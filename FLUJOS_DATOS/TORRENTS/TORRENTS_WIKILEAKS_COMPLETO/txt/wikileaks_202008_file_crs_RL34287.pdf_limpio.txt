divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34287offender reentry correctional statistics reintegration into the community and recidivism summary the prison population in the united states has been growing steadily for more over 30 years the bureau of justice statistics reports that each year more than 650000 offenders are released into the co mmunity and almost 5 million exoffenders are under some form of communitybased supervision offender reentry can include all the activities and progra mming conducted to prepare ex convicts to return safely to the community and to live as lawabiding citizens some exoffenders however eventually end up back in prison the mo st recent nationalle vel recidivism study is 10 years old this study showed that twothirds of exoffenders released in 1994 came back into contact with the criminal ju stice system within three years of their release compared with the average american exoffenders are less educated less likely to be gainfully employed and more likely to have history of mental illness or substance abuse all of which ve been shown to be risk factors three phases are associated with offender reentry programs programs that take place during incarceration which aim to prepar offenders for thei r eventual release programs that take place during offenders release period which s eek to connect ex offenders with the various services they may require and longterm programs that take place as exoffenders permanently re integrate into their communities which attempt to provide offenders with support and supervision there is wide array of offender reentry program designs and th programs can differ significantly in range scope and methodology research ers in the offender reentry field have suggested that the best programs begi n during incarceration and extend throughout the release and reintegration process despite the relative lack of research in the field of offender reentry an emerging what works literature has shown that programs focusing on work training and placement drug and mental health treatment and housing assistance have pr oven to be effective the federal governments involvement in offender r eentry programs typically occurs through grant funding which is av ailable through wide array of federal programs at the departments of justice labor education and health and human services however only handful of gran t programs in the federal government are designed explicitly for offender reentry purposes the 110th congress is considering number of bills that include some form of offender reentry program within their purview the second chance act pl 110 199 was enacted on april 9 2008 the act expands the current offender reentry grant program at the department of justice and creates wide array of

that twothirds of all released prisoners will commit new offenses recidivate within three years of their release2 many studies have indicated that reentry initiatives that combine work tr aining and placement with counseling and housing assistance can re duce recidivism rates3 according to the bjs the average per prisoner cost of incarceration in st ate prison in 2001 was 62 per day or 22650 per year costs for those incarcerated in federal prison was similar overall the states spent 38 billion on their correctional systems in 2001 the most recent year for which data are available4 offender reentry includes all the activities and prog ramming conducted to prepare exconvicts to return safely to the community and to live as lawabiding citizens reentry programs are typically divided into three phases programs that prepare offenders to reenter society while they are in prison programs that connect exoffenders with services immediately af ter they are released from prison and programs that provide longterm support and supervision for exoffenders as they settle into communities permanently offender reentry programs vary widely in range scope and methodology the bestdesigned programs according to the research in the field are those that span all three phases5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34287crs2 6 us government accountability office prisoner release trends and information on

to prison terms lasting less than one year misdemeanors and convicted felons in continueda government accountability office gao report also suggests that post release planning should begin as early as possible ideally as soon as an inmate is admitted in to prison or even immediately after sentencing such planning could include helping the offender to develop the skills and knowledge base necessary to find wellpaying job and have access to education such as general equivalency degree classes for those who have not comp leted high school nd either vocational training or college classes for those that have completed high school but have not settled on career6 as offenders approach their release date the research suggests that reentry planning focus on connecting offenders with the community and workplace resources they will need to get established agai n employment and access to education has been cited by many studies as two of the most important aspects contributing to the successful reintegration of exoffenders into society7 lastly it is important for the reentry process to extend deep into the offenders reintegration into society indeed for many offenders the first few weeks of adjustment after release are actually less difficult than the longer period of community reintegration8 in many cases this period of time can span the entire three to five years that offenders are sometimes supervised in the community9 correctional system statistics to understand the issue of offender reen try one must first understand the ways in which exoffenders are released into the community it is also worthwhile to analyze the population of individuals serv ing sentences in co rrectional facilities because the number of offenders reentering the community is necessarily related to the number of offenders serving prison sent ences this section analyzes national data on the nations correctional system population in correctional facilities the correctional system includes two main forms of detention jails and prisons jails also known as local lockups are fac ilities generally used to temporarily detain individuals who have been arrested or charged with crime but not usually convicted10 the jail population is thus extrem ely fluid with individuals usuallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34287crs3 10 continued jurisdictions where the prisons are overpopulated 11 from crs

of people imprisoned in the united states increased by roughly 3 each year compared with the overall population growth of roughly 1 each year according to the united kingdoms home office it appears that the united states incarcerates more of its citizens than any other nation in the world at 701 per 100000 of its population in 2002 more than 60 of countries in the british survey including most european countries imprisoned less than 150 per 10000015 figure 1 shows the annual population in state and federal correcti onal facilities in 1995 and 20002005httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34287crs4 source crs analysis of bureau of justice statistics data given the fact that 95 of all inmates will eventually return to the community the prison population has direct impact on offender reentry as the prison population grows increasing numbers of exoffenders are being released from correctional facilities most of these ex offenders are required to undergo some form of community supervision as part of their re lease the following section explores the mechanisms and statistics surrounding the re lease of prisoners into the community exoffenders under community supervision exoffenders can be released into the community through variety of different mechanisms some offenders never serve prison sentences and instead serve their sentence on probation in their communities unde r supervision others serve most of their sentences in correctional facilities but are then released on parole to finish their sentences in their communities under superv ision lastly some offenders serve out their entire sentences in correctional f acilities and are released unconditionally into the community probation individuals who are found guilty of committing crime that is deemed not serious enough for imprisonm ent can be sentenced to serve their sentences under community supervision probation offenders on probation typically must adhere to certain conditions and check in regularly with their probation officers violation of these conditions or failure to appear before their probation5000001000000150000020000002500000 prison 1078542 1316333 1330007 1367547 1390279 1421911 1446269 jail

some states have parole system in place congress abolished parole at the federal level effective in 1986 however there is sm all percentage of federal offenders who were sentenced prior to 1986 who

guidelines please refer to crs report rl32766 federal sentencing guidelines background legal analys is and policy options by lisa seghetti and alison smithofficers can lead to further criminal sa nctions including incarceration in some instances offenders can be sentenced to mixed term of prison and probation parole16 individuals who have served most of their sentences in correctional facility are sometimes ligible to complete their sentences in the community under conditional supervision the conditions asso ciated with parole can vary from case to case but typically include drug testing and regular contact with parole officer violations of these conditions can result in the parolee returning to prison to serve out the remaining portion of his or her ntence there are tw different kinds of parole discretiona ry and mandatory discretionary parole states that use parole boards to determine whether prisoner should be released into the comm unity have discretionary parole the parole boards have the authority to conditionally release prisoner into the community based on statutory or an admin istrative determination that the prisoner is eligible mandatory parole states that have statut ory language determining when offenders should be released into th community have mandatory parole jurisdictions that use determinate sentencing17 often include provisions specifying when inmates should be cond itionally released from pris on after serving specified portion of their original sentences figure 2 shows the number offenders being s upervised in the community either through probation or through pa role it is important to note that parolees account for on average 16 of the overall populati on under community supervision the growing state prison population has resulted in concomitant growth in the overall population of offenders under community supe rvision interestingly however the growth rate of individuals under community supervision has been lagging behind the growth rate of individuals in correctional f acilities this is likely due to the fact that growing number of offenders are being released directly into the community without any form of supervision figure 2 shows that the average population of individuals under community supervisi on has increased by 32 from 1995 to 2005 this contrasts with the ove rall prison population shown in figure 1 which grew by 38 during this period from 2000 to 2003 the overall population under supervision increased at relatively steady rate of 25 per year which corresponded with the annual growth in prison population over the same threeyear period however for reasons that are not altogether clear in 2004 and 2005 the growth in the population under community supervision slowed to 06 year this contrasts with the 3 average growth in the prison population over this period see figure 1 this recent disparity in the annual growth rate of the parole and prison populations suggests thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34287crs6 18 yearend populations are calculate d on december 31 of each year 19 the figure does not include federal parole entries and exitsthe disconnect between the

statistics data figure 3 breaks out the annual state parole entries and the yearend18 state parole population each year from 1980 through 200519 the data show that the growth rate in the states parole populati ons has declined over the last 14 years for which data are available from 1980 through 1992 the yearend parole population more than tripled to 618689 from 1992 through 2005 however the population of exoffenders on parole has increased by only 12 to 693197 an average increase of about 09 each year in addition from 2000 to 2005 the number of entries into the parole population has slightly exceeded the number of exits from parole each year although both entries and exits to pa role have been increasing by about 17 annually this could suggest that offe nders are remaining on parole for longer periods of time or that the parole populat ion is growing relative to the number of people being released from prison100000020000003000000400000050000006000000 parole 679421 723898

justice statistics data the relationship between the prison and parole populations is an important one for number of reasons offenders serving their sentences in prison have committed more serious crimes than offenders who rve their sentences in jail or on probation as previously noted the prison population typically includes individuals sentenced to more than year of time parolees meanwhile often return to the community after prolonged period of incarceration and usually face period of adjustment figure 4 shows the relationship between annual changes in the state prison population and the parole population figure 4 shows differentiation between the period from 1981 to 1992 when the annual increase in the state parole population generally outstripped the annual increase in the prison population and the period from 1993 to 2005 when the obverse has largely been true this is interesting for number of reasons the population of offe nders on parole is by definition subset of the population of offenders in prison to get parole one has to pass through the prison system the fact that the population in prison has been increasing at faster rate than the population in parole over the past 13 years suggests that fewer prisoners are being released before the end of th eir sentences this corresponds with the sentencing reform efforts implemented by many states in the 1980s and early 1990s and the growing use of truthinsentencing laws by states truthinsentencing laws require that offenders serve substantial portion of their sentences usually three quarters thereby reducing discrepancies between the sentence imposed and the actual time served in prison20 the discrepancy between the annual growth of the parole and prison populations in the 1990s is also result of the fact that prison sentences have been becoming longer because of the enactment by most states of mandatory minimum sentencing laws take n together these factors could suggest that the parole population may begin to grow faster than the prison population in100000200000300000400000500000600000700000800000 1980 1981198219831984 1985198619871988 1989 19901991199219931994199519961997

that have been issued over the past two decades come closer to being completed source crs analysis of bureau of justice statistics data the data analyzed thus far have exa mined the relationship between the prison population and the population under community supervision revealing that the population of offenders under some form of community supervision accounts for roughly 70 of the overall popula tion of offenders only 30 of offenders are in jail or prison leaving about 5 million offende rs annually in the community under probation or parole as seen here the number of offenders under community supervision has been increasing steadily for decades but has not grown quite as fast as the incarcerated population many of these individuals will end up recidivating and entering the penal system again either during their periods of supervision or once their sentences have been completed42024681012141618 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005percent yearly

justice statistics figure note other conditional releases include provisional releases supervised work furloughs releases to home arrest or boot camp programs conditional par dons conditional medical releases or unspecified releases figure 5 below shows the types of releases from state prisons from 1980 to 2005 it shows the kinds of reentries that have been occurring historically and reveals that the vast majority of prisoners are released into some form of community supervision the figure also reflects the struct ural change in state systems from the use of discretionary parole eg parole boards toward manda tory parole eg statutorily mandated parole ove r the past 25 years the number of individuals being released into probation has been increasin g over the past 25 years from about 4 in 1980 to 10 in 2005 but neve rtheless remains relativel small in addition figure 5 shows that the number of individuals being released directly into the community as their sentences expire has been in creasing from roughly 11 in 1991 to an average of 20 over the past five years this means that roughly 20 of all offenders are being released into the comm unity without any form of supervision or structured reentry and could account for th lower growth rate in the population of exoffenders being supervised in the community compared with the growth rate of the prison population the figures presented above paint pict ure of correctional system that has been expanding in terms of population for over two decades in turn the number of individuals being released from prison in to the community has been expanding as well figure 5 demonstrates some of the structural changes that have occurred in the reentry process over the past two and half decades namely the increasing use of mandatory parole and the decreasing use of discretionary parole as result of the sentencing reforms that have occurred at the state level figure 5 also shows that the percentage of prisoners being released in to the community with form of direct supervision has been increasing until recently averaging 20 of all releases over the past five years despite slight downtur n over the past three years this trend has clear implications for offender reentry give n that exoffenders re leased without any form of supervision may have difficulty c onnecting to the services and programs that exist in their communities and may be more prone to recidivating0102030405060 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 19941996 1998 2000 20022004 mandatory parole discretionary parole expiration of sentence

statistics recidivism of prisoners released in 1994 report ncj193427 june 2002 continuedrecidivism recidivism is often define d as the rearrest reconvi ction or reincarceration of an exoffender within given time frame as result of this broad definition of recidivism most studies incl ude technical violations of an offenders parole or probation such as failing drug test or not showing up for meeting for example within their general recidivism statistics rearrest statistics also include individuals who are found innocent of the charges for these reasons some studies have focused on reincarceration with new prison sentence as more accurate recidivism statistic arguing that technical violations are really an extension of an offenders original prison term and not newly committed crime essentially there are two competing philosophies about what recidivism should mean21 on the one hand are those who argue that any new contact with the criminal justice system matter how minor should be considered recidivism on the part of an exoffender22 on the other hand are those who argue that recidivism should be more narrowly defined as the commission of new crime resulting in new sentence by an exoffender23 what one includes in the definition of recidivi sm has substantial impact on the rate of recidivism reported regardless of what definition is used r ecidivism is difficu lt subject to study tracking recidivism involves following the cas of individuals for number of years and relying on state or national level data ts that contain inherent inaccuracies for example if an offender is released in california but commits new crime in maine the researchers must be able to match those two records together to make definitive statement about recidivism this match is typically done by consulting the fbis master database of c onvictions however as we will see later this da tabase contains omissions that may affect the results of r ecidivism studies number of studies have been conducted on this issue and most st ates have calculated their own recidivism rates however there is dearth of cu rrent nationallevel sta tistics on recidivism by exoffenders the two main national level studies that have been conducted over the last 15 years are outlined below bureau of justice statistics 1994 recidivism study t h m s t comprehensive national level recidivism study to da was

to prison for new crime they had committed 254 or because they had violated some technical provision of their release 26426 the bjs study therefore showed that more than half of exoffenders who return to prison do so because of technical violations of their parole or probation rather than the commission of new crime it is important to note that the bjs study did not include information on what percentage of ex offenders were serving time in local jails however as previously noted local jails feature fluid population of inmates who usually reside there for brief period of time and may not be convi cted of the crime they are being held forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34287crs12 27 united states sentencing commission comparison of the federal sentencing guidelines criminal history category and

sentencing guidelines work two examples by charles doyle figure 7 summarizes the usscs findings generally the study showed that an offenders criminal history was strongly associated with the likelihood of the offender recidivating after be ing released the more prior convictions or the more serious the nature of the offenders crimes the more likely the offender was to recidivate the study also showed that th definition of recidi vism had large impact on the resulting statistics for example for the most hardened exoffenders general recidivism which includes any contact with the criminal justice system was at 55 after two years over this same period the reconviction rate for the most hardened exoffenders was only 15 this discrepanc shows that the definition of recidivism is important even for the most hardened exoffenders the reconviction rate was relatively low compared with the general recidivism source crs presentation of united states sentencing commission data national recidivism study limitations the rearrest reconvition and resentencing data used in both the ussc and the bjs study come from official records maintained by the states and the federal bureau of investigations fbi official criminal history repositories these repositories understate the actual recidivism levels to some unknown extent because they rely on local police agencies and courts to supply them with notifying documents these documents are not always filed by local poli ce departments or courts how ever in addition if the offender provided different name or fraudulent identity document to police and this misinformation was not discovered th ey would likely not be captured by the data lastly even if the criminal is correctly identified and the document is sent to the repository the repository may not be able to match the person identified in the document with their records this could ccur for example if the document that has been submitted is filled out incorrectly or is illegible moreover as previously noted there is some debate about what kind of outcome measure should be included when measuring recidivism should recidivism statistics22

opposed to prison 31 questioning the evidence p 7include any contact with the criminal justi ce system by an exoffender or should recidivism statistics be limited to the commission of crimes by exoffenders that result in new convictions or new senten ces both the bjs and the ussc studies showed wide differentials between gene ral recidivism which includes any contact with the criminal justice system and rec onviction rates for new crimes the length of the followup period will also play role in the recidivism statistics that are generated because of the costs and difficu lties associated with studying recidivism most studies follow exoffenders for two or three years there is dearth of information concerning what happens to exoffenders beyond the threeyear window that is typically studied for all of these reasons caution shoul d be taken when attempting to draw conclusions about the efficacy of polic measures based solely on recidivism statistics when using recidivism statistics to evaluate program it is important to understand exactly what is included in the definition of recidi vism for example consider the following hypothetical scen ario program is evaluated and shows significant decreases in the number of exo ffenders that are convicted of new crimes and sentenced to new prison terms however the number of exoffenders arrested for violating their parole actually increased was this program successful or not did it make society safer or not this may well be an unlikely scenario but it calls attention to the fact that recidivism may mean different things to different people while recidivism statistics remain the best information available concerning whether exoffenders come into contact with the criminal justice system after being released from prison and what the nature of that c ontact is they are but one factor to be considered when evaluating the efficacy of program because of the concerns outlined above importance of consideri ng other outcome measures while recidivism has traditionally been the most widely used metric used to determine the effectiveness of correctional and reentry pr ograms it is important to note here that other outcome measures can help determin whether an offenders reintegration into society is succeeding measures of attachment to social institutions such as employment involvement in community ac tivities churchgoing and participation in support groups can be important bellwethe rs of an offenders transition to the community29 for example one study of drug court30 participants showed that drug courts reduce drug use among their particip ants and that children born to drug court participants are less likely to be born addicted to drugs31 given the high societal costs associated with substancedependent infants for that particular program recidivism was arguably not the most im portant outcome measure that could have been considered to give policy makers better idea of what happens to ex offenders program evaluations are best focused on the entire universe of activities that exoffenders engage inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34287crs15 32 richard p seiter and karen r kadela pri soner

brief literature review virtually all prisoners currently being detained in secure facilities will someday be released into the community and more offenders are transitioning into the community today than ever before offender reentry is complex issue that touches on wide range of social and governme ntal networks and programs offender reentry policies can vary significantly from state to state and from community to community within particular states th policies affecting pr isoners and the kinds of programs available to them both in and out of prison depend on variety of factors including the availability of funding for social programs within states and communities and the number of private nonprofit and religi ous organizations operating in given community the fe deral government plays supporting role through the numerous grant funding opport unities discussed below complicating factors affecting how offender reentry works in given community can include the varying types of sentences handed down the different kinds of release mechanisms available to judges the types of programs provided in prisons by correctional systems the intensity of supervision provi ded or required by the parole or releasing agency the family and community suppor t available to the offender the kinds of social services available in the offenders community and the status of the local economy and the offenders ab ility to obtain employment32 offender reentry defined before we can discuss offender reentr programs however we must understand what constitutes offender reentry some observers note that offender reentry is the natural byproduct of incarcera tion because all prisoners w ho are not sentenced to life in prison and who do not die in prison w ill reenter the community at some point according to this school of thought reentr is not program or some kind of legal status but rather process that almost all offenders will undergo33 variant on this approach to reentry is the concept that offender reentry simply defined includes all activities and programmin g conducted to prepare exconvict s to return safely to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34287crs16 34 questioning the evidence p

crime what works w hat doesnt whats promising national institute of justice 1997 38 offender reentry what workscommunity and to live as law abiding citizens34 the basic idea here is that every activity and process that prisoner undergoe s while in the judicial and correctional systems will have some nexus with their reentry into the community although this broad definition of reentr certainly encompa sses all the activities that may impinge on or affect prisone rs reentry into society it may be cumbersome one for the purposes of craf ting and evaluating government policies for example it is difficult if not impossible to measure the outcome of reentry program if one includes in the definition of reentry every activity that prisoner undergoes during his time in the criminal jus tice system this has led many in the field to focus on more narrow and thus more manageable definition of reentry this more narrow definition is often stated in tw parts correctional programs that focus on the transition to the community such as prerelease work re lease halfway houses or other programs specifically aiming at reentry and programs that have initiated some form of treatment such as substance abuse life skills educati on or mental health in prison that is linked to community programs that will continue the treatment once the prisoner has been released35 narrowing the definition of reentry thusly allows policy makers to focus on programs that expressly aim to manage the transition from detention to the community program effectiveness the what works literature compared with other social science fields there has been relative lack of rigorously designed studies on the issue of offender reentry nevertheless in recent years there has been increasing attenti on on this issue and number of new studies have been published this has allowed academics to undertake some of the first broad metaanalyses36 of offender reentry studies so of these studies have hewn closely to the what works paradigm creat ed by university of maryland researchers for national institute of justice report to congress37 this concept was adapted to the field of offender reentry in 2003 st louis university study38 the what works literature attempts to identify programs that are effective by creating scoring system to evaluate studies based on whethe r they can be proven to have an impact inherent to this approach is the need to identify program evaluations that provide evidence concerning the effect the program had on certain outcome measures the what works paradigm essentially focu ses on whether studies have accomplished the following thingshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34287crs17 39 offender reentry what works pp 370373 40 see for example shawn bushway and pe ter

been the underlying cause of any observed connection between the program being studied and the outcome measures being analyzed determined whether there are measurement errors resulting from problems with the study including such things as participants being lost over time or low response ra tes to interview requests and calculated the statistical power of the analysis to detect the programs effects on outcome measur included in this category are things such as sample size and the base rate of crime in the community39 the what works model uses these core cr iteria to place studies into five distinct categories with category 5 being the most sc ientifically rigorous and thus considered most effective studies the model then uses this criteria to identify programs that based on the evidence considered have b een proven to work programs that are promising and programs that do not work following is brief discussion of the types of offender reentry programs that have been found to be effective in the w hat works literature as well as in other studies it is important to note here that just because program has been proven to work in one location or for certain popul ation does not necessarily mean that it can be just as effective in other locations or among other populations number of factors can impinge on programs effectiv eness in any given location for example while knowing that program has worked in the past can provide model or blueprint to guide policy practitioners in other locations how program is implemented is just as important to its ultimate success as the underlying model that it is based on the most effective model program can be compromised if it is not implemented properly in addition geogra phic demographic and other differences between locations can affect whether program that succeeded in one place succeeds in another nevertheless know ing that program has worked in the past is of use to policy makers as they consider where to allocate funding and other resources employment there are number of studies that demonstrate that employment is fundamental component of the reentry process and that ex offenders who are able to find stable employment are much more likely to succeed in their rehabilitation than those who cannot find work40 several vocational and work programs were found to effectivel reduce recidivism and improve the job readiness of exoffenders by the what works review41httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34287crs18 42 prisoner reentry what works p 374 43 prisoner reentry what works p 378 st udys statistical

in prison combined and integrat ed with aftercare programs have been shown to be effective in reducing reci divism and substance abuse among their participants especially for offenders with serious crime and substance abuse histories42 halfway house programs number of programs that provide transitional housing for exoffenders as they begin thei r transition into the community have been found to be effective offe nders participating in halfway house programs were found to commit fewer and less severe offenses than those who did not participate participants also performed better on range of other outcome measures such as finding and holding job being selfs upporting and partic ipating in self improvement programs however these results were not statistically significant43 other kinds of programs the what works revi ew concluded that other programs were either not effective or had not been studied enough for firm conclusions to be drawn education programs for example were found to raise educational achievement scores but not to reduce reci divism prerelease programs and programs focusing on violent offenders and sex offenders showed some evidence that they were effective in reducing reci divism but few of these kinds of studies made it through the selection process this precluded any firm conclusions from being drawn about these kinds of progra ms and pointed to the need for more evaluations44 limitations with the what works literature one of the main limitations associated with the what works literature is the dearth of studies that meet its rigorous requirement s for example the offender reentry study cited above was only able to identify 32 studies that met their selection criteria only 19 of these program evaluations contained comparis on or control group and of these only two were randomized control trials45 this has led some to question whether the programs identified to work by this literature review are in fact effective46 moreover most of the

exoffenders into their communities lastly evaluations that incorporate ra ndom assignment and provide statistically rigorous results are by and large expensiv this means that policy makers are often confronted with hard decisions concerni ng whether to fund additional services or evaluations of existing programs conclusions after reviewing the available literature some patterns appear to emerge many of the programs that ve been proven to be effective share some of the same attributes regardless of wh ether they focus on vocational training substance abuse prevention mental health services or alternative housing the attributes shared by most of th programs include the following they start during institutional placement but take place mostly in the community they are intensive in nature lasting typically at least six months they focus services on individuals determined to be at highrisk of recidivating through the use of ri skassessment classifications and if they are treatment programs they use cognitivebehavioral treatment techniques ma tching particular th erapists and programs to the specific learning characteristics of the offenders47 current law the federal governments

s 1060 includes 21 more specific purpose areas despite this difference the grant program in both bills would fund the same kinds of activities legislation in the 110th congress number of bills introduced in the 110th congress touch on the issue of offender reentry the only comprehensive offender reentry bills to have seen action thus far in the 110th congress are hr 1593 and s 1060 commonly known as the second chance act hr 1593 was repor ted out of the house committee on the judiciary on may 9 2007 and wa s passed under motion to suspend the rules by the house on november 13 2007 by vote of 347 to 62 s 1060 was ordered to be reported out of the sena committee on the judiciary on august 2 2007 but was never actually reported75 instead the senate reporte d hr 1593 out of the senate committee on the judiciary by unanimous consent on march 11 2008 hr 1593 was passed by the senate by unanimous c onsent on the same day the president signed the second chance act pl 110199 into law on april 9 2008 the following section provides an overview of the bills touching on the issue of offender reentry in the 110th congress for sectionbysecti on analysis of the second chance act please refer to appendix the second chance act bill called the second chance act has been introduced in each congress since 2000 while these bills have differe d from congress to congress they would all have reformed the offender reentry process in the 110th congress four separate bills have been introduced that include similar language two of them hr 1593 and s 1060 have seen action of some so rt as previously noted hr 1593 was enacted as pl 110199 on april 9 2008 the other two are s 2237 broader crime control bill that includes section called the enhanced sec ond chance act and hr 623 following is brief discussion of each of these bills pl 110199 expands the current offender reentry grant program at doj replacing the four purpose areas currently eligible for funding with new purpose areas spanning every phase of th offender reentry process76 applicants for these grants would be subjected to number of requirements including submitting reentry strategic plan with their application desc ribing the longterm strategy and providing detailed implementation sche dule among other things the act requires that states and localities match 50 of the federal funds provided up to half of this state match or 25 of the overall total funding can be composed of inkind contributions the act also directs the bureau of prisons bop to modify various components of its offender reentry planning process for fe deral exoffenders establishes prisoner reentry program at bop and endow s the agency with new authorities the act also creates some new dem onstration grant programs includinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34287crs28 grants for state and local reentry courts grants for drug treatme nt diversion programs grants to expand substanceabuse programs for prisoners and ex offenders and grants to expand the use of career training programs and mentoring programs while the act authorizes number of new pilot programs and expands the current offender reentry grant program at doj it is important to note here that all of these authorizations ar subject to the availability of appropriations if funding is not appropriated for these programs in fy2009 they will probably not go into effect s 1060 includes language that is rgely similar to that found pl 110199 however s 1060 included some grant progra ms that were not included in the act such as grants to study the use of drug treatment to reduce illegal drug demand and grants to ensure the availability of pharmacological drug treatment services in prison s 2237 the crime control and prev ention act of 2007 includes section iii the enhanced second chance act of 2007 in number of respects section iii of s 2237 is similar to hr 1593 and s 1060 s 2237 would replace the current offender reentry grant programs four purpose areas with 27 new purpose areas spanning every phase of the reentry process these purpose areas and the requirements to be eligible for funding are broadly similar to thos found in hr 1593 and s 1060 s 2237 would also direct the bureau of prisons bop to establish prerelease planning procedures for exoffenders but unlike hr 1593 and s 1060 the bill does not create new offender reentry program fo r federal prisoners or provide new authorities to bop s 2237 would create three new grant programs grants to study the effects of revoking an exoffenders parole grants to community based organi zations to provide mentoring and other transitional services to exoffenders and grants to establish group homes fo r recovering substance abusers of these three new grant programs only the group home grant program differs from those that would be established by hr 1593 and s 1 060 however number of grant programs that are included in hr 1593 and s 1060 are not in s 2237 in addition s 990 and hr 1692 the fighting gangs and empowering youth act of 2007 include language s imilar to that f ound in hr 1593 s 1060 and s 2237 that would expand the current offende r reentry grant program for exoffenders and establish national adult and juve nile offender reentry resource center hr 623 the second chance for exoffenders act of 2007 has been introduced in each congress since the 106th congress the bill would allow non violent offenders defined as offenders w ho did not use weapons or violence in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34287crs29 course of committing their crimes to petition to

c oncerning the offense only in certain cases including criminal investigations gun applications and government employment applications exp unged records would be restored if the individual was convicted for new crime other offender reentryrelated legislation s 456 the gang abatement and preventi on act was passed by the senate on september 21 2007 the bill includes provision 302 that would establish gang prevention grant program administered by the office of justice programs at doj among other purposes this grant could be used to fund rein tegration strategies for the reentry of gangmembers into the community the bill would also create national gang research evaluation and policy ins titute that would be charged among other things with facilitating the implementation of datadriven reentry programs for gangoffenders similar offender reentryrelated language exists in hr 3547 the gang prevention in tervention and suppression act hr 3467 the second chance for america s veterans act would direct the secretary for veterans affairs to create workforce offender reentry grant program for incarcerated veterans the program woul d be established in at least 24 locations equitably distributed across the united states and at least one of these locations would be in penal institution administered by the bureau of prisons the program would include referral and couns eling services in order to assist incarcerated veterans with job training and placement housing health care and other benefits grant funding for these purposes would be made available to state agencies nonprofit organizations and state and local workforce investment boards and each program funded by this grant would be directed to provide deta iled outcomes report including recidivism data to the secretary of veterans affairs the bill would authorize appropriations of 15 milli on each year from fy2008 through fy2011 hr 3409 the place to call home act would create youth offender reentry grant program under this program th attorney general would be directed to create program that would identify incarcer ated young adults who would be eligible for release prior to their 25th birthday

the pre and postre lease stages to connect offenders with employment housing mentors and postsec ondary education to be eligible for funding states would be required to submit plan describing how they plan to meet the programs goals how funding would be used for both pre and postrelease planning and services and how funding w ould be distributed am ong diverse range of qualified nonprofit nd private organizations states would also be required to make series of certifications including among other things that not more than 30httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34287crs30 of the funds allotted to the state would be used for postreleas room and board for eligible exoffenders and that public and private organiza tions have been consulted in developing the plan and given at least 30 days to submit comments on the plan funding would be distributed to states ba sed in part on the ratio of the number of individuals in that state between the ages of 13 and 25 compared with the national average states would be required to collaborate with doj in establishing evaluation procedures and datadriven outcome meas ures 15 of the overall funding for this program would be used by the ag to fund ev aluations of the state programs the bill would authorize 200 million for this program s 1907 and hr 3187 the meth mout h correctional costs and reentry support acts would establish grant progra m to fund programs that would identify eliminate and report on the degree to whic h poor dental health undermines an ex offenders transition to the community f unding could be used among other things to provide dental treatment programs at correctional facilities promoting oral hygiene among inmates and assessing the oral condition of inmates at their release s 1907 would authorize annual appropr iations of 100 thousand each year from fy2009 through fy2011 hr 3187 would authorize 5 million each year over the same time period current legislative issues there are number of oversight issues relating to the administration of federal offender reentry grant funding that may be of concern to congress following is brief discussion of selected issues in cluding the adequacy of the federal governments existing offender reentry gr ant programs the lack of coordination between different federal agencies concerning offender reentry and the lack of current recidivism sta tistics for exoffenders adequacy of existing offender reentry programs this report has demonstrated the bread th of funding opportunities available in the federal government for offender reen try purposes as previously discussed funding that can be used to support offe nder reentry programs exists in grant programs administered by the departments of justice labor education housing and urban development and hea lth and human services am ong the number of federal grant programs that include purpose areas th at can be used to fund offender reentry handful of programs government wide were identified that are specifically tailored to offenders for reentry purposes the prisoner reentry initiative at the departments of justice and labor the grants to stat for workplace and community transition training for incarcerated youth offenders and the lifeskills for state and local inmates program within th department of educati on and the young offender reentry program within the department health and human services the comparative lack of targeted offende r reentry grant funding may be of issue for congress because of the apparent need for wide range of services for offenders both pre and postrelease according to report of the reentry policy council although approximately three of every four people released from incarcerationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34287crs31 77 council of state governments reentry policy council report of the reentry policy council charting the safe and successful return of prisoners to the community january 2005 p 3 78 from telephone conversation with th bureau of justice august 8 2007have history of substance abuse only 10 percent in state prison and three percent in local jails receive formal treatment prior to release just onethird 35 percent of those released from prison participated in educational programs while incarcerated even fewer 27 percent took part in vocational training77 potential issue for congress may include whether the current grant programs within the federal government can adequately support state and local correctional systems as they confront the wide array of services that exoffenders require to successfully transition back to the community if federal progra ms are seen as adequate then action by congress may be necessary otherwise po licy options could include expanding the purpose areas of existing grant programs that are being funded eith er to broaden the types of offender reentry programs that c ould be funded or to add such programs to grant programs that do not currently in clude offender reentry among their purpose areas another policy option could include creating new grant programs specifically tailored to specific kinds of offender reen try programs such as housing assistance drug treatment or job traini ng programs among others lack of current federal recidivism statistics as previously noted the only nationalleve l recidivism statistics concerning the reentry of prisoners into the community are more than decade old these studies showed that over twothirds of exoffenders had come into contact with the legal system either through new rrest violation of the terms of their release or new conviction within three years of their release however there are current nationallevel recidivism statistics and the bureau of justice statistics does not currently have plans to update their recidi vism study because of funding constraints78 while number of states ve conducted studies of thei r prisoners recidivism the lack of nationallevel statistics poses challenge for policy makers as they consider the issue of offender reentry without cu rrent nationallevel an alysis of which ex offenders are more likely to recidivate it is difficult to target funding to offender reentry programs that address the atrisk population indeed much of the offender reentry literature being publis hed today continues to cite the bureau of justice statistics study from the mid1990s when refe rring to recidivism potential issue of interest for congress may include whet her new national vel recidivism study is needed to better understand the current tr ends in recidivism and to better target federal funding to the exoffenders that are most likely to reoffend policy options could include providing funding to the bur eau of justice assistance to update their 1994 study or to undertake new study or funding an educational institution or non profit entity to undertake nati onallevel recidivism study focus on recidivism while few would argue that recidivism is the most important measure of an offender reentry programs impact there is growing consensus within the offenderhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34287crs32 79 see for example jeremy travis in thin king about what works what works best margaret mead address at the national conference of the international community corrections association held in indian apolis indiana on november 10 2003 urban institute justice policy center james lynch prisoner reentry beyond program evaluation criminology public policy vol 5 2 may 2006 and questioning the evidence 80 learn about reentry reentry field that other outcome measures need to be considered when determining whether program has been effective79 many practitioners believe that an individuals reintegration into the comm unity should be measured by number of indicators concerning their attachment to social networks and not just by whether they come into contact with the criminal justice system again possible measures of reintegration can include whether an ex offender has found and maintained job whether the exoffender has reconnected with his family and if he has children whether he is supporting them whether th exoffender has become involved in his community through particip ation in church events neighborhood organizations and support groups and whether the exoffender has attained sobriety or is participating in treatment program potential issu for congress could include whether these alternate measures of an offender reentry programs effectiveness in fostering reintegration within the community should be considered when deciding how best to allocate grant funding and other government resources related issue could be whether reporting on these alternate out come measures should be required of programs receiving federal grant funding coordination between federal agencies there are number of entities that bring together offender reentry professionals from state and local governments nonprofit organizations and academic institutions including the reentry polic council founded by the council of state governments and the reentr roundtable hosted by the urban institute both of these organizations attempt to bolster info rmation sharing about bestpractices and funding opportunities and coor dination between the various state and local agencies and stakeholders within the offender reentry field however the extent to which the various federal agencies with grant progra ms that can be used for offender reentry purposes coordinate their fforts is currently unclear while the serious and violent offender reentry initiative as previously noted reportedly brought together stakeholders from the departments of justice labor education and health and human services that pilot program ended in fy2005 and is currently being evaluated over the last two years doj notes that it has coordinated the prisoner reentry initia tive with the department of labor80 despite the collaborations noted above it is unclear to what extent these various departments have been coordinating the reentry funding available through their various other grant programs this raises potential issue concerning the extent to which duplication of resources is currently occurring across the federal government number of the grant programs identified bove share purpose areas or can be used to fund similar activities this could create certain m easure of confusion among state and local entities applying for offender reentry grant funding there is currently federalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34287crs33 entity currently legislatively charged with coordinating federal offender reentry programs and services across the federal government potential issue for congress could include whether some form of coor dinating council or fede ral offender reentry clearinghouse should be created to provide supervision and oversight to the federal governments offender reentry efforts evaluations of offender reentry programs as previously noted there is comparative lack of scientifically rigorous evaluations of offender reentry programs the what works literature review cited earlier was able to identify only 32 evalua tions undertaken over 30year span that met their selection criteria of these only 2 were randomized control trials the lack of rigorous evaluations of offender reen try programs makes it difficult for policy makers at every level of government to make informed decisi ons concerning what programs to fund and what initiatives to s upport this may be of issue to congress during both the appropriations and aut horization processes during the appropriations process congress faces deci sions about what kinds of grant programs should be funded that are likely to be co mplicated by the lack of available data concerning what kinds of programs are eff ective during the authorization process as congress considers whether to modify existing grant programs or create new grant programs the lack of evidence makes ensuring that effective programs are being created more challenging potential issues for congress to consider could thus include whether more evaluations should be funded through the federal grant process and whether scientific ev aluations should be require d of existing programs appropriations for the second chance act the second chance act expanded dojs current offender reentry grant program and authorized number of targeted pilot programs however because the act was enacted in april of 2008 these programs were enacted too late to be included in the presidents budget request for fy2009 indee d as previously noted the presidents fy2009 request proposes consolidating the doj offender reentry grant program into larger discretionary grant program wh ether funding is to be included in the fy2009 appropriation for the offender reen try programs and activities within doj that were authorized by th second chance act will likely be an issue that congress considers as the fy2009 appropr iations bills are debated conclusion this report has shown that over the past two and half decades the prison population and the number of exoffenders be ing released into the community have been increasing the increasing number of exoffenders entering the community has put pressure on public policy makers to provide treatments and services that will smooth the reintegration process while re ducing recidivism when deciding what programs to fund policy make rs often focus on reducing recidivism the focus on reducing recidivism however is complicated by the fact that there are different definitions of recidivism for example the last major nationallevel study showed that twothirds of exoffenders came into c ontact with the legal system and that abouthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34287crs34 half were back in prison within three years of their release however only quarter of the exoffenders ended up in prison for having committed new crimes another quarter were back in prison for technical vi olations of their release such as failing drug test whether technical viola tions should be considered measure of recidivism or whether reci divism should be confined to the commission of new crimes has engendered much debate within the criminal justice field while the emphasis on reducing recidivism is important programs should also be evaluated based on other out come measures such as their ability to connect ex offenders with jobs services and institutions in their communities the best available research has shown that there are number of services that can help ex offenders reconnect with their communities and lower recidivism including programs focusing on providing vocationa l training substance abuse prevention mental health services and alternative housing the most successful programs focus on highrisk offenders are intensive in nature begin during institutional placement and take place mostly in the community however relative lack of scientifically rigorous research has made it difficult to draw defin itive conclusions about which programs are most effective as congress debates this issue numbe r of policy issues may be considered including whether the current federal grant programs are adequate or whether new programs should be created whether there is need for more current nationallevel recidivism data whether enoug h coordination of the many programs that may be used to help exoffenders is occurring with in the federal government whether more evaluations of offender reentry programs are needed and whether funding will be appropriated for
