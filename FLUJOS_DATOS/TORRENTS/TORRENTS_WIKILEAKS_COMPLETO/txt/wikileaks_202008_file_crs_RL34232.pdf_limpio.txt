possible options to avoid foreclosure lenders may choose from various options such as forebearance rescheduling payments or restructuring the loan which may help dist ressed borrowers become current and continue to stay current in the payments after fo rebearance or loan modification borrower can become delinquent again if borrower circumstan ces will not allow for loan to reperform agreement to preforeclosure sale or deedin lieu of foreclosure may also be viable options to mitigate losses the process data and costs of mortgage foreclosure introduction this report provides an analysis of the process activity and policy issues related to mortgage foreclosures description of the foreclosure process is presented first in traditional banking context and then under securitization when the loan originator longer owns the distresse d mortgage brief discussion is also included concerning what guides the deci sions to foreclose next the various foreclosure data sources are summarized stly some estimates of foreclosure costs are presented the general foreclosure process the foreclosure process is governed by state law and varies widely by state the description of the foreclosure process provided in this report is in general terms first assuming traditional lending framework fo llowed by brief explanation of how the process works when the mortgage has been securitized foreclosure under traditional lending framework foreclosure can begin after borrowe r defaults on the mortgage loan1 default is generally defined as being 90 days or more delinquent although some lenders may use other definitions once in defau lt the lender must decide whether loss mitigation or workout option would suffice or whether to proceed with foreclosure the process of recovering losses by repossessing and selling the property2 financially motivated lender will try to select the option that minimizes losses httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34232crs2 3 if property sells for less than the curre nt mortgage there will be remaining unpaid balance the tax consequences on the unpaid mortgage debt vary according to state law for more information see crs report rl34212 analysis of the tax exclusion for canceled mortgage debt income by mark p keightley and erika lunderdepending upon the state foreclosure process may take from several months to almost two years to complete to ensure valid transfer of title the lender must prove that the borrower is in default and follow various legal procedures prior to the authorization of foreclosure auc tion in states that follow judicial foreclosure process foreclosure petition must be heard and ruled upon by judge who examines all of the evidence in the case in powerofsale states the lender holds deed of trust with clause that allows foreclosure without court action because of the additional legal work foreclosure gene rally takes longer and is more costly to complete in judicial foreclosure states after proper notification re quirements and other lega l procedures have been completed foreclosure auction process begi ns states typically require that the property owner be given advance notice rega rding when the foreclosure auction will take place in addition legal advertisement must ppear in local news media announcing the time and place of the auction legal description of the property and the sale terms and conditions at the auction the auctioneer may begin with reading of the legal advertisement and then set minimum bid the highest bidder at the conclusion of the bidding period assumes title of and responsibility for the property if one purchases the property above the minimum bid the lender receives title the property becomes real estate owned reo term us ed for foreclosed houses that lenders carry until they can be resold by conventional means like any seller the lender may need to incur expe nses for deferred maintenance or outright damage before putting the property on the market lenders may hire the services of realty brokers who are paid commissions to sell reo properties meanwhile the lender still incurs costs such as forgone interest property taxes and any other delinquent liabilities assumed from the previous borrower consequently even if the property were sold at market value the lender may incur losses the stigma of being reo property however may have the eff ect of reducing the list price below current market value furthermore the lender may pay some or all of the closing costs to entice new buyers just as any seller might do in any ordinary real estate transaction once title has been transferred to new owner the tabulation of the lenders total foreclosure costs from borrower default to final property disposition may begin the foreclosure process does not necessa rily end after title of the property is transferred some states provide borrowers with statutory right of redemption which allows the borrower period of time perhaps longer than full year to repurchase the property after th foreclosure auction hen ce the foreclosure sale is not final in these states until the end of the redemption period3 the length of time from initiation to completion of the for eclosure process therefore depends on whether the foreclosure must go to court and whether right of redemption existshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34232crs3 4 for more information on the securitization process see crs report rs22722 securitization and federal regulati on of mortgages for safety and soundness by edward vincent murphythe discussion so far has focused upon single lender foreclosing on single mortgage if the borrower used two loans to acquire the property however then two lenders would be affected suppose bo rrower whose property has been foreclosed obtained primary loan for 80 of the total needed amount and piggyback or secondary loan for the remaining 20 afte r subtraction of lega l and administrative costs the proceeds of the foreclosure or reo sale go to pay off the primary lender first and the lender of the secondary loan gets whatever is left over given that foreclosure costs can be substantial th second lender risks not recouping anything on the unpaid secondary loan balance foreclosure under structured financing framework the term lender has so far been used in the traditional context in which bank that originates mortgage also holds it in portfolio in modern financial markets however originators do not necessarily keep loans in their own portfolios loans originated in the primary market where the home purchaser and the loan originator conduct business are often sold in secondary market where the loan originator and an investor conduct business the process of structured financing in the mortgage market involves the following steps first home buyer goes to an originator which can be financial institution or mortgage broker who approves and issues mortgage loan second the originator sells the loan to securitizer s ecuritizer can be governmentsponsored enterprise gse such as fannie mae or freddie mac or pr ivate securitization trust third the securitizer bundles the i ndividual mortgages together and creates new financial product the mortgageback ed securities mbs finally the securitizer may sell mbs payment streams to investors who become the ultimate lenders investors may be hedge funds pension funds sovereign wealth funds or other financial institutions if the securitizer decides not to sell the securities to third party investors and instead holds them in its own portfolio then the securitizer becomes the investor mbs payment streams which are called tranches have specific risk or return requi rements that meet various i nvestor needs for example securitizer may create seniorjunior tranching structure in which the senior tranche investors receive payment first but their yield is lower than for the junior tranche investors the senior tranche w ould appeal to investors who prefer lower risk investments and the junior tranche w ould appeal to investor s who prefer to take higher risks for the possibility of earning higher yield the seniorjunior tranching structure is only one of the numerous disbursement structures securitizers can use to attract investors this particular tranchin g structure however is used throughout this report for the sake of illustration4 the key difference between the forecl osure process under traditional banking versus structured financing frameworks s to do with the amount of flexibility that the mortgage holder has to make important financial decisions if default occurs suppose the securitizer eith er acts as or appoints servicer who collects mortgagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34232crs4 5 see crs report rl33775 could securitization obstruct voluntary loan modifications and payment freezes by edward vincent murphy 6 the liquidity problem of august 2007 was tri ggered by senior tranche holders reassessing the riskiness of their exposure to fi nancial problems see crs report rl34182 financial crisis the liquidity crunch of august 2007 by darryl getter mark jickling marc labonte and edward vincent murphy payments from borrowers and disburses these to the tranches the investor and servicer negotiate rules that the servicer will follow while acting on the investors behalf if default occurs servicer c ontract provisions along with state law determine 1 whether the servicer can offer loss mitigation solutions and if so of what types and with what limitations 2 when the servicer can initiate foreclosure 3 if the servicer may act as an agent at the foreclosure aucti on and 4 any bidding rules the servicer must follow for example if servicer can initiate foreclosure the rules are likely to state how much can be bi d eg up to certain percentage or the full amount of borrowers unpaid balance at foreclosure auction given that the costs associated with foreclosure will be bor ne by the ultimate investors the rules are designed to minimize those expenses5 any foreclosure costs generated from faulted mortgages in pool of mbs must be subtracted from the proceeds paid to the securitization trust suppose the securitizer is currently using the seniorj unior tranching struct ure described above if the senior tranche gets paid first th the junior tranche will initially suffer the revenue loss the investors in the senior tranche would be adversely affected should the number of foreclosures be greater than expected and associated costs exceed the stream of revenues that would have been paid out to the j unior tranche of course fewer foreclosures can translate into the junior tranche holders being rewarded with higher yield than senior holders which co mpensates them for assuming more default risk6 more on foreclosure incentives lenders may try loss mitigation solution with defaulted borrowers while workout may result in reduc tion of revenues compared with the original mortgage agreement the revenue loss may still be less costly alternative to foreclosure of course if loan falls into default second time after ss mitigation option has been applied the additional fo rgone interest expenses ar also added to the overall foreclosure costs hence loss mitigation may be less costly alternative to foreclosure if it is successful in getting the mortgage loan to perform again for this reason lenders may be cautious and adopt different polic ies regarding the frequency of loss mitigation usage based upon their individual experiences another consideration regarding the d ecision to foreclose is whether the mortgage loan carries mortgage insurance foreclosure costs can be reduced if some or all of the delinquent mortgage loss is covered by private or government mortgage insurance private mortgage insurance pmi is typically required by lenders when the borrower puts down less than 20 of the appraised value of the home pmi pays the lender based on the outsta nding balance of the loan foreclosure costs property maintenance costs taxes and hazard insurance federally insured mortgages whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34232crs5 7 fha typically assumes all of the borrowers fault risk by insuring 100 of the mortgage loan after default the agency pays an in surance claim filed by the lender fha can then decide whether to initiate foreclos ure and dispose of the property 8 see httpwwwocwenbusinesscomdoc

the statutory maximums for eligible borrowers are provided by the federal housing administration fha and the veterans administration va when lenders file insurance claims mortgage providers may either pay just fraction of the loss allowing lenders to retain title or pay the full amount of the mortgage bala nce and take title to the property and then decide whether to proceed with foreclosure consequently lender incurring loss from defaulted mortgage in particular one with private insurance may decide to initiate foreclosure and pass on some of the loss to the mortgage insurance provider7 as stated earlier in this report however the foreclosure decision is usually guided by the contracts negotiated by the lender or investor and the servicer for example the contracts typically specify how servicers will get paid and reimbursed for expenses suppose serv icer collects fees in the form of commission which may be calculated as percentage of the interest or mortgage coupon paid by the borrower under this arrangement payment occurs as long as the mortgage loan is performing so foreclosure would translate into lost income stream there may even be additional financia l penalties associated with the inability to get delinquent loans to reperform some servicing firms have incentive compensation plans that deduct money from employees unable to avoid completing foreclosure8 servicers who acquire reputation for not being able to get sufficient number of loans to re perform may risk being unable to obtain fu ture servicing rights for other types of loans eg for automobiles credit cards etc hence some payment structures provide servicers the incen tive to avoid foreclosure some servicing agreements may not allow servicers to have much discretion for example for mortgages that fannie mae holds in its portfolio servicers must follow guidance on how to proceed with loss mitigation solutions9 the servicer must first get written permission from fannie mae before implementing loss mitigation solution as well as follow guidances on how to implement the solution given that it is subject to various capital requirements accounting and tax rules fannie mae must purchase delinquent mo rtgage from its mbs pool before loss mitigation solution can be applied as result fannie mae monitors and approves all decisions concerning troubled loans in its portfolio similarly fha servicers must follow fha guidelines for troubled ans fha servicers however have more discretion over how to get troubled loans to reperform fha federal mortgage insurance company does not face the capita l requirements and tax consequences of private mortgage securitizer hence fha requires its servicers to participate in the fha loss mitigation program and avoid foreclosure if at all possible10 servicers cannot simply file claim on troubled mo rtgage and convey title of the property to fha without permission from the departme nt of housing and urban developmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34232crs6 11 see crs report rl34386 could securitization obstruct voluntary loan modifications and payment freezes by edward vincent murphy and crs report rl34372

wwwmbaaorghud fha servicers will not be re imbursed unless they show evidence of adherence to fha policies and proce dures regarding troubled loans because of the various contractual arrangements that loan servicers are obligated to follow borrowers cannot necessarily avoid foreclosure by contacting their servicers in some cases present and fu ture compensation for servicers depends on the number of loans they can get to perform which encourages servicers to try solutions to avoid completing foreclosure in other cases servicers may have limited authority and options11 consequently understanding why servicers may or may not complete the foreclosure process requi res an understanding of the servicing contractual agreements or guidelines attached to the various mortgage loans measuring us foreclosures the federal government does not collect mortgage foreclosure data various private data sources are therefore used to measure forecl osure developments different sources employ different appro aches to measuring foreclosures one approach is to look at the number of for eclosures as percentage of mortgages outstanding another approach is to count the number of

lenders to file notice of foreclos ure to begin the process borrower and servicer can nonetheless resolve re payment problem and avoid completing foreclosure some states require lender or servicer to file an initial notice of foreclosure intent followed by another f iling when the foreclosure sale takes place consequently if every filing is counted as new foreclosure then multiple counting will

prime loans and longer paying fha mortgage insurance premiums or they wanted to obtain cashout refinances that exceeded the fha loan limits since house prices were rapidly appreciating hence the rise

for several years 27 the january 2006 to june 2007 time frame would have best coincided with the period that foreclosures began to rise as reported by th nds some of the housing price and sales data however are not seasonally adjusted making it necessary to use the june 2006 to june 2007 period for computing annual ratesmicroeconomic factors that help expl ain foreclosures include unanticipated changes in economic or personal circumstan ces examples of unanticipated changes in personal circumstances in clude divorce sudden changes in health and job loss given abnormal rise in national divorce rates or bilitating medical injuries those reasons do not fully explain the recent ri in foreclosures foreclosures could potentially be attributed to local labor ma rket conditions for example foreclosures in ohio rose when its unemployment rate rose to approximately one percentage point higher than the annual us national une mployment rate 55 compared with 46 in 2006 rising job losses however still cannot entirely account for aggregate developments florida for instance d unemployment rates at or below the us national average during 2006 yet the state still experienced marked rise in foreclosures hence unanticipated change s in personal circumstances do not entirely explain the recent rise in foreclosures regional and more widespread macroeconomic factors that can translate into rise in foreclosures include slowdown in sales activity and th rate of house price appreciation declinin g sales activity increases the difficulty of borrowers with cash flow problems to avoid foreclosure because they cannot quickly sell their homes and reduce expensive mortgage payments falling house prices affects the ability to refinance mortgage and may even courage some borrowers to stop making mortgage payments altogether25 homeowners with substantial equity in their homes arguably have greater incentive to coope rate with the lender and renegotiate an arrangement to avoid foreclosure forecl osures are however more likely to occur when homeowners have little 10 or less equity in their homes if the market value of house falls sufficiently be low the value of the mortgage or if very little or downpayment was used to purchase the hom the borrower may have financial incentive to walk away and not ttempt steps to avoid foreclosure26 according to national us census bu reau data new home prices fell by 411 between june 2006 and june 2007 and new home sales were down by 2218 during the same period according to the national association of realtors median existing home prices fell by 004 during the same period and existing home sales declined by 112527 hence selling home or refinancing mortgage perhaps prior to an interest rate adjustment on an arm loan that would result in substantial increase in the monthly payment appear to be less feasible options in the current market consequently rise in foreclosures woul d not be considered unusual given the

equity or cashout refinance loans from prime market lenders furthermore when home prices began to exceed the maximum fha loan limits in various regions credit impaired borrowers looked for alternative credit sources hence the growth in subprime lending during the late 1990s and early to mid2000s enabled people evaluated as having lesser credit quality to gain access to mortgage credit by 2005 subprime loans accounted for an estimated 20 of all mortgage originations29 the recent housing market slowdown has revealed that subprime borrowers appear to be more susceptible than prime borrowers to changing housing market conditions and perhaps also more susceptible than thos who satisfy current fha requirements for mortgage insurance estimates of foreclosure costs foreclosures are rarely profitable for lenders30 the legal fees lost interest property taxes other delinquent obligations incurred by the former homeowners eg association fees and selling expenses make foreclosures costly to lenders31 although many studies provide dollar valu estimates of foreclosure costs it is difficult to know how cost estimates were obtained without access to proprietary data32 study cited in freddie

net cost of foreclosures to lenders if this figure is net costs then estimated foreclosure costs reflect current market conditi ons at the time the estimates were computed foreclosure costs are likely to be higher during 2006 and 2007 when housing market activity has slowed lenders would be unable to turn over foreclosed properties as quickly and market prices have declined in many areas over this period 35 the joint economic committee estimates that foreclosures on average may cost as much as 80000 this estimate includes costs to homeo wners loan servicers lenders neighbors and local governments see us congress senate joint economic committee sheltering neighborhoods from the subpr ime foreclosure storm special report by the joint economic committee 110th cong 1st sess washington

period foreclosure costs and disposition of the property costs that th lender would be likely to incur the working paper does not state explicitly if these costs were paid by the lender nor whether the 58759 was an average or median amount per foreclosure but it did say the foreclosure process took an average of 18 months to resolve hence this reported dollar amount may be fairly representative of the actual costs incurred only by single lender presumably in 200234 foreclosure costs are farreaching in addition to losing their homes borrowers are likely to find it difficult to obtain credit in the future even at high interest rates lenders suffer the losses associated with acquiring the property from the borrower settling outstanding claims repairing any damages and selling the property local governments may face the problem of vacan t units in neighborhoods and loss of tax revenues foreclosure may reduce the va lue of neighboring homes as result foreclosure is something that parties di rectly and indirectly involved with the property would want to avoid35
