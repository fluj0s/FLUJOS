evaluation us authorities confirmed that the underground explosion was nuclear but that the test produced w yield of less than one kiloton as the united nations security c ouncil met and approve d resolution condemning the tests and calling for punitive sanctions north korea remained defiant insisting that any increased pressure on the regime would be regarded as an act of war china and south korea the top aid providers to and trade partners with the north supported the resolution itself but have been unwilling to cut off other economic cooperation and aid considered crucial to the regime the sanction regime depends heavily on individual states compliance with the guidelines economists argue that the only definitively effective punishment on north korea would be the suspension of energy aid from china which reportedly supplie s about 70 of north koreas fuel determining the motivations of government as opaque and secretive as north korea is exceedingly difficult but analysts have put forth range of possibilities to explain why the pyongyang regime decide d to test nuclear weapon possible motivations include an attempt to engage the united states in bilateral talks to ensure the security of the regime and to satisfy hardline elements within the pyongyang government as well as techni cal motivations for carrying out nuclear test the shortterm implications of north koreas nuclear test are clear whether technical success or failure north koreas willingness to carry out test in the face of significant opposition indicates that it is willing to endure the potential consequences analysts fear that the medium and longterm implications could include more potent nuclear threat from pyongyang nuclear arms race in asia and the transfer of nuclear weapons or material to st ates or groups hos tile to the united states there are also strong concerns about the impact on the global nonproliferation regime partic ularly to other states poised to develop their own nuclear weapon programs the most fundamental us goals of th confrontation with north korea are to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction nd to prevent an attack either nuclear or

of preventing the collapse of the north korean regime which it fears would interrupt its surgin g economic developmen t and bring thousands of north korean refugees across the border in to china analysts point out that china is also motivated by desire to keep rth korea as buffer state between it and the us troops stationed in south korea chinese officials maintain that the unsc resolution should create conditions conducive to the peaceful resolution of this issue through dialogue and negotiation8 according to press reports after the passa ge of the resolution chinese officials began inspecting trucks bound for north korea more closely9 questions have arisen on whether china will enforce the sanctions regime on air or ship trade and beijing said it would not stop north koreanbound ships to conduct inspections for illegal weapons and missiles as the reso lution requests chinese offi cials insist that they are implementing the resolution but that normal trade with north korea should not be disrupted economists argue that the only defin itively effective punishment on north korea would be the suspension of energy aid from china china reportedly supplies about 70 of north koreas fuel10 after the test reports citing chinese trade statistics showed marked decline of oil exports to north korea in september prompting speculation that beijing may have been punishing pyongyang for the july missile tests andor warning it not to test nuclear device as threatened chinese officials subsequently denied any cuto ff however and customs data showed resumption of crude oil to north korea in october11 some analysts suggest that beijing could be employing more subtle form of pressure by sending fewer refined oil products but there is overwhelming evidence that china has tried to punish north korea by restricting energy tradehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33709crs5 12 for more information on south koreas pproach to north korea see crs report rl33567 koreaus relations issues

intelligence and research november 1 2005possible north korean motivations determining the motivations of government as opaque and secretive as north korea is exceedingly difficult but analysts have put forth range of possibilities to explain why the pyongyang regime decided to test nuclear weapon now as with many foreign policy decisions the calculati on was probably combination of factors attempt to secure bilateral talks some analysts have argued that the nuclear test was desperate effort by the north koreans to secure bilateral negotiations with the united states and once in negotiations have more leverage the bush administration has steadfastly refused to engage in direct talks with north korean negotiators outside of the sixparty talks process although us officials assert th at much of the multilateral forum is devoted to speaking directly with the north korean s selig harrison an asian expert with exceptional access to dprk officials argues that top north korean officials want bilateral talks in order to implement the denuclearization agreement concluded at the last round of the sixparty ta lks in beijing in september 200517 this argument assumes that north korea is sincere in its intent to eliminate its nuclear weapons program in exchange for economic and dipl omatic incentives or if not the norths intent should be tested the joint statement of principles issued at th september 2005 round of the sixparty talks was seen as groundbreakin g agreement that outlined clear path to negotiated resolution in the statement the six parties unanimously agreed to the peaceful denuclearization of the korean peninsula and north korea committed to abandoning its nuclear weapons programs re turning to the npt and allowing iaea safeguards the other five parties offere d energy and humanitarian assistance the united states and north korea agreed to ta ke steps toward norma lization of relations which for the united states would include resolution of concerns with the norths ballistic missile programs and human rights record18 according to some analysts the promise of establishing diplomatic relations with washington was the key element for the north korean delegation attempt to ensure security of regime the nuclear test could have been motivated by the regimes deep insecurity and fear of an attack by the united states fear that has consumed the country for generations since the korean war after be ing labeled as part of the axis of evil by president bush in 2002 north korea ma have drawn lesson from the invasion of iraq that iraq was targeted because it was believed to be pursuing nuclear weapons program but had not yet succeeded pyongyangs planners may believe that developing and demonstrating nuclear capability will deter us attack north korea may believe that the rest of the world will adjust to it being nuclear powerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33709crs7 19 this unclassified assessment was in response to senate select committee on intelligence questions for the record arising from the fe bruary 2003 worldwide threat briefing dated august 18 20 03 p 144 or p 18 of the pdf file the full text is available at httpwwwfasorgirpcongress2003_hr021103qfrciapdf 20 ibid note that the question posed by the committee was is north korea capable of developing simple fission wea pons without conducting nuclear tests rather than more direct formulation of has north korea veloped weapons without nuclear tests in addition classified response was provided to the committee 21 see for example north korean fuel identified as plutonium new york times october 17 2006after the initial rounds of c ondemnation similar to the experiences of pakistan and india after testing nuclear weapons in 1998 an unclassified 2003 cia assessment provided to the senate select committee on intelligence offered this analysis test would demonstrate to the world the norths status as nuclearcapable state and signal kim jongils perception that build ing nuclear stockpile will strengthen his regimes international sta nding and security posture19 domestic political factors although internal pressures are exceedingly difficult to measure in secretive north korea the test may have been intended to appease hardliners in the regime in the wake of the partia lly failed missile tests in july 2006 the military leadership in north korea may have pressed for anothe r indication of their resolve given the norths impoverished state leader kim jong il needs to maintain the support of the military in order to hold on to power another domestic factor could have been the need for north korea to assert itself as south korea was winning wide recognition because of the ascension of foreign mini ster ban kimoon as secretary general since the division of the peninsula in 1945 pyongyang has competed with seoul for legitimacy as the government of the korean people many of these dynamics have played out at the wher both countries are recogniz ed as sovereign states technical motivations most observers believe that nuclear testing is important to validate design for an implosion device whether using plutoni um or highlyenriched uranium heu however in 2003 the cia had assessed that given north koreas long experience in high explosives testing nuclear tests would not be required to validate simple fission weapons20 even if north korea has also received copy of chinese heu implosion device blueprints pparently provided by pakist ani scientist aq khan to libya it is likely that technical experts would want to test it that said it is not clear that north korea has any heu at present more likely north korea desired to test an implosion device using plutonium whet her it was an indigenous or foreign design several media reports state that us intelligence agencies have concluded the device was plutonium21 some experts have suggested that the small yield of the test might indicate that north korea was attemp ting to test more sophisticated design composite pits or boosted fission devices but more data would be necessary to draw such conclusion even if this were the case one such nuclear test would not indicate whether north ko rea had the capability to place nuclear warheads onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33709crs8 22 although some us officials have suggest ed that north korea has had nuclear weapons for several years official us unclassified estimates have not stated that prior to the nuclear test unclassified us intelligence assessments have focused on the amount of plutonium that north korea is likely to have the assumption that north korea has workable devices seems to rest on the notion that acquisition of fissile material like plutonium is the usually the most difficult hurdl to overcome in the development of nuclear weapons experts tend to agree that the wea ponization process shaping the metal weapons design and manufacture can take as few as six months the observation that the october 2006 test had less than 1kt yield suggests that north korea may not have workable design although the test itself may provide significant technical information about what north korea has to improveballistic missiles given that the device di d not appear to produce the desired yield north korean scientists may desire to test again to improve the weapons design possible medium and longterm implications the shortterm implications of north koreas nuclear test are clear whether technical success or failure north koreas willingness to carry out test in the face of significant opposition indicates that it is willing to endure the potential consequences the psychologi cal impact of crossing this particular diplomatic red line is significant with ramifications for medium and longterm regional and global stability some implications are discussed below growing nuclear threat absent information on what nuclear w eapons north korea actually has or what its intentions are it is difficult to assess the north korean nuclear threat to the region and to the united states however different scenarios of capabilities and intentions may illuminate the kinds of threat that could emerge capabilities and intentions may not always match one may drive the other or there may be attempt to seek to match the two in addition to the threat of its own weapons capabilities north korea may pose threat in terms of its willingn ess to provide technology materials or weapons to rogue states such as iran or syria or terrorist organizations or individuals as noted above north korea may have had several motiva tions for testing which may also inform the larger questions of developing its nucl ear arsenal while prestige leverage in diplomatic negotiations and domestic political considerations may only require for now rudimentary or even symbolic nuclear capability security considerations and technical pr ide could push north korea to develop more sophisticated arsenal at present north korea might now have the capability to deliver crude nuclear device with in the region using ground transportation ships or airplanes22 north korea undoubt edly has the capability to deliver radiological dispersal device in the re gion although arguably it had this capability before the nuclear test according to mo st informed observers north korea does not now have the capability to marry nuclear warheads with longrange missiles thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33709crs9 23 pyongyang threatens to make more nukes washington times march 15 2006 24 n korea threatens preemptive strike

would undoubtedly need to conduct further nuclear tests there is reliable information about how north korea might use nuclear weapons particularly with respect to potential escalation within conventional conflict most official north korean st atements about nuclear capability point to the need to provide for deterrent against the united states according to the cia in april 2003 north korea publicly claimed that the iraq war shows only tremendous deterrent force can avert war and that failure to resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue would force the north to mobilize all potentials almost certainly reference to nuclear weapons in ma rch 2005 the north korean foreign ministry stated that reality proves that our possessi on of nuclear weapons guarantees balance of power in the region and acts as strong deterrent against the outbreak of war and for maintaining peace23 in march 2006 the foreign ministry stated that our strong revolutionary might put in place all measures to counter possible us preemptive strike according to the korean central news agency and that preemptive strike is not the monopoly of the united states the ministry added we made nuclear weapons because of nuclear threat from the united states24 from military perspective north korea could be seeking either nuclear deterrent against potential conventional force attack or nuclear retaliation either against nuclear attack socalled secondstrike capab ility or against conventional attack potentia lly firstuse capability perceptions of how nuclear weapons might be used will help shape the development of capabilities although it may not entirely drive the process thus if north korea is seeking capability that requires it to threaten the us mainland th future development of its forces would focus on developing robust and reliable nuc lear warheads small enough to fit in an icbm nosecone as some observers have suggested the threat that north korea poses may not fit into the traditional contexts of deterrence potential scenarios include demonstration detona tions to deter us interv ention transfers to terrorist groups that would use such weapons against states other than the united states and transfers to rogue states25 nuclear arms race in asia many regional experts fear that the nucl ear test will stimulate an arms race in the region geopolitical instability could pr ompt northeast asian states with the ability to develop nuclear w eapons relatively quickly to move forward creating cascading effect on other powers in the regi on one scenario envisioned would start with japanese decision to develop nucl ear weapons program in the face of clear and present danger from north korea south korea still wary of tokyos intentions based on japans imperial past

from ma inland china in turn this could prompt china to increase its own arsenal which could have impact on further development of programs in south asia alternatively south korea could go nuclear first stimulating similar chain of reactions most nonproliferation experts believe that japan using existing but safeguarde d stocks of plutonium could quickly manufacture nuclear arsenal south kor ea and taiwan would take longer although there is evidence of past experiments with plutonium processing for both countries26 japan is not likely to move forwar d precipitously with nuclear weapons development japan has abided by the selfimposed three non nuclear principles which ban the possession produc tion or import of nuclear arms with memories of hiroshima and nagasaki still vivid the japa nese public remains largely resistant to arming themselves with nuclear weapons many tokyo strategists may recognize that going nuclear could actually undermin their security by further eroding the global nonproliferation regime and reinforcing mistrust in the region under the terms of the usjapan alliance japan and south korea remain protected under the nuclear umbrella secretary of stat condoleezza rice reiterated the firm us commitment to defend japan and south korea against any threat from north korea during her trip to the region following the nuclear test some observers have suggested that the threat of japan goin g nuclear was intentionally emphasized in order to pressure beijing and seoul to be more firm on north korea however discussion about nuclear w eapons development is more likely to appear in government statements after north koreas defiant move the week after the test foreign minister taro aso nd the ruling party policy chief shoichi nakagawa suggested that japan should bate the possibility adding that nuclear weapons would not violate the constituti on earlier in september 2006 former japanese prime minister suhiro nakasone suggested that japan should study the possibility of going nuclear given the presence of other nucleararmed states in the region after rices assurances however as stated that japan has intention of developing nuclear weapons reinforcing many analysts contention that japans current policy could dissolve if the us commitment to the bilateral alliance wavers aside from the nuclear question new prime minister shinzo abes agenda of strengthening japans overall defense posture policy that has been encouraged by the united states may gain further support proliferation to other states or nonstate actors us officials have repeatedly stated that north korea must not cross the redline of further proliferation of its wmd capabilities whether to other states or nonstate actors there have been few in stances

rolorgact2006_10cv rforensicsaspunited states considered sharing nuclear missiles with india after chinas 1964 nuclear test but it can be argued that by then the united states had tens of thousands of weapons and there was norm estab lished yet of nonproliferation as embodied in the 1970 nuclear nonproliferation treaty in 2002 the cia told congress that traditional state recipients of wmd technology may follow north koreas prac tice of supplying specific wmdrelated technology and expertise to other countries or nonstate actors however the report specifies only that north korea has provided ballisticmissilerelated equipment components material and expertise rather than nuclearrelated items north korea is an established exporter of ballistic missiles and many observers including in the us government equate north koreas willingness to supply those items with willingness to sell nuclear w eapons or fissile material others argue that nuclear weapons are special case and confer special prestige th at state would cheapen its hardearned prestige by disseminating that capability that nonproliferation norm has been in place for over thirty years and that state like north korea would likely in the first few years conserve its nuclear material and weapons for its own deterrent or aggressive purposes some observers have suggested that as north koreas arsenal grows it might be more inclined to share the wealth at present the yongbyon five mwe reactor reportedly produces about six kg of plutonium per year enough for about one w eapon s hould north korea finish the two r eactors under construction which are not close to co mpletion it could augment that stockpile considerably27 kim jongil could see growing nuc lear stockpile as wasting asset or as source of hard currency howeve r transferring nuclear weapons or fissile material is inherently risky because of the loss of control over the recipients actions particularly if the material can later be tracked back to source such as north korea it is not entirely clear that it is possible to positively identify source of material although it is possible with c onsiderable cooperati on from nuclear weapon states to eliminate some sources thus narrowing the possibilities28 pyongyang official reportedly suggested during talks in april and august 2003 between north korean negotiator li gun and former assistant secretary of state james kelly that north korea w ould demonstrate its nuclear weapons or transfer weapons abroad according to one report mr li told mr kelly that the communist state would export nuclear weapons add to its current arsenal or test nuclear device on september 1 2003 nort h korean officials issued statement that north korea did not intend to sell nucl ear weapons or export nuclear material to terrorists nonetheless this continues to be us concern httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33709crs12 north korea was added to the us lis t of state sponsors of terrorism in 1988 and remains on the list although it is not known to have sponsored any terrorist acts since 1987 according to the state departme nt north korea continued to maintain ties to terrorist groups in 2005 has sold conventional weapons to several terrorist groups in 2 000 state depar tment report specified that north korea had sold weapons to the moro islamic liberation fr ont militant islamic group located in the southern philippines and re portedly continues to provide safe haven to terrorists specifically four remaining members of the red army an ultraleftist wing of japans radical student move ment in the 1960s in 2000 however north korea and the united states signed joint statement in which the two sides agreed that international terrorism poses an unacceptable threat to global security and peace and that terrorism should be opposed in all its forms in 2001 north korea also signed the convention for the suppression of fina ncing of terrorism and party to the convention against the taking of hostages nonetheless north koreas history of officially sanctioned kidnaping missile sales to states of concern and activities in drug smuggling and money c ounterfeiting are seen by many as indicators that kim jongil would be equally ope n to selling nuclear material s technology or weapons to terrorist groups impact on other proliferators in addition to the effect burgeoning north korean nuclear weapons capability will have on states in the region as they reassess their security the north korean test may hold some lessons for those outside the region that are perhaps inclined to develop the same capabilities the need for strong response to the test is not only rooted in the desire to roll back north koreas capabilities but also in the need to demonstrate political resolve and clear consequences to states disregard for international norms however it can be argu ed that lessons have already been drawn from north koreas proliferation before the test and that they are not good ones that wouldbe proliferators who participate in multilateral incentive programs will not live up to their commitments such as the agreed framework that there is equal if not more bargaining leverage outside the regime than within it and that there are practical consequences to withdrawing from the npt as north korea did in 2003 key question is how states of concern view the situation as it has unfolded is north korea perceived to have been allo wed to withdraw from the npt with punitive action by the international community until north korea tested nuclear device or is north korea now perceived by states such as iran and syria as the victim of discriminatory security c ouncil actions that have the potential to collapse its economy iranian presiden t ahmadinejad stated on october 16 2006 that some western countries have turned the security council into weapon to impose their hegemony and issue resolutions against countries th at oppose them but that iran would not be intimidated ultimately the extent to which the inspections curb pyongyangs ability to export and import wmdrelated items and any potential impact on north koreas economic viability will influence those perceptions fate of nuclear arsenal in north korean co llapse scenario us concerns with north koreas nuc lear weapons progra m may not be limited to how the current regime uses it cont rol over the norths nuc lear arsenal may behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33709crs13 uncertain in the event of collapse particularly if there is chaotic aftermath if control of the government is unclear north korean military officials may rashly launch nuclear weapons in one scenario pa rticularly as punishing attack on japan if they perceive to have not hing left to lose in mo re prolonged period of uncertain leadership nuclear weapons or material could be transfe rred to other foreign entities in an eventual reunification of the peni nsula under seouls control in another scenario more questions arise about wh ether the korean government would be willing to relinquish its nuclear weapons given the uncertain geopolitical conditions that the region would face us goals and policy options the most fundamental us goals of th confrontation with north korea are to prevent the further proliferation of wea pons of mass destruction and to prevent an attack either nuclear or conventional on the united stat or on its allies in the region both actions would dramatically diminish us security the bush administration appears to be divided on how to best achieve these goals with one group favoring negotiation to shape rth koreas behavior and another group advocating measures that will weaken the regime and ultimately lead to its collapse pursuing us objectives through the sixparty talks is complicated by the fact that other states have calculated their own national interests with regard to north korea differently japans goals converg most closely with us objectives to bolster its own security from the threat of north korean missile attack and to resolve the issues surrounding the abduction of several japanese citizens by north korea in the 1970s and 1980s for china and south korea the political instability and economic consequences of collapse of north korea may represent the worst outcome pursuit of us goals is pendent on some degree of cooperation from beijing and seoul the nuclear test by pyongyang has compelled china and south korea to agree to harsher measures but it is unlikely to alter their ultimate objective of preventing the collapse of north korea the options outlined below are not intended to be exhaustive but to provide spectrum of alternatives the approach taken by the united states may combine elements of several of the possible strategies status quo the current bush administration north korea policy is to work through the six party process to ensure the dismantle ment of north koreas nuclear weapons program the policy involves combinati on of diplomatic nd economic pressures on the regime in addition to focusing on the nuclear issue us officials have increased their criticism of north koreas human rights record and its criminal activities particularly counterfeiting cr itics of the us policy argue that the administration appears to be divided between those who favor negotiated solution and others who favor regime change and that this division has at times paralyzed the policymaking process toward north korea other observers believe that the divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33709crs14 masks an overall weak and passive policy that reflects north koreas low priority in comparison to middle east conflicts and international terrorism issues explicitly accept north korea as nuclear power some analysts maintain that north korea as paranoid and isolated regime will never be willing to give up its nuclear weapons some security analysts may argue that accepting north korea into the nuclear club and pressing for it to become responsible nuclear power is in the best interest of the international community in that scenario north kor ea could be asked to make nonproliferation commitments in exchange for tacit acceptance of its nuclear weapons status in much the same way that the united states has accepted the nuclear status of india pakistan and israel however the language used by us officials calling nuclear north korea intolerable and unacceptable indicates that the administration is unlikely to take this approach pakist an and india angered the united states and others after testing nuclear weapons in 1998 and now ar us allies for variety of geopolitical purposes however there is widespread be lief among us government officials that north korea as major us advers ary under an unpredictable and dangerous regime cannot be trusted with nuclear weapons more over unlike pakistan and india north korea like iran joined the npt and then violated it while this distinction may have practical value it appears to have diplomatic significance new approach through bilateral talks with north korea proengagement advocates argue that the united states should take new approach by agreeing to the longstanding north korean request for direct bilateral relations and offering more reciprocity for nuclear settlement including the normalization of diplom atic relations under this pl an as north korea suspended all nuclear and missile tests and froze its plut onium production programs negotiations on normalizati on of relations between the two countries would commence as north korea advanced towa rd the verifiable dismantlement of its nuclear programs incentives such as removal of the measures that restrict north korean access to the international banking system energy assistance programs and removal from the us list of state sponsors of terrorism might be offered this approach would resemble the implementa tion of the 2005 sixparty talks agreement but would begin with direct talks between us and north korean negotiators proponents of this option argue that although the united states has limited coercive measures remaining it has ample positive leverage for pushing forward on an agreement with north korea pursui ng this option is based on the belief that either north korea is willing to give up its nuclear weapons or that the multilateral coalition will be stronger if the united st ates tries bilateral approach first indicating its good faith to the other partie s most observers agree that the bush administration is unlikely to pursue this path because it believes that bilateral negotiations would reward the north kor eans for bad behavior although officials maintain that much of the multilateral forum is devoted to speaking directly with the north koreans that north korea would tinue its recalcitrant behavior in orderhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33709crs15 29 see leon v sigal an instinct for the capillaries paper for the seoulwashington forum brookings institution available at httpwwwbrookingseducommevents 20060501_sigalpdfto extract more benefits from any deal and that multilateral talks provide the best leverage north korea may wish to maximize the propaganda benefits of the negotiations including painting the us fficials as groveling and pleading for peace before kim jongil continue diplomacy via sixparty talks in the aftermath of the test some analysts speculated that the sixparty talks were dead as forum for negotiation howe ver us and regional officials continue to refer to the multilateral negotiations as the best way forward if north korea remains recalcitrant or ins titutes another boycott of the ta lks the other parties could meet to pursue joint strategy forward that specifically responds to the tests although the united nations security counc il measures achieve global involvement the participants in the sixparty talks have the most interest and leverage meetings of the five parties would likely focus on harmonizing the strategies including pressing china and south korea to adopt measures and strengthen sanctions that keep up pressure on the north korean regime to return to the negotiations observers point out that the biggest challenge may be maintaining sustained punitive measures from south korea and china once the initial crisis has died down this approach would require the united states and japan to maintain their pledge to resolve the problem through diplomatic means as china and south korea oppose the threat of military action escalate economic and legal pressure on regime as diplomatic progress in the sixpart talks faltered over the past several years the bush administration has develope d several programs designed to increase pressure on the regime these initiatives target the influx of cash and goods to pyongyang particularly those acquired through illicit or illegal activities that allow the regime to hold on to power and to develop weapons programs strengthening these programs may convince the regime to return to negotiations by threatening kim jongils hold on power encouraging south korea and china to participate in these activities would incr ease the likelihood of changing pyongyangs behavior on the other hand squeezing rth korea could push it to proliferate weapons and nuclear material more quick ly out of economic desperation some experts dispute that illegal activities such as counterfeiting and drug smuggling constitute major part of the north korean economy29 unilateral financial and legal measures since september 2005 the united states has pursued unilateral measures to financially isolate north korea in september 2005 the administration identif ied banco delta asia macaobased bank as an institution that allowed m oney laundering and c

might be tied to pyongyangs nuclear or other wmd progra ms several banks including many in china have suspende d business with north korean companies continuing law enforcement activities and using unilateral us financial leverage on international banks and financial institutions represents one way the united states can squeeze the north korean regime to reinforce the message the us government could identify and im pose sanctions on another bank perhaps one in mainland china suspected of allowing north korean firms to maintain accounts that facilitate illegal activities the united stat could also make explicit what some analysts say is the unspoken message of the warnings so far that the us government may prohibit us banks from dealing with financial institutions that have any links with groups that are tied to terrorism or rogue states30 strengthen proliferation security initiative one option that has been widely discussed is strengthening of the pr oliferation security initiative psi psi begun in 2003 is an effort to improve capabilities to interdict wmdrelated materials technology and quipment particularly as they are shipped to or from countries of concern such as north korea and iran31 although many hail psi as new initiative it is in reality slightly more robust version of interdiction efforts that have been carried out for many year s one new feature is the conclusion of bilateral shipboarding agreements which can facilitate shortnotice inspections of cargo but still require the authorization of the country under whose flag the ship is sailing although several observers have suggested that res 1718 legitimizes psi the resolution does not authorize inte rception or confiscation of cargo and so serves only to focus not strengthen efforts in the region only japan is member of psi south korea announced that it would not join psi out of fears of engaging in military skirmish with the north koreans but that it may take part in psi activities on casebycase basis china has expressed reservations about the legal standing of psi and chinese officials remarked at press conference in decembe r 2004 that there are also many concerns in the international community about the legitimacy and ffectiveness of psi interdictions and consequences that may arise therefrom the psi participants should take this into rious consideration some observers have noted that chinas resistance to psi may be influenced by its dependence on middle east oil and gas making it reluctant to cede interdiction rights to us and allied navies and by wariness of how psi might affect the relative balance of chinese and us pow er in the region until north koreas nuclear test it appeared as if chinas reluctance to join psi would make it very difficult for other states in the region to join in however the nuclear test and imposition of sanctions by the security council may make it politically easier for other states in the region to joinhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33709crs17 32 see aaron l friedberg an offer kim cant refuse washington post opinion section october 16 2006 33 for discussion of military options see crs report rs21582

would necessarily mean ab andoning the sixparty talks and actively working to undermine the ruling government either directly or through collapse of the north korean economy current us policy already has elements of this but declaring regime change policy even without threatening military action would create large divisions with seoul and beijing because the united states may not have the economic

threatening seoul and beijing that their overall bilateral relationship with washington is at risk for seoul this might mean threatening to withdraw us troops from south korea and pulling support for the bilateral free trade agreement currently in negotiation for beijing it may mean reconsideration of the one china policy and scaling back of the extensive economic relationship critics of this approach point to the pot entially massive ramifications of hurting relations with china major factor in the global economy and with south korea us treaty ally that hosts over 30000 us troops adopting more punitive policy toward north korea would align washington more closely with tokyo possibly exacerbating already tense relations in northeast asia with explicit divisions the somewhat uneasy peace
