house and senate appropriations committees subcommittee structure from the 1920s to the present in 1920 the house adopted change in its rules to consolidate jurisdiction over all appropriations in the appropriations committee after the enactment of the budget and accounting act of 1921 the house reorganized its appropriations committee by establishing for the first time set of subcommittees to consider appropriations bills based on the administrative organization of the executive branch the senate followed suit in 1922 and the two chambers have continued under that basic organizational approach since that time the evolution of the modern appropriations subcom mittee structure can be divided into four eras the first era stretching roughly from the initial reorganization in the 1920s until the end of the second world war was marked by stability most of the changes in appropriations structure resulted from combining bills eg the treasury department bill with the post office department bill beginning in 1924 although one new bill and subcommittee was created when the appropriations bill for the department of labor was split off from the departments of state justice commerce and labor bill in 1939 the second era from the end of the second world war through 1970 saw multiple changes during this period congress attempted to keep pace with executive branch reorganization eg creation of subcommittees to consider appropriations for the new departments of defense in 1947 and transportation in 1967 and changing national priorities eg creation of separate appropriations bill and later subcommittee for foreign operations the third era from 1971 through 2003 was marked by renewed stability although this era saw many changes in the overall committee structures of the house and senate the structure of the appropriations subcommittees in both chambers remained mostly unchanged until 2003 since 2003 there have been major changes in organization involving nearly every subcommittee in 2003 both the house and senate appropriations committees merged their subcommittees on transportation and treasury and created new subcommittee to consider appropriations for the newly created department of homeland security in 2005 both chambers undertook major reorganizations eliminating three subcommittees in the house and one in the senate this reorganization however left the two chambers with differing subcommittee jurisdictions and in 2007 the two appropriations committees reorganized again to reestablish parallel subcommittees this report will be updated to reflect any changes in appropriations subcommittee structure

section 9 of the us constitution pr ovides that money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law the constitution does not however prescribe any specific structure or process for making appropriations the committee structure established by congress assigns prominent role to the appropriations committees of the house and senate for both the development of appropriations legislation and oversight over budget execution the appropriations committees in turn have created system of subcommittees designed to facilitate their ability to carry out these tasks the number and jurisdictions of these subcommittees has evolved to meet changing needs and circumstances for example reorganization has been undertaken in order to adjust to new executive branch department although reorganization of subcommittee jurisdiction in the house and senate appropriations committees was not formally part of the legislation creating new department of homeland security dhs it was frequently discussed as possible adjunct reform 1 under such proposal the subcommittee structure of the appropriations committees in both the house and senate was to be reorganized so that appropriations for the various agencies proposed to be consolidated into new dhs could likewise be consolidated2 after the legislation establishing the new department was signed into law the chairman of the house appropriations committee announced that new subcommittee would indeed be established in the house3 this modification of subcommittee structure affected eight of the existing subcommittees and was one of the most extensive reorganizations of the appropriations committees since the 1920s shortly thereafter similar change was made in the senate appropriations committee reorganization can also be undertaken in order to adapt to changes in congressional priorities at the start of the 109th congress the house and senate undertook second major change in subcommittee structure this reorganization affect ed 10 subcommittees in the house eliminating three and eight subcommittees in the senate eliminating one

the first world war the idea that the budgetary process should be more centralized gained prominence and ultimately resulted in passage of the budget and accounting act of 19214 in anticipation of the more centralized executive budget system provided under the act the house also changed its rules to require that all ap propriations be considered by the appropriations committee5 during the late 19th century congressional rules had provided that jurisdiction over 1 for example the concept was endorsed by the brookings institution which stated that subcommittee reorganization would institutionalize

house and senate appropriations committees6 notably the appropriations bills for the district of columbia indian affairs agriculture department army navy post office department and rivers and harbors ie public works were considered by the appropriate legislative committees in addition the bureau of the budget newly established under the budget and accounting act recommended that appropriations bills be reorganized along administrative lines with appropriations for salaries and expenses being carried in the same bill as funding for programs and activities administered by department this arrangement had previously existed only in the department of agriculture appropriations bill the house appropriations committee adopted the bureaus concept and reorganized the structure of general appropriations bills and its subcommittees so extensively that only the structure of the agriculture bill remained essentially unchanged prior to this reorganization appropriations bills and subcommittees tended to be organized along topical lines for example the military activities of the war department were considered in appropriations bills reported by the military affairs committee and the activities of the corps of engineers were considered in river and harbor appropriations bills reported by the commerce committee the salaries and contingent expenses for the civilian administration of the department however were carried in the legislative executive and judicial bill which was within the jurisdiction of the appropriations committee similar division existed for most departments and was true even for agencies whose appropriations were wholly within the jurisdiction of the appropriations committee funding for the activities of agencies as disparate as the interstate commerce commission the coast guard and the bureau of mines were carried in the sundry civil bill which was frequently the largest of the general appropriations bills nevertheless their salaries and expenses were generally funded in the legislative executive and judicial bill after its reorganization the house appropriations committee comprised the following subcommittees 1 agriculture department 2 commerce and labor departments 3 deficiencies 7 4 district of columbia 5 independent offices including the executive office of the president 6 for more on the appropriations process in this era see charles h stewart budget reform politics the design of the appropriations process in the house of representatives 18651921 cambridge and new york cambridge university press 1989 7 unlike the other subcommittees the deficiencies subcommittees jurisdiction remained essentially topical rather than provide funding for an established group of agencies and programs in single annual bill its jurisdiction frequently involved multiple bills these bills provided supp lemental appropriations for various unanticipated needs of programs otherwise funded in regular appropriations however the subcommittee was also responsible for funding additional items not already provided in regular appropriations bills and financed obligations already entered into in advance of appropriations authority such as the lendlease program during world war ii

department and the navy 9 post office department 10 state and justice departments including the judiciary 11 treasury department 12 war department and the army both military and civil functions 8 by longstanding custom the house originates all general appropriations bills9 as consequence it is the house that generally decides the content of the bills by originating appropriations bills corresponding to its new administratively based organizational structure the house created jurisdictional problem for the senate which retained system based on topical organization of appropriations bills as well as multiple committees sharing jurisdiction over general appropriations bills confronted with the difficul ty of considering the reorganized appropriations bills with its now outmoded system the senate reorganized its appropriations jurisdiction and subcommittees in 1922 10 information available on congressional subcommittees including those of the appropriations committees is sparse and unsystematic prior to enactment of the legislative reorganization act of 194611 from available hearings and other committee documents it appears that during this era the appropriations committees continued the practice of having each subcommittee other than the deficiencies subcommittee be responsible for drafting one of the regular appropriations bills12 data on appropriations bills may also generally be used to identify subcommittee structure one conclusion that may be drawn from the appropriations bills considered in this period is that the subcommittee structure of the appropriations committees was relatively stable other than name changes the salient changes in appropriations bill structure and presumably subcommittee structure as well between 1922 and 1946 seem to have been limited to the following 8 civil functions consisted largely of the work of the army corps of engineers such as river and harbor projects flood control and maintenance of the panama canal 9

chief aims of the legislative reorganization act of 1946 was to bring about modernization of congresss committee system including its subcommittees as result unlike the earlier period information on subcommittee structure since 1946 is more readily available in the 80 th congress 19471948 the appropriations committees in both chambers had the following structure 1 agriculture 2 deficiencies 3 district of columbia 4 government corporations 5 independent offices 13 in the 68th congress the senate subcommittee maintained subunits for separate consideration of treasury and post office items respectively although single bill was considered 14 in the 68th congress the senate subcommittee maintained subun its for separate consideration of state and justice and commerce and labor items respectively although single bill was considered 15 however from available congressional documents it does not appear that this division was reflected in similar change in the subcommittee structure during the debate on the civil functions bill rep j buell snyder simply remarked that rep james p buchanan the chairman of th appropriations committee had directed that the estimates for the war department be handled in two separate measures congressional record vol 81 june 15 1937 p 5733 in the 80th congress for which there is reliable information on appropriations subcommittee structure there was single subcommittee and separate military establishment and civil function bills 16 the federal security agency was established by reorganization plan 1 of 1939 grouping the office of education public health service social security board us employment service civilian conservation corps and national youth administration the agency was abolished by reorganization plan 7 of 1953 and its functions transferred to the newly created department of health education and welfare 17 this change in bill structure however reflected ch ange in the subcommittee structure of the house only the senate maintained single subcommittee for consideration of separate appropriations bills for the departments of state justice and commerce and department of laborfederal security agency until the 80th

departments and the judiciary 9 treasury department and post office 10 labor department and federal security agency 11 war department 12 navy department the idea of modernizing congressional committee structure and operations embodied in the legislative reorganization act was paralleled by an interest in developing more modern federal administrative apparatus to supplant the one that had grown in fits and starts to meet the challenges of the depression and world war ii because appropriations bills continued to be written along organizational lines these changes in the executive branch had an impact on appropriations subcommittee structure four changes in party control in the house between 1947 and 1955 also contributed to an environment well disposed to multiple changes in appropriations subcommittee jurisdiction this evolution saw the number of subcommittees fluctuate between low of 10 18 and high of 1519 despite this fluctuation during this era it appears that the appropriations committees generally continued the practice of having each subcommittee be responsible for drafting one of the regular appropriations bills20
