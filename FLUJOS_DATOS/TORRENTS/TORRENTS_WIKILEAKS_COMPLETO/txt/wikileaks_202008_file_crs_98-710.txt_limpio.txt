finance division house rule x assigns the committee on rules jurisdiction over the order of business of the house the panels most noteworthy responsibility is to issue order of business resolutions these are usually called rules special rules or less commonly special orders chamber adoption of these rules accomplishes two main objectives it permits the house to take up measures that typically lack convenient rightofway to the floor and it defines the procedural playing field for example time for debate and the structure of the amendment process for considering legislation the committees important scheduling role has meant that congressional scholars and others have classified rules in various ways for example an open rule affords any lawmaker an opportunity to offer amendments to bill so long as they are in compliance with the houses standing rules closed rule forbids anyone from offering amendments with an exception sometimes made for amendments recommended by the committee that reported the measure starting about twentyfive years ago in response to developments such as increased partisanship and uncertainty with respect to how long or controversial the amendment process on the floor might be the rules committee began to issue more procedurally imaginative and complex rules definition of selfexecuting rule one of the newer types is called self executing rule it embodies twoforone procedure this means that when the house adopts rule it also simultaneously agrees to dispose of separate matter which is specified in the rule itself for instance selfexecuting rules may stipulate that discrete policy proposal is deemed to have passed the house and been incorporated in the bill to be taken up the effect neither in the house nor in the committee of the whole will lawmakers have an opportunity to amend or to vote separately on the selfexecuted provision it was automatically agreed to when the house passed the rule rules of this sort contain customary or boilerplate language such as the amendment printed in section 2 of this resolution or in part 1 of the report of the committee on rules accompanying this resolution shall be considered as adopted in the house and in the committee of the whole crs2 traditional use originally this type of rule was used to expedite house action in disposing of senate amendments to housepassed bills as mentioned in the precedents house practice by wm holmes brown and charles w johnson self executing rules for these purposes eliminate the need for motion to dispose of the senate amendment brown and johnson further state that such resolutions are sometimes called hereby special orders because the house in adopting the resolution as drafted hereby agrees to the disposition of the senate amendment as proposed by that resolution if the house adopts resolution further action by the house is required the senate amendment is never before the house for separate consideration hereby or selfexecuting rules have also been used to adopt concurrent resolutions correcting the enrollment of measures or to make other technical changes to legislation contemporary use selfexecuting rules are still employed on matters involving housesenate relations they have also been used in recent years to enact significant substantive and sometimes controversial propositions examples from the congressional
