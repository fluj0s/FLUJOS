the clearing congress lectures shoreham hotel washington dc the freedoms of clear lecture given on 4 july l958 thank you well do we have congress yet well good how are you making out i have doubt that what you will be making out better after youve had some seminars you realize we have upper indocs for the seminar this time it was my idea the you know justas an aside here theres real reason why we might not some day some fardistant future develop group clearing technique its possible not very probable but possible the results which are obtained in group intensive are quite excellent when very competent auditors are auditing for instance nibs and dick and i think burk and one other auditor hal were in this last group intensive and they did very fine job they really got somewhere i dont know if you can see this or not showing an apa graph but that blue line is where they was and that red line is where they went so they did go somewhere on one of these graphs by reason of group intensive its group processing shouldnt be undersold undersold it is an assist to clearing but is not itself clearing at this time people only do few thousand percent betterafter theyve been through processes for while and we expect more significant gain than that for clearing now the whole idea of clearing people getting off into run here the whole idea of clearing people is not making nothing out of them and it really isnt setting them free its simply making them more capable and more able and increasing in particular watch this carefully their creativeness and increasing in particular their tolerance there are four freedoms we have been told from another decade and these four freedoms were all very well but they were not doable we have four freedoms today in scientology that are very doable clearing does not mean that the individual is free from thisuniverse or its liabilities it merely means he can cope with them thats little bit different from standpoint of average man you know you get somebody who can throw his shoulders back in clearing people we do achieve these four freedoms and ill enumerate them for you here theyre freedom froms im afraid the first one is illness now thats quite remarkable since illness has been considered an indoor sport here for number of years laugh if you cant do anything else to get attention from somebody or to get out of something you can always get sick but medical science has been ending this rather rapidly and as matter of fact even dianetics put large dent into it seventy percent of mans ills are psychosomatic and good auditor auditing outthe right engrams got people well people who are clear dont get sick as often that doesntclearing course lectures 4758 3 the freedoms of clear2 mean that if you probably inject them with tremendous number of bacteria of one kind or another and the body would get sick but the person wouldnt ive had more clears say this to they say this to they say they say the difficulties are very simple the body is sick and im not i say how do you feel the fellows going around cough cough cough i say how are you doing how do you feel i feel great cough cough cough chuckle i say whats the matter well the body has touch of flu or something and i feel fine and so on now this means that bodies continue to be subject to such things as trains running into them and bacteria poured into them from the unwashed spoons of the cafe and such things but to this illness is not added the perpetuation of the person himself see he doesntperpetuate the psychosomatic aspect all illness has psychosomatic aspect i believe that in operating thetan at that level youd be able to take body and smash it up against the wall and it would bounce down in good shape and it would be in perfect condition that is higher condition we have not experienced that condition and we are talking about clearing i remind you we are not talking about anything that we dont know about i can only tell you what happens now the funny thing about it is you clear somebody and for about two three months after that the body tries to get used to not having to be sick and the guy goes around and he starts shelving this and shelving that and one day he gets up in the morning and all of sudden the pneumonia he had ten years ago goes ffft hed be perfectly alright but the bodygoes through period of selfadjustment there for about i dont know exactly what the period is on the average but as reported its about ninety days as the person himself gets clear then the body starts clearing see all by itself im talking now the body is clearing physiological aspects its straightening itself up physiologically not mental physiologically see i dont know then whether or not it would be an immediate truth to say that the physical universe oh boy am i telling you lie now i dont know if it would be true that the physical universe around the person would start to straighten up too chuckle i can only tell you that very aberrated people have very aberrated machinery their machinery breaks downyou get the famous case that we always speak about joe blow you give joe blow brand new car in perfect condition it has been adjusted within an inch of its name plate on all factors and facets he gets in the car starter rrrrr rrrr rrow rrow battery runs down batteries have never run down before on any new car that just came out of the plant but it ran down then and he runs it for few miles and all of sudden its developed torsion steering laugh you go down to used car lot you can actually take cars that have been owned by one owner and you can diagnose the case state of their former owners now in some under privileged countries in the world that have been very badly beaten around it is as much as your lifes worth to leave piece of machinery lying around foranybody to get at because it will go boom it doesnt matter how many lendlease tractors it doesnt matter how much tonnage of equipment is poured into the country its going to break down thats what you can say about it during the war during the war it was quite interesting that tons and tons of butter were shipped to starving russia taken up on the mermansk run at great expense of us corvettes and british corvettes and german submarines remember they were an expensive item too and when they arrived why the russians used it to grease the tanks with thats quite interesting im not telling you anythingclearing course lectures 4758 3 the freedoms of clear3 now i just dreamed up they did thats what they used our butter for it tasted sweet it didnt have any particular rancid flavor and there were hairs in it and so they knew it wasnt butter chuckle but butter under heat is not good lubricant if youve ever tried to fry steak or something like that in butter in skillet thats too hot it burns and so did the tanks so it isnt exactly mental aura were talking about you know they actually do odd things and one of the characteristics of aberration is to misuse equipment you use fork not to eat with or turn things in frying pan with but to hold the door open with and you go around some places youll find out that the equipment is all misused one way or the other shoes are stored in the ice box all kinds of things are occurring but this is what you see in an under privileged country that is rather aberrated on the average thats what you see but im not just talking about that when i talk about area of influence of person im actually talking about an esoteric exotic incomprehensible not measurable sphere of calm that can surround somebody or sphere of confusion that can surround somebody that actually affects the environment im sure youve had person who has come to see you youve had other people come to see you and everything was okay when you put the dinner on the table and they sat down and everything why dinner got eaten and everybody got up after you know dishes got done that sort of thing you had nice evening you know nicedinner this person were discussing however comes to dinner now they didnt even go near the stove but for the first time in months the rice boiled over the soup burned the best crockery fell on the floor they werent even near the kitchen and they sit down at the table you know and half the things are missing or theres too many of them and they dont hit the plates they hit the tablecloth you get the idea and half way through dinner theres tremendous emergency that requires that you not finish dinner theres just things go wrong the one thing we can say about these people things go wrong and it doesnt physically evidently take anything to make them go wrong they just do now if we take the converse of this there are people around whom things go right person moves in things start goingright the person doesnt do anything just things start going right get the idea i can give you an example of that i knew young officer im awfully hard on ensigns because they cost my life several times laugh and they these few tiny little grey hairs up there each one of thems an ensign failing to put ammunition aboard failing to put the charts aboard you know that sort of thing telling the crew they could all have liberty one hour before sailing you know this sort of thing but this young man came from california of all things you wouldnt expect it but he did and he was rather plump calm young fellow and up to that time the ship had never been able to get any supplies except if i myself would apply for them but he walked aboard and all of sudden we were wealthypeople just walked down the deck with five gallon cans of paint and hand them to us you know over at the ammunition depot theyd say youre sure you have enough ammunition we were wealthy this young man i might as well say his name his name was ensign dye very unlikely that he would have name like that and would make things live to the degree that he did but things lived around this person there are other persons youd give him plant it would promptly go zzzt drooping you give somebody else plant it would go clearing course lectures 4758 3 the freedoms of clear4 zzzoom soaring up you say good god lets get rid of that before it fills the room you know just thrives now when were talking about those things were talking about sphere of influence direct sphere of influence not via mest this person is actually influencing mest events matter energy space and time one way or another ive known person that could never be on time for anything even though they left two hours early this person ordinarily left to take train two hours early he had the whole family sitting down in the waiting room at the depot for two hours before the train left and then miss it i said to this person once i said how do you manage this and the person looked very thoughtful and then came out of it all of asudden and realized that i was coming in little too close now similarly there are people you see if were talking about the physical universe and zone of enturbulation body of course is close up area and body without much causation can simply get sick by being in such zone i have known nurses much as your life was worth to have one on the case they walk in the temperature soars harry leon wilson ruggles of red gap one of one of the better old time writers of novels and things wrote one called oh doctor i think the name of the thing was and he had black watch mary i think her name was and she comes in on the case picks up the thermometer along side of the bed shoves it in the patients mouth takes it out sneers throws the thermometer in the waste basket takes out her own whips it outshoves it in his mouth takes it out and reads it 106 ah thats much better laugh now freedom from illness would then not consist of running away from illness it would just be matter of illness as result of enturbulated zone an area of influence it would simply be negative gain that far but then there is positive thing this society gets so sick that it forgets something that there is positive good people think that evil is positive and only evil is positive thats because you can kill man so quick and you can mock him up so slowly for instance nations which is criteria you cant even talk about the insane in nation in the same breath well have to sensor this film destroy it some day i realize because the way the worlds going why remark like that would be considered high treasonbut if they manage to hide the master and bring it out few years later some nation will consider it compliment that it is not even insane see its further off than that i dont know why it is but nations do seem to demonstrate an individuality which comes close to insanity you start to add up the characteristics of nation do it some time for sport add up the characteristics of nation what it does and then say what would i think of an individual if it did these things well id throw him in garbled it takes twenty years to grow young man so that you throw him away in brief time in war thats an interesting thing isnt it well if nation as aberrated as it is could mock him up ping you see why it wouldnt have this disproportion of positive good and positiveevil so you get this positive evil would not appear quite so authoritative or quite so forceful but that you spent hours and hours making cake and people come in and go swish swish and then gulp cake that appears that evil has great authority and that you have to work very very hard to be good now the harder you have to work to produce something the less creative you areclearing course lectures 4758 3 the freedoms of clear5 i love these authors who spend seven years writing book they tell you this to impress you with the fact that this is good book thats not true not true i usually tell one of these fellows if you could just mock up the manuscript paper with all the writing on it pop that would be the finest novel ever written they think im being funny its not true i am not being funny its an actual fact that you were that good at creativeness little thing like plot and characterizations and witty words certainly wouldnt bother you any in other words theres positive good so we get this other factor here of zone of influence where good takes place in other words theres positive good here it isnt just absence of evil and so we get freedom from illness we also get proof up against illness by recreation of the bodymember which would become ill very rapidly where we get such zone you see theres double thing at work here and the modern world has lost sight of the positive aspect of good the next thing we put down just for the multitude because any thetan in his right mind doesnt mind little bit of pain it is after all sensation and if you dont believe this run little process on somebody sometime sit him down and then say waste pain this way waste pain that way waste pain all of sudden pain appears very valuable to him you just have him go on little further have him run enforced pain for little while and you could until he gets to agreeing with the society again take his loose skin and pinch it very very hard and he would say ah thanks thats an interesting thing but pain is defined certainway but if we defined it this way an undesirable sensation then we have truth here in saying freedom from pain which is saying freedom from an undesirable sensation the next freedom that we could write down that scientology would carry with it is ignorance ignorance contains of course potential to know doesnt it we have the old first postulate idea native state in which the thetan knows everything and then he has to not know the whole lot of it so that he can know something then he has to know whole bunch of particulars see here he is he knows everything he has potentiality of total knowingness and then he has to say i notknow all of these things then he comes down and knows whole bunch of particulars and now again he notknows these particulars this we termforgetting and after hes got all of that suppressed we get ignorance ignorance goes along with obsessive making nothing out of everything if you dont believe this talk someday to stupid man stupid people are not dangerous to have around so much as unnecessary now stupid person stupid person can do some of the weirdest things the great revolutionaries of the world are the very very bright and the very very stupid now you take somebody whos very very bright he could see these various wrongs so he says they ought to be overthrown and then you get somebody else whos very very stupid and he doesnt see any wrongs he just fails to understand anything wrong or right so he says i cant understand it therefore its evil and i willoverthrow it and we get hitlerian revolt you know we got to overthrow everything we do not understand well this doesnt carry with it the potentiality of everything being understandable dont ever make that mistake you know how people convince people theyre ignorant they take something which cannot be understood chuckle and then they say you stupid jerk why dont you understand this isaac newton did this one time he invented thing calledclearing course lectures 4758 3 the freedoms of clear6 calculus chuckle now people in colleges people in colleges prove theyre bright by knowing calculus by knowing exactly what to do with it exactly how to handle it and everything about calculus and prove other people are stupid because the other people say this is interesting but does it have any real use or can it be done some other way you get the idea now calculus is not really flagrant example lets go upstairs now into something that is drawing big pay from the government at every side lets take psychology these people say there is subject here and then people rush in and say well teach little bit of it and they say oh well it takes years and years and years to understand anythingabout it and of course youre stupid because you dont understand anything about it but it takes so many years to understand something about it and this way nobody ever finds out theres nothing there you get what nice trick that is its an interesting trick the first thing science of mind should be able to do is to change minds science should have control of an area the science of physics certainly can change lot of things within its zone if it expects to be effective and when we say science then we have some connotation of effectiveness and i suppose there can be an esoteric science which is not effective at all and which doesnt treat anything but it would only be an honest one if it said so dont ever make the mistake of believing that youre ignorant simply because you do notunderstand non comprehensible because thats the oldest trick in the universe when im talking about ignorance im talking about very mechanical thing im talking about the fellow who refuses to know what he has already found out now hes ignorant hes stupid this fellow already knows that he only gets one body this lifetime theyre rationing them very thinly at this time have you noticed that very thin rations on bodies youre supposed to make one last one whole lifetime this fellow know this he knows he isnt going to get another body so he jumps into car and goes tearing down the highway drives on both sides of the road comes to dangerous intersection times it so as to cross it at the same time with truck comes out of the hospital jumps into car drives downthe road and times it so as to touch at the same time as truck he comes out of the hospital gets into car and drives down the road crosses dangerous intersection and times it to cross the same time as truck that fellows stupid given the fact that hell only get one body and that he wants the body given that fact then we get stupidity now of course if hes merely after if his goal essentially is the destruction of all bodies all cars and all trucks then hes being howling success and in his own right can be considered very intelligent he knows how to make it intersect with truck every time and that takes some doing laughing now wherever we have wherever we have ignorance we generally have the remainder of things that man considers bad one of the first and foremost of them isignorance you have to have almost wilful ignorance before you have hopeless case now iq is not necessarily intelligence or brilliance or smartness jan told about professor one day who said this professor said that iq is what the test measured which i think is very good because essentially in dianetics its the original thesis it gives the purpose of the mind in there brief form of it is supposed to resolve problems relating to survival we dont know what intelligence is but we know what ignorance is and we can put test up here thatclearing course lectures 4758 3 the freedoms of clear7 says he is not ignorant by so many points chuckle you get the idea thats about all we can test we can test his potential now clear of course has to be out of this zone of ignorance 135 i think is some people have told lately that thats genius although i used to consider it college average i use to think that ought to be then i met some college boys of this generation and i found out it wasnt college average any more so well say its genius ive been invalidated there 135 is pretty darn high iq now i found something very peculiar about people who have 135 and above i found out they dont have any real difficulty in communicating thats because they are not in the dark about what were communicating but people who are below 80 havean awful lot of trouble trying to find out what youre talking about and most of your discussion with them concerns the definition of what youre discussing you keep saying the car needs washing and they say the car the car the car the car the car the car and you say yes the car its out there on the driveway and there it is and so on you finally lock on conversation so called and you get this car out there alright you got that located and the you say there you better get bucket and they say why you say well the car needs washing and they say washing washing washing here we go see so that your quote communication with these people is simply voltaires if you would argue with you must define your terms well all you do with these people is define objects you just go onendlessly talking about what you were talking about without ever talking about it you never get anywhere beyond the point of that now youve known such people very often very often boy or girl in his or her teens will conceive this of the parents of the family they conceive the parents to be very very stupid mostly because they can never hold conversation what they miss is this the parents might have been stupid in their own sphere or they might have been smart but they are certainly educated into one frame of reference and their powers of observation grasp certain values that apply to their age bracket and the teenager has entirely different sets of values for the same apparent scenery the parents look at car the boy looks at hot rod same vehicle the boy never sees the carproperly put together he sees the thing properly stripped down with enough vitties in it and he says why are you driving that old heap and in view of the fact that its comfortable gets to work gets back it is what the neighbors also own which makes it correct the correct tie the correct chapeau the correct gown used to be societys basic discussion point and now its the correct car the correct ranch type you know theyre wearing cars now and you get different viewpoints but person who is very bright can shift his viewpoint with speed he realizes hes talking to teener he picks it up at once that the teener is not talking about car the teener is talking about hot rod hes not talking about performance in terms of comfort hes talking performance in terms of zing hes not talking about smoothness of motor hestalking about loudness of motor i know i ran into this the other day with mary sue she was hoping they hadnt put muffler on new speed boat it sounded so lovely now her idea that sounding lovely was crack crack crack crack the least it sounded like was the cannonade that preceded the battle of waterloo i thought it was nice sound myself but the boat people came down and put muffler on it and now all the sound is inside the cockpit so it deafens you if you ride in it chuckleclearing course lectures 4758 3 the freedoms of clear8 but anyway person who is who is this word intelligent this word smart these words all have connotations we really dont have word to determine brilliance because its not really defined there havent been enough bright people around for anybody to notice what brightness was but its matter of being able to identify this is one test of it identify whats happening whats going on and what the objects are all about and what they mean to the other fellow intelligence then isnt something as the psychologists would have you believe that its innately implanted here just sixteenth of millimeter on the other side of the medulla oblongata it doesnt apply to just the person its second party thing in other words its the ability to know what the other fellow is thinking you get the idea in only thatway can intelligence be demonstrated or conversation or communication be held it has to have some perception of what the rest of the world all is about well this also then requires tolerance requires perception observation requires an awful lot of things fellow has to be able to look and identify for himself and look and identify for the other fellow in order to communicate thats just one factor of intelligence its not first dynamic operation at all its multiple dynamic operation i suppose if fellow was smart enough he would know what the supreme being was thinking about but of course if he was that smart hed probably be excommunicated anyway the whole area here of ignorance would also be able to embrace the idea that somebody could not identify so that you would then not keep on saying but its car im talking about washing the car the car you know the thing you get the idea he wouldnt be going down scale on toboggan trying to communicate and thats partially freedom from ignorance freedom also from the other fellows ignorance so hes stupid so what heres bucket of water and heres some wood haul and hew feller chuckle but of course the ignorant cant even draw water and chop wood thats whats remarkable to i went out one time very very stupid fellow that was hired in the woods to do woods work and he was hired because he would work and because he was stupid at least this is what the woodsman told and i went out to where he was working and i found that thetree behind him had more felling axe marks than the tree in front of him and every time he lifted this axe he hit something with it that he didnt intend he was working there for little while and he finally came up the house and he said to he said have you got beach umbrella and i said yes yes i have beach umbrella and he said can i borrow it i said alright alright he borrowed it he took it out lugged it out into the woods when he got it in the woods he came back with the beach umbrella and he says well the sun is so bright when there isnt any sun but its not so bright out in the woods and i never have been able to figure that out to this day theres reason to go on worrying about it i abandoned it years ago laughing he made little bit of chaos where i was concerned i found out he had the rest of the crew on their ears and the rest of the crew in that logging area kept begging the foreman to fire him before he killed somebody they tell him to light up the boiler in the morning you know so hed stuff it full of straw and hed stuff it full of straw and hed stuff it full of straw and the next thing you know he had small forest fire going he didnt light the boiler he lit the forest laugh this was an interesting caseclearing course lectures 4758 3 the freedoms of clear9 now we go little bit further when we talk about clearing and we get another zone which is very important person who is very bright in the determination that ive been talking about brightness who is very bright person who is very very intelligent seems to make other people brighter now thats an interesting fact so that youre pretty good youre pretty good and you move in on this zone this area and theres some other people there and these other people are all enturbulated about some horrible puzzle and they cant seem to figure out which way to shift into low or something of the sort you show up you dont show them but they shift into low ever see anything like this thats zone influence in terms of brightness well i wouldnt go so far as to say that if more people were brighter more peoplewould be brighter but its true if more people were brighter then more people than that would become mysteriously brighter i knew one girl one time she was married to writer he was very very brilliant writer he was tremendous boy and he oh youve seen one of his pictures destination moon this guys real bright bob heinlein anyway bob had the horrible effect upon people of making them very bright theyd get around bob theyd talk to bob for little while and next thing youd know theyd be bright you know young writers and so forth were always coming around to get rubbed off on them little bit and he was married to girl boy was she bright oh she was just sharper than tack and then unfortunately due to thefortunes of war and few other things he wasnt married to her any more i ran into her and you talk about stupid person boy was she stupid and she lived the rest of her life just that stupidly and she didnt live long either but there was fantastic little test of things about the brightest person you ever met was that girl as long as she was in location of very bright person you see that now that doesnt mean that everybodys bright because theyre in the area of some bright person god forbid if youre not bright in your own right youll never be free from ignorance but you can make person bright in his own right by clearing rather easily iq on old time processing used to go up at the rate of one point per hour of processing just as neatas you please if you tested it and it was good processing it went up at the rate of one point per hour now there are some techniques which arent necessarily part of clearing at all it had to do with withholding running various types of withholding and running it in various ways but you could shoot peoples iq up at about five points an hour rather fabulous but this is their own brightness theyre acquiring not anybody elses you see but freedom from ignorance would be basically freedom from liability because of the ignorance of others therefore you wouldnt have to totally depend upon the tolerance of the world you live in it becomes very important the last part of these freedoms here is the most controversial of them all this little thing i have not talked about for some years death ive just not talked about it very much scientologists though have developed considerable awareness of what this is all about they have good grip on the situation we arent good enough yet so that we can overthrow this critter and dispense with it entirely or to pick up one of our friends after hes disappeared down this chute or route but this phenomena depends totally upon fixation of identity in terms of bodies if body is an identity then death defeats us in costing us our friends dont you see until we have overcome death we will still lose friends thats for sureclearing course lectures 4758 3 the freedoms of clear10 there are many people not many there are only about five that i wish were here today in the flesh because i liked them they were good people and theyve gone off to the four quarters of somewhere now these people comprise very low mortality rate for as many people as there are in scientology they comprise very low mortality rate but they nevertheless they nevertheless have disappeared about five of them over long period of time here several of them very dear friends of mine and very very missed now the conquest with death is personal thing they had not developed the facility and this is not really part of being clear but they had not developed the facility to perpetuate their identity in the absence of an identified body thats the only trick now were really talking about something awfully esoteric arent we when were talking about this were talking about something exotic were talking about something that is magic far beyond that sort of thing one of the first things fellow realizes with great clarity on the road up is that he is not his body and as he realizes this more and more we can see that new thing would take place ill go into that in moment but all recognition and all freedom begins with the individual thats thats horrible thing to have to face because it tells us that the individual is the beginning point of any realization and after that there is sense in talking about the masses when people are really licked they talk about the masses when they are whipped when they dont know where theyre going or what theyre doingthey talk about the masses they talk about people i dont know any people i know person but ill tell you this when person who fixates on the masses has failed to communicate somewhere along the line with one person and ever afterwards is putting out generalized communication hoping it will reach that person he failed to communicate to mama every time he said mama can i aw shut up you know some ladylike rebuttal later on he decides that hes going to communicate to the masses why he hopes in some circuitous fashion that the communication on via will get around and get to the old lady after all you got that youll find that people who fixated on the masses cannot talk to the individual now you wanna watch one of these boys and you wanna watch yourself because you become dangerous person when this happens to you that when you can talk to many and also talk to one now when you can sell somebody out of his eyeteeth individually visavis and you can also talk to group you become dangerous person the world at large recognizes this the american government today likes nothing worse than people who are in charge of groups leaders of groups they think hmmmm however they are usually victimizing only people who are talking to masses theyre not dangerous theyre not really dangerous at all because they never communicate to person i never saw mass of people sit down to read book have you its not happened at all so therefore we have to start with the one we startwith basic unit of youness basic unit of you before we start anywhere id like to draw you this little picture of the dynamics large sketch pad is set up on an easel we talked about these freedoms we talked about freedom from death well freedom from death depends in large degree upon this graph i never showed you this graph before i talked about it in angeles i think in the fall of 50 and then came right off of it its the eight dynamics its very easy to enumerate they simply consist of self which is the urge towards survival of ones self sex the urge towards survival through sexclearing course lectures 4758 3 the freedoms of clear11 the second dynamic the third dynamic group the fourth dynamic mankind the urge towards survival through fifth the animal kingdom or the world of bodies or bodies in general the urge toward survival through bodies sixth the physical universe the urge toward survival through the physical universe seventh which is the dynamic of the spirit which is the urge towards survival through the spirit and eighth which is merely infinity and we turn it right side up and we get eight you can call that supreme being or anything else you have found out about it laugh now heres peculiarity on the eight dynamics theyre matter of reach they are matter of spirit influence theyre matter of reach here is the first dynamic drawing tinycircle in center of pad person who would only be on the first dynamic would have this area of reach of merely self but dont think thats bad thing youve been educated some of you to believe that the thought of self and awareness of self and that sort of thing is bad thing you should think of the other fellow never of you and that sort of thing now were talking about below the line lets go on up here very rapidly drawing concentric circles outward from the tiny center circle heres your second dynamic third dynamic fourth dynamic fifth dynamic sixth dynamic seventh dynamic and out here of course is your eighth now this is very fascinating your first dynamic here pointing to it on pad has to be real now up above this line drawing horizontal line across the middle of the pad andthrough the center of the 1st dynamic this is matter of reach dont you see were talking about reach were talking about how far an individual can go not necessarily in terms of space but how far his influence exists when we talk about this first dynamic we say well he can influence himself pretty well we probably mean body and so forth out here would be your second dynamic well what about your second dynamic well if he could control that pretty good hed really be something the third up here the handling of groups this becomes little more rare but can be done that is handling number of first dynamics we get up here to the fourth were merely talking about handling that species to which he belongs if we were talking about the fourth dynamic of cockroaches wed be talking about all thecockroaches that are in this universe we happen to be talking about physical bodies of human beings so were not talking about cockroaches now this fourth dynamic merely means body of the species fifth dynamic would be all life forms thats your combination of life plus material objects making body forms this would be trees and grass and all the rest of that alright theres your command there and your sixth dynamic would be the physical universe heres your seventh dynamic and would be all of the spiritual world on this last circle and then outside that you got an infinity pointing below center line and writing and you got two three four five six seven eight minus we also got minus one where does the average person sit in thiscommunity or this society today you dont think for moment that hes totally aware of himself do you if he did he would be able to influence his whole history and everything else hed be natural clear and there arent very darn many of them his zone of influence and so forth just around himself he would become so darn notable that just oh gee you know so people are at least at minus one you know well i dont amount to much i m nobody you know how it is erase erase i know i want the trophy but i slipped negation of self alright now lets walk down hill here and we see minus second well thisclearing course lectures 4758 3 the freedoms of clear12 individual is inhibited sexually thats enough to put him on minus second thats enough he read freud once finished chuckle minus third he thinks of groups as masses not as firsts he knows what group is its mass thats the way he defines it but how about this fellow at minus four who is talking about mankind little boy runs up to him and says daddy can i have nickel get away you little brat mankind has got to be saved get away from here laughing get the idea hes not upstairs on any of these dynamics above him but mankind this is weird deal when you get to thinking this over hes just going on an avoidance the further we go south the more hes avoiding the things just north of him you see these things up here to the north from the south are beyond his ken and as he goesdown here to minus six nuclear physicist he never looks at it but he says theres something in it i know theres something in it if i combine enough stuff this way mumble itll go booom and there will be fifth fourth third second wheee so we actually have your divisions here of constructive and destructive person who is in very good shape can construct and destroy but persons who can only destroy are certainly below this line and persons who can construct and gradually as we go up we get them to destroy too but they can do this at analytical choice are above this line now we get then negative dynamics and this is the way they are laid out and where do people normally exist on these negative dynamics its very interesting but theyre some where around thereantisocial you have to get somebody up the line up here at least get him sexually inhibited freud undoubtedly improved the whole society you have to get enough of him there so he can make nothing out of it before he can find himself judgment which is an ot subject which well be talking about in the next acc actually consists of ive been searching for years for what judgment is it is how many and what side dynamics does person compute on instantly thats judgment if an individual computes on the first dynamic only hes got more judgment then most people now if he can compute when he thinks of solution to an automobile accident or something like that he thinks in terms of first second third fourth you know and thats his solution it embracesthat many positive dynamics okay but if it embraces that many negative dynamics you can peg him about where he sits and then you can tell him after that what he ate what hes trying to get rid of what hes fleeing from and so forth where his obsessions lie its quite interesting that is judgment how many dynamics he can simultaneously compute on but that is not really what were covering here what were trying to cover here is that as an individual goes up here he is running away from the world pointing below the center line and up here he is reaching into the world pointing above the center line and the further an individual can reach the more he can control and if an individual is totally aware of himself as an immortal being he has not yetcome up to point where he can make somebody else aware that he of himself without body is an immortal being and then we get up here to the third dynamic on the subject of death so death perhaps is just little bit beyond the scope of clear but death is certainly at the first dynamic and the individual would be free from death these are the four freedoms that we are talking about here today and they actually do pose new view of society and without anybody inventing new society if you look thisclearing course lectures 4758 3 the freedoms of clear13 over and thought of society free from these things you might ask yourself two questions whatll we do for game i think we could dream that up if we were this good and the other one is what would society look like how much security would there be and wouldnt people be little bit happier in it we can ask that question and whether you answered yes or is beside the point because you have total freedom of choice to be as bad off as you want what were talking about here is that person shouldnt be forced to be bad off now therefore the gate opens and the gate opens certainly on these things and many many more that we wouldnt really be able to embrace in very fast rundown the next lectures that im going to give you are going to immediately concern the techniques of how you bring an auditor up to being able to run techniques and the techniques themselves with their present day auditing commands which do make clear and i do hope that you appreciate the information and that it has some slight value thank you end of lecture
