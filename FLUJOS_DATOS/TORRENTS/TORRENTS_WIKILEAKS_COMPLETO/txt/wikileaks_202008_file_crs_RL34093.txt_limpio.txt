and trade foreign affairs defense and trade division mark manyin analyst in asian affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division the kaesong northsouth korean industrial complex summary this purpose of this report is to provide an overview of the role purposes and results of the kaesong industrial complex kic and examine us interests policy issues options and legislation the kic is an industrial park located in the democratic peoples republic of korea dprk or north korea just across the demilitarized zone from south korea currently over 50 mediumsized south korean companies are using north korean labor to manufacture products in kaesong but projections are for as many 2000 firms to locate there the complex was planned developed and financed largely by south korea and it has become symbol of the growing level of engagement between the north and the south the united states officially supports the kic the kic enters into the us policy debate because 1 south korea would like the united states to consider products made in the kic as south korean in origin for purposes of the koreaus free trade agreement korus fta 2 the kic has become growing source of foreign exchange for the communist government in pyongyang 3 the kic is part of the strategy by south korea to ease tensions with north korea 4 the kic is part of the dprks economic reforms similar to chinas special economic zones that could lead to greater liberalization in the rest of its economy 5 the kic raises issues of security human rights and working conditions in north korea and 6 us government approval is needed for south korean firms to ship to the kic certain usmade equipment currently under us export controls the language of the proposed korus fta signed but not yet approved by congress does not provide for dutyfree entry into the united states for products made in kaesong annex 22b to the proposed fta however provides for committee on outward processing zones opz to be formed and to designate zones such as the kic to receive preferential treatment under the fta such designation apparently would require legislative approval by both countries the fundamental issue with respect to the kic is whether the united states should support project that provides revenue to the kim jongil regime in pyongyang considering the regimes nuclear and human rights policies and that includes questionable labor practices even though the project seems to be enhancing cooperation between south korea and the dprk lowering labor costs for korean businesses and providing possible beachhead for market reforms in the dprk us policy options include maintaining the status quo of supporting but not actively promoting the kic using the debate over the korus fta to focus attention on labor and other conditions in the kic encouraging reforms in the kic providing close oversight to the committee on outward processing zones if formed tightening or loosening sanctions and export controls with respect to the dprk encouraging or prohibiting us companies from doing business in the kic placing restrictions on south korean companies that do business in north korea and encouraging other

trade relations status most favored nation status so products made in north korea currently are assessed the high tariff rates of the 1930s column two in the us harmonized tariff schedule when they enter the us market for example womans cotton suit hs code 62041200 from south korea currently is assessed us tariff of 149 while the tariff on comparable item from north korea is 90 under the proposed korus fta the tariff on this item for south korea would be eliminated but even if it were allowed to be imported from the dprk its tariff rate would remain at 90 the language of the korus fta signed by representatives of each government but not yet approved by congress does not provide for dutyfree entry into the united states for products made in kaesong the office of the us trade representative has been clear that the agreement does not include goods from the kic3 annex 22b to the proposed fta however provides for committee on outward processing zones opz to be formed this committee is to meet annually to consider identifying geographical areas that may be designated as outward processing zones and whose products could qualify as goods originating in south korea the committee would establish criteria to be met to include but not be limited to progress toward denuclearization of the korean peninsula the impact of the outward processing zones on intrakorean relations and the environmental standards labor standards and practices wage practices and business and management practices prevailing in the outward processing zone with due reference to the situation prevailing elsewhere in the local economy and the relevant international norms decisions reached by the unified consent of the committee are to be recommended to the parties to the agreement

that provides revenue to the kim jongil regime in pyongyang considering the regimes nuclear and human rights policies and that includes questionable labor practices even though the project seems to be enhancing cooperation between the dprk and south korea lowering labor costs for south korean businesses and providing possible beachhead for market reforms in the dprk the future course of the kaesong industrial complex could undergo some changes as result of the december 2007 victory of lee myungbak in south koreas presidential election lee who will take office at the end of february 2008 has indicated he generally will seek more reciprocity from pyongyang in non humanitarian interkorean cooperation programs and that he will link future large scale economic programs to progress on the north korean nuclear issue and will also weigh heavily the financial costs of these programs statements from his transition team members indicate that the new administration plan to continue projects that are commercially viable both presidentelect lee and his transition team have been somewhat vague on what these principles would mean for the kic however the incoming administration has indicated it will not suspend the kic4 if this proves to be the lee governments policy major question for the future will be whether the lee government would support major expansion of the kic one policy shift that may occur according to some south koreans who have contacts with the transition team is that lee may seek to raise the commercial focus of the kic by reducing the governments involvement in running the complex5 us policy options include maintaining the status quo of supporting but not actively promoting the kic using the debate over the korus fta to focus attention on labor and other conditions in the kic encouraging reforms in the kic providing close oversight to the committee on outward processing zones if formed tightening or loosening sanctions and export controls with respect to the dprk encouraging or prohibiting us companies from doing business in the kic placing restrictions on south korean companies that do business in north korea and encouraging other countries to or not to include the kic in their respective ftas with south korea the development of the kaesong industrial complex the kic resulted from an initiative led by the hyundai group beginning in 1998 that

could manufacture products using north korean labor provide an opening for north korea to liberalize and reform its economy and ease tensions across the dmz although begun primarily as private sector venture both governments are heavily involved in the project groundbreaking occurred in june 2003 and again in april 2004 hyundai asan and the korea land corporation both from south korea have been developing and managing the complex south korean companies operating in kaesong receive certain incentives from the rok government and have certain rights as determined by negotiated agreements with

breakers in kaesong are not to go on trial in the north6 the corporate tax rate is 10 to 14 with an exemption for the first five years after generating profits and 50 reduction for the ensuing three

rates equal to those applied to public works projects these loans totaled about 40 million as of the end of 20057 out of the first 26 firms to either begin operations or contemplate beginning operations in the near term 25 of them applied for loans from the interkorea cooperation fund8 south korea also provides political risk insurance that will cover financial losses up to 90 of companys

south korean companies operating in the kic are doing so primarily for political purposes or whether their operations in the complex are economically viable also it is not clear whether companies in the complex would be economically viable without south korean government support in providing infrastructure and loans with belowmarket interest rates the kic does provide small and mediumsized businesses access to labor costs lower than those in china or vietnam workforce that speaks the same language and proximity to large markets in south korea some companies appear to be using production in kaesong to replace that in china south korea or elsewhere but others may be using governmentsubsidized loans and political risk insurance to invest in politically popular projects the long list of companies that have applied to enter the kic however indicates that investments there likely are seen as profitable for most businesses it also should be noted that an estimated 40 of the small and medium sized south korean companies that established operations in china have not been successful there many have withdrawn from that market the kic is viewed as essential for survival by some of these companies19 the experience of some of the early investors in kaesong may be indicative of the economic viability of the project shinwon clothing established operations in the kic to take advantage of the dexterity and lower cost of north korean workers favorable logistics and to avoid nontariff barriers in china and southeast asia by manufacturing about 16 of five of its clothing

authorities take portion as much as 45 of the wages paid by the south korean companies he noted that verified details are elusive and neither the dprk nor south korean government nor any company has been able to state definitively how much of his or her wage kaesong worker is allowed to keep23 according to south korean officials average wages and working conditions at kaesong are far better than

central special direct general bureau north korean government agency article 34 of the labor law of the kaesong industrial complex however states that wages must be paid directly to employees in cash the dprk claims that this is not being implemented now because of the lack of foreign exchange centers in the kic31 the rok ministry of unification has stated that of the 5750 minimum monthly salary 750 or 15 of the base pay goes for social insurance providing for unemployment and occupational hazards the government also deducts 15 or 30 for sociocultural policy fee that goes for rental of

closer to the complex according to the kic management council the health condition of workers at the kic has visibly improved as they have had access to better nutrition35 the actual recruitment of

recruit does not demonstrate the requisite skills eg sewing hire the worker as trainee at 70 or less of the minimum wage employers cannot freely punish or fire incompetent workers they must give

challenge during the startup phase of factory in the kic gradually however north korean workers begin to identify with the company and level of trust is developed between the south korean executives and the north korean managers and workers37 currently north korean workers do not have the right to change employers this promises to keep labor costs from escalating as they have in other developing markets as foreign firms bid for skilled workers this also provides companies in the kic with stable though aging workforce38 this practice however conflicts with what would be consistent with

earnings with 700 million derived directly from the operation of the kic 25 billion from sales of raw materials and other industrial products and 14 billion from corporate taxes42 considering that in international trade in goods in 2005 north korea exported 18 billion and imported 36 billion the estimated total gains of 955 billion over nine years associated with the kaesong industrial complex would be quite significant provided it progresses according to plan kaesong and the proposed koreaus free trade agreement during the negotiations on the korus fta south korea requested that products

provisions and implications coordinated by william h cooper crs14 at us house international relations committee hearing on july 20 2006 assistant us trade representative karan bhatia indicated that the proposed fta would not cover goods made in freetrade zone in north korea47 the text of the koreaus free trade agreement signed by representatives of each government but not yet approved by congress does not provide for dutyfree entry into the united states for products made in the kaesong industrial complex annex 22b to the proposed fta however provides for committee on outward processing zones opz on the korean peninsula to be formed and to identify geographic areas that may be designated outward processing zones determine whether any such zone has met the criteria established by the committee and recommend them to the respective governments which shall be responsible for seeking legislative approval for any amendments to the agreement with respect to outward processing zones the committee also is to establish maximum threshold for the value of the total input of the originating final good that may be added within the geographical area of the outward processing zone decisions of the committee would require unified consent this arguably provides the us side with veto power over any recommendation of the committee the criteria to be met include but are not limited to progress toward denuclearization of the korean peninsula the impact of the outward processing zones on intrakorean relations and the environmental standards labor standards and practices wage practices and business and management practices prevailing in the outward processing zone with due reference to the situation prevailing elsewhere in the local economy and the relevant international norms the opz committee is to meet at least annually beginning year after the agreement goes into effect question has arisen with respect to language in annex 22b pertaining to labor standards and practices in the kic with due reference to the situation prevailing elsewhere in the local economy and the relevant international norms is the local economy in this case that of the dprk or that of south korea and can products from the kic be produced under conditions contrary to international labor organization agreements that lay out basic international standards or worker rights yet still be recommended by the opz committee to be included under the fta48 another issue raised by the korus fta is whether intermediate products made in the kic can enter the united states under the provisions of the fta if they are incorporated into products that are manufactured in south korea and that qualify as originating in south korea the same concern exists with respect to products made in china or elsewhere if they have north korean inputs currently goods of north korean origin may not be imported into the united states either directly or 47 hyde warns ustr to keep kaesong

third countries without prior notification to and approval of the office of foreign assets control of the department of the treasury49 further issue with respect to the kic and the korus fta is that if kic products made with the lowcost north korean labor are allowed to be treated as south korean in origin under the proposed korus fta south korean exporters would enjoy large cost advantage over their counterparts in the united states the control of exports to kaesong the united states maintains comprehensive economic embargo against the dprk because of its designation as state sponsor of international terrorism the departments of commerce and the treasury jointly administer the trade embargo under the trading with the enemy act of 1917 and the export administration act the department of commerce licenses us exports and reexports while treasury grants general andor specific licenses for financial transactions by us persons with dprk entities the department of commerce requires license for the export to north korea of virtually all commodities technology and software except for technology generally available to the public and gift parcels not exceeding 40050 in fy2006 the us bureau of industry and security approved two items for export to the dprk they were glass fiber optic transmission items 5a991 worth 213919 and software 5d992 for 360051 the transmission items were telecommunications equipment used by korea telecom in setting up the communications lines between the two koreas and into the kic52 the south korean government also maintains strict controls over exports to the dprk the restricted items include machinery and inspection equipment to produce metal and machines electronics optics laserrelated equipment microorganism cultivating devices and chemical product facilities and sophisticated hightechnology equipment and materials even the latest versions of personal computers commonly available in the south are restricted and if their export is approved they have to be kept under lock and key in the kic53 new hightechnology monitoring systems including tracking devices are also being used for items with sensitive dualuse technology 49 us

crs16 in the october 2007 summit between south korean president roh moohyun and north korean leader kim jongil the north agreed to improvements in how kaesong operates including swifter customs clearance for goods crossing its border and better computer and cellphone communications connections between seoul and kaesong factories the transition team of incoming president lee myungbak has indicated that it likely will continue with these plans54 longterm geopolitical and economic issues the kaesong industrial complex sits at the hub of spreading concentric sets of economic and geopolitical interests and concerns at its narrowest sense the kic is business venture in which participants are seeking profits and business advantages on the south korean side the kic provides small and mediumsized companies with manufacturing platform and opportunity to access lowcost labor without having to go overseas to establish subsidiaries or to outsource the assembly of their products to china or other markets on the dprk side the kic provides jobs for workers who can earn relatively higher wages without crossing their borders illegally or working under contract in laborscarce countries such as those in the russian far east or in middle eastern countries at somewhat wider set of interests the kic provides channel for rapproachment between the dprk and south korea kaesong developed partly from south koreas sunshine policy of economic engagement with the north it can be viewed as confidencebuilding measure between two countries whose hostility toward each other has lingered since the 195052 korean war as has been the case with the extensive economic interchange between china and taiwan55 the kic may provide bridge for communication and catalyst for cultural interaction and it can create stakeholders in each others economies with shared interest in stability liberalization and increased communication across the dmz at still wider set of interests the kic may be the proverbial camels nose under the tent in attempts to reform liberalize and modernize the north korean economy in neighboring china in 1978 foreign businesses were first allowed to operate in special economic zones now foreign invested businesses generate more than half of chinas exports and imports the chinese speak of practicing socialism with chinese characteristics and indeed many stateowned enterprises still encumber the chinese economic system the stateowned enterprises that are successful however operate much like privately owned enterprises and one is hard pressed to find other significant differences between the chinese brand of socialism and market capitalism in january 2006 kim jongil paid his fourth visit to china to see its special economic zones there he observed modern hightechnology 54 ahn yonghyun lee govt to postpone some interkorean mega projects chosun ilbo january 8 2007 55 for discussion of this issue see crs report rl32882 the rise of china and its effect on taiwan japan and south korea us policy choices by dick k nanto and emma chanlettavery crs17 factories many of them foreignowned in operation56 likewise the kic exposes average north koreans to modern business methods and to the accouterments of western industrial society according to the economist intelligence unit the decrepit north korean economy has three crying needs deeper market reforms greater openness and above all massive investment to modernize decrepit plant and infrastructure57 the kic potentially addresses all three of these needs to limited extent however reports from north korea indicate that the economic reforms there currently are stalled even being reversed unlike chinas reforms moreover the initiative for the kic came from abroad is viewed with suspicion by many and is an isolated case although pyongyang seems to be attempting to revive the sinuiju special administrative region similar free trade zone along the border with china58 in sum it is still too early to tell if kaesong will succeed much less have large effect on the rest of the north korean economy at geopolitical level kaesong is one part of the standoff between the dprk and the united states china south korea japan and russia over north koreas nuclear weapons program under the rubric of the sixparty talks lie bundle of strategic issues such as the ability of north korea to finance its nuclear program the need for humanitarian and energy aid the stability of the kim jongil regime and the enforcement of various economic sanctions being applied to north korea major goal of the united states in the sixparty talks is to halt and verifiably dismantle north koreas capability to produce nuclear fuel and nuclear bombs or to proliferate nuclear material or technology to potentially hostile countries or groups the us strategy to accomplish this is combination of sticks sanctions diplomatic isolation name calling and carrots promises of aid diplomatic recognition security guarantees conveyed to north korea through the sixparty talks bilateral meetings and occasional media blasts under this strategy there is little reason to provide the dprk with any financial reward even if it is to the benefit of south korea unless it shows significant progress in its commitments under the sixparty talks the south korean goals with respect to north korea however not only include the denuclearization of the korean peninsula but eventual reunification and reconstruction of the dprks economy major south korean concern is the potential cost of reunification either in the form of flood of economic emigrants to the south or in actual budgetary outlays to help rebuild the norths civilian economy the high cost to west germany of the integration of east germany after the fall of the berlin wall has provided little comfort to the policy makers in seoul the south korean strategy therefore has tended to be longer on carrots promises of food fuel and fertilizer and shorter on sticks sanctions with heavy reliance on engagement across the interactive spectrum and on diplomacy to resolve the issue even after the 56 see for example onishi norimitsu on his visit to china kim traveled familiar path the new york times january 26 2006 57 the economist intelligence unit country report north korea may 2007 p 13 58 institute for far eastern studies interest revived in the sinuiju special administrative region reported by nautilus institute policy forum online 0625a march 30 2006 crs18 north korean nuclear test in 2006 south korea continued the kic operations it only halted its plans to call for new applicants to enter the kic existing production facilities continued to manufacture and existing applications moved forward although incoming rok president lee myungbak has said he will seek more reciprocity in seouls dealings with pyongyang and he has been somewhat vague about how he will treat the kic his statements to date have been widely interpreted to mean that phase 1 of the complex at minimum will continue operating undoubtedly the kic would be centerpiece of if lee enacts his proposed 3000 policy to help north korea raise per capita income to 3000 in ten years lee has made this policy contingent upon progress in the denuclearization of north korea for south korea not only does kaesong provide entry into the decrepit dprk economy but it is key factor in building up and reforming the economy in the north with an eye toward eventual reunification beijings strategy before the return of hong kong in 1997 has been instructive to seoul major reason that many of the first economic reforms in china occurred in nearby guangdong province particularly just across the border from hong kong in shenzhen city was that beijing tried to stem pressures to immigrate to hong kong by raising the standard of living and industrial development in the region abutting the returning territory this strategy has been so successful that some immigration particularly of hong kong retirees has been going from hong kong to guangdong province and not the other way around likewise beijing has broadened ties with taiwan through allowing cross strait investments travel business visas communication and other businessbased activities in some sectors particularly in the manufacture of computers and other electronic products taiwan and the east coast of china have become one integrated economy kaesong arguably could begin similar process with north korea south korea also aims to become hub of east asia in order to accomplish this it would like to be connected to china russia and to europe via railways that pass through north korea as part of the kic project north and south korea have reconnected railroad line connecting the north and south and have conducted test run on it second line on the opposite side of the peninsula also was connected in terms of logistics shipment by rail from south korea via kaesong to hamburg germany would take about 27 days by ship 10 days via the transsiberian railway and 7 days via the transchina railway59 see figure 3 59 hyundai asan kaesong industrial park brochure c 2006 crs19 figure 3 kaesongs potential logistical role source hyundai asan us interests and policy options the three national interests of the united states that form the basis of all policy discussion are security economic wellbeing and value projection these three national interests all play into consideration of the kaesong industrial complex the main security concern for the united states is the location of the kic in the dprk us security concerns with respect to north korea center on two major considerations 1 the dprks nuclear program and 2 potential conflict across the dmz separating north korea and south korea the kic has opposing effects upon these security considerations on one hand since income in any country is fungible anything that increases revenue to the pyongyang regime has the potential to contribute to the dprks military including its missile and nuclear program it is likely however that the dprks nuclear program has assured funding from the government also given kim jongils military first policy the north korean military has top priority in the allocation of scarce economic resources it also has call on certain economic activities and government subsidies for them it is not clear how much if any income over that used to pay for expenses related to kaesong for pyongyang from the kic currently is directed toward the dprk military or nuclear program since the kic land formerly was military base that had to be vacated60 some arrangement may have been made to compensate the military for relinquishing strategically important piece of ground even if the income from the kic does not 60 lim eulchul kaesong industrial complex history pending issues and outlook seoul haenam publishing company 2006 p 37 crs20 go directly into military purposes it may bolster funds for civilian purposes that had been cut because of the budgetary demands of the military the kim regime moreover uses scarce foreign exchange to bolster the loyalty of its inner circle of elites who use it to buy imported luxury goods security council resolution 1718 adopted october 2006 explicitly prohibits any member state from providing funds that go to support north koreas nuclear weapons program the resolution states in section 8d that all member states shall in accordance with their respective legal processes ensure that any funds financial assets or economic resources are prevented from being made available by their nationals or by any persons or entities within their territories to or for the benefit of persons or entities engaged in or providing support for the dprks programs related to nuclear weapons other weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile related programs as for tensions across the dmz the kic already has played an important role in increasing the level of engagement between the dprk and south korea and in raising the priority of economic activity relative to security concerns even though the border between north korea and south korea is heavily guarded and crossings had been rare the military on both sides have acquiesced to the daily traffic on the northsouth highway to kaesong and the reconnection of two railways across the dmz along with limited tourist visits and family reunions in terms of the second us national interest of economic wellbeing the kic currently has little relevance although it has some effect through us trade and investment relations with south korea us companies have investments in kaesong and us trade with north korea in 2007 was virtually nonexistent south korea however is the seventh largest trading partner of the united states and the united states is south koreas third largest trading partner if the sixparty talks on the denuclearization of the korean peninsula were to progress far enough the united states could reestablish diplomatic relations with the dprk lift economic sanctions and eventually grant that country normal trade relations mostfavored nation status if so trade with north korea could be done on the same basis as trade with most other countries of the world absent that development south koreas request to treat products made in the kic as south korean in origin would seem to be the only way to bring the kic into the set of industrial locations open to normal or preferential trade with the united states meanwhile south korean companies exporting kic products likely will continue to avoid the us market rather than face economic sanctions and high us tariffs this may give countries that include the kic in their ftas with south korea such as asean and efta and possibly the european union possible small diplomatic advantage over the united states in dealing with seoul moreover south korea is likely to press the united states to change its kic policy this could be source of future usrok tension even if the korus fta is passed the third us national interest is projecting us values such as marketbased economy representative government and nations adhering to world standards for working conditions environmental regulation and other humanitarian considerations in this respect the kic potentially could play significant role as demonstration project to educate north koreans on the workings of marketbased crs21 economy the kic provides an opportunity for businesses to operate in north korea according to what may be higher labor and environmental standards than exist in the rest of the country and to educate north korean middle managers on how such standards work currently the 20000 north koreans employed in the kic are too few and the project too small to have significant impact on the development of the north korean middle class factor in the development of more representative society and the number of the elites in the dprk with an economic interest in the complex probably is still relatively small if the project continues to develop and the dprk opens other freetrade zones however something akin to the economic reforms in china or the economic transformation that is now occurring in vietnam61 could occur in north korea this could weaken the hold by pyongyang on the daily lives of citizens and bring the country more into the globalized world such economic liberalization also could reduce pressures on north korea to engage in illicit trade in order to cover its trade deficit62 and diminish the need for pyongyang to saber rattle in order to divert attention from its domestic problems in the short run however increased revenues strengthen the regimes hand and make it less vulnerable to outside pressure also spillover effects will depend on north korea adding much more value to the production processes which it has yet to do finally there is some question about the extent to which kic is commercially viable or whether incentives and supports given to south korean firms are critical as opposed to marginal in their profit and loss calculations trade between the dprk and south korea tends to be governmentbased in contrast to trade between china and north korea this may blunt the lessons learned by pyongyang the united states currently has mixed policy with respect to the kic since south korea is close ally of the united states washington has been supportive of efforts by south korea to engage the north in interkorean projects that benefit south korea on the other hand the united states has been firm in predicating any economic or other concessions on actions by the dprk to curtail or eliminate its nuclear program major policy considerations and options for congress given the above us interests include the following in considering whether or not to approve the korus fta congress may express its support or nonsupport of the exclusion of the kic from the fta as negotiated congress may also specify the conditions under which the kic can or can not be brought under the provisions of the proposed fta congressional disapproval of the proposed korus fta likely would have large negative impact on prospects for the future of the kic with respect to the united states 61 see for example bradsher keith vietnams roaring economy is set for world stage the new york times october 25 2006 62 see for example crs report rl33885 north korean crimeforprofit activities by liana sun wyler and dick k nanto crs22 in the debate over the korus fta congress may focus attention on labor and other conditions in the kic and encourage reforms if the korus fta is approved congress may provide close oversight of the committee on outward processing zones since the united states already imposes range of economic and financial sanctions on the dprk the united states could either tighten or loosen them this could affect nonsouth korean businesses in determining whether to invest in the kic or to purchase products made there the united states also could tighten or loosen us controls on the export of dualuse technology items to the kic the united states could impose restrictions on or provide inducements to us business activity in kic the us government could encourage other countries or groups of countries such as the european union to or not to include the kic in their respective ftas with south korea if the dprk takes the necessary steps to halt its nuclear program as outlined in the sixparty talks support or oppose measures leading toward normal trading relations status for the dprk and the lifting of economic sanctions the us government could place restrictions on south korean firms that do business in north korea legislation legislation and other
