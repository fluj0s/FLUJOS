was reported out of the senate health education labor and pensions committee on march 29 2007 and is currently awaiting senate action this report compares the provisions of hr 493 and s 358 relating to ginas prohibition of genetic discrimination in employment1 overview of differences in s 358 and hr 493 both the house and senate versions of gina prohibit discrimination in employment because of genetic information and with certain exceptions prohibit an employer from requesting requiring or purchasing genetic information the house and senate versions of gina are similar in many respects however there are several significant differences for example the employment sections of the bills contain differing versions of the definitions of family member2 and genetic information3 generally where the employment provisions describe unlawful employment practices s 358 includes prohibition against discrimination on the basis of information about request for or the receipt of genetic services by such employee or family member of such employee4 whereas the house version does not explicitly include this prohibition the house bill contains an exception to the prohibition of discrimination regarding dna analysis for law enforcement purposes5 which does not have parallel provision in the senate bill 1 all references to the house and senate bills are to s 358 as reported
