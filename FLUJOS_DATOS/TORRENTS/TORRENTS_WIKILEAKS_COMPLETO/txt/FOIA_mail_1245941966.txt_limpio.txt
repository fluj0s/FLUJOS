from nick pepin nicholaspepinportacuk to phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject re fwd cru surface temperature dataset date thu 25 jun 2009 105926 0100 phil thanks for this great detail i am thinking that probably raw radiosonde dataset may be better i tried this before using the lks dataset but station density was an issue and only ended up with around 20 station pairs it sounds as though things have improved dramatically in that area and will look at the sources you suggest my hope is that at least i can find hundredsthousands of stations near to my high elevation surface ones for comparison if not i could interpolate spatially maybe between radiosondes to my surface sites since freeair climate not meteorology should be relatively smooth in space i cannot interpolate between surface stations i agree that reanalyses can be can of worms esp ncepncar as for the surface ill also look at the site you suggest and get back if i have any qproblems i appreciate the time you have taken to answer some of my q best wishes nick phil jones pjonesueaacuk 24062009 1309 nick i dont want to put off but there is an awful lot of things wrong with ncepncar they are probably ok for monthtomonth variability but if you look at some of the figures in simmons et 2004 youll see that for trends they are practically useless before 1979 there is just so much wrong with the sondes which together with the introduction of satellite data in 19789 makes reanalyses awful the simmons paper is about how much better era40 is than ncepncar it is also telling you that you shouldnt be using ncepncar for trends and era40 is only ok in europe and north america group of us are hopeful of getting an eu project funded to go through the reanalysis input surface and sonde the aim is to put in all the homogenised surface and sonde data so giving reanalysis better data input and putting back all the data that missed the realtime cut im not sure youre aware that back data have ever got into the reanalyses if data doesnt make the cut in real time it can never get in later the reanalysis source input doesnt collect back data youd be better off getting one of the newer sonde datasets hadat2 although developed in 2005 is beyond its sellby date have look at the attached and this web site httphomepageunivieacatleopoldhaimbergerleowebindexhtml raob core version 14 is the latest the drop off in surface data isnt the fault of ghcnv2 the folks in asheville are doing all they can to get additional datasets currently about 2000 sites are exchanged in real time if the sites you want are not exchanged by met services in real time we cant get access to them except by asking each met service andor waiting till the next volumes of the 10year books for 20012010 get released crutem3 has some additional station data going in for australia and canada but apart from this we will have nothing more than ghcnv2 we could get load more from the us quite easily but coverage is reasonable there compared to the rest of the world ghcnv2 and ourselves have lots of historic series but these arent updatable in real time without continuous effort lots of projects were funded in the us and europe in the 1980s and 1990s to get loads of data digitized homogenized and accessible it is possible to do things with daily data synops but these are only generally good enough for the good countries httpwwwdwddebvbwappmanagerbvbwdwdwwwdesktop_nfpbtrueswitchlangen_pagelabel_dwdwww_klima_umwelt_datenzentren_gsnmc this site has what is available in real time since 2001 this site can be very annoying there is link back to ncdc cheers phil cheers phil at 1748 23062009 you wrote phil many thanks for your reply this is very helpful esp the simmons paper i am aware there are issues with reanalyses although i do want to try and use data representative of free air and not contaminated with surface obs hence ncepncar rather than era40 maybe and use of pressure level data rather than 2 m or surface reanalysis temps which i think the simmons paper is about i dont want the reanalysis to respond to surface issues and want it to be independent purely based on radiosonde and satellite coupled with modelling of course this doesnt make the points irrelevant and i am looking at these while deciding what to use as regards surface data i am interested in the tmean you mention used for crutem3 is this available and for how many stations ghcnv2 is not good after 1990 since many stations stop it is particularly dire after 2005 as you may realise please let know what you think best wishes and thanks for your help re this nick phil jones pjonesueaacuk 22062009 1038 nick i was away when your earlier message can in march and i must have forgotten it when i got back to norwich we generally only put the gridded data on the web site the station data that goes into crutem3 is only monthly mean temperature it is only since the mid1990s that countries have routinely exchanged monthly mean tx and tn data many countries dont use these data to calculate mean t instead using their historical methods based on fixed hours we do have an archive of historic tx and tn monthly but this is almost entirely based on ghcnv2 sources we use these data in products like this paper mitchell td and jones pd 2005 an improved method of constructing database of monthly climate observations and associated highresolution grids int j climatol 25 693712 when you compare with reanalysis trends you want to consider looking at erainterim available from 19892008 there are also longer reanalysis products developed by noaa gil compo from surface station data only ie sondes and satellites so consistent through time are you aware of this paper basically reanalyses will be wrong before 1979 except possibly in europe and north america this paper has the reasons why reanalyses will be wrong cheers phil at 1506 17062009 you wrote dear prof jones you maybe had forgotten that i emailed you while ago march asking about access to data for surface stations for work on temperature trends in complex topography original email and details below since then i have been awarded royal society travel grant to do some work on this in the us and i will be examining the ghcnv2 dataset in detail which i have i would really like to be able to include cru dataset as well since i did this in my original research and these datasets are highly regarded if you are not the correct person to ask maybe you could guide to the right person many thanks for your reply best wishes nick pepin nick pepin 09032009 1643 dear prof jones you may remember that few years ago 2005 i published paper with dian seidel looking at temperature trends at high elevation surface stations and comparing them with reanalysis trends i wish to update this work as part of another project and was looking on the uea website to see if any of the original stations have been updated it is important that they are homogeneity adjusted as much as possible it appears that nearly all of the datasets available on the web are gridded and therefore interpolated which i dont want since interpolation influences what i am examining are any of the 3000 approx original stations available mean monthly maxima and minima are good enough which are used to create crutem3 etc in my original analysis i combined data from the cru station dataset and ghcn some stations were in both and i would like to do the same again if possible this is part of work looking at the effect of topography on temperature trend patterns on global scale it will be more detailed than preliminary work on this in the attached paper many thanks for your help best wishes nick pepin prof phil jones climatic research unit telephone 44 0 1603 592090 school of
