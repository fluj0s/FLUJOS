the united states from oil price shocks marc labonte economist government and finance division gail makinen specialist in economic policy government and finance division summary over the past 25 years the us economy has experienced four large oil price shocks 197374 197980 199091 and 19992001 each has been catalyst for discussions about proper national energy policy many analysts have suggested that energy independence should be an integral part of such policy both major parties have sponsored legislation to that end however us suppliers of energy participate in the world energy market so long as prices are determined in that market energy independence will not free the united states from oil price shocks by contrast if an energy independent us longer participated in the world market prices would become less volatile but would likely be higher than at their current peak alternative energy sources cannot shield the us economy from the oil price entirely but increased energy efficiency has reduced and can continue to reduce the effect of these shocks on the overall economy such efficiencies have been achieved over the past 25 years and as result the 19992001 oil price shock has likely had smaller effect than those of the past this paper will be updated as events warrant over the past 25 years the united states and the rest of the world has been subjected to four major oil price shocks 197374 197980 199091 and 19992001 as shown in figure 1 on monthly basis oil prices rose from 10barrel in december 1998 to high of 34 in november 2000 since then prices have fallen considerably as can be seen in figure 1 the latest price rise was not nearly as drastic as in the first two oil shocks nevertheless while the shocks have varied in magnitude each has been catalyst for national debate over the essentials of proper energy policy and energy independence has loomed large in that debate the most recent price rise has been exception both parties have sponsored legislation whose stated goal is to reduce dependence on foreign oil by some large fraction including hr4 which passed the house on august 1 2001 and s883 in fact an argument for energy independence has been an integral part of congressional research service the library of congress crs2 recommendations for national energy policy at least since the time of the first oil price shock 197374 yet the petroleum market is not national rather the market is international and the price is set internationally even though what we do here in the united states can have an important effect on that price figure 1 us real yearly oil price 70 60 refiner acquisition cost 50 40 30 20 10 0 1970 1973 1976 1979 1982 1985 1988 1991 1994 1997 2000 year source energy information administration note average yearly refiner acquisition cost measured in constant 2000 dollars american energy policy since price and other controls imposed in the 1970s were removed us energy policy has primarily relied on the market the relatively unhindered forces of supply and demand are allowed to determine the prices of different energy sources and the public has been allowed to access any energy source for consumption the rationale for this policy is that market prices best reflect the relative scarcity to society of the energy source in question reliance on the market as an energy policy is justified on the grounds that it results in economically efficient decisionmaking furthermore because the market ensures that petroleum will be supplied by the most efficient producers it delivers the lowest price to us consumers on average this overall reliance on the market has not prevented the federal government from playing an active role the government has sought to increase the supply of alternative fuels by promoting such petroleum substitutes as gasohol it has also sought to reduce the demand for energy by mandating fuel efficiency standards for motor vehicles and appliances and by providing subsidies to individuals to better insulate homes among other things crs3 moreover there are conceptual objections to totally marketbased national energy policy they rest on the argument that while market prices may incorporate all the relevant costs to the individual they may fail to incorporate those that are relevant to the nation there may be environmental concerns that the market price does not capture market prices may also fail to incorporate premium to help counteract any unacceptable foreign influence on us foreign and domestic policies for example this reliance could affect national security in event of an armed conflict considerations such as these explain the existence and have conditioned the recent use of the strategic petroleum reserve finally since oil supply shocks are seldom anticipated market prices can rise dramatically when they occur when prices do rise suddenly and sharply in the short run they can be disruptive and in the past have had measurable effect on gdp employment and inflation since oil is an important input in the production and transport of most goods rise in the price of oil raises the cost of production for producers this effect will be felt by producers using alternate energy sources as well if those prices also rise what makes supply shock so difficult for policymakers to respond to is the fact that it reduces economic output and raises the price level in the short run holding all else equal if prices were perfectly flexible producers could lower their other input prices such as wages leaving aggregate output and the aggregate price level the same there would be reduction in output or increase in the price level in the short run1 but if we live in world of sticky prices2 as common observation suggests we do then producers cannot lower their other input prices quickly and so must pass part of the price rise on to consumers as result output falls as people are willing to buy fewer goods at the now higher prices since the price of labor is now too relatively high to be compatible with the higher oil price some employers may need to lay off some of their workers with fewer workers employed less output can be produced in effect the rise in the price of oil and the inability of other prices to adjust temporarily reduce the rate of growth of output that the economy can produce since producers have to pass part of the oil price rise on to consumers by raising the price of their goods the general price level temporarily rises as well when prices adjust in the long run as economists argue that they will the decline in output will end the supply shock causes real longrun change in the economys overall productive capabilities merely reallocation of resources3 that makes some individuals such as oil producers better off and some such as consumers worse off4 but until overall prices have fully adjusted the economy will suffer from 1 for more comprehensive discussion of the effects of petroleum price increase on the us economy see crs report rl30634 rising oil prices what dangers do they pose for the economy by marc labonte 2 wage contracts publication subscriptions and items from catalogs are three examples of prices that are believed to be particularly sticky or relatively difficult to adjust in the short run 3 some economists have theorized that the costliness of this reallocation of resources is the characteristic of an oil shock that has the greatest impact on the economy rather than the price adjustment problem 4 what is not captured in this simple model is the role that overreaction played in the first two oil shocks caused by shortages and political uncertainty prevalent in the first two shocks first since consumer confidence is an important determinant of aggregate demand an overreaction may have continued crs4 lower rate of growth in output and higher price level since majority of our oil is purchased abroad the adjustment process is likely to take longer than usual thus an argument exists even in the context of policy that places primary reliance on the market for an energy strategy that may not be strictly market driven the goal of such policy would be to reduce the volatility of energy prices not to reduce average energy prices tradeoff can be made between market efficiency on one hand and enhanced security and economic stability on the other hand the essential question remains if the tradeoff is desirable is energy independence policy that could successfully render the united states either immune or less vulnerable to oil price shocks would energy independence isolate the us economy from energy price shocks to answer this question let us use counterfactual reasoning we will suppose that during the three major oil shocks oil prices rose exactly as they did the only factual change will be to suppose that the united states was energy independent in the sense that it did not import any oil from abroad under these altered circumstances would the us economy have been immune from the rise in world oil prices the answer is quite simply to see why consider what would happen when oil prices outside the us rose with world oil prices rising above the us price us producers would have an incentive to sell their oil in foreign markets as us supplies were diverted from domestic to foreign markets situation would be created in the united states in which demand exceeded supply this excess demand would then cause the us price of oil to rise to restore balance or equilibrium between us demand and supply the end result of the oil supply shock even if it was caused by the behavior of opec would be higher domestic price of oil just as if the us had been an oil importer the major difference would be that in the counter factual case in which the united states was assumed to be selfsufficient in oil it would now be an oil exporter5 the only way to isolate the us economy from supply disruptions abroad under the counter factual situation posited above would be to forbid the exportation of oil ie its diversion from domestic to foreign markets and to prohibit domestic oil companies from raising prices6 but we do not live in the counter factual world since net oil imports have 4 continued reduced aggregate demand in the short run thereby aggravating the decline in output caused by the supply shock second overreaction may have led to individuals and businesses using resources in inefficient activities such as hoarding and queuing which could reduce their productivity and thus aggregate output 5 recent history has provided another interesting example in which national behavior is similar and unrelated to the status of energy independence in july and august 2000 french citizens demonstrated in protest to the run up in gasoline prices france is an oil importing country shortly thereafter in september 2000 similar agitation swept the united kingdom the united kingdom is not only selfsufficient in oil but is an oil exporting nation 6 the only other theoretical alternative to banning exports would be for us producers to meet not continued crs5 accounted for about 50 of us consumption in recent years such policy were it to be implemented would lead to shortages unless domestic oil prices were allowed to rise much higher than at present this is because oil extraction in the united states on large enough scale to meet our energy needs is much too costly to compete with foreign producers for this reason withdrawal from the world market would likely imply price that was less volatile in the long run but even higher than prices at their recent peak indeed even if the us were able to use only alternative energy sources the shock could have some effect on the economy assuming the shock lasted for significant period of time foreign nations adversely affected by the shock would shift some of their consumption to alternative energy sources the demand for these sources of energy would rise raising their prices and us suppliers would divert their output to the world market creating situation in which domestic demand exceeded domestic supply the resulting excess demand in the united states would then force up the domestic price of any substitutes for oil thus ultimately to some degree the original oil price shock would reach the united states although its effect on the economy would be smaller its magnitude would depend on the extent to which alternative energy sources were substitutes for oil and are exportable from the united states would greater energy efficiency free the us from oil shocks the us economy is far more energy efficient than it was in 197374 as seen in figure 2 the increase in the real price of oil in particular and energy in general led to moves that increased the energy efficiency of the economy while many of these changes resulted from the way an economy would respond to an increase in real energy prices others such as mandated federal gasoline mileage standards for automobiles resulted from legislation energy efficiency is often touted on environmental grounds but there is purely macroeconomic argument for greater efficiency the more energyefficient an economy the smaller the likely effect from given oil price or energy shock oil shocks reduce economic output and increase prices by raising the cost of one portion of producers inputs when producer becomes more energy efficient fewer of his inputs are affected by an oil shock therefore less economic adjustment needs to take place7 thus policies to make the economy more energy efficient are likely to pay dividends in terms of reducing the effects of oil price shocks on the economy indeed greater energy efficiency is part of the reason that output is likely to contract less and inflation has risen less in the current recession than in the recessions of 19731975 and 19801982 and the benefits of energy efficiency do not rely on greater energy independence whether the united states imported none or all of its oil greater energy efficiency still implies that sudden increase in oil prices will cause proportionately smaller disruption to output 6 continued only domestic consumption needs but enough of world consumption to break opecs market power which would imply domestic production on an even greater scale 7 it is worth stressing again that the macroeconomic goal of greater energy efficiency is to promote less volatility in the overall economy not to promote lower oil prices crs6 figure 2 us energy consumption per dollar of output 16 thousand btu per 2000 dollar 14 12 10 8 6 1973 1977 1981 1985 1989 1993 1997 2001 year source energy information administration note petroleum and natural gas consumed per 2000 constant dollar of gdp energy independence the analysis in this report suggests that the united states cannot avoid the consequences of price shocks through policy of energy independence even if that policy could lead to the us again being net exporter of oil that is because the price of oil is set in an international market on the basis of world supply and demand the laws of international supply and demand can only be avoided if us consumers and producers were legally forbidden from accessing the international market but the result would likely be oil prices that were higher albeit less volatile than at the peak of the latest price spike while policy that encouraged alternative energy sources would moderate the effects of an international oil price shock it would not make the us economy immune because foreigners would substitute alternative energy sources for oil greater energy efficiency by lessening the energy input to produce unit of output could also moderate the effect of future shocks on the economy american economic activity as measured by gross domestic product gdp has become less dependent on energy since the first oil price and this is one reasons why the runup in oil prices during 19992001 has not affected the economy as greatly as the three previous shocks for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20727
