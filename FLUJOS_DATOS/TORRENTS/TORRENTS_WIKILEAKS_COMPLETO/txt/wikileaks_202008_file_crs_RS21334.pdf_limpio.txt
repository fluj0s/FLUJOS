stat 719301 to 719307smith v doe one of the complainants in smith the alaska case was convicted of sexually abusing his minor da ughter after his release fro m prison state court awarded him custody of his daughter based in part upon psychiatric evidence that he was not pedophile and was very low risk of reoffe nding 259 f3d at 983 alaska then passed its sexual offender registration w he and his wife sued st ate officials in federal court under 42 usc 1983 alleging that application of the statute would constitute violation of the ex post facto and due process clauses of the united states constitution the district court granted the states motion for summary judgment the ninth circuit reversed holding that the alaska statute had to be considered punitive and that consequently the ex post facto clause barred the laws retr oactive application 259 f3d at 98595 the finding made resolution of the due pro cess issues unnecessary 259 f3d at 995 the united states supreme court granted certio rari 534 us 1126 2002 and rejected the ninth circuit conclusion that retroactive application of th alaska sora statute would offend the ex post facto clause justice kennedy in the opinion for the cour t joined by chief justice rehnquist and justices oconnor scalia and thomas held th ex post facto clause inapplicable because the statute in question was intended to create civil regulatory scheme and not as punishment and because it was not so punitive in pur pose or effect as to negate that intent 123 sct at 1154 justice thomas although joining the opinion of the court submitted concurring opinion to emphasize his view th at ex post clause analysis should be limited to the terms of the statute and should not weigh the punitive impact of administrative decisions made for its implementation like the decision here to provide notification through the internet 123 sct at 1154 justice souter concurred in the result but found the question of punitive purpose or effect so closely stated that only the presumption of constitutionality to which state law is entitled saved the alaska sora from ex pos t facto infirmity 123 sct at 1156 justice ginsburg with whom justice breyer agree d and justice stevens in separate opinion consider the alaska sora scheme punitive and therefore would have held that the ex post facto clause precluded its retroactive application 123 sct at 1158 stevens j dissenting 123 sct at 1160 ginsburg breyer jj dissenting the court began its examination with the observation that the ex post facto clause obviously applies only to the criminal statut 123 sct at 1147 the matter of whether statute is criminal or civil and regulatory in nature may be discerned by its language andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21334crs3 2 justice souter not only agreed with the cour t that there is evidence pointing to an intended civil characterization of the act but also saw considerable evidence pointing the other way the legislature had not designated the procedur civil and its obligations turned exclusive upon prior criminal conviction and in justice s outers mind its burdens were severe 123 sct at 1155156 3 justices ginsburg and breyer applied the mendozamartinez factors with different result they considered the acts burdens both onerous and intrusive and involving affirmative disabilities and restraints they saw them mirro red in the colonial forms of punishment the majority found distinguishable they too noted th at only the criminal convicted were exposed to the acts burdens and they felt that the acts burdens without regard to future dangerousness or rehabilitation were too excessive to be justif ied in the name protecting public safety by public notification 123 sct at 1159160 other indicia of legislative intent such as its placement within the code and the extent of discretion afforded administrative officials in the eyes of the court the alaska legislature marked its intent to create civil regulatory scheme by its statutory statement of purpose protection of public safety by its divide d placement of the acts provisions within the states health and safety code as well as its criminal procedure code and by the broad implementing authority it vested in one of the states regulatory agencies 123 sct at 11471492 in order to judge whether the statutes purpose and effect might be so punitive as to belie this apparent regulatory intent the court considered the factors used to test for the presence of punitive features in double jeopardy cases kennedy v mendozamartinez 372 us 144 16869 1963 the factors most relevant are wh ether in its necessary operation the regulatory scheme has been regarded in our history and traditions as punishment imposes an affirmative disability or restraint promotes the traditional aims of punishment has rational connection to nonpunitive purpose or is excessive with respect to this purpose 123 sct at 1149 each of the colonial punishments thoug ht most analogous the punitive impact of administrative decisions made for its implementation public shaming humiliation banishment involved more than the mere notification found in the alaska procedure the process in alaska is more analogous to visit to an official archive of criminal records than it is to scheme forcing an offender to appear in public with some visible badge of past criminality at least in the eyes the court 123 s ctat 1151 the statute calls for neither imprisonment nor any other physical restraint and its burdens might be considered less onerous than occupati onal debarment or so of the other disqualifications which have been accepted as components of regula tory scheme in the past 123 sct at 11513 the court did not consider the fact that the statute might have deterrent effect dispositive but thought the acts rationa l connection to nonpunitive purpose most significant factor in t he determination that the statutes effects are not punitive 123 sct at 1152 and it had been conceded that it had valid and rational nonpunitive purpose of public safety advanced by alerting the public to the risk of sex offenders in their community sct at 1152 finally the court refused to accept the contention that the act was excessive by virtue either of its application to all sex offenders matterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21334crs4 how dangerous or because of the breadth of disclosure triggered by use of the internet as medium of notification 123 sct 1152154 connecticut dept of public safety v doe the ninth circuit in smith was troubled by the fact that even judicial determination that potential registrant was longer dangerous would not free him from the grasp of the alaska statute the second circuit in connecticut was troubled by the fact that th connecticut statute afforded opportunity for such determination the ninth circuits concern was insufficient to render the alaska statute punitive and thus subject to ex post facto limitations the second circuits concern was irrelevant since so ra obligations turned upon conviction not upon dangerousness or the want thereof connecticut dept of public safety v doe 123 sct 1160 1163 2003 the complainants in connecticut had sued under 42 usc 1983 claiming that the connecticut sexual offender regi stration and notification statut violated the ex post facto and due process clauses the district court rejected their ex post facto claim but agreed that due process required current danger ousness hearing before information about registrant could be disseminated doe v lee 132 fsupp2d 57 dconn 2001 the court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed 271 f3d 38 2d cir 2001 the united states supreme court granted cer tiorari 122 sct 1959 2002 and reversed in brief opinion of near unanimous court chief justice rehnquist observed in paul v davis 424 us 693 1976 we held that mere injury to reputation even if defamatory does not constitute the deprivation of liberty interest petitioners urge us to reverse the c ourt of appeals on the ground that under paul v davis respondent has failed to establish that petitioners have deprived him of liberty interest we find it unnecessary to reach this question however because even assuming arguendo that respondent has been depr ived of liberty interest due process does not entitle him to hearing to tablish fact that is not material under the connecticut statute 123 sct 1164 there is nothing procedurally unfair bout statute which demands registration of those convicted of certain cr imes regardless of the offende rs are dangerous or harmless while denying them hearing to prove they are not dangerous there might be something substantively unfair about stat ute which imposes substantial burdens upon registrants in the name of protecting the public from the dangerous but which affords mechanism for those ensnarled to prove they are not dangerous the question of substantive due process however was not before the court and the court explicitly declined to address it 123 sct at 1164165 justice stevens the only member of the c ourt not to join the opinion of the court nonetheless concurred in the result because i believe registra tion and publication are permissible component of the punishment of this category of crimes however for those c onvicted of offenses committed after the effective date of such legislation there would be separate procedural due process violation so long as defendant is provided constitutionally adequate trial 123 sct at 1158 159 stevens j dissenting in smith and concurring in the result in doe httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21334crs5 justices scalia and souter offered separa concurrences justice scalia wrote to emphasis that from his perspective enactment of the connecticut statute would have provided all the process that was due even if had deprived regi strants of liberty interest 123 sct at 1165 justice souter with whom justice ginsburg agreed suggested that not only did the courts opinion left the door ope n for subsequent substantive due process challenges but that the sora is like all legislative choices affecting individual rights open to challenge under the equal pr otection clause 123 sct at 1166
