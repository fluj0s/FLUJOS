february 13 2002 kenneth katzman specialist in middle eastern affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress terrorism near eastern groups and state sponsors 2002 summary the qaeda terrorist network founded by osama bin laden is believed to pose continuing although diminished threat to the united states at home and to us interests and allies abroad following the networks defeat in its base in afghanistan as stated in taped appearances by its leaders since the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon the goal of qaeda is to destroy high profile us targets in order to end what qaeda claims is us suppression of islamic societies in these appearances bin laden virtually claimed responsibility for the september 11 attacks throughout its history qaeda has sought to oust prous regimes in the middle east and gain removal of us troops from the region before september 11 signs pointed to decline in state sponsorship of terrorism since the attacks some countries that are designated by the united states as state sponsors of terrorism including iran and sudan have cooperated to an extent with the usled war against qaeda and its taliban protectors in afghanistan in spite of its cooperation against the taliban and qaeda iran is still considered major sponsor of radical islamic groups that conduct terrorism against israel the arabisraeli peace process is longstanding major us foreign policy interest and the administration and congress are concerned about any terrorist groups or state sponsors that oppose the process possibly because of breakdown in the palestinianisraeli peace process in september 2000 palestinian organizations such as hamas as well as older groups such as the popular front for the liberation of palestine that have been inactive for years have stepped up operations against israelis following several major terrorist attacks against israelis since december 2001 the united states has strongly criticized palestinian authority president yasir arafat for failing to exert sufficient efforts to constrain these and other groups some analysts assert that israels actions against the palestinians have contributed to increased palestinian support for violence against israel us differences with other governments on the strategies for countering terrorism in the near east have to some extent narrowed since september 11 the united states in the past differed with its allies particularly on how to deal with state sponsors of terrorism most allied governments believe that engaging these countries diplomatically might sometimes be more effective than trying to isolate or punish them the united states has generally been more inclined than its european allies to employ sanctions and military action to compel state sponsors and groups to abandon terrorism postseptember 11 developments seem to have validated the importance of both diplomacy and in certain circumstances more forceful responses in dealing with terrorism differences with allies have begun to reemerge as the bush administration expands its war on terrorism indicating it will seek to prevent the emergence of threats by regimes some of which also have ties to terrorist groups that are developing weapons of mass destruction wmd this report will be updated

introduction1 this report updates the version issued on september 10 2001 just prior to the september 11 attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon that killed about 3000 persons it is an analysis of near eastern terrorist groups and countries on the us terrorism list list of countries that the secretary of commerce and secretary of state have determined provide repeated support for international terrorism2 this report adopts the same definition of terrorism as that used by the state department in its annual reports the definition contained in title 22 usc section 2656fd according to this section terrorism means premeditated politicallymotivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents usually intended to influence an audience five out of the seven states currently on the terrorism list are located in the near east region iran iraq syria libya and sudan the other two are cuba and north korea which will not be covered in this report the composition of the list has not changed since sudan was added in 1993 the groups analyzed in this report include but are not limited to those designated as foreign terrorist organizations ftos pursuant to the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 pl 104132 the last section of the report discusses significant themes in us unilateral and multilateral efforts to combat terrorism in or from the region the state departments annual report on international terrorism entitled patterns of global terrorism 20003 is significant source for this report other sources include press reports and conversations with us counterterrorism officials experts investigative journalists and foreign diplomats although the september 11 attacks have placed near eastern terrorist groups at the center of us antiterrorism policy near eastern terrorist groups and their state sponsors have been focus of us counterterrorism policies for several decades since the 1970s many of the most highprofile acts of terrorism against american citizens and targets have been conducted by these groups sometimes with the encouragement or at the instigation of their state sponsors however single terrorist attack either in or outside the near east region compares in scale to the september 11 attacks on the world trade center and pentagon which killed 1 this report was prepared with the assistance of patricia niehoff 2 the determinations are made in accordance with section 6j of the export administration act of 1979 50 usc 2405j 3 state department publication 10822 released april 2001 crs2 total of over 3000 persons senior us officials have attributed this attack to the qaeda network whose leaders enjoyed sanctuary in afghanistan from 1996 until their defeat at the hands of the us military and its afghan partners in late 2001 according to patterns of global terrorism 2000 available on the us department of states web site at httpwwwstategovsctrlspgtrpt2000 hereafter cited as patterns 2000 worldwide terrorismrelated casualties increased to 405 in 2000 from 233 in 1999 but the number of attacks increased only slightly from 392 in 1999 to 423 in 2000 of these 2000 totals only 16 of the 423 attacks and 19 of the 405 casualties occurred in the middle east although patterns 2000 covered only three months of the palestinian uprising that began in late september 2000 since 2001 began there have been dozens of terrorismrelated israeli casualties resulting from palestinian suicide bomb attacks some of them in retaliation for israeli actions against suspected palestinian militants thirtyone of attacks and 12 of the deaths during 2000 occurred in eurasia central asia the caucasus and russia the terrorist groups analyzed often differ in their motivations objectives ideologies and levels of activity the islamist groups remain generally the most active stating as their main objective the overthrow of secular prowestern governments the derailment of the arabisraeli peace process the expulsion of us forces from the region or the end of what they consider unjust occupation of muslim lands some groups such as the kurdistan workers party pkk fight for cultural and political rights or the formation of separate ethnicallybased states table 1 below shows the 20 near eastern groups currently designated by the state department as ftos the designations were mostly made when the fto list was inaugurated in october 1997 and revised in october 1999 and october 2001 group can be added to the list at any time qaeda the bin laden network was added on august 21 1998 the islamic movement of uzbekistan was designated on september 25 2000 and two pakistani groups lashkar etayyiba and jaish mohammad were added to the fto list on december 26 2001 under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act the designation of group as an fto blocks its assets in the united states and makes it criminal offense for us persons to provide it with material support or resources such as financial contributions executive order 12947 of january 23 1995 also bars us dealings contributions to or financial transactions with any individuals named as specially designated terrorists sdts on november 2 2001 the secretary of state also subjected all ftos to the increased financial restrictions that had been applied to qaedarelated entities under executive order 13224 september 23 2001 under this new executive order the united states can close down us branches of foreign banks that do not comply with us requests to end dealings with the ftos an sdt according to the executive order is person found to pose significant risk of disrupting the middle east peace process or to have materially supported acts of violence toward that end crs3 table 1 near

the palestine liberation organization plo which has not been the subject of separate section in patterns since patterns 1995 is analyzed in this report because of the debate over whether plo leader yasir arafat is taking sufficient steps to prevent terrorism by other groups in areas under the control of the palestinian authority since late 2000 there has been discussion about the degree to which certain plo factions are involved in violence against israel and whether they should be named as ftos when the fto list was reviewed and reissued in october 1999 the democratic front for the liberation of palestine dflp was dropped largely because it has reconciled with arafat the groups past involvement in terrorism and the recent revival of its operations against israel are discussed in this report this report contains section on the abu sayyaf group operating in the philippines as well as analysis of several pakistani islamist groups that are fighting indian control of part of kashmir province these groups are discussed in this report even though they operate outside the near east region because of their alleged connections to the bin laden network and the taliban of afghanistan in accordance with the october 2001 redesignation of the fto list the two jewish extremist groups kach and kahane chai will be treated as one group radical islamic groups since the 1979 islamic revolution in iran and particularly since the seizure of the us embassy in tehran in november of that year radical islam has attracted widespread press attention as the driving ideology of the most active middle eastern terrorist groups and state sponsors of the 20 ftos listed above 12 are islamic organizations hizballah party of god4 lebanonbased hizballah appears to be groping for direction following israels may 2000 withdrawal from lebanon having accomplished its main goal of ousting israel from southern lebanon some in the organization want it to focus exclusively on political and social work primarily through participation in parliament it holds 8 out of 128 total seats and through its charity and reconstruction works with lebanons shiite community some want hizballah to accept ministerial positions 4 for other names under which hizballah or the other groups discussed in this paper operate see us department of the treasury office of foreign assets control terrorism what you need to know about us sanctions crs5 in lebanons cabinet step that hizballah has thus far not taken hardliners in hizballah want it to battle israeli forces over the border particularly in the disputed shiba farms area5 other hardliners in the organization believe that the israeli withdrawal validated its guerrilla strategy and appear to be helping palestinian groups apply similar tactics against israeli forces in the west bank and gaza strip although initially encouraged by hizballahs relative restraint following the israeli withdrawal israel and the united states remain wary of hizballah hizballahs 15 year military campaign against israeli and israeli surrogate forces in southern lebanon activity that is not technically considered terrorism by the us state department often included rocket attacks on israeli civilians even though the united nations has certified that israels withdrawal is complete hizballah has asserted that israel still occupies some lebanese territory the shiba farms and on that basis has conducted several military attacks on israel since the withdrawal in october 2000 hizballah captured three israeli soldiers in the shiba farms area and kidnaped an israeli noncombatant whom it had lured to lebanon israel announced in early november 2001 that the three soldiers are believed dead hizballah has continued to conduct surveillance of the us embassy in lebanon and its personnel according to recent patterns reports but major terrorist attacks have been attributed to it since 1994 however according to numerous press reports and hizballah leaders own statements the organization is providing advice and logistical support to islamist palestinian groups fighting against israel in the latest palestinian uprising which began in september 2000 in january 2001 israel accused hizballah of serving as an intermediary in the shipment of 50 tons of weaponry from iran that was seized by israel and according to the united states and israel was bound for the palestinian authority the pa is precluded from fielding the weapons contained in the shipment under its oslo interim accords with israel if true this suggests that hizballah is trying to broaden its assistance to nonislamist palestinian elements in late august 2001 jordanian officials discovered cache of rockets at hizballahowned location in jordan igniting fears that hizballah might fire rockets on israel from there or might provide the weapons to palestinian militants there or in the west bank6 jordans king abdullah was said to have raised his concern about growing hizballah activity in jordan with president bush in february 2002 hizballahs history founded in 1982 by lebanese shiite clerics inspired by the islamic revolutionary ideology of irans ayatollah khomeini hizballahs original goal was to establish an islamic republic in lebanon during the 1980s hizballah was principal sponsor of antiwestern and particularly antius terrorism it is known or suspected to have been involved in suicide truck bombings of the us embassy april 1983 the us marine barracks october 1983 killing 220 marine 18 navy and 3 army personnel and the us embassy annex september 1984 all in beirut it also hijacked twa flight 847 in 1985 killing navy diver robert stethem who was on board and its factions were responsible for the detention of 5 for further

crs6 most if not all us and western hostages held in lebanon during the 1980s and early 1990s eighteen americans were held hostage in lebanon during that period three of whom were killed in the early 1990s hizballah also demonstrated an ability to conduct terrorism far from the middle east in may 1999 argentinas supreme court after an official investigation formally blamed hizballah for the march 17 1992 bombing of israels embassy in buenos aires and issued an arrest warrant for hizballah terrorist leader imad mughniyah hizballah did not claim responsibility for the attack outright but it released surveillance tape of the embassy implying responsibility in may 1998 fbi director louis freeh told argentina the fbi believes that hizballah working with iranian diplomats was also responsible for the july 18 1994 bombing of the argentinejewish mutual association amia building in buenos aires that left 86 dead7 in july 1999 argentine investigators brought charges against 20 suspected argentine collaborators in the amia bombings and the trial began in late september 2001 hizballahs outside connections hizballah maintains connections with similar groups in the persian gulf saudi and bahraini investigations of antiregime unrest have revealed the existence of local chapters of hizballah composed of shiite muslims many of whom have studied in irans theological seminaries and received terrorist training there and in lebanon saudi and us officials believe that saudi shiite muslims possibly with connections to lebanese hizballah were responsible for the june 25 1996 bombing of the khobar towers housing complex for us military personnel near dhahran saudi arabia the united states reaffirmed this allegation in the june 2001 us indictments of 14 khobar suspects according to patterns 1998 in november 1998 bahraini authorities uncovered an alleged bomb plot that they blamed on persons linked to bahraini and lebanese hizballah patterns 1999 reiterates that hizballah receives substantial amounts of financial assistance weapons and political and organizational support from both syria and iran although it does not mention specific figures then secretary of state christopher said on may 21 1996 that iran gave hizballah about 100 million per year figure that us officials have not since deviated from reported 150 of irans revolutionary guards remain in lebanon to coordinate irans aid to hizballah syria permits iran to supply weapons to hizballah through the international airport in damascus although recent turkish shutdown of the air corridor connecting iran and syria has made iranian deliveries more difficult specially designated terrorists sdts8 hizballah members named as sdts include 1 secretary general hasan nasrallah who is about 44 and has led hizballah since 1993 2 shaykh muhammad hussein fadlallah the 64yearold senior shiite cleric and leading spiritual figure of hizballah 3 subhi tufayli the 54 year old former hizballah

1980s he was also implicated in the twa 847 hijacking mughniyah as well as several alleged perpetrators of the june 1996 attack on the us housing complex of khobar towers in saudi arabia was included on list of 39 entities and persons issued october 12 2001 under executive order 13224 september 23 2001 the order subjects listed entities to financial restrictions blocked assets according to the treasury departments terrorist assets report for 2000 the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms has seized 283000 in assets belonging to 18 persons arrested in north carolina in july 2000 on suspicion of smuggling goods to generate funds for hizballah hamas and palestinian islamic jihad pij prior to the september 2000 outbreak of the palestinian uprising it appeared that the bulk of the leadership of the sunni muslim palestinian group hamas islamic resistance movement was accommodating yasir arafats leadership of the palestinian authority pa hamas leaders also appeared resigned to an eventual final peace agreement between israel and the pa although they continued to criticize arafat as too eager to compromise with israel since the uprising began hamas and its smaller ally palestinian islamic jihad pij have escalated terrorist attacks against israelis hamas claimed responsibility for the june 1 2001 suicide bombing of the dolphinarium discotheque in tel aviv which killed 21 and for an august 9 2001 suicide bombing at pizza restaurant in jerusalem that killed 18 including one american it also claimed responsibility for the december 1 2 2001 suicide bombings in jerusalem and haifa that killed about 25 persons in addition to the three bombers pij has conducted several recent suicide bombings many of which killed only the bombers many experts believe that the renewed terrorist activity is at least partly attributable to breakdown in security cooperation between israel and the palestinian authority cooperation that was widely credited with keeping terrorist attacks to minimum in the preceding few years the renewed terrorist threat has led israel to adopt policy criticized by the united states and many other countries of assassinating hamas and pij activists to preempt their suspected attacks hamas continues to receive funding from businesses it runs in palestinian controlled areas from iran about 10 of its budget from wealthy private benefactors in the persian gulf monarchies and palestinian expatriates according to patterns 2000 the patterns report adds that the group conducts fundraising and propaganda activities in western europe and north america many individual donors appear to believe their contributions go to charitable activities for poor palestinians served by hamas social services network and are not being used for terrorism pij is politically closer to iran than is hamas and apparently derives most of its funding from state sponsors especially iran pij receives some logistical support from syria according to patterns 2000 history hamas was formed by muslim brotherhood activists during the early stages of the earlier palestinian uprising intifada in 1987 its spiritual leader shaykh ahmad yassin who is paralyzed was released from prison by israel in october 1997 he seems to serve as bridge between hamas two main components crs8 the extremists who orchestrate terrorist attacks primarily through clandestine wing the izz addin alqassam brigades and the more moderate elements affiliated with hamas social services charity and educational institutions pij was in part inspired by the iranian revolution of 1979 even though pij is sunni muslim not shiite muslim organization pij remains almost purely guerrilla organization with overt component it is led by ramadan abdullah shallah gazaborn 43 year old academic who previously was an adjunct professor at the university of south florida he was chosen leader in 1995 after his predecessor fathi alshiqaqi was assassinated allegedly by israeli agents recent patterns reports characterize hamas strength as an unknown number of hardcore members and tens of thousands of supporters and sympathizers and pijs strength as unknown hamas and pij generally have not targeted the united states or americans directly although americans have died in attacks by these groups along with israelis and often the bombers themselves five out of the 65 killed in series of four hamaspij bombings in israel during february march 1996 were american citizens these bombings had the apparent effect of shifting public opinion toward the conservative likud party leader benjamin netanyahu in israeli national elections on may 29 1996 possibly proving decisive in his election victory as prime minister over then labor party leader shimon peres neither group conducted major attacks in the runup to the may 1999 israeli elections although they did carry out attacks in an attempt to derail the negotiation and implementation of the october 23 1998 israelipalestinian wye river memorandum in total the two groups have conducted about 80 suicide bombings or attempted suicide bombings killing more than 450 israelis since the signing of the israeliplo declaration of principles in 19939 blocked assets the united states has blocked the assets of some alleged hamaspij leaders using the authority of president clintons january 23 1995

terrorist organizations office of foreign assets control us department of treasury january 2001 crs9 the islamic group and aljihad egyptian security authorities continue to gain the upper hand in their battle against the opposition islamic group and its ally aljihad11 groups that over the past several decades periodically have gone underground and then resurfaced this effort could be enhanced by the us defeat of qaeda in afghanistan because militants from the two groups constitute large and politically significant faction of qaeda there have been large scale terrorist attacks by these groups since the islamic groups november 17 1997 attack on tourists near luxor and attacks inside egypt at all since august 1998 the gunmen in the luxor attack killed 58 tourists and wounded 26 others and then committed suicide or were killed by egyptian security forces even before september 11 these egyptian groups sensed that they were on the defensive and that terrorism had made them unpopular in late 1997 leaders of both groups including their common spiritual leader the 64 year old blind cleric shaykh umar abd alrahman declared ceasefire with the egyptian government muhammad hamza who is in operational control of the islamic group in egypt while abd alrahman remains incarcerated in the united states has abided by the truce connections to qaeda and the 1993 bombing of the world trade center with the decline of the groups activities within egypt and the incarceration of abd alrahman for plots related to the february 1993 bombing of the world trade center factions of the groups that are in exile have gravitated to the qaeda network several sdts from the islamic group and aljihad became members of bin ladens inner circle as his top lieutenants including ayman alzawahiri and abu hafs masri mohammad atef according to us military officials atef was killed by us air strike during the us war on the taliban and qaeda these egyptian militants oppose any truce with the egyptian government and also seek in concert with bin laden to attack us interests directly shaykh umar abd alrahman was not convicted specifically for the february 1993 bombing of the world trade center in new york but he was convicted for related unsuccessful plots in the new york area those convicted in the trade center bombing were allegedly associated with him there has been much speculation about the relationship if any between abd alrahman and bin laden at the time of the 1993 trade center bombing both recruited fighters for the afghan conflict against the soviet union through organizations in the united states and elsewhere particularly one called the maktab alkhidamat services office also known as kifah12 the two also had close connections to the islamic government of sudan although abd alrahman left sudan in 1990 before bin laden relocated there in 1991 abd alrahmans two sons reportedly have been associated with qaeda in afghanistan since 1989 one was reported killed and one reported captured during the usled war on qaeda the alleged mastermind of the 1993 trade 11 faction of the jihad operates under the name vanguards of conquest 12 maktab alkhidamatal kifah were designated for increased financial restrictions under executive order 13224 september 23 2001 crs10 center bombing ramzi ahmad yousef reportedly was an qaeda member13 see section on qaeda below although their recruiting activity in afghanistan has raised questions as to whether the united states gave bin laden or abd rahman assistance during the afghan war the central intelligence agency has told crs that it found evidence that the agency provided any direct assistance to either of them the us assistance program for the antisoviet groups in afghanistan focused primarily on indigenous afghan mujahedin and not arab volunteers such as those sponsored by bin laden or abd alrahman history the islamic group and aljihad formed in the early 1970s as offshoots of the muslim brotherhood which opted to work within the political system after being crushed by former president gamal abd alnasser both seek to replace egypts prowestern secular government with an islamic state aljihad was responsible for the assassination of president anwar sadat in october 1981 the islamic group has been responsible for several attacks on highranking egyptian officials including the killing of the peoples assembly speaker in october 1990 and the wounding of the minister of information in april 1993 the islamic group also has nonviolent arm which recruits and builds support openly in poor neighborhoods in cairo alexandria and throughout southern egypt and runs social service programs aljihad has operated only clandestinely focusing almost exclusively on assassinations sdts the following egyptian islamist figures have been named as sdts or as subject to enhanced financial restrictions under executive order 13224 1 shaykh umar abd alrahman who was acquitted in 1984 of inciting egyptian president anwar sadats assassination is in medical detention facility in missouri following his october 1995 conviction for planning terrorist conspiracies in the new york area 2 ayman alzawahiri about 51 who is top lieutenant of bin laden see below and was convicted in egypt for the sadat assassination14 3 mohammad atef who as noted above was apparently killed in the usled war on qaeda 4 rifai taha musa about 48 who was arrested in syria and extradited to egypt in october 2001 5 abbud alzumar leader of the remnants of the original jihad who is serving 40 year sentence in egypt 6 talat qasim about 44 propaganda leader of the islamic group and 7 muhammad shawqi islambouli about 46 the brother of the lead gunman in the sadat assassination islambouli military leader of the islamic group also is believed to be associated with bin laden in afghanistan qaeda osama bin laden network founded in 1988 qaeda arabic for the base the network of osama bin laden has evolved from regional threat to us troops in the persian gulf to global threat to us citizens and national security interests the september 11 2001 suicide hijacking attacks allegedly by qaeda on the world trade center and pentagon were considered threat to us national security and led to us military campaign against qaeda in its primary sanctuary in afghanistan and against 13 us sees links in brooklyn to world terrorist network new york times october 22 1998 14 egypts most wanted the estimate december 19 1997 p8 crs11 qaedas protector the islamic fundamentalist taliban regime by december 2001 the war had resulted in the ouster of the taliban from power and the death or capture of thousands of qaeda fighters and operatives in afghanistan bin ladens fate and that of his top cohort egyptian islamic jihad leader ayman alzawahiri are unknown pakistans leader president pervez musharraf has said he believes bin laden most likely has died but others particularly us officials say there is evidence bin laden or alzawahiri have died most experts believe that whether bin laden does or does not survive the war the effort has seriously disrupted qaedas ability to plan major new acts of terrorism at least one of bin ladens top lieutenants mohammad atef was reportedly killed in the war another senior recruiter ibn alshaykh allibi is in us custody zawahiris family has been killed in the war according to death announcement in an egyptian newspaper others say that much of the qaeda network is based outside afghanistan and its members still pose substantial threat to us and other targets in the united states and abroad the fate of other top operatives including abu zubaydah and safl aladl mohammad makawi is unknown and some believe that they or any number of other senior qaeda operatives are capable of reconstituting the group even if bin laden and zawahiri have not survived those who believe qaeda can last beyond its defeat in afghanistan note that in building this network bin laden assembled broad coalition of disparate radical islamic groups of varying nationalities to work toward common goals the expulsion of nonmuslim control or influence from musliminhabited lands the networks ideology laid out in several pronouncements by bin laden and his allies has led qaeda to sponsor islamic fighters or terrorists against serb forces in bosnia against soviet forces in afghanistan and now russian forces in chechnya against indian control over part of kashmir against secular or prowestern governments in egypt algeria saudi arabia and uzbekistan and against us troops and citizens in the persian gulf somalia yemen jordan and the us mainland itself some experts believe this ideology is widely held and can outlive bin laden or qaedas formal existence as an organization the backbone of qaeda according to many experts is the ideological and personal bond among the arab volunteers who were recruited by bin laden for the fight against the soviet occupation

that several thousand nonafghan muslims fought in the war against the soviets and the afghan communist government during 1979 to 199215 and that many of these fighters had subsequently become engaged

afghanistan where qaedas leadership was welcomed by the 15 patterns of global terrorism 1993 released april 1994 p4 crs12 taliban to western and latin american countries in which qaeda operatives are unwelcome but might be active unbeknownst to the government of that country in some cases such as sudan and yemen governments are aware of an qaeda presence but might be unwilling or illequipped to take action to expel qaeda in other cases qaeda activists are linked to opposition movements such as those in the persian gulf countries saudi arabia kuwait qatar bahrain oman and the united arab emirates in other cases the qaeda presence is function of the activities of its subordinate or affiliate groups including egypts islamic group and aljihad algerias armed islamic group and salafist group for call and combat which have been active not only in algeria but in past acts of terrorism against former colonial power france the abu sayyaf organization in the philippines harakat ulmujahidin movement of islamic fighters in pakistan the islamic movement of uzbekistan the islamic army of aden yemen the asbat alansar partisans group in lebanon ittihad islamiya islamic union in somalia and the libyan islamic fighting group an opposition movement to libyas government16 although there are few evident links to hamas bin laden was follower of dr abdullah alazzam palestinian of jordanian origin who was influential in the founding of both hamas and qaeda and who was assassinated in 1989 in addition to afghanistan qaeda or its affiliates has participated in recent or ongoing wars or insurgencies such as in bosnia kosovo chechnya and kashmir some uighur activists in muslim areas of western china are said to be affiliated with qaeda17 in still other cases qaedas affiliate groups are active in countries near their main areas of operation for example the islamic movement of uzbekistan has transited tajikistan and kyrgyzstan in an effort to operate against the government of uzbekistan chechen guerrillas allegedly linked to qaeda have reportedly transited azerbaijan and there may be ties between qaeda and an azeri islamist opposition group called hizb etahrir liberation party in east asia abu sayyaf and other islamic activists are said to be operating in indonesia and malaysia and an alleged qaeda plot against the us embassy in singapore was reportedly uncovered in january 2002 the singapore plotters are alleged to be members of an organization called jemaah islamiah islamic group which was created in malaysia in the mid 1990s and also has presence in indonesia and the philippines18 regarding indonesia there is speculation that group called laskar jihad founded in early 2000 and which advocates antichristian violence is associated with qaeda19 qaeda has also been present in some countries in the course of planning or committing acts of terrorism such as several countries in east africa including 16 with the exception of the islamic group in

there segment of that plot which also was foiled was attempted by an qaeda cell in canada the september 11 attacks demonstrated that qaeda cells can exist even in countries such as the united states where qaeda is clearly considered hostile by the government and the population these countries are working together to uncover and arrest qaeda cells that might remain previous investigations of qaeda plots as well as of the september 11 attacks have turned up qaeda cells in virtually every country in western europe as well as few countries in eastern europe including poland some alleged qaeda activists are reported to have transited few countries in south america and those countries are working with us intelligence and law enforcement authorities against qaeda21 history of terrorist activities bin ladens network has been connected to number of acts of terrorism prior to the september 11 attacks bin laden himself has been indicted by us court for involvement in several of them bin laden has claimed responsibility for the december 1992 attempted bombings against 100 us servicemen in yemen there to support relief operations in somalia operation restore hope one was killed in press interviews bin laden has openly boasted that he provided weapons to antius militias in somalia during operation restore hope and that his loyalists fought against us forces there in street battle in mogadishu in october 1993 18 us special operations forces were killed in battle with militiamen allegedly supplied and assisted by qaeda qaedas involvement with the somali militias appears to have strengthened bin ladens view that terrorism and lowtechnology combat could succeed in causing the united states to withdraw from military involvement abroad the four saudi nationals who confessed to the november 13 1995 bombing of us military training facility in riyadh saudi arabia admitted on saudi television to being inspired by bin laden and other islamic radicals three of the four who confessed to the bombing were veterans of conflicts in afghanistan bosnia and chechnya according to patterns 1997 members of bin ladens organization might have aided the islamic group

involved in the february 1993 bombing of the world trade center however patterns 1999 says that bin ladens network was responsible for plots in asia believed orchestrated by ramzi ahmad yusuf who was captured in pakistan brought to the united states and convicted in november 1997 of masterminding the trade center bombing the plots in asia all of which failed were to assassinate the pope during his late 1994 visit to the philippines and president clinton during his visit there in early 1995 to bomb the us and israeli embassies in manila in late 1994 and to bomb us trans pacific flights the august 7 1998 us embassy bombings in kenya and tanzania which killed 224 persons including 12 american citizens occurred just after six month period in which bin laden had issued repeated and open threats including february 1998 pronouncement calling for the killing of us civilians and servicemen worldwide on august 20 1998 the united states launched cruise missiles on bin ladens training camps in eastern afghanistan based on us evidence of his networks involvement in the bombings the united states also struck pharmaceutical plant in sudan that the administration alleged was linked to bin laden and was producing chemical weapons agents us officials add that the bombings were intended to disrupt planning for new attack for their alleged role in the bombings 17 alleged members of qaeda have been indicted by us court including bin laden four of the six in us custody have been tried and convicted three others were arrested and have been convicted in britain in december 1999 us and jordanian law enforcement authorities uncovered and thwarted two alleged plots one in the united states and one in jordan to attack us citizens celebrating the new millennium the united states plot allegedly to bomb angeles international airport was orchestrated by probin laden cell of algerian armed islamic group members coming from canada in june 2000 jordan tried 28 persons who allegedly were planning to attack tourists during millennium festivities in that country but 15 of those charged are still at large also in june 2000 lebanon placed 29 alleged followers of bin laden who belong to an organization called asbat alansar see above on trial for planning terrorist attacks in jordan the presence of bin laden cells in jordan and lebanon coupled with israeli arrests of alleged bin laden operatives in the west bank and gaza strip suggests that qaeda might plan acts of terrorism in connection with the palestinian uprising some press reports in february 2002 indicate that some qaeda activists who fled afghanistan after the start of the us war effort have gone to lebanon if the reports are true the fleeing qaeda members might be benefitting from the asbat alansar network there

the ship killed 17 and injured 39 navy personnel although most governments have agreed with the united states that the evidence of qaedas responsibility for september 11 is clear and compelling there is little agreement on responsibility for the spate of anthrax mailings in the united states that followed the september 11 events five people died in these mailings which temporarily closed several congressional buildings and post offices one has been arrested for the mailings us officials say it appears based on tests that the source of the anthrax was domestic such as military research

indicted along with bin laden on november 4 1998 for the kenyatanzania bombings22 qaeda financing financially qaeda drew initially on the personal fortune of bin laden variously estimated at anywhere from 50 million to 300 million the organization according to most press reports later became relatively selfsustaining relying on funding from many other sources including contributions islamic charities and lending institutions such as barakat and some legitimate businesses such as chain of honey shops and bakeries in the middle east executive order 13224 of september 23 2001 greatly expanded the number of qaeda related entities under financial restrictions and increased the scope of the restrictions to include penalties against foreign financial entities that conduct transactions with the named entities many of the entities named are individual leaders of qaeda including those mentioned in this section23 the deputy treasury secretary said on january 22 2002 that about 80 million in qaeda assets had been uncovered and seized worldwide since executive order 13224 was issued in addition about 221 million in assets of the taliban movement were blocked under executive

december 1979 in 1989 after the afghan war ended he returned to saudi arabia to work in his familys business the bin laden construction group however his radical islamic contacts and protests against the presence of us troops in saudi arabia to combat iraqs invasion of kuwait caused him to run afoul of saudi authorities in 1991 bin laden relocated to sudan with the approval of sudans national islamic front nif leader hasan alturabi there in concert with nif leaders he built network of businesses including an islamic bank shamal an importexport firm and firms that exported agricultural products an engineer by training bin laden also used his family connections in the construction business to help sudan build roads and airport facilities the businesses in sudan some of which may still be operating enabled him to offer safe haven and employment in sudan to qaeda members promoting their involvement in radical islamic movements in their countries of origin especially egypt as well as antius terrorism he reportedly has some business interests in yemen as well and is believed to have investments in european and asian firms bin laden has said publicly that while he was in sudan there were few assassination attempts against him during his time in sudan bin laden also sponsored londonbased group the advisory and reform committee that distributed literature against the saudi regime as result of bin ladens opposition activities saudi arabia revoked his citizenship in 1994 and his family disavowed him although his syrianborn mother and some of his brothers reportedly maintained contact with him he has formal role in the operations of the bin laden construction group which continues to receive contracts from the saudi government and from other arab countries in may 1996 following strong us and egyptian pressure sudan expelled him and he returned to afghanistan under protection of the taliban movement some reports say sudan offered to extradite him to saudi arabia but that saudi arabia refused the offer on june 7 1999 bin laden was placed on the fbis ten most wanted list and 25 million reward is offered for information leading to his capture he is

similar to that faced by egyptian islamist groups in egypt according to patterns 2000 gia splinter group the salafi group for call and combat is now the more active armed group inside algeria although it is considered somewhat less violent in its tactics than is the gia both the gia and the salafi group were subjected to increased financial restrictions under executive order 13224 suggesting the us government considers both groups linked to qaeda some gia members including ahmad ressam were allegedly involved in thwarted december 1999 plot to detonate bomb in the united states24 plot widely attributed to qaeda by us law enforcement authorities as noted above it now appears that the target of the plot was angeles international airport the gia is highly fragmented25 in part because it does not have an authoritative religious or political figure who can hold its various factions together and arbitrate disputes founded by algerian islamists who fought in afghanistan the gia formed as breakaway faction of the then legal islamic salvation front fis political party in 1992 after the regime canceled the second round of parliamentary elections on fears of an fis victory according to patterns 2000 the gia has killed over 100 expatriates in algeria mostly europeans since 1992 but in possible indication of regime counterterrorism success foreigners have been killed in algeria since 1997 over the past six years the gia has conducted campaign of civilian massacres sometimes wiping out entire villages in their areas of operations in an effort to intimidate rival groups and to demonstrate that the government lacks control over the country the gia conducted its most lethal terrorist attack on december 31 1997 when it killed 400 algerian civilians in town 150 miles southwest of algiers according to patterns 1997 it should be noted that there are allegations that elements of the regimes security forces and other opposition groups have also conducted civilian massacres over the years several of the gias leaders have been killed battling algerian security forces in february 2002 algerian authorities announced that the gias latest leader antar zouabri was killed in gun

groups as well as others discussed below seek the end of indian control of musliminhabited parts of the divided region of kashmir they are harakat ulmujahidin movement of islamic fighters lashkar etayyiba army of the righteous and jaish emohammad army of mohammad the latter two were designated as foreign terrorist organizations on december 26 2001 following december 13 2001 attack by pakistani islamic militants on indias parliament building the three groups are also designated for financial restrictions under executive order 13224 the largest and most well known of the pakistani islamic extremist movements is harakat ulmujahidin hum it is composed of militant islamist pakistanis and kashmiris as well as arab veterans of the afghan war against the soviet union who view the kashmir struggle as jihad islamic struggle the hum was included in the original october 1997 fto designations when its name was harakat alansar it subsequently changed its name to harakat ulmujahidin possibly in an attempt to avoid the us sanctions that accompanied its designation as an fto under its new name the group was redesignated as an fto in october 1999 an offshoot of the hum kidnapped and reportedly later killed five western tourists in kashmir in 1995 the hum is believed responsible for the december 1999 hijacking of an indian airliner because the hijackers demanded the release of an hum leader masood azhar in exchange for the release of the jet and its passengers one of whom was killed by the hijackers the group is allied with or part of the qaeda coalition but it has been focused primarily on expelling indian troops from kashmir and does not appear to be part of qaedas broader struggle against the united states then leader of the hum fazlur rehman khalil signed bin ladens february 1998 pronouncement calling for terrorist attacks on american troops and civilians although the hum has not tended to target americans according to patterns 1999 some hum fighters were killed in the august 20 1998 us retaliatory strikes on bin ladens training camps in afghanistan khalil stepped down in february 2000 as leader of the hum in favor of his secondincommand faruq kashmiri kashmiri is not viewed as closely linked to bin laden as is khalil and the move suggested that the hum was seeking to distance itself from qaeda khalil remained as secretary general of the organization but he is said to be in hiding since october 2001 fearing arrest by pakistan after its decision to cooperate with the us war on the taliban other islamist groups in pakistan the hum fights alongside other pakistani islamist groups that have not been named as ftos they include the following jaishemohammed jem army of mohammed this is more radical splinter group of the hum formed

and the protaliban islamic scholars society jamiati ulemai islam party of pakistan it probably receives some funds from qaeda according to patterns 2000 on december 25 2001 pakistan detained masood azhar partial response to indian demands on pakistan to curb kashmirrelated terrorism following the december 13 attack on indias parliament building lashkaretayyiba army of the righteous is described by patterns 2000 as one of the three largest and best trained groups fighting in kashmir against india led by professor hafiz mohammed saeed and operating through missionary organization known as the mdi center for islamic call and guidance its fighters are pakistanis from religious schools throughout pakistan as well as arab volunteers for the kashmir jihad pakistan detained saeed in late december 2001 following the attack on indias parliament building few other kashmirrelated groups are mentioned in press reports or in patterns 2000 but they are not analyzed separately in the report or discussed in depth one is the harakatul jihad islami islamic jihad movement many of whose fighters defected to the jaishe mohammed when it was formed another group lashkare jhangvi has called for attacks on the united states and declared itself an ally of bin laden the hizbul mujahedin mujahedin party is an older more established and somewhat more moderate group with few apparent links to bin laden or to arab volunteers for the kashmir struggle islamic movement of uzbekistan imu the islamic movement of uzbekistan imu was named as an fto on september 25 2000 after kidnaping four us citizens who were mountain climbing in kyrgyzstan in august 2000 the imus primary objective is to replace the secular authoritarian government of uzbekistans president islam karimov with an islamic regime and it is believed responsible for setting off five bombs in tashkent uzbekistan on february 16 1999 one of the bombs exploded in government building just minutes before karimov was to attend meeting there the government of uzbekistan blamed the plot on two imu leaders tahir yuldashev and juma namangani both of whom reportedly enjoyed safe haven in talibancontrolled afghanistan26 antitaliban forces in afghanistan say namangani was killed in the us war against the taliban while commanding qaeda fighters around the city of mazar esharif in november 2001 yuldashevs fate is unknown the

related group of guerrillas battled security forces in neighboring kyrgyzstan abu sayyaf group the abu sayyaf group which is designated fto is an islamic separatist organization operating in the southern philippines founded in 1991 although it is not known to operate in the near east region abu sayyaf is discussed in this report because of its alleged financial and political ties to qaeda the

kidnaping foreign hostages press reports assess its numeric strength at about 2000 some of whom have trained in afghanistan as of now it is holding about 12 hostages including two american citizens in the southern philippines it has also expanded its kidnapings into malaysia and is suspected of shipping weapons to muslim extremists in indonesia who are fighting against christians there28 the united states fears that some qaeda fighters who fled the recent fighting in afghanistan might try to congregate in the philippines possibly in territory controlled by the abu sayyaf group us officials have

abu hassan admitted to the kidnaping and was executed by the yemeni government in october 1999 new leader has been publicly identified even before september 11 yemens president ali abdullah alsalih had publicly vowed to eradicate terrorism from yemen and there is evidence that the government as matter of policy supported radical islamist groups or alleged qaeda sympathizers living in yemen however there are areas of yemen under tenuous government control and experts believe that the yemeni government has to some extent tolerated the presence of islamic extremists in yemen some government workers are believed to have personal ties to individual islamists there yemen interrogated many people and made number of arrests in the cole attack but some us law enforcement officials have been unsatisfied with its cooperation in that investigation in middecember 2001 yemen government forces attacked tribes in central yemen believed to be harboring associates of bin laden although the attack was unsuccessful and led to us requests to provide yemen with military advisory assistance the former south yemen peoples democratic republic of yemen pdry was on the us terrorism list during 19791990 for supporting leftwing arab terrorist groups but was removed from the list when south yemen merged with the more conservative north yemen in 1990 to form the republic of yemen radical jewish groups kach and kahane chai some radical jewish groups are as opposed to the arabisraeli peace process as are radical islamic groups the jewish groups which derive their support primarily from jewish settlers in the occupied territories have been willing to engage in terrorism to try to derail the process the incidents involving these jewish groups have declined in recent years although settlers possibly linked to them have attacked palestinians throughout the latest palestinian uprising that began in september 2000 in the october 2001 reissuing of the foreign terrorist organization list the state dept combined kach and kahane chai into single designation suggesting that the two have either merged or are so closely associated as to be indistinguishable kach was founded by rabbi

occupied territories and parts of jordan they also want strict implementation of jewish law in israel to try to accomplish these goals the two groups have organized protests against the israeli government and threatened palestinians in hebron and elsewhere in the west bank on march 13 1994 the israeli cabinet declared both to be terrorist organizations under 1948 terrorism law the declaration came after the groups publicly stated their support for february 25 1994 attack on hebron mosque by radical jewish settler baruch goldstein who was kach affiliate and an immigrant from the united states the attack killed 29 worshipers and wounded about 150 patterns 2000 says that the numerical strength of kach and kahane chai is unknown and repeats previous assertions that both receive

with the palestinians neither amir nor his two accomplices were known to be formal members of kach or kahane chai although amir appears to espouse ideologies similar to those of the two groups blocked assets according to the terrorist assets report for 2000 about 200 belonging to kahane chai has been blocked since 1995 leftwing and nationalist groups some middle eastern terrorist groups are guided by arab nationalism or left wing ideologies rather than islamic fundamentalism during the 1980s and 1990s with the collapse of the soviet union and the loss of much of their backing from state sponsors the leftwing and nationalist groups became progressively less active and were largely eclipsed by militant islamic groups however some of the leftwing nationalist groups have reactivated their terrorist and commando operations since the latest palestinian uprising began in september 2000 palestine liberation organization plo the plo formally renounced the use of terrorism in 1988 and it reaffirmed that commitment as part of its september 1993 mutual recognition agreement with israel the plo has not been named an fto by the state department and patterns 1995 was the last patterns report to contain formal section analyzing the plo the plo is analyzed in this crs report because of the debate in congress and among observers over whether the plo as the power behind the palestinian authority pa is taking sufficient steps to prevent hamas pij and others from conducting terrorist attacks against israelis this debate has intensified since the palestinian uprising began in september 2000 the uprising has been accompanied by significant increase in the frequency of hamas and pij terrorist attacks some observers maintain there is evidence that hamas and pij are increasingly cooperating with militant elements linked to the plo in conducting acts of violence against israel crs23 the bush administration has become more critical of the pa following hamas suicide attacks in jerusalem and haifa on december 12 2001 that killed 26 persons the us criticism escalated following israels seizure in early january 2002 of ship carrying 50 tons of iranian arms bound for the pa and possibly hamas according to press reports the weapons aboard the ship including long range mortars and plastic explosives all of which are banned under palestinian interim agreements with israel suggested that pa elements might be planning terrorist attacks against israel trying to build conventional military option or attempting to build capability to combat reprisal attacks on pa facilities patterns 2000 generally credited the pa with working with israel to disrupt hamas and pij attacks against israel in the first half of 2000 but the report noted israels dissatisfaction with pa antiterrorism cooperation after the uprising began an administration report to congress on plo compliance with its commitments covering december 15 2000 june 15 2001 alleges that factions of the plo have encouraged or participated in violence against israel the factions mentioned include wing of the fatah movement called the tanzim organization and plo security apparatus called force 17 on the basis of these allegations some members of congress maintain that fatah the tanzim force 17 and related armed faction that has been conducting attacks on israel the aqsa martyrs brigade should be designated as ftos although some israelis longer view arafat as partner for peace others note than many palestinians have looked to arafat and the plo for leadership for more than three decades and that there is viable alternative to him yasir arafat who was born august 1 1929 used the backing of his fatah guerrilla organization to become chairman of the plo in 1969 after the plo and other palestinian guerrillas were forced out of jordan in 1970 and 1971 cross border attacks on israel became more difficult and some constituent groups under the plo umbrella resorted to international terrorism in the wake of the 1973 arabisraeli war international efforts to promote arabisraeli peace caused arafat to limit terrorist attacks largely to targets within israel lebanon and the occupied territories popular front for the liberation of palestine general command pflpgc ahmad jibril former captain in the syrian army formed the pflpgc in october 1968 as breakaway faction of the popular

operations and the group operates small tank force at its bases in lebanon according to observers jibrils several hundred guerrillas fought against israeli forces alongside hizballah during israels occupation of strip of southern lebanon which ended in may 2000 recent patterns reports have not attributed any significant terrorist attacks to the pflpgc in the past few years in may 2001 jibril claimed responsibility for shipping boatload of weapons to the palestinians in the occupied territories although the shipment was intercepted by israels navy crs24 probably because of jibrils service in the syrian military syria has always been the chief backer of the pflpgc giving it logistical and military support in the late 1980s the pflpgc also built close relationship with iran and it receives iranian financial assistance although only libyan agents have been tried or convicted for the december 21 1988 bombing of pan am 103 there have been persistent reports that iran approached the pflpgc to bomb us passenger jet in retaliation for the july 3 1988 us navys downing of an iranian passenger airplane iran air flight 655 according to some theories the pflpgc first pursued such

killing of its leader abu ali mustafa israel killed mustafa with missile strike on his west bank office mustafa had replaced his longtime mentor ailing pflp founder george habash as pflp secretarygeneral in july 2000 in october 1999 in the wake of the pflps reconciliation talks with arafat israel had allowed mustafa to return to palestiniancontrolled territory from exile partly because mustafas office was located in building inhabited by civilians the united states strongly criticized the israeli killing of mustafa and israels policy of targeted killings as an excessive use of force and unhelpful to efforts to quiet the ongoing violence in october 2001 the pflp retaliated for mustafa by assassinating israeli tourism minister rehavam zeevi mustafas successor ahmad saadat was arrested in midjanuary 2002 by pa authorities as part of arafats most recent crackdown on palestinian terrorism the pflp was founded in december 1967 following the arab defeat in the six day war with israel in june of that year by marxistleninist ideologue and medical doctor george habash christian the pflp was active in international terrorism during the late 1960s and the 1970s on september 6 1970 pflp guerrillas simultaneously hijacked three airliners and after evacuating the passengers blew up the aircraft the pflp opposed the palestinians decision to join the madrid peace process and suspended its participation in the plo after the september 1993 israel plo declaration of principles in august 1999 in apparent recognition of arafats growing control over palestinian territory the pflp held reconciliation talks with him arafat reportedly invited the pflp to send delegate to the usbrokered summit talks with israel at camp david in july 2000 but the pflp refused its terrorist

soldiers the two guerrillas were killed in the exchange of fire recent patterns reports estimate the total strength for all major factions of the dflp is about 500 the dflp may still receive some financial assistance from syria where it has its headquarters the dflp formed in 1969 as an offshoot of the pflp the dflps most noted terrorist attack was the may 1974 takeover of school in maalot in northern israel in which 27 schoolchildren were killed and 134 people wounded it thereafter confined itself largely to smallscale border raids into israel and infrequent attacks on israeli soldiers officials and civilians in israel and the occupied territories the dflp still led by its 67yearold founder nayif hawatmeh abandoned its call for the destruction of israel in the 1980s it sought stringent conditions for palestinian participation in the october 1991 madrid peace conference and publicly opposed the september 1993 israelplo mutual recognition accords and subsequent interim agreements reached between israel and the palestinians the dflp began reconciling with arafat in august 1999 and stated that it might recognize israel if there were permanent israelipalestinian peace in response to the dflps apparent moderation the state department removed the group from the list of ftos when that list was revised in october 1999 also that month israel permitted hawatmeh to

accommodated to that decision in april 1996 abu abbas voted to amend the plo charter to eliminate clauses calling for israels destruction in april 1998 israel allowed abu abbas to relocate to the gaza strip from iraq where he had settled after his expulsion from damascus in 1985 during its most active period the plf conducted several highprofile attacks its most wellknown operation was the october 1985 hijacking of the italian cruise ship achille lauro in which the group murdered disabled us citizen leon klinghoffer and held the other passengers hostage for two days abu abbas and his team surrendered to egyptian forces in exchange for promise of safe passage they were apprehended at nato airbase in italy after us aircraft forced down the egyptian airliner flying them to safehaven abu abbas who was not on board the achille lauro during the hijacking was released by the italian government but later sentenced in absentia warrant for his arrest is outstanding in italy but the justice

are attempting to influence the domestic political structures or the foreign policies of their countries of origin two of them operate against the government of turkey and the other against the government of iran kurdistan workers party pkk35 the pkk appears to be in transition from guerrilla and terrorist organization to political movement it was founded in 1974 by political science student abdullah ocalan who is now about 53 years old with the goal of establishing marxist kurdish state in southeastern turkey where there is predominantly kurdish population it claims to have changed its goals somewhat to focus on greater cultural and political rights within turkey the pkk generally targeted government forces and civilians in eastern turkey but it has operated elsewhere in the country and attacked turkish diplomatic and commercial facilities in several western european cities in 1993 and 1995 the united states sides with turkey in viewing the pkk as terrorist organization but wants to see peaceful resolution of the conflict and encourages turkey to provide greater cultural and linguistic rights to the kurds the pkks transition accelerated in october 1998 when turkish military and diplomatic pressure forced syria to expel pkk leader ocalan and the pkk ocalan 34 ibid 35 the pkk is distinct from iranian and iraqi kurdish organizations that the state department does not consider terrorist and which in the case of iraqi kurds benefit from us support crs28 who is about 52 sought refuge in several countries but turkey acting on information reportedly provided by the united states captured him as he was leaving greeces embassy in kenya in early 1999 he was tried and on june 29 1999 sentenced to death for treason and the murder of about 30000 turks since 1984 the implementation of the sentence has been suspended pending appeals to the european court of human rights in august 1999 he called on his supporters to cease armed operations against the turkish government decision affirmed at pkk congress in january 2000 pkk violence against the turkish government has since subsided but not ended and many of the pkks estimated 5000 fighters remain encamped and active across the border in iran and kurdishcontrolled northern iraq and have conducted few minor terrorist attacks since revolutionary peoples liberation partyfront dhkpc the dhkpc is becoming more active after long period of virtual dormancy this marxist organization still commonly referred to by its former name dev sol was formed in 1978 to oppose turkeys prowestern tilt and its membership in the north atlantic treaty organization nato since the late 1980s the dhkpc which corresponds to its acronym in turkish has concentrated attacks on turkish military and security officials but it has since 1990 attacked foreign interests according to patterns 2000 the group assassinated two us military contractors in turkey to protest the gulf war against iraq and it rocketed the us consulate in istanbul in 1992 an attempt by the group to fire an antitank weapon at the consulate in june 1999 was thwarted by turkish authorities also foiled was planned attack by the group in august 2000 on incirlik air base which hosts us aircraft patrolling fly zone over northern iraq the group attacked an istanbul police station killing one police officer in january 2001 the peoples mojahedin organization of iran pmoi the peoples mojahedin organization of iran pmoi the dominant organization within broader national council of resistance ncr has leftwing roots but it is not composed of an ethnic minority it was formed in the 1960s as an opponent of the shahs authoritarian rule and was part of the broad movement that overthrew the shah in 1981 the pmoi turned against the islamic revolutionary regime of ayatollah khomeini when irans clerics violently excluded the pmoi and other groups from major roles in the new government but the pmoi rebellion was suppressed and some of its leaders fled iran to continue their political activities in exile the group claims that it has abandoned what some experts describe as left wing past and that it is committed to free markets and democracy however the state department noted in 1994 congressionallymandated report that there is record of an internal debate over the change in ideology and there is reason to doubt the organizations sincerity the group publicly supports the arabisraeli peace process and the rights of irans minorities the state departments longstanding mistrust of the group is based not only on the groups past activities but on its killing of several us military officers and civilians during the struggle against the shah its alleged support for the takeover of the us embassy in tehran in 1979 its authoritarian internal structure and its use crs29 of iraq as base for its several thousand member military wing the state department named the pmoi an fto in october 1997 on the grounds that it kills civilians in the course of its antiregime operations inside iran in one of its most highprofile attacks the group claimed responsibility for the april 10 1999 assassination in tehran of senior iranian military officer however the group does not appear to purposely target civilians in the october 1999 revision of the fto list the state department partly in response to an iranian government request named the ncr as an alias of the pmoi meaning that ftorelated sanctions now apply to the ncr as well the ncrs offices in the united states have not been closed by us law enforcement authorities because its us chapter was not included in the fto designation seven persons were arrested in california in march 2001 for allegedly soliciting donations for the group which if proved would be violation of fto sanctions regulations other supporters of the group often operate under the names of local iranian expatriate organizations in 1998 majority of the house signed letter questioning the state departments designation of the group as an fto and some members state that the group merits us support as an alternative to the current regime in tehran some members and outside experts believe that the pmoi was designated as an fto as gesture of goodwill to iran after the election of mohammad khatemi in 199736 the pmoi is led by masud and maryam rajavi masud leads the pmois military forces based in iraq and he is president of the ncr his wife maryam who is now with him in iraq after leaving france in 1997 is the organizations choice to become interim president of iran if it were to take power mozagan parsaii is the organizations secretary general middle eastern terrorism list countries us officials maintain that they have made number of gains in their efforts to reduce state sponsorship of terrorism five middle eastern countries are on the terrorism list iraq iran syria sudan and libya37 in the case of libya sudan and to lesser extent iraq us and international pressure coupled with internal developments in some of these states have reduced their support for international terrorism long before september 11 of the middle eastern countries on the list sudan appears to be the closest to achieving removal the state department openly acknowledges working with sudan to help it meet the remaining requirements for removing it from the list and has praised its cooperation against qaeda after september 11 in the case of iran and syria however us efforts have had little success in curbing the support of these governments for terrorist groups 36 kempster norman us designates 30 groups as terrorists angeles times october 9 1997 37 along with cuba and north korea these countries have been designated by the secretary of state under section 6j of the export administration act of 1979 50 usc app 2405j as having repeatedly provided state support for international terrorism crs30 under section 6j of the export administration act removal from the list requires 45 day advance notification to the house international relations committee the senate foreign relations committee and the senate and house banking committees that the country has ceased support for international terrorism and pledges to continue doing so also under that provision major change of government in the listed country can serve as grounds for immediate removal from the list iran38 irans sponsorship of terrorist groups appears to be setting back the prospects for reconciliation between the united states and iran usiran relations were improving prior to september 11 and subsequently in the course of tacit cooperation in the war against the taliban however in january 2002 the united states and israel alleged that iran sold large shipment of arms to the palestinian authority israel seized the ship before its cargo was offloaded the episode expanded us concerns about irans sponsorship of terrorism by indicating link between iran and palestinian groups who are not islamic in nature and with which tehran has previously had few links in his january 29 2002 state of the union message president bush was highly critical of iran calling it part of an axis of evil with iraq and north korea patterns 2000 as has been the case for the past 6 years again characterized iran as the most active state sponsor of international terrorism however the report as did patterns 1999 attributes irans terrorism support to specific institutions the revolutionary guard and the ministry of intelligence and security rather than the iranian government as whole these institutions are controlled by supreme leader ali khamenei who espouses hardline positions on most foreign and domestic policies this characterization suggests that the state department believes president mohammad khatemi and his allies genuinely wish to overcome irans reputation as terrorist state in order to further ease irans isolation indicating that khatemi is attempting not to differ with khamenei patterns 2000 cites statements by khatemi as well as by hardline leaders calling for the destruction of israel in an apparent positive signal to iran patterns 2000 for the third year in row cites pmoi attacks on iranian officials as justification for irans claim that it is victim of terrorism although major international terrorist attacks have been linked to iran since khatemi took office in august 1997 the united states has not publicly noted any diminution of iranian material support for terrorist groups opposed to the arab israeli peace process such as those groups discussed earlier in this paper patterns 2000 notes that iran has encouraged hizballah and palestinian terrorist groups to escalate attacks on israel in the context of the palestinian uprising iran also has been accused by regional governments of sponsoring assassinations of antishiite muslim clerics in tajikistan and pakistan and of supporting shiite muslim islamic opposition movements in the persian gulf states and iraq on the other hand us officials acknowledge that iran has improved relations with its gulf neighbors 38 for further information see crs issue brief ib93033 iran current developments and us policy by kenneth katzman crs31 dramatically in recent years and that its support for gulf opposition movements has diminished sharply iran also has largely ceased attacks on dissidents abroad that were so prominent during the tenures of khatemis predecessors in handing down indictments of 14 people in june 2001 the department of justice stated its belief that iran was involved in the june 1996 khobar towers bombing in saudi arabia which killed 19 us airmen iranians were among those indicted but the indictments detail the role of iranian security personnel in inspiring and supervising the plot which was carried out by members of saudi hizballah eleven of the 14 are in custody in saudi arabia and saudi arabia says they will be tried there and not extradited to the united states39 many experts believe that the saudi and us governments have sought to avoid firmly pressing the khobar case against iran legally or diplomatically in order not to undermine khatemi who was elected after the bombing or reduce the chance to improved relations with iran syria40 syria has expressed public support for the us war on terrorism and has emphasized that syria itself has long combated islamic movements in syria at the same time syria is attempting to deflect us and international scrutiny of its role as host to terrorist groups syrias position is that the movements it hosts are legitimate resistance movements against israeli occupation on that basis syria refuses to expel the groups in syria and areas of lebanon that syria controls even before september 11 patterns 2000 was more critical of syria than was patterns 1999 which came close to promising that syria would be removed from the terrorism list if it signed peace agreement with israel this appeared to signal that us hopes had receded that president bashar alassad would be more flexible on foreign policy than his father the late hafez assad who bashar succeeded in june 2000 upon his death far from praising syria for restraining terrorist groups as was the case in some past patterns report patterns 2000 says that syria allowed hamas to open new office in damascus in march 2000 the report adds that syria did not act to stop hizballah or palestinian terrorist groups operating in syria or areas under syrian control or influence from launching antisrael attacks syria continues to allow iran to resupply hizballah through the damascus airport and has allowed visiting iranian officials to meet with antipeace process terrorist organizations based in syria it also publicly opposed suggestions that hizballah be disarmed by peacekeepers after the militia seized positions in southern lebanon vacated by israel during its may 2000 withdrawal syria also provides sanctuary to the pflpgc and other nonislamist palestinian groups there are indications that qaeda members are welcome in syria group active in lebanon asbat alansar partisans group is believed linked to 39 macfarquhar

and there is information to suggest that the group operates with syrian or lebanese government approval patterns 2000 does state that syria is generally upholding its pledge to turkey not to support the pkk some believe that syrias position on the pkk is the result of syrias fear of turkeys potential threat to use armed force against syria and not unilateral syrian desire to sever relations with the pkk an alternate interpretation is that syria wants to sustain the recent improvement in its bilateral relationship with turkey also patterns 2000 states that syria appears to have maintained its long standing ban on attacks launched from syrian territory or against western targets despite its position on the terrorism list the united states maintains relatively normal relations with syria the two countries exchange ambassadors and most forms of nonmilitary us trade with and us investment in syria are permitted subject to various licensing restrictions libya41 the pan am 103 bombing issue has been at the center of us policy toward libya for more than decade and will likely prevent any major rapprochement as long as muammar qadhafi remains in power however some press reports citing unnamed administration officials indicate that the bush administration might consider easing sanctions perhaps including removing libya from the terrorism list outright if outstanding pan am 103 issues are resolved42 after an article to this effect appeared in january 2002 bush administration officials sought to downplay the possibility that libya would be removed from the list anytime soon most experts believe libya has reduced its involvement with terrorist groups at least for now in 1998 prior to the handover libya had expelled abu nidal it was reducing its contacts with other radical palestinian organizations and it expressed support for yasir arafat in an effort to reward libyas positive steps in 1999 us official began meeting with libyan diplomat for the first time since 1981

briefly to assess whether to lift the us restriction on the use of us passports for travel to libya the restriction has not been lifted the january 31 2001 conviction of almegrahi brought some closure to the pan am case but also reinforced the perception among the pan am victims families and others that libyan leader muammar qadhafi had at the very least foreknowledge of the bombing immediately upon the conviction president bush stated that the united states would maintain unilateral sanctions on libya and oppose permanently lifting sanctions until libya 1 accepts responsibility for the act 2 compensates the families of the victims 3 renounces support for terrorism and 4 discloses all it knows about the plot in january 2002 some persons involved in pursuing compensation agreement with

lifted sudan45 sudan appears closest of any of the near eastern countries on the terrorism list to being removed despite congressional and outside criticism over its prosecution of the war against christian and other rebels in its south prior to the september 11 attacks the state department said it was engaged in discussions with sudan with the objective of getting sudan completely out of the terrorism business and off the terrorism list46 the administration has praised sudans cooperation with the us investigation of qaeda and the september 11 plot in recognition of this cooperation the administration did not block security council vote on september 28 2001 to lift sanctions on sudan in recent years sudan has signaled willingness to assuage international concerns about its support for terrorism in august 1994 sudan turned over the terrorist carlos ilyich ramirez sanchez to france in december 1999 sudans president umar hassan albashir military leader politically sidelined sudans leading islamist figure hassan alturabi in february 2001 turabi was arrested and has remained under house arrest since may 2001 turabi was one of the primary proponents of sudans ties to regionwide islamic movements including qaeda the abu nidal organization hamas pij egypts islamic group and jihad hizballah and islamist rebel movements in east africa the ties that prompted the united states to place sudan on the terrorism list in august 1993 according to patterns 2000 by the end of 2000 sudan had signed all 12 international conventions on combating terrorism one issue that apparently has been resolved is sudans compliance with three security council resolutions adopted in 1996 1044 of january 31 1054 of april 26 and 1070 of august 16 the resolutions demanded that sudan extradite the three islamic group suspects in the june 1995 assassination attempt against president mubarak in ethiopia restricted the number of sudanese diplomats abroad and authorized suspension of international flights by sudanese aircraft although the last measure was never put into effect according to the washington post of august 21 2001 the bush administration has concluded that sudan has ended its

sudans behavior on the issue us envoy for sudan former senator john danforth was appointed on september 6 2001 there is lingering resentment among some sudanese against the united states because of the august 20 1998 cruise missile strike on the alshifa pharmaceutical plant in khartoum conducted in conjunction with the strike on bin ladens bases in afghanistan the united states destroyed the plant on the grounds that it was allegedly contributing to chemical weapons manufacture for bin laden although the clinton administration asserted that the alshifa strike was justified several outside critics maintained that the plant was genuine pharmaceutical factory with connection to bin laden or to the production of chemical weapons the plant owners 24 million in usbased assets were unfrozen by the administration in 1999 move widely interpreted as tacit us admission that the strike was in error iraq47 usiraq differences over iraqs regional ambitions and its record of compliance with postgulf war ceasefire requirements will probably keep iraq on the terrorism list as long as saddam husayn remains in power some us officials want to expand the war on terror to iraq despite lack of hard evidence of iraqi involvement in the september 11 attacks president bush in his january 292002 state of the union message suggested iraq was part of an axis of evil along with north korea and iran statement that some took as an indication that the united states would eventually take action against iraq even those us officials who oppose extending the war to iraq assess iraqs record of compliance with its postwar obligations as poor and its human rights record as abysmal however international pressure on iraq on these broader issues appears to have constrained iraqs ability to use terrorism patterns 2000 as have the past few patterns reports notes that iraq continues to plan and sponsor international terrorism although iraqs activities are directed mostly against antiregime opposition those iraq holds responsible for its past defeats or bodies that represent or implement international sanctions against iraq these trends apparently accord with recent central intelligence agency judgments of iraqs terrorism policy according to new york times report of february 6 2002 that press report added that the cia has evidence iraq has planned antius terrorism since it organized failed assassination plot against former president george hw bush during his april 1993 visit to kuwait which triggered us retaliatory missile strike on iraqi intelligence headquarters the times report also 47 for further information see crs issue brief ib92117 iraqi compliance with ceasefire agreements by kenneth katzman crs36 said that the cia is convinced iraq has not provided chemical or biological weapons to qaeda or other terrorist groups among recent developments in october 1998 iraqi agents allegedly planned to attack the praguebased radio free iraq service of radio free europeradio liberty although attack occurred czech officials say an iraqi intelligence officer in prague met with september 11 lead hijacker muhammad atta in early 2001 reportedly to discuss an attack on the radio facility some observers believe the meeting suggests an iraqi role in the september 11 attacks iraq which historically has had close ties to yasir arafat has given some support to antipeace process palestinian groups and hosts the abu nidal organization abu abbas palestine liberation front and other minor groups as lever in its relations with iran iraq continues to host and provide some older surplus weaponry to the pmois army the national liberation army nla which has bases near the border with iran however iraq apparently has reduced support for the group as iraqs relations with tehran have improved over the past two years table 2 blocked assets of middle east terrorism list states as of end 2000 country assets in us 232 million consisting of blocked diplomatic

near eastern terrorism prior to september 11 there was little agreement on strategy for countering the terrorism threats discussed above the apparent success of the us military campaign against the taliban and qaeda in afghanistan apparently has prompted wider acceptance of the utility of military force than was the case previously observers tend to agree that the continued success against qaeda and other terrorist groups will depend on sustained bilateral multilateral or international cooperation with us efforts not all options focus on pressuring states or groups some experts believe that diplomatic engagement with some state sponsors and us efforts to address terrorists grievances could be more effective over the long term the united states has claimed some successes for its policy of pressuring state sponsors but there are signs that the united states is now incorporating greater degree of engagement into its policy framework at the same time the united states has not dropped the longstanding stated us policy of refusing to make concessions to terrorists or of pursuing terrorism cases politically or legally as long as is needed to obtain resolution an exhaustive discussion of us efforts to counter terrorism emanating from the region is beyond the scope of this paper but the following sections highlight key themes in us efforts to reduce this threat49 military force the success of the us military against the taliban movement of afghanistan that had protected the qaeda organization has according to many experts validated the utility of military force against terrorism some believe that many governments are now moving against qaeda cells and other terrorist groups present in their countries fearing that us military force might be used against regimes that tolerate the presence of terrorist groups advocates of broad application of military force believe that military action against qaeda in afghanistan has severely disrupted that organizations ability to plan new acts of terrorism skeptics of further military action maintain that conditions in afghanistan are unique and that the antiterrorism campaign in afghanistan cannot easily be replicated elsewhere us officials say that the continued campaign against qaeda might unfold differently elsewhere including the use of us military advisers to help governments destroy qaeda sanctuaries in other countries us military attacks were conducted in retaliation for terrorist acts sponsored by libya and iraq as well as those allegedly sponsored by qaeda on april 15 1986 the united states sent about 100 us aircraft to bomb military installations in libya the attack was in retaliation for the april 2 1986 bombing of berlin nightclub in which 2 us military personnel were killed and in which libya was implicated on june 26 1993 the united states fired cruise missiles at the 49 further discussion of these issues is provided by crs issue brief ib10119 terrorism and national security issues and trends by raphael perl crs38 headquarters in baghdad of the iraqi intelligence service which allegedly sponsored failed assassination plot against former president george bush during his april 14 16 1993 visit to kuwait other us retaliation against iraq since 1991 has been triggered by iraqi violations of ceasefire terms not related to terrorism the august 20 1998 cruise missile strikes against the bin laden network in afghanistan represented us strike against group not state sponsor the related strike on pharmaceutical plant in sudan could have been intended as signal to sudan to sever any remaining ties to bin laden the effectiveness of other us military action against terrorist groups or state sponsors is difficult to judge libya did not immediately try to retaliate after the 1986 us strike but many believe that it did eventually strike back by orchestrating the pan am 103 bombing since the 1993 us strike iraq has avoided terrorist attacks against high profile us targets but it has continued to challenge the united states on numerous issues related to its august 1990 invasion of kuwait the 1998 airstrikes against qaeda did not prompt the taliban leadership to extradite or expel bin laden from afghanistan nor did the strikes deter bin ladens network from engaging in further terrorist activities including september 11 unilateral economic sanctions the united states has been willing to apply economic sanctions unilaterally particularly against state sponsors of terrorism in an effort to pressure those states to expel terrorist groups they host analysts doubt that unilateral us economic sanctions by themselves can force major changes in the behavior of state sponsors of terrorism major us allies did not join the us trade ban imposed on iran in may 1995 and the move did not in itself measurably alter irans support for terrorist groups on the other hand virtually all middle eastern terrorism list states have publicly protested their inclusion on the list and other us sanctions suggesting that these sanctions are having an effect politically andor economically us officials assert that us sanctions even if unilateral have made some terrorism state sponsors think twice about promoting terrorism to demonstrate that improvements in behavior can be rewarded in april 1999 the clinton administration announced that it would permit on casebycase basis commercial sales of us food and medical products to libya sudan and iran the move relaxed the bans on us trade with the three countries as noted previously all three have recently shown some signs of wanting to improve their international images terrorism list sanctions under number of different laws50 the placement of country on the terrorism list triggers wide range of us economic sanctions including 50 the list of sanctions are under the following authorities section 6j of the export administration act as amended pl 9672 50 usc app 2405 j section 40 of the arms export control act as amended pl 90629 22 usc 2780 and section 620a of the foreign assistance act of 1961 as amended pl 87195 22 usc 2371 and section 1621 of the international financial institutions act 22 usc 262c crs39 ban on direct us foreign aid including exportimport bank guarantees ban on sales of items on the us munitions control list requirement that the united states vote against lending to that country by international institutions strict licensing requirements for sales to that country which generally prohibit exports of items that can have military applications such as advanced sensing computation or transportation equipment us trade ban has been imposed on every middle eastern terrorism list state except syria under separate executive orders placement on the terrorism list does not automatically trigger total ban on us trade with or investment by the united states in addition foreign aid appropriations bills since the late 1980s have barred direct and indirect assistance to terrorism list and other selected countries and mandated cuts in us contributions to international programs that work in those countries as shown in table 2 above the united states also tries to maintain some leverage over terrorism list states and groups by blocking some of their assets in the united states some us sanctions are secondary sanctions imposing penalties on countries that help or arm terrorism list countries sections 325 and 326 of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act pl 104132 amended the foreign assistance act by requiring the president to withhold us foreign assistance to any government that provides assistance or lethal military aid to any terrorism list country in april 1999 three russian entities were sanctioned under this provision for providing antitank weaponry to syria sanctions on the russian government were waived noncooperating list the 1996 antiterrorism act also gave the administration another option besides placing country on the terrorism list section 303 of that act created new list of states that are deemed not cooperating with us antiterrorism efforts and provided that states on that list be barred from sales of us munitions list items under that provision and every year since 1997 afghanistan along with the seven terrorism list countries has been designated as not cooperating us allies have been designated as not cooperating although the provision was enacted following an april 1995 incident in which saudi arabia did not attempt to detain hizballah terrorist imad mughniyah when plane on which he was believed to be passenger was scheduled to land in saudi arabia51 possibly in an attempt to avoid similar incidents on june 21 1995 president clinton signed presidential decision directive 39 pdd39 enabling us law enforcement authorities to capture suspected terrorists by force from foreign countries that refuse to cooperate in their extradition52 51 hizballah denies mughniyah on board plane fbisnes95079 apr 25 1995 p44 52 policy on terror suspects overseas washington post february 5 1997 crs40 the clinton administration rejected several outside recommendations most recently those issued in june 2000 by the congressionally mandated national commission on terrorism to place afghanistan on the terrorism list the clinton administration said that placing afghanistan on the list would imply that the united states recognizes the taliban movement as the legitimate government of afghanistan position later adopted by the bush administration however president clinton on july 4 1999 issued executive order 13129 imposing sanctions on the taliban that are similar to those imposed on terrorism list countries and on foreign terrorist organizations the order imposed ban on us trade with areas of afghanistan under taliban control froze taliban assets in the united states and prohibited contributions to taliban by us persons the clinton administration justified the move by citing the talibans continued harboring of bin laden also in its june 2000 report the national commission on terrorism recommended naming greece and pakistan as not fully cooperating with us anti terrorism efforts the clinton administration rejected those recommendations as well in patterns 2000 the state department implied that pakistan and lebanon were potential candidates for the terrorism list or possibly the not cooperating list for supporting or tolerating operations by terrorist groups53 on the other hand patterns 2000 did credit both pakistan and lebanon with antiterrorism cooperation in selected cases in the aftermath of the september 11 attacks and pakistans decision to align itself with the us war effort the united states has praised pakistans cooperation lifted us sanctions and begun new foreign assistance program for that country multilateral sanctions in concert with us unilateral actions the united states has sought to enlist its friends allies and other countries to employ multilateral sanctions against middle eastern terrorism as noted above the united states led efforts to impose international sanctions on libya and sudan for their support of terrorism and both those states sought to distance themselves from terrorist groups this suggests that the perception of isolation caused by the sanctions was factor in the terrorism policy decisions of these countries in 1998 and 1999 the united states and russia jointly worked successfully to persuade the united nations security council to adopt sanctions on the taliban because of its refusal to extradite bin laden security council resolution 1267 adopted october 15 1999 banned flights outside afghanistan by its national airline ariana and directed member states to freeze taliban assets the united states and russia teamed up again to push another resolution security council resolution 1333 adopted december 19 2000 that among other measures imposed an international arms embargo on the taliban only not on opposition factions54 these measures began to be implemented just prior to the september 11 attacks but did not cause the taliban to waiver in its refusal to hand over bin laden 53 patterns 2000 p 32 54 miller judith russians join us to seek new sanctions on taliban new york times august 4 2000 crs41 counterterrorism cooperation successive administrations have identified counterterrorism cooperation with friendly countries as key element of us policy in one important regional example the united states has sought to contain hizballah by providing military and law enforcement assistance to the government of lebanon in the past few years the united states has sold lebanon nonlethal defense articles such as armored personnel carriers in 1994 on onetime basis the united states provided nonlethal aid including excess trucks and equipment to palestinian authority security forces in an effort to strengthen them against hamas and pij prior to september 11 the united states had been expanding counterterrorism dialogue with russia and the central asian states against islamic militant groups linked to qaeda all of these countries subsequently aligned themselves openly or tacitly with the us war against the taliban and qaeda every year since 1999 the state department hosted multilateral conference of senior counter terrorism officials from the middle east central asia and asia focusing on combating the terrorism threat from afghanistan these conferences and meetings have often resulted in agreements to exchange information to conduct joint efforts to counter terrorist fundraising and to develop improved export controls on explosives and conventions against nuclear terrorism55 for the past few years the united states has been providing some detection equipment and few million dollars in financial assistance to the central asian states to help them prevent the smuggling of nuclear and other material to terrorist groups such as qaeda the measure yielded some results in april 2000 when uzbek border authorities used this equipment to detect and seize ten containers with radioactive material bound for pakistan56 the united states has worked with the european union eu to exert influence on iran to end its sponsorship of terrorism in exchange for relaxing enforcement of us sanctions under the iranlibya sanctions act pl 104172 which would have sanctioned eu firms that invest in irans energy industry in mid 1998 the united states extracted pledge from the eu to increase cooperation with the united states against iranian terrorism in may 1998 the eu countries agreed on code of conduct to curb arms sales to states such as iran that might use the arms to support terrorism however the code is not legally binding on the eu member governments57 terrorism fundraising cooperation in january 2000 the united states signed new international convention for the suppression of terrorist financing which creates an international legal framework to investigate those involved in terrorist financing since september 11 the united states has made cooperation against terrorism fundraising major priority in its dealings with other countries 55 patterns 1998 p v 56 bryen stephen the new islamic bomb washington times april 10 2000 57 plan still lets rogue states buy arms associated press may 26 1998 crs42 particularly middle eastern countries where much of the fundraising for qaeda is conducted selective engagement as noted in the discussions of terrorism list countries the administration has shown increasing willingness to engage state sponsors once these countries have demonstrated some willingness to curb support for terrorism us officials justify engagement with the argument that doing so creates incentives for terrorism list countries to continue to reduce their support for international terrorism on the other hand critics believe that terrorism list countries are likely to view us policy of engagement as sign that supporting terrorism will not adversely affect relations with the united states of the middle eastern terrorism list countries the united states engages in bilateral dialogue with all except iran and iraq the united states has called for dialogue with iran but iran has thus far refused on the grounds that the united states has not dismantled what iran calls hostile policies toward that country formulation widely interpreted to refer to us sanctions iraq has asked for direct talks with the united states but the united states has rejected the suggestion on the grounds that iraq is too far from compliance with gulf warrelated requirements to make official talks useful legal action legal action against terrorist groups and state sponsors had become an increasingly large component of us counterterrorism strategy although the september 11 attacks and us military response has to some extent diminished support among observers for this option in the case of the bombing of pan am 103 the bush administration chose international legal action trial of the two libyan suspects over military retaliation similar choice has apparently been made in the khobar towers bombing case although that legal effort consists of us indictments of suspects and not uncentered legal effort the united states is planning to try some qaeda fighters captured in afghanistan although the us strategy has been primarily to defeat qaeda militarily rather than treat the september 11 attacks primarily as criminal case congress has attempted to give victims of international terrorism legal option against state sponsors the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 section 221 created an exception to the foreign sovereign immunity for certain cases 28 usc section 1605 allowing victims of terrorism to sue terrorism list countries for acts of terrorism by them or groups they support since this provision was enacted number of cases have been brought in us courts and several multimillion dollar awards have been made to former hostages and the families of victims of groups proven in court to have been sponsored by iran in 2000 the clinton administration accepted compromise legislation to use general revenues to pay compensatory damage awards to these successful claimants with the stipulation that the president try to recoup expended funds from iran as part of an overall reconciliation in relations and settlement of assets disputes the provision called the crs43 justice for victims of terrorism act was incorporated into the victims of trafficking and violence protection act of 2000 pl 106386 the clinton and bush administrations have opposed directly tapping frozen iranian assets in the united states such as selling irans former embassy in washington on the grounds that doing so could violate diplomatic sovereignty or provoke attacks on us property or citizens abroad the domestic front the september 11 attacks have exposed the vulnerability of the united states homeland to middle easterninspired terrorism as other previous event the octobernovember 2002 anthrax mailings also exposed us vulnerabilities although it is not known whether these incidents were related to september 11 other middle easternrelated terrorism or activity by groups in the united states not connected to the middle east the september 11 attacks have sparked stepped up law enforcement investigation into the activities of islamic networks in the united states and alleged fundraising in the united states for middle east terrorism some observers allege that middle eastern terrorist groups including qaeda have extensive political networks in the united states working from seemingly innocent religious and research institutions and investment companies58 pij leader shallah before being tapped to lead pij taught at the university of south florida in the early 1990s and ran an affiliated islamic studies institute called the world and islam studies enterprise wise some observers believe that extraordinary security measures are needed to ferret out qaeda cells in the united states others have challenged this view saying that most american muslims oppose the use of violence and donate money to organizations that they believe use the funds solely for humanitarian purposes some postseptember 11 us domestic counterterrorism efforts particularly those dealing with immigration and investigative powers have drawn substantial criticism from us civil liberties groups which have expressed concern about excessive intrusions by law enforcement authorities some arabamerican and american muslim organizations have long complained that us residents and citizens of arab descent are unfairly branded as suspected terrorists and that this sentiment increased dramatically after september 11 as part of their criticism these organizations point to erroneous initial accusations by some terrorism experts that islamic extremists perpetrated the oklahoma city bombing in april 1995 58 emerson steven islamic terror from midwest to mideast wall street journal august 28 1995 for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31119
