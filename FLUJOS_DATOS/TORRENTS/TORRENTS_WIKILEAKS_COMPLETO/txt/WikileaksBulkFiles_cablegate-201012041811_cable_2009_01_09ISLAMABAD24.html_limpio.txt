14 b and d 1 s summary president zardari told the ambassador january 2 he would have choice but to respond militarily to an indian attack there was more politically sensitive issue in pakistan than kashmir he said zardari had been briefed by isi director general ltg pasha on his meeting with the dcia in washington and he had concurred in the release of the tearline information to be passed to the indians zardari also discussed his increasing frustration with nawaz sharifs government in the punjab whom he believed had tipped off jamaat uldawa jud about the assets freeze ordered by the federal government zardari discussed his concern about relations with india and his conviction that he and chief of army staff general kayani represented the best hope for better relations with india zardari needs additional resources for the police particularly in the federally administered tribal areas fata and northwest frontier province nwfp and he was looking forward to his upcoming trip to afghanistan end summary 2 s ambassador called on president zardari january 2 to discuss followup to the mumbai investigation zardari said he had been briefed by lt general pasha on his meeting with dcia and he had approved the release of tearline information to the indians he wanted to emphasize he and general kayani were fully committed to better relations with india he reminded the ambassador that it had only taken phone call from the us to ensure that pakistan did not oppose the usindia civil nuclear deal at the nuclear suppliers group zardari emphasized he had problem making decisions recalling that we had asked him to refuse the release of detainees in the context of peace deals when the army and isi were pressing to do so but he said there was way that he could let india attack pakistan many in the west did not understand the importance of kashmir in pakistani public opinion 3 c zardari indicated clearly that he was disinclined to repeal with 17th amendment which gives the president the power to appoint the service chiefs judges and the election commissioner he justified this on the grounds that the initiative had to come from parliament nawaz sharif lately has been pressing zardari to fulfill his electoral commitment to repeal this amendment which codified musharrafs legal framework order 4 s zardari said that he was increasingly losing patience with nawaz sharifs government in the punjab and he believed that confrontation was looming he said that pakistani muslim leaguenawaz chief minister shabbaz sharif had tipped off the jud about the unscr 1267 mandated asset freeze resulting in almost empty bank accounts information from moi does indicate that bank accounts contained surprisingly small amounts zardari suggested lahore principal officer might mediate between the pakistan peoples party ppp governor and shabbaz sharif who increasingly are publicly at odds ambassador noted that his government had been holding over nawazs head the supreme courts decision on nawazs eligibility to run for office zardari replied yes but it doesnt seem to be doing much good anymore zardari dismissed nawazs ability to bring crowds into the street in the punjab if his party was removed from the punjab government 5 s ambassador and zardari discussed us assistance issues particularly in regard to upcoming visits of as boucher and codel reed as usual zardari asked for additional support particularly to fund additional police in fata and nwfp which could hold territory after the army and the frontier corps moved out he said that he needed 100000 police in each province there are now 48000 police in nwfp and he needed equipment quickly he said that he was going to ask us to reprogram some of our funding since without security none of the other programs matter 6 s zardari confirmed again at the end of the conversation that pakistan would not allow nonstate actors to dictate state policy but that the gop would respond if the indians attacked he recommended report done in india which indicated that indian muslims are treated poorly and are among the least prosperous members of society he said that the bharatiya janata party bjp was trying to whip up antimuslim sentiment morever there were plenty of extremist groups in india that could have assisted lashkaretaiba 7 c ambassador asked about swat he said flatly they did not have the troops to hold it ambassador asked the status of asfandyar wali khan the head of awami national party who was ostensibly in charge of the nwfp government zardari just rolled his eyes 8 s zardari said his trip to afghanistan had been rescheduled for january 7 he laughed about the rumors that civilian military struggles in pakistan had prompted the delay in truth he said he did not like to fly in bad weather and he was worried about security ambassador had asked interior minister rehman malik several times about the status of brahamdagh bugti who is in exile in afghanistan readers will recall that the status of mr bugti was major bilateral irritant between afghanistan and the musharraf government since musharraf wanted bugti deported to pakistan by karzai to face justice for participation in separatist activities zardari said he was going to ask karzai to keep him in afghanistan bugti was now involved in conflicts for supremacy in his tribe zardari said that government was drafting legislation to give the balochis more autonomy and political control patterson
