and solutions lecture given on 4 july 1961 thank you well im very glad to see that youre all still alive i personally didnt think this was going to happen and im sorry for it its an accident we have great many processes though that we still could use and furthermore we could let them be used by somebody that read the bulletin and thought it was written in chinese thats about the only way weve just heard from your part of the world that routine 1 on two cases is showing absolutely change or gain of any kind whatsoever and this means what this means some gross error i mean security check is being run backwards or itll be gross error believe you know i mean itll be big and it is so unimaginably big that the instructor in this case doesnt imagine that it could be that big so doesnt look for anything like it you see like herbie the other day hes telling us well hes having terrible time and cant he omit all the rudiments from security check because his auditors just are spending nothing getting nothing done but the rudiments in security check and i tell him thirdofadial drop thinking its something else and then he of course on the ground and able to observe it finds out what his auditors dont know what thirdofadial drop is so theyve been setting it for anything you see but he never imagined this see he thought there was something basically wrong with the process or something of the sort now youre going to find out youre going to find out that the mistake which causes routine 1 not to operate is something like security check is not being done be security check that you would call security check see the auditor you know doing something weird you know and it isnt happening as security check and then youll find that routine 1 is probably operating with the cchs all out you know they got the idea that the cchs actually must bite this was mistake they were waking making week or two ago the cchs must each one must be made to bite before you leave it and that doesnt matter if it takes an intensive to get cch 1 to bite you go on running cch 1 until it bites and youre only entitled to leave the thing if it has bitten you see totally missing out the idea that if thing is flat its flat and twenty minutes worth of it its flat and thats it so they never nobody ever got any cchs run so youll find out somehow or another the cchs arent being run and somehow or another security check isnt being done and then routine 1 doesnt work female voice hmm maybe they dont know what cch is hm female voice maybe they dont know what cch is well i understand that just couple of weeks ago there was terrific yickleyackle on the subject of all the hgc had to go over to the academy if they found out the academy was teaching and running them entirely different and then somebody else had an entirely different idea of how they were run and they were all trying to straighten out and get some agreement well i understand they did come to an agreement but are these the cchs female voice sure you see that would be you see thats the gross error that you come up against with something like this somebody tells you suddenly that some process doesnt work on pc all right you say thats fine thats fine but the first thing we do is to find out if it was that process was it in any way being used thats the first thing we ask for rather than ah what process is going to run on this pc that could be an interesting thing okay enough of that weve got routine 1a operative here havent we female voice yes hm female voice yes is it working on anybody female voice yes female voice jolly good male voice sure is you like that you like that male voice oh yes well of course who would think in the midst of only i would be able to get simplicity on the subject of problems because of course i just realized that any time anybody has looked at the idea of auditing problems of course it has been problem how you did it i actually worked for very long time with problems to get some kind of an anatomy of them and we have fantastic array of technology as i gave you yesterday thats why i wanted to give you that lecture yesterday so that you had the gen on problems and its an interesting thing that anything could be as much of problem to man as the problems of man you see had an anatomy thats whats interesting or it was undoable or had any understandingness about it its the way we first entered the game on psychosis we had to assume that the main thing about psychotic was that it was all incomprehensible everything was incomprehensible and then if you had everything incomprehensible of course why that was it and everybody was trying desperately to understand psychosis and thats the only mistake the psychiatrist has made he hasnt actually done anything about psychiatry psychiatrosis he has labeled it hes identified various types and forms and then he has applied an extraordinary emergency remedy extraordinary just fantastic i mean its something on the order of well this fellows this fellow his leg keeps itching his leg keeps itching and well he has to scratch it and this is the order of remedy of psychiatry you know well cut it off so they cut his leg off see keeps itching now they have remedy theyre done you see right there thats the way theyre treating insanity when you use these heroic measures which are all out of proportion to the condition of course thats what you always wind up with theres never second trench theres never second ditch theres nothing to go into after youve electric shocked somebody what can you do and after youve given somebody prefrontal lobotomy well he can go pick up another body thats about it you know that kind of action but oddly enough in scientology now we have actually been able to do something about this weve been doing things about these if anybody wanted to sail in and do something about them the common denominator of the psychotic of course is problems the understandingness of problems winds up eventually to an understandingness of insanity when all the solutions become the problems and all the problems become the solutions of course you have your ne plus ultra aaaa all right now theres an additional condition theres further reach of this when the problems cant be the solutions you know the problems are the solutions thats one level now lets go down stage and lets invert it and the solutions and the problems longer can be matched or associated then we get tremendous number of solutions which themselves are the problems but which are not matched up to any problem and this i think if you look it over describes psychosis the person is being whole bunch of solutions to nonextant problems think it over you see psychotic in an institution he always carries roll of toilet paper with him and thats to wrap it around door knobs so that he wont have to touch any of the door knobs youll see them doing this quite its quite an ordinary mechanism freud observed lot of things like this he added quite an enormous amount of observation to the field hes now busily he was taken over you know by psychiatry and now hes being repudiated by psychiatry and now the next thing were going to find out according to marilyn who just wrote something on it were going to find out that the only psychiatry there is really is pavlovian that could happen to us one day you know i mean somebody takes over scientology you see tries to take over scientology somebody tries to take it over and then when theyve got full control of it invalidate it see and then knock it out and then say theres nothing left but brainwashing well the hope is there that they could do that because they continually are trying to come around and say that we do brainwashing see the so the hope must be extant its psychotic forecast of what their future they would like to have their future be theres always something you must know about these things though before you consider or give them tremendous dangerousness dont assign dangerousness to these things the psychosis is solution to nonextant problem the problem doesnt exist for the person who is solving it the person is living the solution to nonexistent problem i see im not reaching you too well here you know and when you see psychosis after its all described after this quote psychosis unquote is all described theres missing datum in the description so of course its incomprehensible see its been objectively described they havent described what problem it is that this behavior is solution to so of course the main part of the data is gone see you havent got the problem so its gone you got it male voice mmhm see so therefore you couldnt understand psychosis by observing behavior its incomprehensible because its 50 percent missing its like trying to understand an electric motor you see that has guts has leads terminals or guts now you walk along and you say what is this thing well maybe somebody did futuristic shell you see you see see its just the observed thing but theres the rest of it is not there so of course you couldnt frankly the cure of psychosis by addressing the psychosis is listen carefully now not possible you cannot cure psychosis by addressing the psychosis now you cannot cure an aberration by addressing the aberration why because youre running the still in the middle of the motion youre running the solution in the middle of the confusion the stable datum and the confusion youre trying to cure the stable datum and it is held in place by an existing confusion and youre not looking at the confusion youre looking at the cure youre looking at the stable datum youre looking at the motionless fact but of course it wont move out unless you get the motion off of it now you get an idea of whirlpool with the center of the whirlpool motionless but without that center the pool wouldnt whirl you see but for some reason or other the center of the whirlpool is motionless but all else is moving and that motionlessness continues to be motionless only because it has motion around it so you get the idea that yes if we could pluck out this motionless piece the whirlpool would cease to exist we get this idea but ill tell you something practice empirical practice in my efforts to do various things and combinations over very very long period of time have demonstrated that it is not possible to take the motionless piece out of the whirlpool you can take the whirlpool off the motionless piece but you cannot take the motionless piece off the whirlpool because the thing is being motionless only because the whirlpool isnt being confronted to put it into mental terms so here you have confusion and the stable datum here you have motion and motion here you have sound and silence here you have absolute location and change change surrounding location which is motionless here you have all these things now the solution is analogous to the motionless point in the middle of the whirlpool thats the solution and you cant pull the solution out and have the whirlpool disappear thats mentally it just just take my word for it it cant be done because if you leave the whirlpool there all thats going to happen is is new motionless point will arise and you can pick off an endless an infinity of motionless points off this motionlessness you could just go on forever picking up nomotion just forever but to pick the motion off of it ahha its very funny thing that everything that is wrong with thetan is what is right with thetan anything that is on the way upper tone scale that is right with thetan in fixed aberrated state at the bottom of the tone scale becomes what is wrong with the thetan at the highest upper level thetan can be motionless and at the lowest level he has to be its matter of determinism on the higher levels of the tone scale he can determine motionlessness but at the low level of the tone scale motionlessness is being determined for him and when this gets into the field of mechanics of course motionless is not being determined by another postulate it is being determined by the mechanics of motion if you want to see somebody stiffen and go still and actually this test by the way this is will amuse you but it doesnt work as test its the perfect lecture room test theoretically you see this thing is perfect ill tell you why it wont work in moment as demonstration people dont get it because im so im not going to do it im just going to tell you about it you stand fellow up and you shake your hands in front of his face youre going to demonstrate confusion and the stable datum you see youre making him the stable datum and you shake your hands violently in front of his face not threatening him particularly but just lot of motion you know fingers shaking and so forth in front of his face and you say now you say now there you are and there was the motion and point out to the rest of the class and the observers that he stood still and youll see it every time he actually freezes you know the person will sort of tend to freeze you know he goes still on you you show him the motion he goes still and now you say now isnt this wonderful demonstration and nobody gets it theyve all gone still and this stillness is stupidity so the person you have demonstrated it on doesnt get it at all its the most marvelous thing you ever tried to demonstrate i tried it up here at london hasi several years ago and i just couldnt get it across to the staff auditors you know i kept showing them you know one after the other i kept and they just kept getting stupider and stupider and stupider because then of course youre dealing with the absolute basic woof and warp of what happens to people that they withdraw from this motion and they get into fixed stillness you see well they wont confront the motion and yet they cant not confront the motion so they put up barrier against the motion which is stillness and they think that if they become still enough the motion will duplicate them or something and become still thats the last resort and then after that they just butter themselves all over the universe because theyre trying to move out of stillness and be stillness without of course actually confronting the motion and eventually they go into violent motion they eventually have place to even butter themselves anymore so they themselves become motion youll find out in goals assessment that it is the commonest thing in the world to have preclear come up with whole string of goals of get in motion they come up with this whole long string of goals it doesnt matter whether its in space opera or any other field they come up with race driving or something like that they come up with this long string of goals get in motion get in motion get in motion get in motion see what theyre actually trying to do is avoid the motion and they go back into the motion kabibliuboom see now after theyre audited for while and so forth theyll go on reverse course theyre liable to go into an obsessive stillness for while you know not want to go out or something like that when theyre out and then all of sudden they will go into motion only this time theyre in control of the motion see they become cause over the motion but at the time they give you this usually as whole string of goals theyre sure being the effect of motion to such degree that theyre the effect of stillness you see theyre driven out of stillness they cant be still and they themselves become the motion theyre the particle on the line the leaf in the breeze the pilot in the cockpit of the fighter plane hes got to go man go thats his motto go man go yet you look at this fellows life in general and he hasnt been going you say if you like speed that much well why arent you why arent you doing any race driving you see in actual fact theyve moved out of the motionless spot into the motion and are being the motion but factually the step upgrade is motionless from that spot so they do an awful lot of motionlessness which is very hard to understand hard for everybody to understand the person who cant leave the house well there are certain motions around that are just too motion see and they mustnt go out and confront this motion and theyre doing noconfront of the motion which of course fixes them with the stillness and so they dont leave the house that is all this odd aberration is called you see of motionlessness this odd aberration of not leaving the house all it could be called is you see is noconfront of motion and we have case up in london whos been guinea pig ive done my best for this case and so forth ive given auditors direction on the case and so on but this cases motionlessness has now been audited for very close to eight years with the very best processes and the very best auditors and the case still stays in the house now you get what i mean now the practice on the line demonstrates that every time i havent any other reverse cases whenever motionlessness is audited and motionlessness is audited and motionlessness is audited and you audit nothing but the motionless all right what silence would you be willing to be see any process of that character all you do is stack up bunch of motionless points and the bank looks like its jamming now you can slightly differentiate the difference between motions but you cannot easily differentiate the difference amongst stillnesses so stillnesses identify more rapidly than motions now lets look again at psychosis the person is being one of these stills even while theyre being driven out into the agitation see theyre being still of some kind or another well what kind of still is it well the worst kind of insanity there is is catatonia not an agitated insanity its the insanity of total motionlessness catatonic state now thats deemed to be incurable why it isnt incurable at all im sure there are many things that you could do but you recognize that the fellow whos sitting there writing checks without checkbook without pen in his cell in the institution hes sitting there writing checks and he gives these invisible checks to the jailer and he gives invisible checks to this one and invisible checks to that one and hes always mailing them off in invisible envelopes its quite an interesting activity well when people try to cure him they try to find out all about these checks you see well factually he probably was simply business executive thats been driven mad by internal revenue you see and the thing thats wrong with him hasnt anything to do really with sitting still writing checks whats wrong with him is this was level of stillness to him at some time or another which became fixed solution to some other very motionful problem now look just try to throw your imagination across this and you could see easily that there could be thousand problems to which sitting still and writing invisible checks would be solution to some writers when they finally finally go around the bend its right immediately after they they usually wind up as their last ditch is writing for the saturday evening post and readers digest and they take off from there and they want to watch out from that point there on because thats just one step you see close to writing at all they almost wiggle in the chair and they move over into writing at all well that fellow had better watch it because hes liable to be out in the park one day and all of sudden pick up an invisible pen you see or invisible typewriter and start typing an invisible story and there he is you see and matter of fact there are many cases of this thats very common very common fellow sitting still writing an invisible story on invisible paper very common well thats what the fellow gets for writing for the saturday evening post and readers digest thats all i say its good enough for him now those are the great organs of mediocrity the great organs of mediocrity i absolutely despise publication that intends to achieve nothing but mediocrity its like i respect skid row bum if he has set out to be the bummiest skid row bum that anybody has ever heard of you see hes really willing to work at it ill respect him ill respect him but if hes just trying to be mediocre skid row bum why im afraid i dont have much respect for him but if he starts to work at being mediocre skid row bum im afraid my contempt knows bounds i wouldnt even confront him in steinbeck now the substance of this is the fellow has added up all skid row bums see so hes got an average skid row bum so hes not trying to be one skid row bum you see hes trying to be all skid row bums now thats very interesting state to be in and its like this magazine the saturday evening post which doesnt even come out on saturday evening and wasnt founded by benjamin franklin and its sort of trying to be all magazines at the same time you see and there it is working hard to be all magazines and never publishing anything brilliant really you see never publishing anything bad and never publishing anything good it has stated editorial policy if you please that it has stated and released statements on that it wishes never to publish brilliant writer or bad writer but just mediocre medium writer because thats what really appeals to everybody and thats their editorial policy well when somebody is going out to be average he isnt really being himself at all hes being everybody so of course youve got one of these butteredallovertheuniverse cases see hes promptly being everybody he wants to be an average what the hell is this there are individuals there cant be an average individual there could be an individual who has the same iqs or characteristics as other individuals but there cant be an average individual im not quibbling with the thing there can be however fellow who is trying to be an awful lot of other individuals and therefore is buttered all over in terms of beingness now that fellow will be obsessively in still thats for sure the stills which you will run off of that case are fabulous and hes right next door to going around the bend dont kid yourself the operations which this universe uses to make person assume the average and try to convince him to be the average are so numerous that they appear not odd to you you see or nothing reprehensible about this theyve been completely dulled down on this particular subject because the operations are so innumerable you know you mustnt really stick your head above the crowd you know and you mustnt get down underneath the crowds feet either you must just be the crowd now how the hell can you just be the crowd id like wish somebody would tell something and this thetan is going to occupy all of these bodies called crowd simultaneously huh well that means of course he isnt occupying his own body and thats the first thing youd find out about in processing the one thing he isnt occupying is his own body so what can he do if he thinks of himself as being everybody else then every time he breathes wrong he will have qualms because of course hes made everybody else breathe wrong you got the idea so if he thinks an abstruse or an abtuse obtuse thought in any way at all this is liable to have terrible consequences because some child going to school in china might be thinking might have to think this thought you see and that would be terrible because not because of anything else but that hed be thinking the thought but hed be thinking the thought in china you get the idea its not that he you find out in the final analysis that he has specialized in murdering children in china see but he actually is not worried about the child in china hes worried about the fact that he is in china you see see hes actually the most selfcentered person in the world while being buttered all over the universe all right insanity is right next door to that so person is never himself and therefore by addressing the solution which he is being and lets put definition in right here insanity is solution its the adaption of solution the obsessive adaption of solution to the exclusion of all other solutions in the absence of problem got that theres problem there but the fellow sure got solution and he cant be any other solution now the one thing you cant do to this insane person is say well now why dont you put these three rocks that you must put on your window sill every evening before you go to bed why dont you put these three rocks on the chair you say now ill help you out because they keep falling off the window sill and waking you up you see the person keeps brushing them off well put them on the chair and the person will go along with this merely because he cant do anything to you and you put them over on the chair and then you leave the room and you come back and the rocks are on the window sill see youll explain to him that this is what is waking you up and why you cant sleep you see and so forth and youll always find the rocks on the window sill now this looks pretty daffy but what problem is he solving and thats the question you must always ask of insanity what problem is this fellow solving because hes obsessively being solution to problem which he doesnt know about and cannot confront to the exclusion of ever changing to the exclusion of ever really looking at any problem because if youll notice the number of problems which they create are just innumerable if they would just go on through life being this solution to the problem we wouldnt argue about it or worry about it very much but theyre not content with this because theyre the one solution to nonexistent problem all problems with this person are on automatic and the number of problems which occur in their vicinity practically cant be counted well they all they have to do is get into an automobile and the motor doesnt start and all of sudden the battery goes down and two tires go flat and you say what on earth is this all about it looks absolutely telepathically teleportationally mysterious beyond all mystery youll find theres probably very logical connection between this or something but thats the truth with them theyre just surrounded all the time by problems you sign them one of the things registrars should know in central organizations is when they hand the person writing pen to sign contract and the pen doesnt write take the pen back and take the contract back this is not your average condition these are pretty extreme and theyre very recognizable youll find out that when you put one of these in an hgc for instance that all of sudden clear up on the third floor of the building next door youve got problems youve got problems man youve got problems out on the front walk and youve got problems in the basement and youve got problems every place problems you never dreamed existed around there and not only that theyve got most of the people in their family on full automatic on problems and youll have all those on your neck giving them giving their versions of all these problems you see youll find out you cannot even mail them letter try and do it theyve given you the address and everything and you stamp it carefully and so forth but my golly by the time you get through this letter will have gone to tanganyika and just nothing can nothing can permit this letter just wont ever arrive thats all but in the process of not arriving man does it sure carom off lot of places dont be surprised if you have the whole postal department down there on your neck you know trying to find out why this letter see why you see and yet you look at it and apparently its just an operation of you wrote simple letter and you put it in an envelope with the proper address and put stamp on it and put it in the postbox and it looks to you like it ought to be then picked up by the post office department and eventually delivered to this person but that is not what is going to happen i can assure you that is not and you can look through the files of central organizations where they have come into collision with person who should have been institutionalized long since and you will see some of the weirdest oddball communication curves you ever have cared read it is very funny you see the person confronts problems of any kind so in the final analysis of course all problems are on automatic and they just happen the person takes responsibility for any action of any character except being solution and the person goes on being this solution its just one solution thats all and itll be at the bottom of everything now there can be million problems there can be million problems but theres only one solution see that now when youre doing goals assessment youre actually covertly getting person to look at problems thats why they go null so its pretty good reach furthermore youre getting them to look at what they havent been doing which is to say while being they were trying to be b and so never asised anything about so you keep dropping them back and around and moving them on the track to all those areas where they werent being what they were being but were being something they werent being so we got asis and thats what happens in goals assessment now the lower harmonic or even perhaps the more direct approach is in routine 1a now if you wanted to see somebody go through the roof or out the window or down the spout run routine 1a on spinner i havent advocated that you do that we dont have very many people that are edgy and we certainly dont have any psychos you lack experience with psychos i can tell you that they when i say psycho the word youre crazy is used so carelessly in english language that so careless that people lose sight of the fact that there are these conditions that they do exist and that in the united states something like one out of every fifteen people including menninger have been in an institution at one time or another and before they take them to an institution they have to be pretty bad off or mixed up in politics one or the other and factually tour through an institution sometime put your collar on backward sometime or hang cross on your chest and take over your ministerial rating or something and go down to console the poor dead screamers that are inhabiting the local or some private sanitarium they usually wont let you into private sanitarium theyre holding down grandma and so on so they can collect the family fortune in there usually the people are in there for usual economic reasons for instance we have professional pc who caroms around in scientology like this and her brother every time he needs some money he gets her pronounced temporarily insane and then according to somebodys will he has the family fortune at his beck and call and this girl simply gets put in institutions and electric shocked and then the family is longer interested since theyve got what they wanted for the moment or something of the sort and then she gets out of the institution shes allowed to drift around for little while and then theres some economic bind comes along and they put her back into the institution this has been going on for years shes been breaking auditors hearts she even showed up one time in england here and promptly of course from various quarters and so on pressure was put on authorities and she was promptly put into an institution here in england and she walked out the front gate of it and turned around twice and so help pete was back into it i dont even know where she is now ive gotten ive lost track of this particular character weve rescued her out of too many gray walls you see but the gate there there seems to be strong wind blowing from outside and through that gate but its economics and but you go to public institution and the best thing to do to go near is public institution and like menningers fills up all the time and well menninger has his own clinic on one side of the river and after they all run out of money then he ferries them across the river to the state institution on the other side im not kidding you that is his modus operandi and practically nobody ever walked out of menningers front gate they go down and go across the river and they get put into the state institution where they dont cost anybody anything but state institutions are great are the great neglected state institutions and youll find lots of people in there that theyre real psychotics and it is actually something to look at real psychotic it is something to look at wow wow very impressive years ago i used to worry about them long time ago i thought this was something remarkable the only thing remarkable about it is the psychiatrist with his solution and of course your psychiatrist is not qandaing with any problems so therefore he never tries to solve insanity he qsandas with what this psychotic is being solution and when the psychiatrist qsandas with the psychotic the psychiatrist comes up with an obsessive solution you wouldnt even stand chance getting electric shock relieved in the united states you couldnt even legislate against it everybody would be pouring in there telling you this is the solution and you say at the same time has this ever cured anybody and they say it has never cured anybody and you say well why are you doing it well its what youre supposed to do who said youre supposed to do it well its what you do yeah all right has it ever cured anybody as matter of fact if we didnt electric shock anybody theyd get out of here weeks before well now look then therefore thats costing the taxpayer money isnt it and they say well yes but its the solution you see and if you wanted any greater proof than this i wouldnt think you would want any greater proof than this that what is the psychiatrist going to qanda with hes going to qanda with psychotic thats for sure because he has answers to amount to anything so you just now examine the psychiatrists fixation on the idea of solution you give him an unworkable solution and hes very happy and hell never change his mind that is the solution and that is it and you talk to psychiatrist and you try to tell him all about scientology see and you say itll do this and do that oh yes he agrees with you he probably thinks it does he doesnt think that it doesnt work what youre going up against is the fact that he is himself being an obsessive solution see he is solution what kind of solution is he being well hes psychiatrist you say yeah well all right this is what gets on your nerves all the time the guy cant cure insanity he cant do anything about psychosomatic illnesses and yet continually everybody is referring to him but he is psychiatrist and you say very good now what has this got to do with it the person who handles the mind should be able to handle the mind and everybody in the state and psychiatrists and the medical profession they all look at you and they give you this complete non sequitur theyll say yes but hes psychiatrist you say all right lets go over this again slowly do you good at all the man that is the societys solution and of course its just held in place rirrrr crunch see and the psychiatrist cures are just held in place rirrrr crunch see and when you come along and you say why dont you do something practical youre asking fixated solution to change which isnt aware of any problem and thats the mystery of psychiatry they dont recognize that psychosis is problem in the society psychosis is not problem and therefore you would have some very odd conversations with the psychiatrists of this institution you visited these conversations would sound very odd to you youd say this guy is nuts well thats right but youre talking to fellow who is being an obsessive solution and that is all he is being he isnt being anything else he doesnt have chance to be anything else why because hes handling only people who are obsessive solutions now theyre being obsessive solutions because they have view of any problems of any kind whatsoever and not slightest idea of problem ever existing they have idea that they are problems to anybody you can say to psychotic do you realize after theyve splattered pitcher of milk all over the room you can say to him do you realize somebodys going to have to clean up this pitcher of milk splattered all over the room you have not reached them that does not communicate that somebody else has problem or that any problem exists does not communicate theres communication on the subject of problems you can talk in vain you see what im talking about so if psychiatry in its various studies has pursued course of research it has been research of solutions but what would you think of group who continued to solve problem they didnt know existed you say why are you institutionalizing these people and theyll give you the most oddball answers but they will never give you the obvious answer theyre menace to their family and society and therefore should be locked up that is not the straight answer but you know thats the answer youd get if you asked them you know that because thats sensible answer but thats not the answer youd get you get all sorts of odd answers and they speak about cure theyre continuously speaking about cure either they hate anybody who says they can cure anything so while being the solution they hate solutions so you can get whole series of solutions set up and you can examine these solutions forever and you say well where are we what are we at what are we looking at here well were looking at solutions well please in research and please in working with the mind never make the mistake that man has now made all the time hes been on the track look if theres solution there must have been problem look at the ten commandments which are 162 you know im beginning to believe the ministry cant count i looked that up the other day how many commandments there really were you know theres pages of them and everybody keeps talking about the ten commandments and some versions of the bible have qedandaed with the fact that there are supposed to be ten commandments and they dragged in ten commandments and they got ten commandments in them but full bible has just got commandments commandments commandments commandments commandments man you dont know whether youre coming or going when you finally get to the end of all these commandments because you take any group of five and at least two contradict confusing man these are all solutions the only thing theyve listed is solutions and thats why you dont like moral codes because moral codes are solutions to problems which arent announced and you can therefore define moral code technically moral code is series of solutions to problems which have not been confronted or analyzed and you get upset about moral codes thou shalt not drink pitchers of milk after three pm before thy parents or something like this do you realize that almost all of those commandments which are in the bible at this particular time that we call the ten commandments are prompted by some obsessive crimes that existed at that state of the game and that several of these commandments are solutions to venereal disease isnt that interesting i think its fascinating i see those archbishops now standing up there with the little choirboys all singing and the harps drumming or whatever they do and swinging incense burners around their head like slingshots and going through it all and everybody dropping nickels on the drums and so forth because theyre solving venereal disease i think thats terribly interesting why didnt they invent penicillin look what we would have been spared man ive actually managed to shock even you little bit look them over look them over you think im kidding you the next time you run into copy of this thing read them over and find out how many of them are solutions to venereal disease you see that was problem that descended on them that they could know nothing about that was problem that descended on them from various quarters of the world and finally descended upon them from the new world and they didnt know what the devil cooked here but they got lot of solutions but they never looked at the problem and the problem of course was inherent in the basis that there were some quote sexual practices they had enormous numbers of practices whereby there was supposed to be sex they were already preventing sex dont you see so they turn around on the other side of the picture and they say well leave all those in place and now we will solve this other thing while leaving all of the things that are causing the problem you see in place we will now get some new solutions thats the one thing they didnt need man yeah they already had about forty too many solutions they had actually prevented morality at an ethical level see and then invented an immorality with whole bunch of new morals im telling you this not because im yipyapping about the christian church but solutions solutions the more you have to do with solutions in straightening out human conduct the less gain youre going to make and thats all there is to that thats all im trying to tell you the more you have to do with solutions for the third dynamic the less third dynamic youre going to have because solution by definition is nonconfront of the problem and you get fixed confront of the solution well if everybody is facing inboard while the enemy is attacking the gates all hell is going to break loose i promise you everybody faces the courtyard you know the inner keep all the soldiers on the walls do nothing but look at the inner keep and there it stands stony silent massive impressive and they say well that will take care of us that will take care of us with their backs you see to the wall and the walls are being stormed now what do you suppose is going to happen to all these soldiers theyre going to get solution thats for sure theyre going to get somebody elses solution in hurry arent they so later on this is proven so unworkable this becomes so unworkable at length they try various means of this they face inward and eventually they take the keep you see and they make it have face and they have arms and you have stone idols and if you just look at this enough you see youre all set and dont go look that way look at the stillness you see and thats good now the next one that happens after this sort of thing of course is that even though there isnt war on everybodys looking at the muezzin in the minaret and hes saying alyalallah or something of the sort what does that mean father of evil anyhow they pray to this minaret see and everybody has to face in certain directions at certain times and of course this is good solution its good solution particularly for thieves in the market and you see we get more and more of these face the motionlessness contemplate the motionlessness contemplate the motionlessness contemplate look at the stillness look at the stillness face inward dont look outward does that sound like any religions you ever heard of meditate now if you just contemplate stillness enough youve got it made its an operation its the basic operation of the track i dont im not antichristian im just antioperation i believe its perfectly all right to do anything you want to to people i believe this is perfectly all right i run on very odd code its very peculiar for this universe its all right to do anything you want to as long as you dont say its something else or try to convince people youre doing something else thats where the crime comes in the entrance of the notknow or say youre doing something for some very wonderful purpose you see when as matter of fact youre doing it for quite another purpose which is not wonderful at all this you might say is evil and this is practically the only evil there is that drifts on down the line and i dont theres qualification to that is as long as you can do anything you want to as long as other people arent being completely plowed under by it greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics but that allows you an awful lot of latitude believe theres an awful lot of latitude in there but fighting in the dark up in black alley with poniard nah nah nah nah thats way to live man thats way to live they pick you out of the burning ghat and you dont go to hell you have to live with yourself which is about the only hell there is now where you have solution solution solution solution solution solution and nothing but solution and nothing but solution and nothing but solution and you never have problem problem problem problem problem you never see any of these problems these problems are never disclosed you never see any part of them nobodys ever asked to confront any of them and so forth of course the person winds up eventually just bthaaa solution you know hes walking solution but he doesnt even know what hes solution to thats whats grim its the notknow now when that stage is reached thats definition of an obsessive solution it is reaching the stage when one does not know what one is solution to and those are obsessive solutions or being an obsessive solution or when one is being terribly still he doesnt know what he is being still to counteract the motion of what see he doesnt know what motion hes trying to counteract by being still then only then does obsessive stillness enter so youve got notknow you see running through all of these things that is the bug factor now where you have an individual solving problems you dont have an evil there is nothing wrong with solving problems quite the contrary but an individual who has put all problems on automatic now cant solve problems if he does solve them itll be with some fantastic liability fabulous liability to the solution of problem hes liable to cave in terror stomach turn on oh my god all the things thatll happen to him if he solves problem so hes glumping down the street you see and he doesnt know where to go for the night and he doesnt know what to do and so forth and you say well why dont you go down to the ymca the first thing you get back is oh well it never occurs to you to ask him do you have another solution but it should because he hasnt he doesnt dare solve problem he just doesnt dare theyre not crazy you know thats not insane its just they dont dare solve problem when you have somebody around whos workman or something who is in this particular state everything sort of goes into fabulous decline of some character or another and you cant quite figure out what is happening here youll find every job in the place gets half done everything is half done and eventually the whole place is just torn to pieces and its in complete ribbons he isnt being evil he knows hes supposed to be working so hes trying to work without solving any problems because the terrible consequences of solving problem weigh down upon him mightily now you go up another stage and you get fellow who can solve problems of minor nature but cant solve problems of major nature and we very often hire them as executives not in scientology but we very often see these people around in organizations trying to be executives you know and all they can do is swell themselves up and practice pomposity or be mean to their juniors or something like this because they for sure dont dare really solve big problem the little problems about the ink wells yeah all right but the contract with blitz company do we accept it or do we reject it brrrr lets have board meeting is the usual answer isnt it lets hang everybody else with the responsibility for this thing now they know this is so dangerous that they will very often try to protect you by preventing you from solving problem and theyll keep feeding you all sorts of extraneous data to the problem that has nothing to do with the problem at all but theyre merely trying to protect you theyre not trying to confuse you because they know whats going to happen to you if you solve problem because they know what would happen to them if they solved major problem the consequences of it are fantastic now we move up the line we find fellow who can relax on this particular subject now the level of aberration of problem the level of aberration what it takes to be an aberrated solution you see we mustnt get the idea that all of it is very mild you see and this all runs at very low level we only see that when theyre accumulating as locks actually the problems they have tried to solve and the problems they have failed on and the problems they have proposed and the things which they couldnt confront that they did solve are pretty magnitudinous such as shall we wipe out this planet you see the problem was the planet is getting overpopulated and people are having rough time now the solution is shall we wipe out this planet or shall we practice immigration or what shall we do see to this problem of its all overpopulated and things arent going very well and nobodys very happy and this person took their finger off their number with magnitude see big magnitude and they said well the thing to do i guess is to wipe out the planet i know its bad thing but its the only thing we can do and they did and there they are now down in the spinbin see this kind of thing you see they make this they didnt confront the problem either through laziness or stupidity or irresponsibility or something they didnt confront this problem and it influenced more dynamics than just themselves and influenced them very heavily and they did some great wrong by not confronting the problem and they did some great wrong and after that the idea of problem there are problems around here everything is going along just fine you know the machinery is all busted down and the papers are all over the floor and theyre using the account books out there for doormat but everything is going fine yes everything is fine and thats why you sit see these guys see these guys sitting in the middle of absolute well you wouldnt call it an office youd call it catastrophe see and youll see guy sitting there and theres just stuff running out of the walls practically you know man they wouldnt dare touch any part of it see that itself would be theyd have to face this confusion theyd have to see the condition theyre in and when you see somebody living like that or somebody working like that one of two things are true either the stuff is avalanching in faster than they can cope with it but in that particular case theyre coping with it theyre getting something done so they can then straighten it out or youve got somebody that doesnt even know it is there doesnt even know its cascading in on him and youll go into this persons quarters or office or something and you look at him and you say why dont you straighten this place up and the person says what well thats the essence of what ive been trying to show you they dont even see the papers cascading all over the floor and the account books being used as ledger see which happens to be strangely enough doormat its not its not there its something they just got it all notised and if you can get the idea of this fellow sitting in this terribly untidy completely twistedup office without even knowing he has confused office space without even knowing he has the papers scattered all over the place without even knowing that hes got the floor dirty see and without even noticing that the lights dont go on and off anymore youve got an idea of thetan sitting in his bank and he says its all orderly and its all straight and theres nothing here and theres nothing confused you get the idea and there he is its all right so it must be wrong with them over there couldnt have anything here because ive got it all straight and you look at it and you say you do you do how very interesting but of course because you cant see the clutter that he is not taking any exception to why you just put it down to an odd behavior pattern and you say well hes behaving oddly well hes not behaving oddly hes confronting noly hes got big notis going on it all now when youre running anything you run it in an orderly fashion and you will at once get something done in the first place youre giving the person an orderliness to confront and he confronts this orderliness and he finds out that there is some motion that can be confronted and then hell confront little disorderliness and youll get somatic going through and then he confronts your orderliness of your process and then he confronts the disorderliness got the idea and hell confront little bit more and little bit more and little bit more now where you have individuals who are totally insane you have of course got confront of problems so dont expect 1a to work it wont 1a does not anywhere near go as far south as the cchs but itll work on most people but some of the phenomena it brings up is going to startle you its going to startle you this fellows got it all tame hes making it just fine of course hes sick whuuwhuhwhoo gatansuu ansooo and so forth but hes doing all right and therefore he doesnt need any auditing i always feel like taking violin out of my pocket and playing maybe so i really dont know your story sounds so queer all right you start running problems on this guy see and you say recall problem recall problem or think of problem or confront problem or anything you want to say recall problem is the one youre running and the best one and the individual says suuuuh im not sure about this and thisll happen to almost anybody whos member of the human race right now if you ran this particular process on them see what has ron been talking about all these years hes been talking about these things called ridges ridges oh well really ridges people have ridges its an interesting indictment of psychology that they dont believe there are any masses in the mind ridges ridges there are ridges and you run them on recall problem recall problem where the hell did this come from you see and the bank starts going solid and little avalanches occur and little things occur and somatics well youre just calling to his attention the fact that there were some problems around that were confusions and they were in motion and therefore the problem motion of course in counterpositions oppositions of confusion naturally add up to ridges and masses and so on so these things really start showing up this is the first time i can tell you truly that we have good cure for this type of mass and so forth that we run into in the mind its good its really good it bypasses the liability of curing it were doing the darnedest things here in scientology i mean the things were doing are absolutely incredible see i can tell you absolutely straight to your faces that you mustnt solve anything dont you see i mean thats what somebody would add this lecture up to see all the while telling you you can solve it and then you run it and you find out you can get away with it thats pretty weird you know thats pretty weird if you think it over in other words were enough on top of the mechanisms of existence and so on that we can pull the overtmotivator sequence without its consequences well what the hell you know i mean the guy that dreamed up that operation in the first place thats defeated you see the problemsolution sequence you see and we say all right you can sit there as an auditor and solve all this pcs problems by the way theres another index in psychiatry they do sit there and solve all the patients problems for them aaaah yep this is right about craziness thats for sure and the individual we tell him all right solutions man the only thing thats wrong the only reason people go crazy is solutions now go ahead and solve the pc but the fellow says but how how could you possibly do that you know i mean if you go crazy solving gosh uh hm must be something very evil about this yeah yeah only the road out of course has barriers you see thats the one thing that nobody ever looks at particularly you know you go out through all the gates of park and you go through the gates of the park and other people trying to leave the park keep walking over shrubs and getting branches in their faces and coming up against barbed wire and stone walls so that proves to them conclusively that youd better never go out of the park and we come walking along and were walking along this gravel path and admiring the view and we see the gate up ahead that were going through you know walking along and were moving out the gate we look at these people floundering over here in the brush and we say what the hell is the matter with them we said hey hey theres walk over here why dont you come over here and walk out the gate and they know they know the truth there is neither any walk nor any gate dont you get in that frame of mind okay
