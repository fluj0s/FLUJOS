card sponsors and depending on the facts of given case certain directors officers and employees of these entities may be liable directly under section 1320d6 based on general principles of corporate criminal liability24 other persons who obtain protected health information in manner that causes covered entity to release the information in violation of hipaa including recipients of protected information may not be liable directly the liability of persons for conduct that may not be prosecuted directly under section 1320d6 is to be determined by principles of aiding and abetting liability
