response to crisis exigency or emergency circumstances threatening the nation moreover they are not limited to military or war situations some of these authorities deriving from the constitution or statutory law are continuously av ailable to the president with little or qualification othersstatutory delegations from congressexist on standby basis and remain dormant until the president formally

communication regulate the operation of private enterprise restrict travel and in variety of ways control the lives of united states citizens furthermore congress may modify rescind or render dormant such delegated emergency authority until the crisis of world war i presidents utilized emergency powers at their own discretion proclamations announced the exercise of exigency authority however during world war i and thereafter chief executives had available to them growing body of standby emergency authority which became operative upon the issuance of proclamation declaring condition of national emergency sometimes such proclamations confined the matter of crisis to specific policy sphere and sometimes they placed limitation whatsoever on the pronouncement these activations of standby emergency authority remained acceptable practice until the era of the vietnam war in 1976 congress curtailed this practice with the passage of the national emergencies act

eighteenthcentury english philosopher john locke who had str ong influence upon the founding fathers in the united states preeminent exponent of government of laws and not of men locke argued that occasions may arise when the executive must exert broad discretion in meeting special exigencies or emergencies for which the legislative power provided relief or existing law granted necessary remedy he did not regard this prerogative as limited to wartime or even to situations of great urgency it was sufficient if the public good might be advanced by its exercise 1 emergency powers were first expressed prior to the actual founding of the republic between 1775 and 1781 the continental congress passed series of acts and resolves which count as the first expressions of emergency authority 2 these instruments dealt almost exclusively with the prosecution of the revolutionary war 1 thomas i cook ed two treatises of government by john locke new york hafner 1947 pp 203207 edward s corwin the

failed to attract much attention during the course of debate over the charter for the new government it may be argued however that the granting of emergency powers by congress is implicit in its article i section 8 authority to provide for the common defense and general welfare the commerce clause its war armed forces and militia powers and the necessary and proper clause empowering it to make such laws as are required to fulfill the executions of the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the united states or in any department or officer thereof there is tradition of constitutional interpretation that has resulted in socalled implied powers which may be invoked in order to respond to an emergency situation locke seems to have anticipated this practice furthermore presidents have occasionally taken an emergency action which they assumed to be constitutionally permissible thus in the american governmental experience the exercise of emergency powers has been somewhat dependent upon the chief executives view of the presidential office perhaps the president who most clearly articulated view of his office in conformity with the lockean position was theodore roosevelt describing what came to be called the stewardship theory of the presidency roosevelt wrote of his insistence upon the theory that the executive power was limited only by specific restrictions and prohibitions appearing in the constitution or imposed by the congress under its constitutional powers it was his view that every executive officer and above all every executive officer in high position was steward of the people and he declined to adopt the view that what was imperatively necessary for the nation could not be done by the president unless he could find some specific authorization to do it indeed it was roosevelts belief that for the president it was not only his right but his duty to do anything that the needs of the nation demanded unless such action was forbidden by the constitution or by the laws 3 opposed to this view of the pres idency was roosevelts former secretary of war personal choice for and actual successor as chief executive william howard taft he viewed the presidential office in more limited terms writing that the president can exercise power which cannot be fairly and reasonably traced to some specific grant of power or justly implied and included within such express grant as proper and necessary to its exercise in his view such specific grant must be either in the federal constitution or in an act of congress passed in pursuance thereof there is taft concluded undefined residuum of power which he can exercise because it seems to him to be in the public interest 4 between these two views of the presidency lie vari ous gradations of opinion resulting in perhaps as many conceptions of the office as there have been holders one authority has summed up the situation in the following words emergency powers are not solely derived from legal sources the extent of their invocation and use is also contingent upon the personal conception which the incumbent of the presidential office has of the presidency and the premises upon which he interprets his legal 3 theodore roosevelt an autobiography new york macmillan 1913 pp 388389 4 william howard taft our chief magistrate and his

determined by the president himself5 finally apart from the constitution but resulting from its prescribed procedures there are statutory grants of power for emergency conditions the president is authorized by congress to take some special or extraordinary action ostensibly to meet the problems of governing effectively in times of exigency sometimes these laws are only of temporary duration the economic stabilization act of 1970 for example allowed the president to impose certain wage and price controls for about three years before it expired automatically in 1974 6 the statute gave the president emergency authority to address crisis in the nations economy of course many of these laws are continuously maintained or permanently available for the presidents ready use in responding to an emergency the defense production act originally adopted in 1950 to prioritize and regulate the manufacture of military material is exemplary of this type of statute 7 finally there are various standby laws that convey special emergency powers once the president formally declares national emergency activating them in 1973 senate special committee studying emergency powers published compilation identifying some 470 provisions of federal law delegating to the executive extraordinary authority in time of national emergency 8 the vast majority of them are of the standby kinddormant until activated by the president however formal procedures for invoking these authoritie s accounting for their use and regulating their activation and application were established while ago by the national emergencies act of 19769 g22g145g142g561g7g150g142g155g144g142g151g140g162g561g5g152g151g140g142g153g157g561 relying upon constitutional authority or congressional delegations made at various times over the past 200 years the president of the united states may exercise certain powers in the event that the continued existence of the nation is threatened by crisis exigency or emergency circumstances what is national emergency in the simplest understanding of the term the dictionary defines an emergency as an unforeseen combination of circumstances or the resulting state that calls for immediate action 10 in the midst of the crisis of the great depression 1934 supreme court majority opinion characterized an emergency in terms of urgency and relative infrequency of occurrence as well as equivalence to public calamity resulting from fire flood or like disaster not reasonably subject to anticipation11 an eminent constitutional scholar the late edward s corwin explained emergency conditions as being those which have not attained enough of stability or recurrency to admit of their being 5 albert l sturm emergencies and the presidency journal of politics vol 11

on emergency powers in 1973 political scientist described an emergency in the following terms it denotes the existence of conditions of varying nature intensity and duration which are perceived to threaten life or wellbeing beyond tolerable limits13 corwin also indicated it connotes the existence of conditions suddenly intensifying the degree of exis ting danger to life or wellbeing beyond that which is accepted as normal14 there are perhaps at least four aspects of an emergency condition the first is its temporal character an emergency is sudden unforeseen and of unknown duration the second is its potential gravity an emergency is dangerous and threatening to life and wellbeing the third in terms of governmental role and authority is the matter of perception who discerns this phenomenon the constitution may be guiding on this question but not always conclusive fourth there is the element of response by definition an emergency requires immediate action but is as well unanticipated and therefore as corwin notes cannot always be dealt with according to rule from these simple factors arise the dynamics of national emergency powers 15 these dynamics can be seen in the history of the exercise of emergency powers g14g138g160g561g138g151g141g561g18g155g138g140g157g146g140g142g561 during the summer of 1792 residents of wester n pennsylvania virginia and the carolinas began forcefully opposing the collection of federal excise tax on whiskey anticipating rebellious activity congress enacted legislation providing for the calling forth of the militia to suppress insurrections and repel invasions16 section 3 of this statute required that presidential proclamation be issued to warn insurgents to cease their activity17 if hostilities persisted the militia could be dispatched on august 17 1794 president washington issued such proclamation the insurgency continued the president then took command of the forces organized to put down the rebellion 18 here was the beginning of pattern of policy expression and implementation regarding emergency powers congress legislated extraordinary or special authority for discretionary use by the president in time of emergency in issuing proclamation the chief executive notified congress that he was making use of this power and also apprised other affected parties of his emergency action 12 edward s corwin the president office and

ibid p 279 15 while some might argue that the concept of emergency powers can be extended to embrace authority exercised in response to circumstances of natural disaster this dimension is not within the scope of this report various federal response arrangements and programs for dealing with natural disasters have been established and administered with potential or actual disruption of constitutional arrangements with regard to corwins characterization of emergency conditions these longstanding arrangements and programs suggest that natural disasters do admit of their being dealt

laws for responding largely to military economic and labor emergencies during this span of years however the exercise of emergency powers by president abraha m lincoln brought the first great dispute over the authority and discretion of the chief executive to engage in emergency actions by the time of lincolns inauguration march 4 1861 seven states of the lower south had announced their secession from the union the confederate provisional government had been established february 4 1861 jefferson davis had been elected february 9 1861 and installed as president of the confederacy february 18 1861 and an army was being mobilized by the secessionists lincoln had little over two months to consider his course of action when the new president assumed office congress was not in session for reasons of his own lincoln delayed calling special meeting of the legislature but soon ventured into its constitutionally designated policy sphere on ap ril 19 he issued proclamation establishing blockade on the ports of the secessionist states 19 measure hitherto regarded as contrary to both the constitution and the law of nations except when the government was embroiled in declared foreign war20 congress of course had not been given an opportunity to consider declaration of war the next day the president ordered the addition of 19 vessels to the navy for purposes of public defense21 short time later the blockade was extended to the ports of virginia and north carolina22 by proclamation of may 3 lincoln ordered that the regular army be enlarged by 22714 men that navy personnel be increased by 18000 and that 42032 volunteers be accommodated for threeyear terms of service23 such directive of course antagonized many representatives and senators because congress is specifically authorized by article i section 8 of the constitution to raise and support armies in his july message to the newly assembled congress lincoln suggested that while his actions with regard to the expansion of the armed forces might be legally suspect these measures whether strictly legal or not were ventured upon under what appeared to be popular and public necessity trusting then as now that congress would readily ratify them it is believed he wrote that nothing has been done beyond the constitutional competency of c ongress 24 indeed congress subsequently did legislatively au thorize and thereby approve the presidents actions regarding his increasing armed forces personnel and would do the same later concerning some other questionable emergency actions in the case of lincoln the opinion of scholars and experts is that neither congress nor the supreme court exercised any effective restraint upon the president 25 the emergency actions of the chief executive were either unchallenged or approved 19 ibid vol 7 pp 32153216 20 clinton l rossiter constitutional dictatorship new york harcourt brace and world 1963 p 225 21 ibid 22 see james d richardson comp compilation of

to render judgment went largely without notice by the supreme cour t the president made quick response to the emergency at hand response which congress or the courts might have rejected in law but which nonetheless had been made in fact and with some degree of popular approval similar controversy would arise concerning the emergency actions of presidents woodrow wilson and franklin d roosevelt both men exercised ex tensive emergency powers with regard to world hostilities and roosevelt also used emergency authority to deal with the great depression their emergency actions however were largely supported by statutory delegations and high degree of approval on the part of both congress and the public furthermore during the wilson and roosevelt presidencies major procedural development occurred in the exercise of emergency powersuse of proclamation to declare national emergency and thereby activate all standby statutory provisions delegating authority to the president during national emergency the first such national emergency proclamation was issued by president wilson on february 5 1917 26 promulgated on the authority of statute establishing the united states shipping board the proclamation concerned water transportation policy27 it was statutorily terminated along with variety of other wartime measures on march 3 192128 president franklin d roosevelt issued the next national emergency proclamation some 48 hours after assuming office29 proclaimed march 6 1933 on the some what questionable authority of the trading with the enemy act of 191730 the proclamation declared socalled bank holiday and halted major class of financial transactions by closing the banks congress subsequently gave specific statutory support for the chief executives action with the passage of the emergency banking act on march 931 upon signing this legislation into law the president issued second banking proclamation based upon the authority of the new law continuing the bank holiday until it was determined that banking institutions were capable of conducting business in accordance with new banking policy32 next on september 8 1939 president roosevelt promulgated proclamation of limited national emergency though the qualifying term had meaningful legal significance33 almost two years later on may 27 1941 he issued proclamation of unlimited national emergency34 this action however actually did not make any important new powers available to the chief executive in addition to those activated by the 1939 proclamation the presidents purpose in making the second proclamation was largely to apprise the american people of the worsening conflict in europe and growing tensions in asia continued constitutional dictatorship pp 233234 and woodrow wilson

emergency remained operative until 1947 when certain of the provisions of law they had activated were statutorily rescinded35 then in 1951 congress terminated the declaration of war against germany36 in the spring of the following year the senate ratified the treaty of peace with japan because these actions marked the end of world war ii for the united states legislation was required to keep certain emergency provisions in effect initially the emergency powers interim continuation act temporarily maintained this emergency authority 37 it was subsequently supplanted by the emergency powers continuation act which kept selected emergency delegations in force until august 195338 by proclamation in april 1952 president harry s truman terminated the 1939 and 1941 national emergency declarations leaving operative only those emergency authorities continued by statutory specification39 president trumans 1952 termination however specifically exempted december 1950 proclamation of national emergency he had issued in response to hostilities in korea40 furthermore this condition of national emergency would remain in force and unimpaired well into the era of the vietnam war two other proclamations of national emergency also would be promulgated before congress once again turned its attention to these matters faced with postal strike president richard m nixon declared national emergency in march 197041 thereby gaining permission to use units of the ready reserve to assist in moving the mail42 second national emergency was proclaimed by president nixon in august 1971 to control the balance of payments flow by terminating temporarily certain trade agreement provisos and imposing supplemental duties on some imported goods43

occasional expressions of concern were heard in congress regarding the continued existence of president trumans 1950 national emergency proclamation long after the conditions prompting its issuance had disappeared there was some annoyance that the president was retaining extraordinary powers intended only for time of genuine emergency and feeling that the chief executive was thwarting the legislative intent of congress by continuously failing to terminate the declared national emergency 44 35 61 stat 449 36 65 stat 451 37 66 stat 54 extended at 66 stat 96 137 and 296 38 66 stat 330

exercise of his war powers and deepening us involvement in hostilities in vietnam prompted interest in variety of related matters for senator charles mathias interest in the question of emergency powers developed out of us involvement in vietnam and the incursion into cambodia together with senator frank church he sought to establish senate special committee to study the implications of terminating the 1950 proclamation of national emergency that was being used to prosecute the vietnam war to consider problems which might arise as the result of the termination and to consider what administrative or legislative actions might be necessary such panel was initially chartered by sres 304 as the special committee on the termination of the national emergency in june of 1972 but did not begin operations before the end of the year 45 with the convening of the 93rd congress in 1973 the special committee was approved again with sres 9 upon exploring the subject matter of na tional emergency powers however the mission of the special committee became more burdensome there was not just one proclamation of national emergency in effect but four such instruments issued in 1933 1950 1970 and 1971 the united states was in condition of national emergency four times over and with each proclamation the whole collection of statutorily delegated emergency powers was activated consequently in 1974 with sres 242 the study panel was rechartered as the special committee on national emergencies and delegated emergency powers to reflect its focus upon matters larger than the 1950 emergency proclamation its final mandate was provided by sres 10 in the 94 th congress although its termination date was necessarily extended briefly in 1976 by sres 370 senator church and senator mathias cochaired the panel46 the special committee on national emergencies and delegated emergency powers produced various studies during its existence47 after scrutinizing the united states code and uncodified statutory emergency powers the panel identified 470 provisions of federal law which delegated extraordinary authority to the executive in time of national emergency not all of them required declaration of national emergency to be operative but they were nevertheless extraordinary grants the special committee also found that pr ocess existed for automatically terminating the four outstanding national emergency proclamations thus the panel began developing legislation containing formula for regulating emergency declarations in the future and otherwise adjusting the body of statutorily delegated emergency powers by abolishing some provisions relegating others to permanent status and continuing others in standby capacity in addition the panel also 45 us congress house

july 1974 unanimously recommended legislation establishing procedure for the presidential declaration and congressional regulation of national emergency the proposal also modified various statutorily legated emergency powers in arriving at this reform measure the panel consulted with various executive branch agencies regarding the significance of existing emergency statutes recommendations for legislative action and views as to the repeal of some provisions of emergency law this recommended legislation was introduced by senator church for himself and others on august 22 1974 and became s 3957 it was reported from the senate committee on government operations on september 30 without public hearings or amendment 48 the bill was subsequently discussed on the senate floor on october 7 when it was amended and passed49 although version of the reform legislation had been introduced in the house on september 16 becoming hr 16668 the committee on the judiciary to which the measure was referred did not have an opportunity to consider either that bill or the senate adopted version due to the press of other businesschiefly the impeachment of president nixon and the nomination of nelson rockefeller to be vice president of the united states thus the national emergencies act failed to be considered on the house floor before the final adjournment of the 93 rd congress with the convening of the next congress the proposal was introduced in the house on february 27 1975 becoming hr 3884 and in the senate on march 6 becoming s 977 house hearings occurred in march and april

committee on 40 vote on may 21 the committee on the judiciary on voice vote reported the bill with technical amendments51 during the course of house debate on september 4 there was agreement to both the committee amendments and floor amendment providing that national emergencies end automatically one year after their declaration unless the president informs congress and the public of continuation the bill was then passed on 3885 yea and nay vote and sent to the senate where it was referred to the committee on government operations 52 the senate committee on government operations held hearing

passed and returned to the house55 on august 31 the house agreed to the senate amendments56 clearing the proposal for president gerald fords signature on september 1457 as enacted the national emergencies act consisted of five titles the first of these generally returned all standby statutory delegations of emergency power activated by an outstanding declaration of national emergency to dormant state two years after the statutes approval however the act did not cancel the 1933 1950 1970 and 1971 national emergency proclamations because these were issued by the president pursuant to his article ii constitutional authority nevertheless it did render them ineffective by returning to dormancy the statutory authorities they had activated thereby necessitating new declaration to activate standby statutory emergency authorities title ii provided procedure for future declarations of national emergency by the president and prescribed arrangements for their congressional regulation the statute established an exclusive means for declaring national emergency furthermore emergency declarations were to terminate automatically after one year unless formally continued for another year by the president but could be terminated earlier by either the president or congress originally the prescribed method for congressional termination of declared national emergency was concurrent resolution adopted by both houses of congress this type of socalled legislative veto was effectively invalidated by the supreme court in 1983 58 the national emergencies act was amended in 1985 to substitute joint resolution as the vehicle for rescinding national emergency declaration59 when declaring national emergency the president must indicate according to title iii the powers and authorities being activated to respond to the exigency at hand certain presidential accountability and reporting requirements regarding national emergency declarations were specified in title iv and the repeal and continuation of various statutory provisions delegating emergency powers was accomplished in title v since the 1976 enactment of the national emergencies act various national emergencies identified in table 1 have been declared pursuant to its provisions some were subsequently revoked while others remain operative all original declarations made pursuant to the national emergencies act are identified in table 1 unless otherwise indicated in italic their status is operational code of federal regulations or federal register citation is provided to enable examination of

united states have been neglected for too long and that congress must pass the national emergencies act to end potentially dangerous situation61 the panels recommended legislation of course was enacted into law before the end of the year other issues identified by the special committee as deserving attention in the future however did not fare so well the panel for example was hopeful that standing committees of both houses of congress would review statutory emergency power provisions within their respective jurisdictions with view to the continued need for and possible adjustment of such authority62 actions in this regard probably were not as ambitious as the special committee expected title of the federal civil defense act of 1950 granting the president or congress power to declare civil defense emergency in the event an attack on the united states occurred or was anticipated expired in june 1974 after the house committee on rules failed to report measure continuing the

was enacted granting the president the authority to order certain selected members of an armed services reserve component to active duty without declaration of war or national emergency64 previously such an activation of military reserve personnel had been limited to time of national emergency declared by the president or when otherwise authorized by law65 another refinement of emergency law occurred in 1977 when action was completed on the international emergency economic powers act ieepa66 reform legislation containing this statute67 modified provision of the trading with the enemy act of 1917 authorizing the president to regulate the nations international and domestic finance during periods of declared war or national emergency68 the enacted bill limited the presidents trading with the enemy act power to regulate the countrys finances to times of declared war in ieepa provision conferred authority on the chief executive to exercise controls over international economic transactions in the future during declared national emergency and established procedures governing the use of this power including close consultation with congress when declaring national emergency to activate ieepa such declaration would be subject to congressional regulation under the procedures of the national emergencies act69 other matters identified in the final report of the special committee for congressional scrutiny included investigation of emergency preparedness efforts conducted by the executive branch attention to congressional preparations for an emergency and continual review of emergency law ending openended grants of authority to the executive investigation and institution of stricter controls over delegated powers and improving the accountability of executive decisionmaking70 there is some public record indication that certain of these points particularly the first and the last have been addressed in the past two decades by congressional overseers71

regulation of emergency powers from the days of the continental congress to the present reflect at least one highly discernable trend those authorities available to the executive in time of national crisis or exigency have since the time of the lincoln administration come to be increasingly rooted in statutory law the discretion available to civil war president in his exercise of emergency power has been harnessed to considerable extent in the contemporary period furthermore due to greater reliance upon statutory expression the range of this authority has come to be more circumscribed and the options for its use have come to be regulated procedurally through the national emergencies act since its enactment however the national emergencies act has not been revisited by congressional overseers nonetheless as the final report of the senate special committee on national emergencies suggests the prospect remains that further improvements and reforms in this policy area might be pursued and perfected an anomaly in the activation of emergency powers appears to have occurred on september 8 2005 when president george w bush issued proclamation suspending certain wage requirements of the davisbacon act in the course of the federal response to the gulf coast disaster resulting from hurricane katrina 72 instead of following the historical pattern of declaring national emergency to activate the suspension authority73 the president set out the following rationale in the proclamation i find that the conditions caused by hurricane katrina constitute national emergency within the meaning of section 3147 of title 40 united states code74 more likely course of action seemingly would have been for the president to declare national emergency pursuant to the national emergencies act and to specify that he was accordingly activating the suspension authority although the propriety of the presidents action in this case might have been ultimately determined in the courts the proclamation was revoked on november 3 2005 by proclamation in which the president cited the national emergencies act as authority in part for his action 75 continued accountability
