labors proposed changes in the adverse effect wage rate aewr summary the h2a temporary agricultural worker program allows american agricultural employers to hire foreign workers to perform fulltime temporary or seasonal work on farms in the united states h2a workers must be paid at least the highest of the adverse effect wage rate aewr the prevailing wage or the applicable federal or state minimum wage the prevailing wage is based on state surveys funded by the us department of labor dol the aewr is based on wage data from the farm labor survey fls which is conducted by the us department of agriculture on february 13 2008 the us department of labor dol published proposed regulations that would change the way the aewr is determined final action on the proposed rule is expected in november 2008 under the rule the aewr would be calculated from the occupational employment statistics oes survey which is conducted by the bureau of labor statistics of the us department of labor and state workforce agencies wages from the oe s survey are available at four levels of skill and experience the four wage levels are called level i level ii level iii and level iv under the proposed rule the aewr could not be less than 725 an hour the fls and oes surveys cover differe nt farmrelated em ployers and provide different levels of detail by occupation nd geographic area an issue for congress is the impact of the proposed change on the wages and employment of unauthorized farmworkers h2a workers and us workers generally speaking under the proposed rule in most areas both the minimum aewr of 725 and the oes level i wage fo r entry level workers would be lower than the current aewr in some areas however the level i wage would be higher than the current aewr on the other hand in most areas the oes level iv wage for workers with management or supervisory duties especially for livestock workers and farm equipment operators w ould be higher than the current aewr compared to the current aewr the proposed aewr is more likely to be lower for crop workers than for livestock work ers or farm equipment operators in some areas the prevailing wage could become the highest of the aewr prevailing wage or minimum wage in some areas in some states the state minimum wage could become the highest of the three wage rates in areas where the proposed rule woul d lower the wages that employers must offer h2a workers the rule should creat an incentive for employers to hire more h2a as opposed to unauthorized workers in areas where the rule would increase the wages that employers must offer h 2a workers the rule would probably not create an incentive to hire more h2a work ers on the other hand in areas where the rule would increase the wages of h2a workers it should create an incentive for employers to hire more us workers however in areas where the rule would lower the wages that employers must offer h 2a workers it could lower the wages employers offer us workers this report will be updated as issues warrant httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34739contents introduction 1 t h h 2 p r g r m2w g r q u i r m n t s f r h 2 w r k r s3 prevailing wages 3 t h d v r s f

levels are currently used in the h2b temporary nonagricultural worker program the level i and iv hourly wages ava ilable from the flc data center are calculated by bls directly from oes wage data for

the fls the oes survey provides wage information for more geographic areas and more farming occupa tions in addition the flc data center provides wage rates at four levels of skill and experience however one of the concerns raised about the oes survey is that it does not collect wage information from farmers engaged directly in crop or livestock production instead it collects wage information

wage potential effects of the pr oposed rule on the wages and employment of farmworkers in the united states this section examines some of the potential effects on farmworker wages and employment if dol implements the proposed change in the way the aewr is determined preview of the findings under the proposed rule in most areas both the minimum aewr of 725 and the oes level i wage for entry level workers would be lower than the current aewr in so areas however the level i wage would be higher than the current aewr on the other hand in most areas the level iii and iv oes wages for livestock

farm equipment operators in some areas the prevailing wage could become the highest of the aewr prevailing wage or minimum wage in some areas in some states the state minimum wage could become the highest of the three wage rates in areas where the proposed rule woul d lower the wages that employers must offer h2a workers the rule should creat an incentive for employers to hire more h2a as

areas where the rule would lower the wages that employers must offer h2a workers it could lower the wages employers offer us workers methodology and assumptions in order to analyze the potential effects of the proposed rule on the wages and em ployment of farmworkers it would be necessary to compare the aewr under curre nt procedures with the aewr under the proposed rule this section uses adminis trative data from employer requests for h 2a workers oes wage data from the flc data center and prevailing wage data from eta to analyze the potential impact of the proposed rule the analysis compares the current aewr for crop and livestock workers combined as calculated from the fls with the four wage levels of three occupations from the oes survey 1 farm workers and laborers crop nursery and greenhouse production 2 farmworkers farm and ranch animals and 3 equipment operators it is assumed that under the pr oposed rule these three occupations would be used to determine the aewr for cr op workers livestock workers and farm equipment operators the analysis also compares the hour ly aewr under the proposed rule with hourly prevailing wage for th same area and occupation the analysis is based on labor certifications for five states these states were chosen because they are the five top states in terms of the number of h2a workers requested in fy2007 together the five states accounted for 437 of the h2a workers requested the states are rth carolina 179 geor gia 80 louisiana 61 florida 60 and kentucky 57 wage data from the oes survey are available by metropolitan statistical area msa and areas that are called balance of state bos which are areas that are not part of an msa at the flc data center these areas are called bls areas for each state the bls areas encompass all of the counties in state oes wage data can be retrieved by county or bls area30 if the oes sample is sufficiently large wage rates are available at four levels of skill and experience for each farming occupation in each bls area the analysis presented here compares the current aewr with the proposed minimum aewr of 725 the oes level i ii iii and iv wages the preva iling wage and state minimum wage rates unde r the proposed rule the actual wage that would apply to an individual worker w ould depend on the occ upation and the level of skill and experience required by an employer for the job thus any of the four oes wage levels the prevailing wage or the minimum wage could become the highest of the wage rates that employers mu st offer to h2a workers the discussionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34739crs15 31 according to current rules wage determina tion that uses the four oes wage levels from the flc data center begins with level i or entry level wage for jobs that require greater skills or more experience higher wage applies us department of labor prevailing wage determination policy guidan ce nonagricultural immigration programs pp 3 7below of findings and the analysis of the potential effects of the proposed rule highlight workers who would be paid the minimum 725 aewr or the oes level i wage more emphasis is placed on these workers because it is assumed that the majority of h2a workers are entrylevel workers findings the results of the analysis of th effect of the proposed rule on the aewr are summarized in tables 4 through 7 for each of the five states chosen table 4 shows the number of bls areas where the oes level i wage is less than or equal to the current aewr column 3 and the number of areas where the proposed level i aewr is higher than the current aewr column 6 the number of areas where the proposed aewr would be less th an or equal to the current aewr is separated into two groups column 4 s hows the number of bls areas where the proposed minimum aewr of 725 is lower than the current aewr and column 5 shows the number of areas where the oes level i wage is more than 725 an hour but less than or equal to the current aewr tables 5 through 7 are similar to table 4 except they compare the current aewr to the oes levels ii iii and iv wages for each state area and occupation tables 13 though 16 in the appendix show the prevailing wage rates for north carolina georgia florida and kentucky prevailing wage rates are currently available for louisiana in general the results show the following in most areas the 725 minimum aewr and the oes level i wage for crop workers livestock worker s and farm equipment operators are lower than the current aewr31 for example for cropworkers in north carolina the oes level i wage is lower than the current aewr in 18 of 19 bls areas compare columns 2 and 3 in table 4 in many areas the 725 minimum aewr is lower than the current aewr for example in georgia the 725 minimum aewr is lower than the current aewr in 15 of 19 bls areas assuming the 725 wage would not be adjusted fo r inflation as wages rise due to inflation increased productivity or both as time passes the 725 wage would apply to fewer areas the minimum 725 aewr and the oes level i wage are more likely to be lower than the current aewr for crop workers than for livestock workers or farm equipment operators for example for crop workers the 725 minimum aewr is lower than the current aewr in 51 of the 83 total bls areas represented in table 4 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34739crs16 compared to livestock workers in 27 areas and farm equipment operators in 24 areas in some areas the oes level i wage is higher than the current aewr for example for equipment operators the oes level i wage is higher than the current aewr in 22 of the 83 bls areas shown in table 4 half of these 22 areas are in kentucky see column 6 in most areas the level iii and iv oes wages for livestock workers and farm equipment operators are higher than the current aewr for example the level iv wage for equipment operators is higher than the current aewr in all 83 wage areas shown in table 7 for livestock workers the level iv wage is higher than the current aewr in 80 of 83 areas on the other hand in 13 of 83 areas the level iv wage for crop workers is lower than the current aewr in some areas the prevailing wage could become the highest of the aewr the prevailing wage or the applicable minimum wage for example in greenville north carolina the prevailing wage for tobacco harvesters is 750 an hour see table 13 this is less than the current aewr of 885 but higher than the proposed minimum aewr of 725 or the level i ii or iii oes wages for crop workers in the greenville msa similarly in brunswick and valdosta ie southern georgi the prevailing wage of 800 an hour for tractor drivers is less than the current aewr of 853 but higher than the level i or ii oes wages for equipment operators see tables 9 and 14 finally in some areas in some states the state minimum wage could become the highest wage that employers must offer to h2a workers in none of the five stat studied here is the state minimum wage higher than the 725 minimum aewr but as of july 24 2008 nine states have minimum wages that are higher than the minimum 725 aewr whether the state minimum wage would apply to an h2a worker would depend on whether it is higher than the prevailing wage or the oes wage for the job comparison of the aewr based on the fls versus oes survey the current aewr may overestimate the wages of crop work ers and underestimate the wages of livestock workers and farm equipment operators except for equipment operators in kentucky the 725 minimum ae wr and the oes level i wage for the three occupations shown in table 4 are generally lower than the current aewr for example in georgia the oes level i wage for livestock workers is lower than the current aewr in all 19 bls areas compare columns 2 and 3 in florida the level i wage for equipment operators is lower than the current aewr in 17 of 20 bls areashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34739crs17 32 us workers include american citizens as well as foreign persons who have been legally admitted to the united statesin general the oes level ii wage for crop workers is also lower than the current aewr see table 5 this is not the case however for livestock workers or farm equipment operators with some excepti ons eg livestock workers in parts of louisiana and kentucky and equipment opera tors in parts of georgia the level ii wages for livestock workers and farm equi pment operators are generally higher than the current aewr the same is true for both the level iii and level iv wages thus the proposed rule may have more of an adverse effect on the wages of crop workers than on the wages of either liv estock workers or equipment operators potential effects of the proposed regulation on the wages and employment of farmworkers if the proposed rule is implemented as written its effect on the wages and employment of farmworkers would depend on number of factors first the rule may either raise or lower the wages employers must offer h2a workers second the effect of the rule may vary by area and occupation the effect on the wages and employment of cr op workers may be different from the effect on livestock workers or farm equipment ope rators the effect may be different in labor markets where local wages are above or below the current aewr finally the effect of the rule may be different fo r three groups of workers unauthorized farmworkers h2a workers and us workers32 effect of the proposed rule on wages under the proposed rule employers would have to offer h2a work ers at least the highest of the minimum aewr of 725 the oes wage level that pplies to the job the prevailing wage or the state minimum wage under current law the federal minimum wage is not scheduled to increase to more than 725 an hour depending on local wages for the occupation skill and experience that empl oyers require for job the wage that employers would have to offer h2a work ers under the proposed rule may be lower or higher than the wage that employers must offer under current regulations under the proposed rule for employers who hire mainly entry level workers the minimum aewr of 725 the oes level i or level ii wage the prevailing wage or the state minimum wage would likely apply nevertheless for some occupations in some areas even the level i or level ii wage would be higher than the current aewr the current aewr is higher than the state minimum wage in all states on the other hand as of july 24 2008 the state minimum wage is greater than the minimum aewr of 725 in nine states whether the state minimum wage would apply to h 2a workers in these states would depend on whether it is higher than either the proposed aewr or the prevailing wage for those h2a workers who qualify for level iii or level iv oes wages the aewr would likely be

the wa ges employers must offer h2a workers in fy2007 50791 h2a temporary agricultura l worker visas were issued at the end of fy2007 an estimated 11 million hi red farmworkers were employed on us farms and ranches33 according to findings from the national agricultural workers survey naws as many as half of crop workers on us farms are not authorized to work in the united states34 thus the available data suggest that us farmers and farm labor cont ractors employ more unauthorized crop workers than h 2a workers under the proposed rule the aewr shoul d more closely reflect the wages of farmworkers in local labor markets in labor markets with large concentration of unauthorized farmworkers wage data from the oes survey may to some extent reflect the wages paid to unauthorized workers35 for employers who hire mainly entrylevel workers the proposed rule ma lower the wages employers must offer h 2a workers and could create an incentive for employers to hire more legal as opposed to unauthorized foreign farmworker s on the other hand the rule may not increase the incentive for employers to hire h2a workers if it raises the wages employers must offer h2a workers similarly the effect of the proposed ru on the employment of us workers may depend on whether it raises or lowers the wages of foreign as opposed to us workers the relative cost of benefits may also affect the demand for foreign and us workers although us workers ar entitled to the same benefits as h2a workers employer costs for housing and tr ansportation may be greater for h2a than us workers eg if us workers live within commuting distance of job36 thus the effect of the proposed rule on the em ployment of us workers may depend on how the rule changes the relative cost ie wages and benefits of foreign versus us workershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34739crs19 other factors may also affect the re lative supply of or demand for foreign farmworkers including increased enforcement of us immigration law and changes in economic conditions in the united states and elsewhere it may be difficult however to separate the effects of these and other changes from the effect of the proposed
