technology resources science and industry division summary in 1982 the small business innovation development act pl 97219 established small business innovation research sbir programs within the major federal research and development rd agencies designed to increase participation of small innovative companies in federally funded rd government agencies with rd budgets of 100 million or more are required to set aside portion of these funds to finance the sbir activity over 207 billion in awards have been made for more than 94660 projects extended several times the program is currently scheduled to sunset on september 30 2008 on april 23 2008 hr 5819 bill to reauthorize the sbir program through 2010 and make changes to the effort passed the house1 program description the small business innovation research program is designed to increase the participation of small high technology firms in the federal rd endeavor congressional support for the initiative was predicated upon the belief that while technologybased companies under 500 employees tended to be highly innovative and innovation is essential to the economic wellbeing of the united states these businesses were under represented in government rd activities agency sbir programs guarantee this sector portion of the governments rd budget to compensate for what was viewed as preference for contracting with large firms current law requires that every federal department with an rd budget of 100 million or more establish and operate an sbir program set percentage of that agencys applicable extramural research and development budget originally at 125 now at 25 is to be used to support missionrelated work in small companies 1 for information on sbir reauthorization activity in the 110th congress see crs report rs22865 the small business innovation research program reauthorization efforts by wendy h schacht crs2 the objectives of the sbir program include stimulation of technological innovation in the small business sector increased use of this community to meet the governments rd needs additional involvement of minority and disadvantaged individuals in the process and expanded commercialization of the results of federally funded rd to achieve this agency sbir efforts involve threephase activity in the first phase awards up to 100000 for six months are provided to evaluate concepts scientific or technical merit and feasibility the project must be of interest to and coincide with the mission of the supporting organization projects that demonstrate potential after the initial endeavor may compete for phase ii awards of up to 750000 lasting onetwo years to perform the principal rd phase iii funding directed at the commercialization of the product or process is expected to be generated in the private sector federal dollars may be used if the government perceives that the final technology or technique will meet public needs pl 102564 directed agencies to weigh commercial potential as an additional factor in evaluating sbir proposals as of fy2006 11 departments have sbir programs including the departments of agriculture commerce defense dod education energy health and human services homeland security and transportation the environmental protection agency the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the national science foundation nsf each agencys sbir activity reflects that organizations management style individual departments select rd interests administer program operations and control financial support funding can be disbursed in the form of contracts grants or cooperative agreements separate agency solicitations are issued at established times the small business administration sba created broad policy and guidelines under which individual departments operate sbir programs the agency monitors and reports to congress on the conduct of the separate departmental activities criteria for eligibility in the sbir program include companies that are independently owned and operated not dominant in the field of research proposed for profit the employer of 500 or less people the primary employer of the principal investigator and at least 51 owned by one or more us citizens or lawfully admitted permanent resident aliens rule change effective january 3 2005 permits subsidiaries of sbireligible companies to participate as long as the parent company meets all sbir requirements pilot effort to encourage commercialization of university and federal laboratory rd by small companies was created by pl 102564 and reauthorized several times through fy2009 the small business technology transfer program sttr provides funding for research proposals that are developed and executed cooperatively between small firm and scientist in research organization and fall under the mission requirements of the federal funding agency up to 100000 in phase i financing is available for one year phase ii awards of up to 750000 may be made for two years currently funded by setaside of 03 of the extramural rd budget of departments that spend over 1 billion per year on this effort the departments of energy defense and health and human services nasa and nsf participate in the sttr program implementation the government accountability office gao formerly the general accounting office is legislatively directed to assess the implementation of the small business innovation development act as amended and has issued series of reports documenting crs3 its findings 1987 study found that both the evaluation and selection processes were sufficient to reasonably insure awards were based on technical merit it was also determined that the majority of agencies were not awarding phase i grants and contracts within the sixmonth time frame required by the sba guidelines another gao report the following month surveyed the participants and noted that most were generally satisfied with the administration of sbir programs in 1989 gao reported that agency heads found the sbir effort to be beneficial and met the organizations rd needs most indicated that the sbir programs had developed new research areas placed more emphasis on the application of research results and led to wider use of small businesses as research performers the study concluded that projects were for the most part of high quality at dod and nasa however sbir efforts stressed rd to meet agency mission requirements in contrast to other sbir programs that focused on commercialization for private sector markets all of the departments stated that sbir projects when compared with other research activities had greater potential to result in new products and processes testimony presented by gao in 1991 stated that the program clearly is doing what congress asked it to do in achieving commercial sales and developmental funding from the private sector an sba study found that approximately one in four sbir projects will result in the sale of new commercial products or processes another gao report issued in may 1992 noted that despite short time frame and the fact that many sbir projects had not had sufficient time to mature into marketable technologies and techniques the program is showing success in phase iii activity as of july 1991 almost twothirds of the projects already had sales or received additional funding primarily from the private sector totaling approximately 11 billion the 1992 study also identified several issues for possible further congressional exploration according to gao dod placed less emphasis on commercialization than other agencies and utilized the sbir program primarily to address the departments rd needs questions were raised about the requirements for competitive bidding when companies looked to federal departments for phase iii contracts after successfully completing phases i and ii gao noted that clarification of the competition in contracting act of 1984 as amended might be necessary in addition there was disagreement over whether the federal agency or the small firm should continue to work on technology development after the cessation of sbir project funding gao also concluded that firms receiving multiple phase ii awards tended to have lower phase iii sales and less additional developmental support the reasons for this remained unclear but the suggestion was made that these companies may have focused on securing funds through sbir awards rather than through commercialization of their rd results march 1995 gao report found that multiple phase ii funding had become problem particularly at nsf nasa and dod among the reasons cited were the failure of companies to identify identical proposals made elsewhere in violation of the mandatory certification procedure uncertainty in definitions and guidelines concerning similar research and lack of interagency mechanisms to exchange information on projects several recommendations were made to address duplication gao testimony presented in march 1996 indicated that the sba had taken steps to implement these suggestions the study also determined that the quality of research appeared to have kept pace with the programs expansion although it was still too early to make crs4 definitive judgment factors supporting this assessment included the substantive level of competition more proposals deemed meritorious than could be funded by agencies and appraisals by departmental sbir personnel indicating the high quality of submissions another gao study released in april 1998 noted that between 35 and 50 of sbir projects had resulted in sales or additional private sector investment despite earlier indications of problems associated with multiple award winners this report found that such firms have similar commercialization rates as single awardees critical technology lists were being used to determine agency solicitations and there was little evidence of participation by foreign firms while several agencies had new programs to assure continuity in funding there were indications of possible inaccuracies in defining the extramural rd budgets upon which the setaside is based the june 1999 gao analysis reported that sbir awards tend to be concentrated both geographically and by firm despite widespread participation in the program the 25 most frequent winners which represent fewer than 1 percent of the companies in the program received about 11 percent of the programs awards from fiscal year 1983 through fiscal year 1997 businesses in small number of states particularly california and massachusetts were awarded the most number of projects the study also noted that while commercial potential is considered by all agencies each has developed different evaluation approaches other goals including innovation and responsiveness to agency mission still remain important in determining awards more recent report by gao june 2005 found that it is still difficult to adequately assess the performance of the sbir program although the effort appears to be achieving its goal of enhanced participation of small business in the rd enterprise utilizing commercialization as measure may not be sufficient because other agency goals were being met such as research needs or expanded innovation success in the commercial market did not take into account the rd requirements of departments like dod or nasa in report the following year october 2006 gao noted that the agencies reporting to the sba did not always provide the necessary data in the format required by sba gao concluded that the agencies need to strengthen their efforts to improve the completeness consistency and accuracy of awards data gao also has evaluated the sttr program january 1996 report found that in general federal agencies favorably rated the quality of winning proposals in the first year and that most projects had commercial potential although the costs might be high the government had taken steps to avoid potential conflicts of interest between federal laboratories and departmental headquarters there was indication that this pilot effort was competing for proposals with the established sbir activity or reducing the quality of the agencies rd in general instead it was credited for encouraging collaborative work yet gao noted that because the programs are so similar there are questions whether or not separate activity is necessary any real evaluation of success in technology transfer however could not be accomplished for several years because of the time needed to bring the results of rd to the commercial marketplace these findings were reiterated in testimony given by gao in may and september 1997 june 2001 gao study of all companies which received sttr awards between fy1995 and fy1997 noted the participants belief that both the firms and the research institutions contributed to expanded rd although the private sector was more influential crs5 in determining the direction of the research the companies reported about 132 million in total sales and about 53 million in additional developmental funding they identified 41 new patents and the creation of 12 new spinoff firms further the awardees preferred that the sttr program remain separate from the sbir activity awards from its inception in fy1983 through fy2006 over 94660 awards have been made totaling more than 207

878 source small business administration data issues for consideration certain issues might be considered if the program is to be reauthorized initially debate centered on the use of setaside proponents urged its use to guarantee participation of small firms in federal rd contracts while opponents argued that set aside interferes with normal market efficiency and circumvents the congressional budget process used to determine program priorities and budget allotments existing regulations require at least 51 ownership by an individual or individuals however some experts argue participation by small firms that are majorityowned by venture capital companies should be permitted proponents of this change maintain that particularly in the biotechnology sector the most innovative companies are not able to use the sbir program because they do not meet this ownership criteria opponents of altering the eligibility requirements argue that the program is designed to provide financial assistance where venture capital is not available they assert that the programs objective is to bring new concepts to the point where private sector investment is feasible an additional concern is the extent to which program participants are mandated to report activities and results pl 106554 placed added requirements on companies to provide information it remains to be determined if these requirements have been successfully implemented other issues that might be addressed include whether the problems identified by gao associated with the duplication of awards has been adequately resolved are the sbir and sttr programs meeting their different mandated objectives or are they serving an identical purpose does the focus on commercialization raise concerns by those who argue that the government has role in directly supporting industrial research and development these and other questions may be explored as the 110th congress considers possible reauthorization of
