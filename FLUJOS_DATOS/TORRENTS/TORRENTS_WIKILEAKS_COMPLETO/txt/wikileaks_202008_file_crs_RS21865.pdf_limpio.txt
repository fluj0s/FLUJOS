within afghanistan and iraq in the transition to postconflict environment afghan and iraqi women face particular challenges especially in climate of uncertainty and insecurity critical step in the promotion of womens participation in local and national governance will be their ability to register for and vote freely in elections campaign for political office and have full confidence in the design interpretation and imp lementation of their constituti on congressional funding for democracy building will obviously have an impact on womens roles in each country particularly amid the ongoing security challenges other key issues include participation in the workforce educational oppor tunities and access to health care designating funds for women one of the key ways congress has had an impact on the situation for afghan women has been through series of legislative earmarks to date in iraq although some funds have been designated to include women such as 10 million for the iraqi womens mocracy initiative congress has not used legislative earmarks extensively for womens programs oversight and reporting similarly in terms of oversight and reporting the afghan women and children relief act of 2001 pl 10781 mandates that the state department submit an annual status report to congress on spending for afghan women such legislation or manda has yet been developed fo r iraqi women but anticipated supplemental appropriations in early 2005 mig ht provide greater specificity on funding allocations12 future developments in consideration of th funding appropriated in fy2003 and fy2004 there are some simila rities in the approach taken by the united states to improve the lives of afghan and iraqi wo men however not only do afghanistan and iraq have different starting point in term s of economic developm ent and assistance from the international community but the timetables for reconstruction are uniquely influenced by ongoing events on the ground although it is too soon to draw specific lessons learned from either country as congress examines th progress of reconstr uction programs for women it may be important to consider the effect of religious versus secular forces the variation in local traditions and cultures and the differences between rural and urban communities to see if the assistance provided to afghan and iraqi women is effective and can be used as model in future postconflict regions
