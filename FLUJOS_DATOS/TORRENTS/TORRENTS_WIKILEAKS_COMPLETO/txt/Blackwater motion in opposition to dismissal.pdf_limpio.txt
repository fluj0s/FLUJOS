and argue for dismissal on the grounds plaintiffs allegations are implausible plaintiffs append modicum of evidence to this opposition to respond to this argument plaintiffs however are entitled to and need an opportunity for discovery before being able to respond in full to the many defendants factual averments see eg prince mem at 25 where defendants claim the state department exercised

revenues flowing into the prince companies as fungible and within his complete and absolute personal control mr prince contributed his personal wealth to fund the operations of the prince companies whenever he deemed such funding necessary likewise mr prince took funds out of the prince companies and placed the funds in his personal accounts at will decl john doe 2 78 according to john doe 2 mr prince views himself as christian crusader tasked with eliminating mus lims and the islamic faith from the globe mr prince intentionally deployed to iraq certain men who shared his vision of christian

2 reports also that mr prince is motivated by greed mr prince and his top manager gary jackson knew the men being deployed were not suitable candidates for carrying lethal weaponry but did not car because deployments meant more money mr prince ignored the advice and pleas from certain employees who sought to stop the unnecessary killing of innocent iraqis certain employees located overseas

reasons these reasons included the men making statements about wanting to deploy to iraq to kill ragheads or achieve kills or body counts b excessive drinking c steroid use and d failure to follow safety and other instructions regarding lethal weaponry when these demonstrably unfit men were returned to the united states mr prince and his executives would send them back to be deployed in iraq

than the blackwate r name the supreme court of virginia held that corporate veils must be pierced when 1 the unity of interest and ownership is such that the separate personalities of the corporation

to commit an injustice or to gain an unfair advantage ohazza v exec credit corp 431 se3d 318 320 1 va 1993 plaintiffs have alleged facts and begun to demonstrate with evidence the existence of these two elements which if proven at trial would require the jury to pierce the corporate veils and hold defendant prince personally responsible for the wrongdoing of his web of companies on the first element the corporate entity was the alter ego alias stooge or dummy of defendant prince the individuals sought to be charged personally cheatle v rudds swimming pool supply co inc 360 s e2d 828 831 va 1987 the complaints allege defendant prince alone was the person in charge and able to make major operational decisions and used the companies merely as tools to implement his own decisions abtan

such drastic step at this early procedural juncture rather this court should permit plaintiffs to proceed to build the record on defendant princes complete and utter control over all the companies defendant prince is the mastermind and sole beneficiary of the ongoing racketeering schemes and should not be perm itted to evade liability merely by hiding behind wholly owned and fully controlled corporate shells that have independent existence6 ii plaintiffs state valid federal racketeering claims against erik prince plaintiffs in two of the lawsuits amended th eir complaints to add claims under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico mr prince accuses plaintiffs counsel of adding these claims merely to inflame the prejudice and passions of the jury prince mem at 13 7 6defendants claim one company greystone is foreign entity incorporated in barbados although defendants did not attach any certificate of inc orporation plaintiffs have obtained the certificate which is attached as exhibit i as is evidenced by the exhibit greystones board steadily consists of defendant erik prince who is joined by revolving cast of subordinates serving as the second board member the companys guarantor is princes bank in michigan huntington bank these documents support plaintiffs allegation that greystone is simply one of the many alter egos of defendant prince greystone does not have offices in barbados greystone does not do business in barbados rather greystone is simply used as an offshore conduit for funds if at this time the court decides to credit greystone as real foreign company that suffices to destroy diversity plaintiffs stand ready to d ismiss greystone further d espite the pendency of grand jury investigations in three jurisdictions 7 defendant prince reasons that the rico claims seek minimis amounts in terms of damages and therefore should be considered as spurious claims brought for improper purposes as matter of law in this circuit the amount of damag sought does not impact the viability of case 109cv00618tseidd document 31 filed 08032009 page 37 of 91 19 see statement of facts fendant prince seeks dismissal of the rico claims on the grounds that they allege facts that are not plausible under the newly developed standard announced b the supreme court in ashcroft v iqbal 129 s ct 1937 2009 both the accusation and the argument lack merit and contradict the supreme courts teachings in sedima v imrex co 473 us 479 1985rico is to be read broadly and should be liberal ly construed to effectuate its remedial purpose in granting the private right of action although the rico charges against defendant prince are indeed sensational that fact results from the breadth and scope of criminal misconduct engaged in by defendant prince and his subordinates as set forth more fully in the statement of allegations and facts the evidence supports plaintiffs rico claims defendant erik prince operates criminal enterprise designed to augment his substantial personal wealth and dvance his views f christian supremacy many innocents have lost their lives as result of defendant prince see eg abtan 617 compl 45 albazzaz 616 compl 13 many laws have been broken by defendant prince see exhibits h see also decl john doe 2 6 in short the complaints rico allegations simply cannot be dismissed as implausible under the supreme courts reasoning in ashcroft v iqbal 129 s ct 1937 2009 in addition to claiming implausibility and impugning opposi ng counsels motives for adding the rico claims defendant p rince argues that four factors doom plaintiffs claims plaintiffs 1 failed to plead erik prince perpetrated the predicate acts prince mem at 14 16 2 failed to plead pattern id at 19 20 3 lack standing id at 16 18 and 4 are seeking extraterritorial application of rico id at 18 19 subsection addresses the first and second rico claims see eg potomac electric power company v electric motor and supply incorporated 262 f3d 260 266 4th cir 2001 nominal damages suffices to establish rico injury case 109cv00618tseidd document 31 filed 08032009 page 38 of 91 20 factors and explains that plaintiffs allegations suffice to satisfy the intricacies of rico plea ding because they allege defendant prince perpetrated multiple and related rico predicate acts subsection b explains that the rico plaintiffs have standing because their properties were damaged during the commission of murders predicate act subsectio n c explains that the rico plaintiffs are not seeking extraterritorial application of rico but rather are seeking to penalize defendant princes conduct that occurred in virginia and north carolina and had substantial effects throughout the united states plaintiffs alleged erik prince per petrated pattern of related acts of racketeering defendant erik prince seeks but cannot find shelter in the decisional law on rico the federal judiciary tends to reject litigants efforts to transform commercial and trivial disputes into civil rico actions which has led to substantial body of caselaw on what does not rise to the level of rico claim see eg palmetto state medical ce nter inc v operation lifeline et 117 f3d 142 4th cir 1997 bast v cohen dunn sinclair pc 59 f3d 492 4th cir 1995 but undersigned counsel could not find any action in which court dismissed rico complaint for failure to plead predicate acts when the complaint alleged repeated murders rather in those instances when confronted with lawsuit against criminal kingpin who sits atop criminal enterprises and directs others to engage in the dirty work the federal judiciary has not hesitated to proceed under rico see eg united states v licavoli 725 f2d 1040 6th cir 1984 upholding the conviction of mafia kingpin and five of his associates united

adverse inferences drawn from defendants invocatio n of the fifth amendment note however that even if credited by this court defendant princes pleading arguments would not merit dismissal as any rico pleading deficiencies may be corrected by amendment see eg chisholm v transouth financial co rporation 95 f3d 331 4 th cir 1996 trial court abused its discretion when it failed to permit rico claimants to amend their complaint 1 plaintiffs llege defendant erik prince p erpetrated multiple predicate cts of murder defendant prince argue s that the rico claims should be dismissed because plaintiffs fail to allege that he prince per petrated any of the predicate acts defendant prince c ites palmetto state medical center inc v operation lifeline et 117 f3d 142 4 th cir 1997 for the proposition that plaintiffs cannot use the phrase prince rico enterprise to convey facts about mr prince himself 8 8 although counsel are fident that their form of drafting satisfies the rico pleading standard and places mr prince on notice that he is alleged to have perpetrated the predicate acts plaintiffs stand ready to amend their complaints if so ordered by the court to substitute the words erik prince in palmetto state the court of appeals for the fourth circuit reversed jury verdict reached after trial finding the evidence did not support finding that defendants committed any predicate acts palmetto state thus speaks to the quantum of evidence needed to prevail on rico claims at trial and does not actually address the type of allegations that suffice to survive motion to dismiss mr prince cites only district court decision from another circuit to support his argument that he must have personally committed the predicate act to be held liable under rico prince mem at 15 rico does not require that an individual pe rsonally committed predicate act see 18 usc 1962 d case 109cv00618tseidd document 31 filed 08032009 page 40 of 91 22 here the rico complaints clearly put defendant prince on notice that he is alleged to have perpetrated the listed predicate acts including the murders tax evasion and weapons smuggl ing stated differently mr prince is equivalent to top mafia boss who is responsible for all the day today crimes committed at his direction and behest see eg united states v licavoli 725 f2d 1040 rico used to convict clevelan d mob boss ja mes t licavoli the rico complaints allege erik prince created the prince rico enterprise separate entity to carry out his criminal wishes abtan 617 compl 117 hassoon 618 compl 129 the rico complaints allege erik prince is the sole person in complete and absolute control over the enterprise and is the beneficiary of the enterprises criminal misconduct abtan 617 compl 119 hassoon 618 compl 131 these allegations satisfy this circuits rico pleading requirements see eg new beckley mining corporation v international union 18 f3rd 1161 4th cir 1994 as the court of appeals for the fourth circuit taught in the seminal case on rico pleading busby v crown supply inc 896 f2d 833 4th cir 1990 plaintiffs properly stat rico claim by alleging that the operation of the rico enterprise harmed them here the predicate acts perpetrated by rico defendant prince include multiple murders as testified to under penalty of perjury by john doe 2 mr prince views himse lf as christian crusader tasked with eliminating muslims and

by the controlling rico jurisprudence developed by the supreme court and the court of appeals for the fourth circuit that case arose from series of anti abortion protests although plaintiffs prevailed

not to exist under 28 usc 1331 federal common law would look to the war crimes act 18 usc 2441d12006 which penalizes the very conduct at issue here and customary international law to fashion the applicable tort standard the federal common law under ats provides for civil liability for war crimes and summary execution plaintiffs complaints state valid federal common law claims f or war crimes and summary execution in the united states the supreme court has ruled that aliens are permitted to bring damage claims for breaches of customary international law in federal district courts using the jurisdictional grant of the alien tort statute ats 28 usc 1350 sosa v alvarez macha n 542 us 692 2004 there t he supreme court confirmed that federal common law prohibits and penalizes conduct that violates international law sosa 542 us at 730 however the court cautio ned that only those international laws that are well established and defined with specificity qualify for incorporation into american federal common law id at 725 in so doing the court recognized that international law is part of federal common law id the sosa court held therefore that modern federal courts could albeit cautiously identify justiciable claims by looking to the customs and usages of civilized nations id at 734 citing the paquete habana 175 us 677 700 1900 these typ of international laws are called norms by the court in so limiting federal common law to these norms that qualify based on specificity and history of establishment the supreme court expressly cautioned that it was not excluding norms governing in dividual relationships rather than sovereign relationships the supreme court explained norms included second more pedestrian element that fell within the judicial sphere of regulating the case 109cv00618tseidd document 31 filed 08032009 page 53 of 91 35 conduct of individuals situated outside domestic boundaries and consequently carrying an international savor sosa 542 us at 715 emphasis added the court explained that there was sphere in which these rules binding individuals for the benefit of other individuals overlapped with the norms of state relati onships id acting cautiously and giving due deliberation to the dissenting argument jscalia the sosa court decided that the door for such ats federal common law claims is still ajar subject to vigilant doorkeeping and thus open to narrow cl ass of international norms today id at 729 it is these so called pedestrian norms protecting individuals that are at issue here namely the international norms that prevent persons from using the cloak of conflict and war to engage in murder and mayhem for their own profit and benefit for that reason the plaintiffs bring their war crimes and summary execution claims under federal common law and seek compensatory and punitive damages from defendant prince and his alter ego companies it is be yond dispute that the prohibition against war crimes qualifies as part of the federal common law enforceable in this jurisdiction th sosa supreme court found war crimes qualify as norms with the necessary specific universal and obligatory definition s id at 732 indeed the prohibition against war crimes is one of the most well established and is codified at the fourth geneva convention relative to the protection of civilians in time of war 1949 article 31a there is requirement that the alleged war criminal be party to the conflict or combatant as blackwater suggests prince mem at 11 in 1996 congress enacted the war crimes act 18 usc 2441 1996 which provided for criminal liability for war crimes when the person com mitting such war crime or the victim of such war crime is member of the armed forces of the united states or national of the united states the

during genocid or war crimes prince mem at 6 this argument fails on rule 12b6 motion for dismissal because plaintiffs clearly have alleged that defendant prince and his companies were committing war

defendants are really seeking from this court is an early factual finding in its favor such findi ng would be wholly premature defendants are free to argue to the jury that gunning down innocent iraqis should not be considered war crimes but their motion to dismiss must be denied further even if plaintiffs had not alleged defendants committed t he summary executions during the commission of war crimes plaintiffs allegations would still state an actionable violation of clear and definite norm of internati onal law the supreme court so held in sosa 542 us at 728 and again in hamdan v rums feld 548 us 557 630 2006 finding that 12 blackwater errs as matter of law in asserting that political or military motive is an element of war crimes prince mem at 11 12 it is not see war crimes act 18 usc 2441 1996 the united nations international criminal tribunal for t he former yugoslavia appeals chamber also rejected precisely this argument finding what ultimately distinguishes war crime from purely domestic offence is that war crime is shaped by or dependent upon the environment the armed conflict in whic h it is committed it need not have been planned or supported by some form of policy

conventions and other customary international law sources to provide content to the federal common law governing these lawsuits this path of looking directly to customary international law reaches essentially the same end result as applying international norms pursuant to the ats albeit by slightly different means the supreme court simply preserved this path as an expression of the importance

the controlling jurisprudence mr prince asks this court to slam the courthouse doors shut and protect him from any financial liability for his own bad acts these bad acts are the subject of multiple grand jury investigations and one pending criminal action but mr prince fail s to advance any legally compelling reason why this court should shut the courthouse doors to innocent iraqis who were harmed by mr prince and his companies mr prince whether by design or inadvertence wholly ignores the fact that plaintiffs seek to hold him personally and directly liable for the deaths and injuries mr prince instead focuses on various forms of secondary liability and claims plaintiffs failed to plead properly t his is simply not the case plaintiffs properly plead facts establishing mr princes direct liability mr prince asserts plaintiffs do not explain the theory of secondary liability that they mean to invoke prince mem at 9 mr prince then arg ues that his companies cannot be liable

ential airways inc 502 f3d 1331 11th cir 2007 as discussed more fully below mr prince is very familiar with the latter action as presidential airways his one of his companies there his pilots killed an american serviceman19 the supreme courts baker v carr 369 us 186 217 1962 decision guides the analysis there are six factors that prevent federal district court from exercising jurisdiction 1 textually demonstrable constitutional commitment to the executive branch 2 the impossibility of deciding wi thout an initial policy determination of kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion 3 the impossibility of courts undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government 4 an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to political decision already made 5 the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question and 6 judicially unmanageable need for discovery none of these factors is prese nt here when the widow s ued mr prince tried to prevent judicial review of his mens misconduct by alleging the courts lack the power to hear any challenges to the operations of his empire because he was working for the united states 19 the judicial description of the conduct of mr princes employees is quite illuminating and serves as but one example of the recklessness that pervaded the blackwater companies see mcmahon v presidential airways inc 502 f3d 1331 1337 11th cir 2007 describing princes pilots fatal foray that deviated from announced flight plan into canyon of rapidly

52 1 this lawsuit does not challenge matters demonstrably and textually committed in the constitution to the executive branch mr prince and his companies rest exclusively on the first test arguing national security and foreign relations raise political questions they then devote pages and pages to describing the state departments contract all of this argument is window dressing for mr princes real argument which finally surfaces on page 28 nor may the judiciary entertain tort claims based on any alleged failure of ustc blackwater or individual ics to comply with the standards specified by the state department caselaw is cited in support of this proposition as matter of law mr prince is simply wrong the court of appea ls for the fourth circuits decision in tiffany v united states 931 f2d 271 4th cir 1991 controls there the court of appeals for the fourth circuit in tiffany had occasion to rule on claims brought not against private party such as mr prince b ut against the executive branch the military itself20 20 in tiffany the lawsuit was against the united states government itself not against forprofit corporation the court was asked to determine whether government employees could be held liable under negligence theory despites having abided by the laws and standards governing their conduct in essence plaintiffs were seeking the impos ition of strict liability standard 931 f2d at 273 75 here as is evidenced by the federal criminal war crimes act the judiciary is well versed in ruling on whether lethal use of force was permissible exercise or war crime the standard by whi ch to measure blackwaters conduct is set out in that act the court held that if the conduct at issue violates federal statutes or formal published regulations the judiciary has the power and indeed the obligation to exercise jurisdiction even over exec utive branch officials id at 280 the court of appeals explained the political question analysis turns on whether plaintiffs allege as the plaintiffs did in berkovitz v united states 486 us 531 1988 that the government violated any federal laws contained either in statutes or in formal published regulations such as those in the code of federal regulations the court went on to state there can be doubt that the mandate of federal statute is far case 109cv00618tseidd document 31 filed 08032009 page 71 of 91 53 stronger foundation for the creation of an action duty than an administrative directive id citations omitted thus if the plaintiffs allege such violations the federal courts have the obligation to entertain suit even as against the executive branch itself here of course pl aintiffs allege defendants committed war crimes conduct prohibited by federal statute war crimes act 18 usc 2441d1 2006 and here plaintiffs are not suing the executive branch itself but are suing contractor alleged to have completely ig nored any direction and guidance given by the state department see eg abtan617 compl 60 these claims are justiciable and do not intrude on any executive prerogative as is clearly evidenced by the executive branchs own use of the judicial bra nch see united states v slough et case 108cr00360 ddc dec 4 2009 criminal proceeding against mr princes shooters for their culpability in the nisu r square massacre pending before the district court of the district of columbia mr prince and his companies rely

ntractor ended up being negligence claim against the military on the facts there the military not the contractor had decided when and how to send the vehicle the military controlled all aspects of the convoy specifically the date and time of dep arture the speed the decision to travel along particular route the amount of fuel to be transported the number of trucks in the convey and the distance between each of the trucks the contractor was part of specific military operation that case t hus falls on the same side of the line as the claims directly against the military alleged in tiffany that case does not speak at all to whether the political question may be invoked for case 109cv00618tseidd document 31 filed 08032009 page 72 of 91 54 claims of intentional wrongdoing that violates federal statutes and violates instructions and policies of the united states government the courts of appeal for the eleventh circuit has issued two other decisions rejecting the political question doctrine merely because the tort claims arose in the midst of the iraq war in lane v halliburton 529 f2d 548 558 560 11th cir 2008 the court denied defendants motion to dismiss on political question grounds because the fact that the alleged acts were set against the backdrop of united state military action in iraq does not necessarily implicate any decisions textually committed to the executive such as employing the use of force or deploying troops in foreign land nor does it constitute direct challenge to actions taken by coordinate branch of government id at 567 in mcmahon v presidential airways inc 502 f3d 13 22 11th cir 2007 the eleventh circuit affirmed the district courts rejection of mr princes political question defense the district judge reasoned cases involving traditional tort liability even if they relate to the military or occur during time of war are capable of judicial resolution the judicial standards required are different than in ordinary tort actions it is simply t he context that has changed mcmahon v presidential airways inc 460 f supp 2d 1315 132 2 md fla 2006 the district court also saw significance in the basic difference between questioning the militarys

as noted case 109cv00618tseidd document 31 filed 08032009 page 73 of 91 55 above those factors are 1 the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion 2 the impossibility of courts undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government 3 an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to political decision already made 4 the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question and 5 judicially unmanageable need for discovery baker v carr 369 us 186 217 1962 first initial policy determination is needed as there is already statute prohibiting the conduct the war crimes act spells out the prohibited acts inten tional killing and wounding civilians who are taking part in hostilities see 18 usc 2441d1d and f 2006 as such there is clearly defined body of law prohibiting the conduct alleged see eg presbyterian

citizens citing doe v mcmillan 93 sct 2018 2028 1973 there has been one instance in this circuit when the court of appeals found that extending absolute immunity to private contractors within the narrow circumstances where the public interest in efficient government outweighs the costs of granting such immunity mangold 77 f3d at 1447 there the contractor wanted immuni ty for statement made in government investigation the court found significant public benefit in preserving the governments ability to investigate fraud waste and mismanagement in administration of government contracts

can easily be decided now however is that iraqi law may be applied by this court and that iraqi law does not bar plaintiffs claims defendants claim plaintiffs lack the ability to seek redress for the killings and woundings for two reasons first mr prince and his companies argues that the cpa order 17 issued june 2003 updated june 27 2004 the bremer orde r prevents plaintiffs from bringing suit second mr prince hired an american lawyer who has never practiced law in iraq and is not native arabic speaker24 1 the bremer order contemplates lawsuits such as these proceeding in united states c ourts based on an opinion provided by this american lawyer defendants claim iraqi courts would sla m their courthouse doors shut were the iraqi plaintiffs to seek to sue in iraq mr princes arguments fail first on the bremer order plaintiffs are before th is court located far from iraq but convenient to mr princes offices and home because the bremer order protected american contractors from being hailed into iraqi courts mr prince and blackwater have misread the bremer order as forbidding this court f rom applying iraqi law the bremer order actually says the opposite it states that contractors are not exempt from iraqi substantive tort law cpa order 17 44 june 27 2004 note defendants are not coalition personnel as defined in section 11 of the bremer order since they are not forces employed

contractor who is supplying goods andor services to or on behalf of coalition forces or the cpa under contractual arrangements id 15 2 iraqi law p ermits plaintif fs claims second iraqi substantive law permits plaintiffs claims including their claims for punitive damages to be brought mr prince s expert on iraqi law haider ala hamoudi failed to interpret accurately the relevant sections of the iraqi civil code he incorrectly refers to article 213 of the iraqi civil code he likely meant to refer to article 219 which expressly deals with vicarious liability26 25 section 11s inclusion of civilians in the definition of coalition personnel refers to civilian employees of the us government not to independent contractors the first section of that article says the government municipalities and other institutions performing public service and any person exploiting one of the industrial or commercial institutions are liable for the damage caused by the ir employees if the damage is the result of violation perpetrated while carrying out their services see exhibit k declaration of dr aziz jawad hadi however vicarious liability is in way limited by this provision in fact according to dr salee m abdullah juboori the person injured as result of an act 26 for the courts reference we have included translation of articles 202 220 of the iraqi civil code as exhibit m case 109cv00618tseidd document 31 filed 08032009 page 84 of 91 66 perpetrated by private company working in iraq has the choice of instituting legal proceeding against the persons who caused him damage or against the company itself being liable for the acts of its employees see exhibit j mr princes american expert seems to believe that iraqi plaintiffs must allege some sort of relationship between the defendant and the iraqi government in order to seek vicarious liability he is incorrect as expl ained by the iraqi jurists who actually practice law in iraq although the first part of the first sentence of article 219 refers specifically to governments and municipalities the section goes on to apply to any person exploiting one of the industrial r commercial institutions this is way limited to government ventures one expert dr juboori explains as follows there is restriction limiting the institution of legal proceeding against specific type of companies sic whether it is nected by contract with the government only or with other parties see exhibit j declaration of dr saleem abdullah juboori see als exhibit k declaration of dr aziz jawad hadi the opinions of plaintiffs experts

regardless of the type of damage 3 this court has the power to ensure plaintiffs have r emedy because iraqi law provides plaintiffs remedy on the facts alleged here the court may decide to borrow that law for purpo ses of developing the federal common law applicable to this matter but the court is also free to ignore iraqi law if it believes application of such law contravenes the public policy
