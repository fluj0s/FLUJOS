can undercut the forces of islamic radi calism and indoctrination as us democracy promotion policies have moved forward policy makers have confronted significant dilemma how to respond to challenges posed by po litical islamist movement s ie parties and political organizations that promote soci and political reform in accordance with islamic religious principles that may l ead them to oppose us foreign policy in response to this dilemma some obs ervers have questioned whether the united states should exert pressure on arab governments to open their political systems and respect human rights with the knowledge that such steps if successful may benefit islamist groups representing powerful and popular political force in the arab world today many islamist political parties and organizations are largely opposed at least rhetorically to key asp ects of us foreign policy in the middle east such as support for israel the occ upation of iraq and the large us military presence in the persian gulf elections in iraq egypt and the palestinian authority that were supported by the united states have strengthened the political positions of islamist organizations including in the case of hamas armed groups that have refused to renounce violence nonviolent islamist groups which have chosen or b een permitted to peacefully participate in politics present their own challenges to us policy makers this report raises the following questions are islamis ts liberal democrats or fundamentalists should the united states support their par ticipation in democr atic politics do non violent islamists welcome dialogue with the united states or would such action discredit them among their followers while many continue to speculate over the direction of us democracy promotion in the middle east congress ma use its oversight authority to bring further clarity to the administrations regional strategy particularly on the issue of dealing with islamist groups congress also appropriates

order in their countries or socie ties be based upon their interpretation of islamic lawus democracy promotion policy in the middle east the islamist dilemma overview as an ongoing response to the terrori st attacks of september 11 2001 and justification for the us invasion of iraq the bush administration has made the promotion of democracy in the middle east national security priority stating that greater political freedom can undercut th forces of islamic radicalism and indoctrination1 however with ongoing sectarian violence in iraq and arab regimes firmly entrenched in power this policy has come under increasing scrutiny many have questioned the pr acticality of this approach and the us ability to accelerate the forces of modernization and social change across wide and diverse geographic area yet despite continuing reservations over us sincerity depth of commitment and consistency on the democratization issue the enormous attention that middle east or arab democratization has received in the years since the september 11th terrorist attacks is believed by many skeptics and advocates alike to have reverberated across the arab world for better or for worse sparking debate antigovernment demonstrations and regimem anipulated elections to appease internal and external demands for democratization at the heart of this upheaval lies long vexing dilemma for us policy makers should the united states exert pressure on arab governments to open their political systems and respect human rights with th knowledge that islamists the most popular opposition force in arab politics stand to benefit from regiona l democratization many observers assert that islamist2 political parties and organizations are largely opposed at least rhetorically to key asp ects of us foreign policy

shiitehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33486crs2 muslim parties in iraq and fundamentalist hamas in palestinian authority elections the united states by encouraging free and fair elections across the region may have inadvertently strengthened islamist oppos ition movements par ticularly militant ones this dilemma becomes even more problematic when turning to the possible participation of nonvi olent islamist groups that have chosen or been permitted to participate peacefully in pol itics many of these gr oups exist in what some experts call gray zone in which their participation in politics is permitted but limited since these socalled moderate isla mist groups have re nounced violence and terrorism it would seem logical that us efforts to promote arab democracy would include seeking more rights for all legitimate actors including these islamists however circumstances differ across the arab world and democracy promotion in the middle east is complex issue with many outstanding questions particularly when examining islamism this report examines how us democracy promotion efforts interact with the political rea lities on the ground in three arab countries morocco egypt and jordan and raises the following questions who are the islamists are such groups legitimate democra tic actors or militant fundamentalists in disguise to what extent are islamists opposed to us middle east policy should the united states engage with nonviol ent islamist groups either gradually or immediately would such engagement isol ate key arab regimes whose cooperation is vital to waging the war on terrorism and securing other us national security goals do nonviolent islamist groups even welcome or accept di alogue with the united states or would such action disc redit them among their followers should these nonviolent islamist movement s be embraced cautiously accepted or circumvented are us democratization effo rts designed to foster alternatives to islamists islamism and identity politics at the heart of the democratization issue in the middle east is the question of national identity in many countries questions about the role of islam in political life rights for ethnic and religious minorities and the role of women remain unresolved with secular arab nationalism having b een largely discredited in the wake of successive arab defeats at the hand of israel in 1967 and 1973 islamism and ethnic politics have largely stepped in to fill an identity vacuum in the arab world today number of competing and overlapping identities vie for primacy in the middle east moderate islamists seek to balance the need for political and social reform with the desire to create society governed by the general principles of islamic law sharia other more radical islamists may use elections as tool to come to power in order to create more rigid islamic rule nonislamist reformers draw support from both secular intellect uals and minority religiousethnic communities who have traditionally been re legated to secondclass status secular intellectuals members of so minority groups and wome ns rights advocates are frequently accused of collaborating with foreigners because

university press 2004 p 25national identities to reinforce their rule some regimes have created secular republics dominated by one ruling party and the military other ruling families have based their legitimacy on their comm on ancestry from the prophet muhammad many analysts consider islamism to be the most popular of the identification models in the arab world according to scholar quintan wiktorowicz islamic activism is rooted in the symbolism language and cultural history of muslim society and as result has successfu lly resonated with increas ingly disillusioned populations suffering from political exclusion economic deprivation and sense of growing impotence at the expense of outside powers and facele ss process of globalization3 asserting that islam is the solution common islamist slogan to the socio economic problems posed by modernity nd western consumer culture islamists both radical and nonviolent groups have s ought to construct their own institutions in society ranging from political organizati ons to health clinic s and schools through their extensive social welfare networks islamists have created alternative state structures that serve to reinforce their appeal among the lower and middle classes there are many examples across the middle east of legal or semilegal islamist organizations that have been granted either full or limited participation in the political system some of these groups have re nounced violence and peacefully oppose their respective governments some regimes ve allowed their pa rticipation in part because islamist parties may act to bolster the strength of the oneparty state or royal family for example when facing economic recession and largescale public unrest arab governments sometimes have grante d islamist organizations more leeway in conducting opposition activities in order to relieve the political system of public pressure thus nonviolent islamist groups have existed in an ambiguous position on the one hand regimes may exaggerate the threat islamists pose to state stability and therefore maintain that these groups are illegal on the other hand they may permit islamists to conduc t limited opposition activity if such activity ultimately benefits the regime arab dissidents have long mainta ined that some secular authoritarian regimes offer islamists limited participation in politics to prevent secular opposition groups or leaders from challenging the ruling party us government concern over islamist groups in previous administrations when regi onal democratization was not seen as us national security priority and islamis t extremism was not seen as significant threat the islamist dilemma was largely an academic question rather than an immediate policy concern since the 1979 ir anian revolution the us government has increasingly believed that should isla mist groups come to power they would pursue more confrontational approach in their foreign policy toward the united states and that key us strategic interests would suffer including access to oil reserves military cooperation nd the security of israel among others to the extent that the united states pushed for regiona l

and lebanese terrorist groups such as hamas and hezballah have played major role in foster ing an extreme distrust of all islamist groups in the eyes of many us officials and wmakers though hamas and hezballah members hold government leadership positions and clai m that these activities are separate from what they describe as legitimate resistance to th israeli occupation of palestinian and lebanese lands the groupssuicide bombing operations and rocket attacks against civilian targets have made it difficult for the united states to consider them as anything but terrorist organizations moreover some supporters of israel fear that any western recognition of islamist organizations anywhere in the middle east would lead governments down slippery slope and would ultimately strength the positions of hamas and hezballah who seek international legitimacy for their respec tive political roles in the west bankgaza and lebanon see us state departments country reports on terrorism and patters of global terrorism 2005 available at httpwwwstategovdocumentsorganization65472pdfrights was secondary arab regimes largely focused on the symbolic rather than the substantive elements of democratic ch ange in order to diffuse occasional international attention to their lack of political freedom many governments continue to employ this strategy by manipulatin g elections keeping parliamentary systems weak and allowing only token oppos ition to operate ope nly and legally the entry of the palestinian hamas and the lebanese hezballah movements into the formal political process also has fueled us suspicions of islamist movements as usdesignated terrorist organizations and combatants in the arabisraeli conflict hamas and hezballah have maintained armed militias and refused to renounce terrorism or violence as means of achieving their political goals though both groups participate in their respective political systems they are infamous for maintaining armedterrorist wings that threaten israel4 some experts argue that non violent islamist groups that renounce violence as tactic in their own countries but support its use in the palestinianisraeli c ontext should not be considered nonviolent in addition analysts have long observe d how some arab regimes have played on western fears of political islamism by attempting to paint all islamist organizations as radical thereby positi oning themselves as the only moderate alternative likely to support us objectives some arab governments such as egypt syria and algeria have history of vi olent confrontation with islamic extremists who have assassinated government officials and launche d costly insurgencies against security forces in some ways arab gove rnments have been engaged in their own war on terror for many years and the experience has made them reluctant to recognize nonrevolutionary islamist groups many arab human rights advocates have asserted that regime s have harnessed the fear of fundamentalistinspired terrorism and instability in order to justify continued oneparty rule and relieve external pressure for political reformhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33486crs5 5 president bush

arab regimes are the bulwark against islamic radicalism in the aftermath of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the idea that democratic middle ea st would be less vulnerable to the forces of extremism contribut ed in part to the us invasion of iraq and in the months following the active co mbat phase of operation iraqi freedom the president put forth his forward st rategy of freedom in the middle east asserting that sixty years of western nations excusing and accommodating the lack of freedom in the middle east did nothing to make us safe because in the long run stability cannot be purchased at the expense of liberty as long as the middle east remains place where freedom does not flourish it will remain place of stagnation resentment and viol ence ready for export and with the spread of weapons that can bring catastr ophic harm to our c ountry and to our friends it would be reckless to accept the status quo5 with the united states committed at least rhetorically to changing the status quo of authoritarian governance in the br oader middle east ma ny have speculated about what political outcomes would be pr eferable for us policy makers should genuine political reform take hold in the middle east within the us foreign policy establishment there has been an ongoing vigorous debate over the issue of engaging islamist groups some of wh ich have renounced the use of violence and entered into mainstream politics combating islamism and promoting liberal alternatives some believe that all isla mists whether they espouse peaceful or violent means to achieve power are suspect dr martin kramer middle east expert at the washington institute for near east policy argues that all islamists are fundamentalists who are inhe rently antidemocr atic and antiwest ern in his essay islam vs democracy kramer writes that democracy diversity accommodation the fundamentalists have repudiated them all in appealing to the masses who fill their mosques they promise instead to institute regime of islamic law make common cause with likeminded brethren everywhere and struggle against the hegemony of the west and the existence of israel fundamentalists have held to these

islamists program brief nixon center october 24 2005 8 according to university of maryland profe ssor shibley telhami skepticism about the real aims of these groups islamists should be balanced by openness to the possibility that their aims once they are in power could differ from their aims as opposition gr oups this requires partial engagement patience and willingness to allow such new governments space and time to put their goals to the test of reality see in the mideast the third way is myth washington post february 17 2006other experts have echoed such beliefs asserting that the idea of nonviolent islamism is myth since even nonviolen t islamists routinely fail to condemn terrorist acts committed by their more radi cal counterparts according to daniel pipes director of the philadelphia based think tank the middle east forum facilitating the immediate politi cal participation of is lamists is tantamount to helping the enemy7 others believe that islamists would set back regional democratization by restricting the rights of women and religious minorities and that their ascension to power would be detrimental fo r us policy in the region in order to counter islamist influence some have suggested that the united states if it is going to promote regional democracy should ggressively work to strengthen the rule of law separation of powers civil society and lternative preferably secular movements there also continues to be strong sentiment among some foreign policy experts and arab government officials that the unite d states should refrain from pushing for political liberalization and allow market forces and globalization to gradually build educated middle classes who can push for change indigenously engaging mainstream nonviolent islamists some scholars assert that the united stat should at the very least lessen its traditional suspicions of nonviolent isla mist groups and not oppose their integration into political systems many middle east experts have asserted that if islamists were able to exercise real political power considerations of realpolitik would moderate their behavior and conseque ntly improve their relations with western governments8 some point to more or less cordial us relations with turkey whose government is led by conservative or centerright islamis t party although islamism in turkey is counterbalanced by turkeys long tr adition of secularism and constitutional provisions supporting secularism in additi on some counterterrorism experts have long suggested that the recognition and integration of nonviolent islamist groups into politics would provide positive outlet for muslim activists and lessen the allure of more radical groups pragmatic approach with us democracy promotion policy toward islamists left somewhat vague perhaps even deliberately so there are many foreign policy practitioners in the us state department who believe that at the moment the united states is taking pragmatic approach toward middle east mocratization some officials assert that us policy is flexible and applied to specific circum stances on countrybycountryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33486crs7 9 islamists at

the question of how much of the historical sharia islamic law that is the corpus of traditional islamic legal rulings inherited from the past can and should be revised9 some suggest that the us government because it is constrained by its strategic relationships with authoritarian regimes may only be capable of selective engagement with some nonviolent islamist groups in this viewpoint such an approach though it would be far less ambitious than the grand rhetoric outlined by the administration and would leave the us government open to accusations of promoting reform inconsistently could rve us interests by promoting reform where it is possible without disrupting re lations with other key arab partners implementing us democracy promotion policy though many have criticized us democr

administration officials visiting the regi on such as secretary of state condoleezza rices july 2005 policy speech on democracy at the american university of cairo in egypt is another way for us policy makers to keep reform visible issue in us dealings with arab regimes however visiting us officials who raise the democratization issue are often accused in the arab media of unfairly meddling

or measured like traditional us foreign assistance for tangible projects such as road construction water resource development and school improvement further proponents of current policy say that the united states continues to spend far more resources on military assistance to the region than on reform while this statement is factually correct it focuses too narrowly on levels of spending rather than on the substance of us programming support for indigenous reformers does not necessarily require large amounts of financial assistance rather it must be properly channeled to support reformers

bmena the bush administration has been credited with raising awareness within the international community for the need for political and economic reform in muslim majority and arab countries however some analysts believe that bmena is too broad to promote reform effectively and doubt that it can evolve into something more than forum for intergovernmental dialogue currently bmena countries support

experts also note that islam commonly prac ticed in morocco is traditionally less dogmatic and more tolerant than the more austere and ri gid interpretations in places like saudi arabia 18 the pjds party website is located at httpwwwpjdmasommaire_enphp3 19 observers have noted that political parties in morocco are extremely weak and generally ineffective under such circumstances the pjd stands apart as real party actively seeking constituents challenge the kings authority17 the pjd has accepted such bargain and the relationship between it and the palace t hough at times confront ational has overall been mutually beneficial moroccan aut horities have sought to avoid the kind of bloody confrontation with islamists that plagued neighboring algeria throughout the 1990s but concern remains over the prolifera tion of jihadist terrorist groups like qaeda that seek to recruit moroccans at home and abroad thus morocco has chosen path of inclusion rather than exclusion in order to lure islamists away from militancy and toward more gitimate means of political participation there also may be an economic reason to allow islamists into the political system morocco which lacks natural resources like oil and depends on foreign aid and trade with the west has an economic incentive to mainta in its momentum on the reform front particularly given the recent focus by moro ccos key trading partners in europe and the united states on democracy and human rights promotion the pjd is not the only islamist group in morocco second group known in arabic as aladl walihsan or justice and charity jco is only legally recognized as charity the jco rejects the legitim acy of the moroccan monarchy though reliable data on the popularity of either group are available there seems to be consensus among morocco experts that the jco has wider national base of grassroots support though the pjd is very active in urban areas the pjd like many islamist groups across th globe it is difficult to discern what the pjds true goals and objectives are over the long term18 some believe that although the party has agreed to work within the current system it remains committed to establishing an islamic state in morocco with islamic law or sharia as the basis for legislation others see the pjds principles as deliberately ambiguous with its leadership desiring to strike balance between continuing its opposition to government corruption and nepotism while possibly participating in future government coalitions perhaps after the 2007 parliamentary elec tion reportedly the pjd covets the social affairs and education ministerial portfolios where it could pursue an islamist agenda due to its participation in the moroccan political system some have called the pjd the islamists of the palace though observers note that the pjds aggressive campaigning among lower and middlecl ass moroccans has made the group more popular than many of moroccos ol der and more blished parties19 nevertheless the aspirations of the pjd remain limited as it has consistently sided with the monarchy even on issues that would appear to contravene conservative interpretation of is lamic law such as

monarchy although relations between the brotherhood and the palace ve fluctuated over the years the brotherhood presence in jordan dates back to the 1930s as it has been tacitly recognized first as charitable organization and later as quasipolitical organization which has openly fielded candi dates in parliament ary elections albeit under different name isl amic action front iaf th relationship between the brotherhood and the palace has been mutua lly beneficial over the years successive jordanian monarchs have found that the brot herhood has been more useful po litically as an ally than as an opponent as opposed to the brotherhood in egypt as it secured islamist support in counterin g arab nationalist interfe rence during the 1950s and 1960s and secular palestinia n nationalism in the 1970s jordanian islamists have been most effective at gaining control of jordans educational system after th brotherhood sided with king hussein during the black september crisis of 1970 in which the
