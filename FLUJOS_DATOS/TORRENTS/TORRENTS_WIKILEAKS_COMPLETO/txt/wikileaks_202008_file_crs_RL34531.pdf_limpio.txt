states has been party to multilateral and bilateral agreements addressing the status of us armed forces while present in foreign country these agreements commonly referred to as status of forces agreements sofas generally establish the framework under which us military personnel operate in foreign country the united states is currently party to more than 100 agreements that may be considered sofas1 sofa as standalone document may not exist with particular country but that does not necessarily mean that the status of us personnel in that country has not been addressed terms commonly found in sofas may be contained in other agreements with partner country so that separate sofa is not always utilized sofa is an agreement that establishes the framework under which armed forces operate within foreign country2 the agreement provides for rights and privileges of covered individuals while in the foreign jurisdiction addressing how the domestic laws of the foreign jurisdiction shall be applied to us personnel3 while in that country it is important to note that sofa is contract between parties and may be cancelled at the will of either party sofas are peacetime documents and therefore do not address the rules of war the ws of armed conflict or the laws of the sea in the event of armed conflict between parties to sofa the terms of the agreement would longer be applicable sofas may include many provisions but the most common issue addressed is which country may exercise criminal jurisdiction over us personnel the united states has concluded agreements where it maintains exclusive jurisdiction over its personnel but more often the agreement calls for shared jurisdiction with the receiving country in general sofa does not authorize specific exercises activities or missions rather it provides the framework for legal protections and rights while us personnel are present in country for agreed upon purposes sofa is not mutual defense agreement or security agreement the existence of sofa does not affect or diminish the parties inherent right of selfdefense under the law of war

that will be afforded us personnel while present in foreign country the agreement establishes which party to the agreement is able to assert crimin andor civil jurisdiction in other words the agreement establishes how the domestic civil and criminal laws are applied to us personnel while serving in foreign country the united states has entered agreements where it maintains exclusive jurisdiction but the more common agreement results in shared jurisdiction between the united states and the signatory country exclusive jurisdiction is when the united states retains the right to exercise all criminal and disciplinary jurisdiction for violations of the laws of the foreign nation while the individual is present in that country shared jurisdiction occurs when each party to the agreement retains exclusive jurisdiction over certain offenses but also allows the united states to request that the host country waive jurisdiction in favor of the united states exercising criminal and disciplinary jurisdiction the right to exert jurisdiction over us personnel is not solely limited to when an individual is located on military installation it may cover individuals off the installation as well the right to exert jurisdiction can result in complete immunity from the laws of the receiving country wh ile the individual is present in that country

established that the united states retained jurisdiction over offenses committed by servicemember arising out of any act or omission done in the performance of official duty in 1957 member of the us army was indicted in the death of japanese civilian while participating in small unit exercise at camp weir range area in japan58 the united states claimed that the act was committed in the performance of official duty but japan insisted that it was outside the scope of official duty and therefore japan had primary jurisdiction to try the member after negotiations the united states acquiesced and agreed to turn the member over to japanese authorities in an attempt to avoid trial in the japanese courts the member sought writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the district of columbia 59 the writ was denied but the member was granted an injunction against delivery to japanese authorities to stand trial the united states appealed the injunction to the us supreme court in wilson v girard 60 the supreme court first addressed the jurisdictional provisions contained in the administrative agreement the court determined that by recommending ratification of the security treaty and subsequently the nato sofa the senate had approved the administrative agreement and protocol embodying the nato provisions governing jurisdiction to try criminal offenses61 the court held that sovereign nation has exclusive jurisdiction to punish offenses against its laws committed within its border unless it expressly or impliedly consents to surrender its jurisdiction and that japans cession to the united states of jurisdiction to try american military personnel for conduct constituting an offense against the laws of both countries was conditioned by provisions contained in the protocol calling for sympathetic consideration to request from the other state for waiver of its right in cases where that other state considers such waiver to be of particular importance 62 the court concluded that the issue was then whether the constitution or legislation subsequent to treaty prohibited carrying out of the jurisdictional provisions the court found none and stated that in the absence of such encroachments the wisdom of the arrangement is exclusively for the determination of the executive and legislative branches63 the treaty of mutual cooperation and security between the united states of america and japan64 was concluded in 1960 and subsequently amended on december 26 199065 under article vi of the treaty the united states is granted the use by

under separate agreement67 much like the previous security treaty concluded in 1952 sofa as called for under article vi of the treaty was concluded as separate agreement pursuant to and concurrently with the treaty in 196068 the sofa addresses the use of facilities by the us armed forces as well as the status of us forces in japan the agreement has been modified at least four times since the original agreement69 g21g152g158g157g145g561g13g152g155g142g138g561 in 1954 the united states and the republic of korea entered into mutual defense treaty70 as part of the treaty the countries agree to attempt to settle international disputes peacefully consult whenever the political independence or security of either party is threatened by external armed attack and that either party would act to et the common danger in accordance with their respective constitutional processes71 article iv of the treaty grants the united states the right to dispose land air and sea forces in and about the territory of south korea72 pursuant to the treaty specifically article iv the countries entered into sofa with agreed minutes and an exchange of notes in 196673 it was subsequently amended january 18 2001 in 1968 two years after the sofa was signed betw een the countries member of the us army asserted in smallwood v clifford74 that us authorities did not have legitimate authority under the jurisdictional provisions contained in the agre ement to release him to the republic of korea for trial by korean court on charges of murder and arson75 the servicemember asserted that the agreement was not approved in constitutionally acceptable manner76 he maintained that us domestic law requires international agreements pertaining to foreign jurisdiction over us forces stationed abroad be approved either expressly or impliedly by the us senate77 the court found that the sofa resulted in diminished role for the republic of korea in enforcing its own laws and that the united states did not waive jurisdiction over offenses committed within its own territory therefore ratification by the senate was clearly unnecessary because senate approval 67 id 68 11 ust 1652 tias 4510 373 unts 248

korea of which the united states could not rightfully claim78 additionally the servicemember asserted that the constitution and the uniform code of military justice ucmj79 provide the sole methods for trying servicemen abroad and that they can not be changed by an executive agreement80 the court held that the premise is true only when there hasnt been violation of the laws of the foreign jurisdiction when violation of the foreign jurisdictions criminal laws occurs the primary jurisdiction lies with that nation and the provisions of the ucmj only apply if the foreign nation expressly or impliedly waived its jurisdiction 81 in support of its decision the court cited the principle stated in wilson 82 that the primary right of jurisdiction belongs to the nation in whose territory the servicemember commits the crime g18g145g146g149g146g153g153g146g151g142g156g561 in 1947 the united states and the republic of the philippines entered into an agreement on military assistance 83 the

agreement further created an advisory group to provide advice and assistance to the philippines as had been authorized by the us congress84 the agreement was extended and amended for an additional five years in 195385 mutual defense treaty was entered into by the united states and the philippines in 195186 the treaty publicly declares their sense of unity and their common determination to defend themselves against external armed attack so that potential aggressor could be under the illusion that either of them stands alone in the pacific area87 the treaty does not address or provide for sofa in 1993 the countries entered into sofa88 the agreement was subsequently extended on september 19 1994 april 28 1995 and november 29 december 1 and 8 1995 the countries entered into an

countries also entered into an agreement regarding the treatment of republic of philippines personnel visiting the united states counterpart agreement90 the counterpart agreement contains provisions addressing criminal jurisdiction over philippine personnel while in the united states the agreement was concluded as an executive agreement and not ratified by the us senate arguably following the logic of the us district court for the district of columbia in clifford because the agreement arguably diminishes the impact of us jurisdiction it would need be ratified by the senate in order to be constitutionally valid but the counterpart agreement can be distinguished from the sofa with the republic of korea and sofas with other foreign jurisdictions in that the us is not fully waiving jurisdiction over offenses committed within us territory rather the agreement states that us authorities will at the request of the government of the philippines request that the appropriate authorities waive jurisdiction in favor of philippine authorities 91 however the us department of state and department of defense retain the ability to determine that us interests require that the united states exercise federal or state jurisdiction over the philippine personnel92
