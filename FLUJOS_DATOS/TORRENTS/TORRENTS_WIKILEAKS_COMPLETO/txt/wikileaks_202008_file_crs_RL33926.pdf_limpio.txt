lies in the prospect that the market price of the companys stock will increase by the time the option is exercised used to purchase stock at the grant date for the options rather than selecting an exercise price based on the current market price for the stock officials at some companies have selected prior date with lower market price that is they backdated stock options to an earlier grant date if this backdating occurred without public disclosure the recipient of the stock options received increased compensation in violation of securities and exchange commission sec regulations generally accepted accounting rules and tax laws some backdating is said to involve sloppiness not fraud the backdating of stock options has imposed costs on shareholders employees bondholders and taxpayers corporate official who has profited from undisclosed backdating of stock options may not be responsible or even knowledgeable of the backdating nonqualified stock options which have special tax criteria to meet are the focus of the backdating controversy primarily because they can be granted in unlimited amounts the magnitude of stock option grants grew drama tically in the 1990s subsequent to passage of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 stock market boom and revised accounting rules recent corporate disclosure changes have reduced the opportunities and rewards for backdating stock options empirical studies about backdating have been done by academics and investigative journalists four recent regulatory actions may have reduced the backdating of stock options but problems persist on december 16 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued new rules requiring companies to subtract the expense of options from their earnings after august 29 2002 the sarbanesoxley act required that companies notify the sec within two business days after granting stock options in 2003 the sec require d increased disclosure of stock option plans the sec issued enhanced option grant disclosure rules effective december 15 2006 policy options to further reduce backdating and other timing manipulation include changes in sec regulations and change in the tax law the sec various state prosecutorial and department of justice doj probes into backdating abuses are ongoing in addition many firms have mounted their own internal probes into possible abuses by november 2007 the secs investigation caseload had fallen from peak of 160 to about 80 and the sec had brought civil enforcement actions against seven companies and 26 former executives associated with 15 firms and according to reports from the doj there were at least 10 criminal filings against defendants for backdating as of january 2 2008 the only ceo to be convicted of charges related to backdating was greg reyes former brocade ceo this report will be updated as issues develop or new legislation is introduced

options are contracts giving employees including officers and sometimes directors and other service providers the right to buy the companys common stock at specified exercise price or strike price at specified time or during specified period after specified vesting period options have most often been issued atthemoney ie with an exercise price equal to the market price of the underlying stock at the date of grant but may also be issued either inthemoney ie with an exercise pric below the market price of the underlying stock at the date of grant or outofthemoney ie with an exercise price above the market price of the underlying stock at the date of grant the intrinsic value of the option is the market value of the stock less the exercise price which is only relevant if the stock option is issued in the money the time value of the option when granted lies in the prospect that the market price of the companys stock will increase by the time the option is exercised used to purchase stock that is its potential appreciation value setting lower exercise price increases the value of the option at the grant date for the options rather than selecting an exercise or strike price based on the current market price for the stock officials at some companies have selected prior date with lower market price that is they backdated stock options to an earlier date thus officials backdated the grant date of the option eg on january 10 the companys officials decided to grant stock options as of january 5 which resulted in stock options being granted in the money if backdating occurred without disclosure then the recipient of the stock options receives an increase in compensation at the expense of other shareholders when he exercises his options to purchase stock undisclosed backdating of stock options violates regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec accounting rules and tax laws failure to disclose backdating and recognize adverse tax and accounting consequences may result in 1 material errors in financial statements fraud and other violations of securities law including falsifying books and records and misrepresenting financial filings to auditorscentral concerns of the sec with respect to violations of civil law and the department of justice with respect to violations of criminal law and 2 the loss of tax deductions and imposition of penalties and interest for failure to withhold and accurately report income and employment taxescentral concerns of the internal revenue service irs 1 backdating the grant date could be undertaken for innocent reasons eg to provide equity for recentlyhired employees when stock prices are volatile that were undertaken in ignorance of the negative accounting and tax complications2 backdating is not necessarily illegal the sec has resource constraints and thus is limited in the number of backdating cases that it can pursue according to stephen j crimmins formerly of secs enforcement division and comanager of its trial unit as the sec pursues the stock option cases it will be particularly interesting to see how the government handles situations where individuals did not knowingly violate the law or deceptively cover up their activities where 1 eric dash dodging taxes is new stock options scheme new york times oct 30 2006 p 1 2 although numerous empirical studies have found statistical support for the hypothesis that corporate executives and directors have benefitted from the undisclosed backdating of stock options this does not prove that particular corporate official was responsible or even knowledgeable of the backdating httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33926g21g157g152g140g148g561g17g153g157g146g152g151g156g497g561g22 g145g142g561g4g138g140g148g141g138g157g146g151

understanding of the accounting and tax rules involved in option grants where they relied on inhouse or outside professionals to alert them to potential compliance issues and where problems stemmed from imprecision or outright sloppiness in tending to the formalities that drive the setting of grant dates 3 by november 2007 the secs backdating investigation caseload had dropped from peak of 160 firms to about 80 however officials at the division of enforcement indicated that the number could grow in the future as the agency continues to examine subprime lending and other types of potential financial fraud4 on september 18 2007 the deputy director of the secs division of enforcement stated that backdating continued to be main focus area for his division in 20075 about 200 companies have been under federal investigation andor have restated earnings6 and by november 2007 the sec has brought civil enforcement actions against seven companies and 26 former executives associated with 15 firms and the doj has reportedly brought at least 10 criminal filings against defendants for backdating7 the first stock doj backdating case to go trial was that of gregory reyes former ceo of brocade communications systems the criminal trial ended in august 2007 with mr reyes conviction which some observers suggested might be watershed development with respect to future trials as of january 2 2008 by far the largest backdating abuse settlement involves december 2007 agreement involving william mcguire former chairman and ceo of unitedhealth group inc the nations largest health managed care firm if approved by court the settlement with pension funds invested in unitedhealth would involve mr mcguire giving back to the firm about 419 million in options and other benefitsin addition to about 200 million of options that he had previously surrendered 8 the repayment represents the first secsanctioned use of section 304 the clawback provision of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 against an in dividual the provision is aimed at depriving executives of stock profits and bonuses earned while misleading investors mr mcguire also agreed to pay 7 million fine in an agreement yesterday with the

how many of these probes will ultimately result in criminal or civil charges or sec penalties while undisclosed backdating of stock options is the focus of this report and the most important type of timing manipulation it should be noted that there are other forms of timing manipulation which are discussed in appendix in some cases when more than one form of timing manipulation occurs it may be difficult to empirically separate the relative magnitude of the cost to the shareholders of these different forms of manipulation including backdating in order to fully understand the backdating issue this report covers the following topics illustration of undisclosed backdating types of stock options growth of stock options in the 1990s the extent of timing manipulation of options the potential costs of backdating key legislative and regulatory developments gatekeepers and potential policy options

shown in the following example which demonstrates violations of laws and regulations it should be emphasized that backdating can take variety of forms and in some cases an employee may not be aware that his stock options have been backdated assume that abc inc is publicly held corpor ation whose stock is selling for 50 share on december 31 1998 as part of his compensation plan abc incs chief executive officer ceo is granted options on that date to buy 10000 shares of stock for 50 share at the money but without disclosure the ceo knowingly selects prior grant date of august 15 1998 when the stock price was at its low for the year 30 10 in other words the grant date has been backdated resulting in reduced exercise price of 30 because of backdating in 1998 the ceo received an undisclosed gain on paper of 20 5030 per share for total of 200000 20 x 10000 this gain was not indicated in the financial statements of the corporation in 1998 shareholders were unaware of the backdating which occurred at their expense this undisclosed gain is not consistent with the options agreement that the company filed with the sec assume that the vesting period is two years nd any time over the next eight years he may exercise his options on december 31 2000 his options become vested that is he receives an unrestricted right to buy 10000 shares of stock for 30 share assume that on december 31 2000 the stock price is 75 he decides to exercise his options he could have delayed 10 members of the companys compensation committee are responsible for determining the ceos compensation including grants of stock options but some ceos have simply set their own grants of stock options or have influenced members of the compensation committee to grant them their desired level of stock options httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33926g21g157g152g140g148g561g17g153g157g146g152g151g156g497g561g22 g145g142g561g4g138g140g148g141g138g157g146g151 g144g561g11g156g156g158g142g561 g561

abc 300000 30 x 10000 he has an immediate gain of 450000 45 x 10000 shares on paper assuming that these are nonqualified stock options11 in the year that the options are exercised 2000 the ceo owes taxes on the gain in value and abc inc deducts only 300000 as the cost of these options thus the actual cost of the options to the company is understated the ceo has the choice of selling some or all of his shares or delaying th eir sale with the hope that the price of the stock will rise further g22g162g153g142g156g561g152g143g561g21g157g152g140g148g561g17g153g157g146g152g151g156g561 the internal revenue code irc recognizes two fundamental types of options one is nonqualified options which have special tax criteria to meet but are taxed to the employee as wage income when their value can be unambiguously established which irs says is when they are longer at risk of forfeiture and can be freely transferred 12 they are deductible by the employer when the employee includes them in income irc section 83 the other is called statutory or qualified options which are accorded favorable tax treatment if they meet the ircs strict qualifications irc section 421424 qualified stock options are excluded from employment payroll taxes g16g152g151g154g158g138g149g146g143g146g142g141g561g21g157g152g140g148g561g17g153g157g146g152g151g156g561 nonqualified options may be granted in unlimited amounts these are the options making the news as creating large fortunes for some officers and highly paid employees and are the focus of the backdating controversy in addition to employees these options may also be awarded to anyone providing services to the company including members of the board of directors and even independent contractors they are taxed when exercised and all restrictions on selling the stock have expired based on the difference between the price paid for the stock and its market value at exercise the company is allowed deduction for the same amount in the year the employee includes it in income that is in the same year it is taxable to the recipient they are subject to employment taxes also although taxes are postponed on nonqualified options until they are exercised the deduction allowed the company is also postponed so there is generally little if any tax advantage to these options since most of these options go to highly compensated individuals whose marginal tax rates are approximately equal to the companys the government probably suffers little if any revenue loss the justification for the postponement of taxes on the recipient and the deduction to the corporation is the uncertainty of their actual value the tax rules follow the practical path of postponing tax until their value is realized as is the case with capital gains

one employee and employee stock purchase plans which are limited to 25000 year for any qualified employee employee stock purchase plans must be offered to 11 nonqualified options are defined in the next section of this report 12 nonqualified options are not guaranteed that is they have value if the company goes bankrupt

1986 broadened the individual income tax base and lowered marginal tax rates it can be argued that the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 made two changes in the tax law that contributed to substantial increase in the granting of stock options to corporate executives higher marginal income tax rates and deductibility cap of 1 million on applicable compensation

reconciliation act of 1993 raised marginal individual income tax rates which had current maximum rate of 28 the new maximum marginal tax rate was 396 the stated reasons for raising marginal income tax rates were to raise revenue to reduce the federal deficit to improve tax equity and to make the individual income tax system more progressive 14 these higher marginal income tax rates gave an incentive to individuals to receive types of remuneration that would be taxed at lower rate some returns on stock options are subject to the longterm capital gains rate in addition some individuals can defer redeeming stock options until their marginal tax rate declines the importance of higher marginal tax rates was lessened however by the reductions in marginal rates during the bush administrationthe highest marginal tax rate for 2007 is 35 15

of these covered employees the publicly held corporation could only deduct as an expense the first 1 million of applicable remuneration the reason for this change was that the committee believes that excessive compensation will be reduced if the deduction for compensation paid to the top executives of publicly held corporations is limited to 1 million per year16 exceptions to this 1 million in applicable remuneration include 1 remuneration payable on commission basis and 2 other performancebased compensation in order to qualify for this second exception four conditions must be met it is paid solely on account of the attainment of one or more performance goals the performance goals are determined by compensation committee of the board of directors of the taxpayer which is comprised solely of two or more outside directors the material terms under which the remuneration is to be paid including the performance goals are disclosed to shareholders and approved by majority of the vote in separate shareholder vote before the payment of such remuneration before any payment of such remuneration the compensation committee certifies that the performance goals and any other material terms were in fact satisfied 17 undisclosed backdating of stock option grants in the money is not disclosed to shareholders and approved by majority of the vote in separate shareholder vote before the payment of such remuneration hence the third condition is not met economic theory suggests that the 1 million cap on deductible compensation would increase the relative importance of performancerelated compensation including stock options18 in retrospect the provision appears to have made stock options relatively less expensive than base salaries bonuses or stock grants which were subject to the cap with the backdating scandals as catalyst number of policymakers have recently sought to examine some of the policy implications of the law charles grassley former chairman of the senate finance committee has said companies have found it easy to get around the law it has more holes than swiss cheese and it seems to have encouraged the options industry these sophisticated folks

1990s provided significant boost to the attraction of option awards it could also be argued that because shareholders also benefitted from the markets gains their inclination to criticize the growing size of executive option grants may have been reduced21

1990s companies had the choice of recognizing the estimated value of stock options grants commonly awarded to executives and rank and file workers as costs in their income statements or simply disclosing option grants in the footnotes to the financial statements where they had impact on reported earnings most opted to do so via the footnote disclosure in 1991 the financial accounting standards board fasb the private sector entity that writes accounting rules proposed that an estimated value of such stock options be mandatory cost item in firms financial statements but after vigorous corporate opposition particularly from high tech industry firms fasb opted not to adopt the proposal until 2004 many have since argued that had the proposal been adopted earlier firms might have been less generous in their executive option grant awards 22

options the relevant literature which is summarized in appendix c is divided between academic studies and empirical analyses in the wall street journal the first academic study was undertaken in 2004 by professor erik lie who found strong econom etric evidence of extensive backdating his subsequent work with professor randall heron found that between january 1 1996 and december 1 2005 29 of 7774 companies engaged in timing manipulation primarily backdating in granting stock options to top executives other studies examined the role of outside directors and the effect of the options backdating

appear to have profited handsomely from undisclosed backdating although they may ultimately be faced with number of costs related to such actions 23 however there is clear evidence of backdatings

to its option recipients understating companys expenses and overstating net profits when options are exercised companies always receive less than what the shares are worth on the open market backdating increases this cost g5g152g156g157g156g561g143g155g152g150g561g7g138g155g151g146g151g144g156g561g10g146g157g156g561 firms where backdating is detected may have to adjust to the accounting shortfall by downward restatements of previous earnings disclosures public announcement that restatement may be forthcoming usually has strong negative effect on share prices as mentioned in the introduction an empirical study concluded that the options backdating scandal had reduced the value of the stock of 110 corporations by at least 100 billion 24

price backdating can reduce some of stock options performance incentive effects on executives backdating the grant date of the options reduces the exercise price below the market price on the day of the award and gives an executive an immediate windfall this means that over certain share price range there is linkage between an executives potential gain from an option awar d and the performance of the underlying stock 23 corporate executives involved in undisclosed backdating of their stock options may lose their jobs may have to pay substantial penalties for violating tax and securities laws and also risk incarceration in addition these executives must bear high costs of litigation the executives who have engaged in undisclosed backdating have violated secs disclosure rules accounting

significant amount of their time is diverted to proberelated matters taking them away from more conventional corporate concerns in more extreme circumstances some corporate executives have been fired

shareholders risk additional losses if the stock is delisted exchange bylaws call for the delisting of companies that fail to release required quarterly or annual financial disclosures on time but due to internal option probes it has been reported that nearly 50 firms with market capitalizations of 75 million or more had postponed their quarterly filings for the second quarter of 2006 by october of that year it was reported that 54 firms had been told that they faced potential delistings for such delays several companies have had their stock delisted by nasdaq for failing to publish audited financial reports on time due to problems with backdating of options delisting is usually followed by sharp drop in associated share price and delisted firms tend to face increased borrowing costs if they migrate to another trading venue it is generally more marginal entity like the otc bulletin board or the pink sheets markets generally associated with low and volatile stock prices and high

financial losses due to bondholders demanding payments for breached indentures corporate bonds normally contain an indenture detailed contract between the issuer and the debt holders that requires the firm to file quarterly and annual reports with those holders at or around the same time it files with the sec this means that late filers including many of the firms undergoing backdating probes may be in technical default of their indentures historically however the convention has generally been that in such cases debt holders give the issuers adequate time to work things out but there are reports that some bondholders including hedge funds have targeted number of firms with delayed filings due to backdating concerns and are either demanding immediate payment of the value of the debt or requiring the borrowers to pay substantial fees for example in the summer of 2006 amkor technology came close to missing the deadline for paying bondholders who had demanded repayment of more than 15 billion in debt and during the same summer the sanminasci corporation asked its bondholders for an extension on the terms of its indenture offering them financial concessions of 125 million

because the pay to their top five executives is not eligible for the same tax deductions that performancebased options are if the options they receive do not depend on performance measure like an appreciation in the stock price after the option grant backdated options confer 25 while new york stock exchange nyse bylaws mandate delisting when annual reports are not provided on time the nasdaq where the vast majority of firms with backdating concerns are listed can delist when there is late quarterly report delisting also results in fiscal pain to the exchange since it is forced to forego the listing fees that th firms pay them in 2006 companies listed on the nasdaq paid an annual fee of 75000 if they had total shares outstanding of over 150 million in 2007 this fee was raised to 95000

backdatingbased shareholder suits that allege either breach of fiduciary duty or violation of antifraud provisions of the us securities exchange act of 1934 the suits consume corporate resources in

options had been backdated28 some of these employees with gains on their incentive stock options iso may have paid only capital gains taxes rather than regular income tax on the rise in value due to backdating now these employees may owe the difference between the higher regular income tax and the capital gains tax plus interest 29 furthermore these employees may owe additional payroll taxes because backdating cancels an exemption from isos from payroll taxes if an employees stock options vested after december 2004 thensection 409a of the tax code applies and tax is due when options vest rather than when they were exercised thus these employees may also be liable for 20 penalty and interest 30 g4g152g151g141g145g152g149g141g142g155g156g561 number of firms that have grappled with

backdated stock options underpay their taxes then taxpayers in general lose in order to raise given amount of revenue these other taxpayers must pay higher taxes some corporate executives have not reported the backdated basis price and thus understated the realized gain on the sale of stock and underpaid their income tax some corporations involved in backdating have claimed deductions for executive remuneration above the 1 million limit that was not performance related for qualified options if some employees are able to illegally obtain additional compensation from backdating in the form of longterm capital gains then tax revenue is lost because the marginal tax rate on longterm capital gains is below that on regular income also taxpayers must cover the cost of litigation in

american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 included new statutory requirements under code section 409a concerning deferred compensation that is the delay of the receipt of compensation and taxes on compensation to future tax year this section was included in response to perceived abuses by executive employees in the recent wave of corporate scandals 31 this section applies to amounts deferred in tax years that begin after december 31 2004 and includes stock appreciation rights if the exercise price is less than the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date the stock appreciation rights are granted32 section 409a generally provides that amounts deferred under nonqualified deferred compensation plan for all taxable years are currently includible in gross income to the extent not subject to substantial risk of forfeiture and not previously included in gross income unless certain requirements are met 33 thus stock options subject to 409 were included in income when they vested rather than when they were exercised consequently code section 409a reduced the tax advantage of stock options and presumably reduced the use of stock options

into the option grant award process and should essentially eliminate easy opportunities to get away with secretive options grants40 agency officials and other observers have also indicated that largely due to the ghtened option award window required by sox the opportunity for corporate officials to retroactively date option awards appears to have been all but eliminated41 but several recent academic studies suggest that this sanguine view may be overstated and perhaps somewhat premature the research found that although the incidence of backdating appears to have been greatly reduced

other things corporate boards particularly their nonmanagerial members known as outside directors are responsible for upholding shareholders interests visavis potentially self serving executive behavior this view is reflected in number of statutory and regulatory rules including requirements that only outside directors serve on board audit and compensation committees corporate board generally possesses the ultimate authority for determining and overseeing the compensation of its key executives majority of the board may however broadly delegate that authority to board committees typically such authority is delegated to the compensation committee which is responsible for 1 recommending compensation programs and pay levels for the ceo and other top executives 2 approving employment agreements and other contracts with such executives and 3 administering equitybased and other longterm incentive compensation plans including option grants when compensation committee recommends optionbased compensation for company executives the firms board then adopts stock option plan describing the basic terms of the plan option plans typically say that the options will have

awards to specific individuals tends generally rests with compensation committees corporate boards are thus integral to the option grant award process and the centrality of this rolecombined with the fact that historically ceos have had significant influence in the selection of board membershas raised concerns over director complicity and oversight in the backdating scandals46 an examination of articles on various firms embroiled in options backdating reveals wide spectrum of potential board involvement and noninvolvement in improprieties involving backdating for example there have been reports of board members 1 being duped by firm executives who manipulated the option grant dates 2 giving executives blanket approval in the choice of their own option grant dates and 3 bein g very much out of the loop with respect to the nuts and bolts responsibilities over options issuance which could raise issues over the effectiveness of the boards oversight an exhaustive study of option grant awards to the outside directors of publicly traded firms between 1996 and 2005 found that substantial number of directors have benefitted from suspiciously timed option grant awards raising co ncerns over director involvement in backdating abuse the study by group that included lucien bebchuk director of the harvard law school program on corporate governance examined 29000 option grants given to 1400 outside directors and found that 9 or approximately 800 were granted on the day of the lowest monthly share price the likelihood of such rge percentage of grants occurring on monthly lows was so statistically improbable that the authors concluded that these lucky grants were evidence of deliberate and opportunistic timing 47 the authors conclusion that the timing was generally deliberate in nature appears to have been buttressed by the finding that grant events were more likely to be lucky during months in which the difference between the median price and the lowest price was the greatest the research also found that when the award dates for directors gr ants coincided with those for the executives especially the ceo the director grants were more likely to be lucky the study did not address key questions surrounding the backdating abuse such as who was responsible who knew what and the mindset of the parties involved still such findings raise fundamental concerns over the effectiveness of many outside directors as shareholder guardians visavis potentially selfdealing executives the research also raises important corollary concerns about the adequacy of corporate governance structures and protocol for example the director grant study also finds that firms lacking majority of outside directors were more likely to award lucky grants to their board members 48 in another study the same authors examined executive option grant awards issued by several thousand firms between 1996 and 2006 and found that lucky ceo grants were more apt to occur when

roles that outside auditors may have played in the corporate backdating misconduct for example one notion is that outside auditors should not have been expected to question the veracity of firm documents showing particular option grant dates but more critical perspective is that the auditors may have regarded options based accounting reporting as lowrisk concern approaching these concerns in cursory and superficial way at best and taking companies reporting at face value and expending little effort to confirm the documents veracity at worst 54 at this stage in the probes outside accountants have been implicated for their roles in corporate backdating all the big four accoun ting firms kpmg llp pricewaterhousecoopers llp deloitte touche llp and ernst young llp have corporate clients who have been implicated for backdating misconduct but none of the auditors appears to have found any misconduct although according to allegations of one firm that is suing deloitte the accounting firm gave its approval to form of backdating 55 research conducted by eric lie and randall heron found that among large and small accounting firms pricewaterhousecoopers and kpmg were ssociated with lower percentage of stock option manipulation56 it also found little evidence that accounting firms actually promoted backdating to their audit clients as some have alleged the study also concluded that smaller auditors in contrast to larger ones were associated with larger proportion of option grant award disclosures that were tardily filed as well as unscheduled option grant awards 57 which are more apt to lead to backdating the possibility that outside auditors may have been negligently complicit in the instances of abusive backdating has led to several actions in the summer of 2006 the public company accounting oversight board58 pcaob issued an unprecedented audit practice alert telling auditors that they must carefully scrutinize their clients stock option practices about the same time the sec accounting office asked accounting firms to identify errors by their public company clients that may have contributed to backdating an initiative that would help the agency conduct its ongoing investigation of the matter one of the broad objectives of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 was to help ensure that corporate audits are performed in an independent manner devoid of selfserving corporate bias to date the preponderance of the backdating being probed appears to have taken place before the enactment of the act while many feel that the acts expedited option grant award reporting provision has virtually eliminated current backdating abuse others are less convinced and to the extent that this view proves credible questions could be rais ed anew about the extent to which the act has led to greater auditing accountability in areas such as this 54 some observers claim that some accounting firms have admitted that historically they have tended to take

firm records and other documents from the firm to determine whether actual and reported exercise dates are consistent61 at this early juncture in backdating probes it is uncertain how widespread the abuse has been some predict that relatively small number of firms will be sanctioned but others are less sanguine about the pervasiveness of the abuse citing the mounting number of firms that have discovered possible backdating irregularities and lies finding that from 1996 and 2002 29 of the sampled firms appear to have backdated or otherwise manipulated their option grants and referencing what they perceive as problematic declines in sec resources devoted to enforcement they question the secs and the dojs ability to both adequately and comprehensively undertake the probes 62 assuming that many firms are found to have enga ged in backdating some predict that the sec and the doj may ultimately wind up pursuing manageable number of deterrenceoriented enforcementsand ultimately institute what some call voluntary compliance protocol for example john coffee jr law professor at columbia university and director of its center on corporate governance speculates that after some deterrent prosecutions are brought i think youll have to see the sec and doj come up with voluntary compliance schemes under which companies can conduct an investigation publish report make

represents the lowest number since 2001 and nearly 9 decrease from fy2005 sec officials largely attributed this to reversible shortterm budgetary and human resource shortfalls some observers also note that the 128 agency enforcement actions involving financial disclosure and reporting declined by nearly 31 from fy2005 and are at their lowest point since 2001 which suggests that sox has helped

provided much greater opportunities for backdating along with other factors like the end of the bull market that began in the 1990s soxs tightened reporting requirements appear to have helped reduce backdatings incidence giving some sec officials sense that the abuse is largely thing of the past however when grant award disclosures are filed late greater opportunity exists for the retroactive falsification of grant dates and in the postsox era there is research that indicates the ongoing presence of nontrivial level of late filings for example after examining several thousand filings one study found that despite an sec website that should have simplified the filing process 13 of the insider option grant award filings in 2005 were tardy 64 this finding led the studys authors who include erik lie the author of the backdating study that helped alert the sec to the existence of the backdating abuse to question whether the late filings reflect the existence of continued and widespread backdating research by the proxy advisory firm glass lewis company the backdating scandal s second act involved combing through hundreds of thousands of executive grant award disclosures between january 2004 to june 2006 in the end the study found some 6000 questionably timed stockoptions grants to executives that had been tardily filed 65 reflecting on the potential ramifications of their research analysts at glass lewis observed that although they could not definitively ascertain the persistence of backdating from the study they noted that given the sheer number of delinquent filings the supposed method of regulation that was going to close the door on backdating remains ajar 66 additionally the analysts said the study raised the prospect that hundreds of firms may have either knowingly or accidentally backdated awards after the 2002 changes67 since august 2002 the sec has pursued enforcement actions against six delinquent filers usually as part of larger investigations68 noting that the lateness of the filings creates greater opportunity for option grant abuse glass lewis researchers described the agencys enforcement as far too lax and thus lacking in

compared to scheduled option grant awards unscheduled grant awards give executives greater opportunity to take advantage of market vagaries or to time awards around the release of positive or negative

some observers have proposed banning the use of equitybased compensation for corporate lawyers and directors they argue that compared to conventional fixed compensation equity based pay is more apt to undermine the officials roles as gatekeepersprotectors against executive misconduct like backdating it would be unprecedented for regulator like the sec or an exchange in its capacity as an sro to place limits on certain kinds of corporate pay but employing similar arguments against compensating directors with equitybased pay number of firms are voluntarily deciding not to do so for example in october 2006 campbell soup announced that starting in 2007 it would stop issuing stock options as part of its directors compensation and in december 2006 ibm announced that beginning in 2007 as part of companywide effort to reduce the reliance on the grants it would stop granting stock options to its outside directors arguments against placing proscriptions on equitybased pay would however include the following 1 there is little empirical evidence linking such the provision of such equitybased pay to improprieties on the part of corporate executives and 2 there is research that has found positive correlation between paying directors with stock options and certain measures of corporate financial performance 80

in july 2003 the sec proposed rule that under certain conditions would have allowed public company shareholders with more than 5 of companys voting securities to have their nominees for board membership included in companys proxy materials 81 this would enable large investors to formally nominate candidates for the boarda change from the current regime under which board members are almost always nominated by firm executives response to widespread concerns over the accountability of corporate directors after number of corporate scandals the proposal received the support of various observers including some institutional investors who argued that the integrity of corporate boards would be enhanced by an expanded shareholder role in the director nomination process similarly it could be argued that such reform could result in boards being populated with greater number of outside directors who are less beholden to management and better able to provide independent oversight and scrutiny of executive compensation practices and excesses including backdating it also could be argued that the research described earlierthat found that large numbers of outside large directors appear to 79 for example see john c coffee jr the dating game the national law journal online sept 4 2006 80 for example see eliezer m fich and anil shivdasani the impact of stockoption compensation

previously indicated in 1993 obra added section 162m to the internal revenue code which limited companys tax deduction on what it pays each of its top executives to 1 million but exempted performancebased pay like stock options in conjunction with other developments like the bull market of the 1990s and the pressure on firms to provide executive pay that better aligned executives incentives with the interests of firm investors obra is widely believed to have been factor in the rise in the use of stock options some have argued that rescinding obra or limiting the kinds of exempt performancebased pay could help stem the use of stock options thus limiting the supply of potentially backdatable stock options 84 this kind of reform could however be criticized for being an exceptionally blunt approach that is only weakly connected to the basic machinery of backdating raising questions about its ability to help stem the abuse moreover comprehensive look at obras impact on ceo pay found that given the minimal impact that tax deductibility of executive compensation tends to have on firm profitability the actual role that obra has played on the configuration of ceo pay

backdating three other types of timing manipulation should be noted86 first springloading and bulletdodging concern the timing of option grants to coincide with public announcements by the issuing company87 springloading occurs when stock options are issued in advance of positive public announcement by the issuing company which is expected to drive up the market value of the stock because the recipients of the stock options knew that the public announcement would be positive but other investor s did not the recipients of the stock options received windfall gain bulletdodging is the reverse of springloading stock options are issued shortly after negative public announcement by the company investors are surprised by the negative announcement may overreact and may temporarily reduce the market value of the stock at which point the stock options are issued subsequently if the price recovers recipients of these stock options will have received fa vorable exercise price springloading and bullet dodging can also be applied to the timing of option repricing when companys stock price falls significantly below the exercise price of its stock options some companies reprice the options exercise price the justification for repricing stock options is to restore their incentive effect second the timing of corporate announcements can be manipulated in relation to known dates for the granting of options for example high tech firm could delay the announcement of technological breakthrough until after the date of the granting of stock options third some executives have changed the exercise date without disclosure in order to reduce their tax liability 88 by backdating the exercise date on their stock options to when the stock price was lower executives can convert regular income into capital gains which are taxed at much lower marginal tax rate89 in some cases more than one form of timing manipulation may occur and it may be difficult to empirically separate the relative magnitude of these different forms of manipulation continued review vol 90 2 may 2000 pp 197202 86 whether or not the first two forms of timing manipulatio n are illegal has not been

stock options and employee stock purchase plans both types require that the recipient be an employee of the company or its parent or subsidiary from the time the option is granted until at least three months before the option is exercised the option may cover stock in the company or its parent or subsidiary both types of qualified stock options receive some tax benefit under current law the employee recognizes income for regular tax purposes when the options are granted or when they are exercised taxes under the regular tax are not imposed until the stock purchased by the employee is sold if the stock is sold after it has been held for at least two years from the date the option was granted and one year from the date it was exercised the difference between the market price of the stock when the option was exercised and the price for which it was sold is taxed at longterm capital gains rates if the option price was less than 100 of the fair market value of the stock when it was granted the difference between the exercise price and the market price the discount is taxed as ordinary income when the stock is sold companies generally receive deduction for qualified stock options so the tax advantage accrues to the employee not the employer companies that would not be taxable anyway such as startup companies not yet profitable would care little if at all about the tax deduction and would be expected to use this method of compensation many companies that are taxable grant qualified stock options however so these options must have some advantage that outweighs the tax cost in some cases the companies doubt find that rewarding their employees with qualified stock options is worth the cost in other cases perhaps the officers and employees who receive the options exercise special influence over the companies compensation policies if the stock is not held for the required two years from the granting of the option and one year from its exercise special rules apply the employee is taxed at ordinary income tax rates instead of capital gains rates on the difference between the price paid for the stock and its market value either when the option was exercised or when the stock was sold whichever is less the company is then allowed deduction just as if the employees taxable gain were ordinary compensation paid in the year the stock is sold imposing the alternative minimum tax on incentive stock options reduces their tax advantage for persons paying the amt the tax treatment is similar to the regular tax treatment of nonqualified options 90 in some cases individuals have incurred significant tax liability from exercising their incentive stock options but had not sold their stock before the price dramatically declined the alternative minimum tax in combination with other rules could cause large tax liability that could not be offset with an offsetting loss when the stock price fell 91 on december 20 2006 this unfair situation was solved by passage of the tax relief act and health care act of 2006 hr 6408 in section 402 90 for description of the alternative minimum tax see crs report rl30149 the alternative minimum tax for individuals by

into academic studies and wall street journal wsj articles the academic work provided the statistical verification of the hypothesis of backdating initially the academic work did not specific any particular corporations involved in backdating articles in the wall street journal named specific corporations that had backdated their stock options furthermore these wsj articles provided widespread publicity for the backdating issue to both the business community and the general public g3g140g138g141g142g150g146g140g561g21g157g158g141g146g142g156g561 g7g155g146g148g561g14g146g142g561 professor erik lie currently on the faculty of th university of iowa initially formulated the hypothesis that some companies without disclosure backdated dates for grants of options to times when prices of their stock were low92 dr lie wrote an article titled on the timing of ceo stock options awards which included an empirical analysis supporting his backdating hypothesis and sent copy of this article to the sec in 200493 in may 2005 his article was published in management science 94 dr lie indicates that the board of directors of company generally assigns the administration of the stock option grants of the stock option plan to the compensation committee95 executives however may be able to influence the decisions of the committee because executives often propose parameters of stock option grants executives often have close personal friendships with some committee members and executives may influence the timing of compensation committee meetings96 using sample of almost 6000 stock option grants to chief executive officers ceos between 1981 and 1992 he conducted several statistical analyses and concluded that the abnormal stock returns are negative before the award dates and positive afterward 97 these findings were consistent with his hypothesis of backdating of stock options without disclosure the publication of dr lies article led to sec investigations of the timing of the granting of stock options by certain companies g10g142g155g152g151g561g138g151g141g561g14g146g142g561g507g138g155g157g146g140g149g142g508g561 in their forthcoming article in the journal of

change executives receiving stock options had up to 45 days after the end of the companys fiscal year to report them to the sec100 after august 29 2002 recipients of stock options must report them to the sec within two business days of receiving the grant one day af ter receiving this information the sec makes it public and now firms with corporate websites are required to post this information on the day after they disclose it to the sec the authors stated that if backdating produced the abnormal return patterns around executive option grants we hypothesize that the new reporting requirements should substantially dampen the abnormal return patterns that previously had been intensifying over time 101 heron and lie utilized large sample of stoc k option grants to ceos between august 29 2002 and november 30 2004 and compared this sample with large sample from january 1 2000 to august 28 2002 the authors concluded that overall we find evidence suggesting that backdating is the major source of the abnormal stock return patterns around executive stock option grants our evidence further suggests that the new reporting requirements have greatly curbed backdating but have not eliminated it to eliminate backdating it appears that the requi rements need to be tightened further such that grants have to be reported on the grant day or at the latest on the day thereafter in addition the sec naturally has to enforce the requirements 102 thus the authors found that while the undisclosed backdating of stock options still occurs it was far more prevalent before new reporting regulations took effect on august 29 2002 g10g142g155g152g151g561g138g151g141g561g14g146g142g561g507g160g152g155g148g146g151g144g561g153g138g153g142g155g508g561 on july 14 2006 professor randall heron and professor

consisted of ceos presidents and chairmen of the board the authors estimated that before august 29 2002 when the new twoday filing took effect 230 of unscheduled at the money stock option grants were backdated 104 but from august 29 2002 through december 1 2005 only an estimated 100 of this type of stock option grants were backdated105 the authors estimated that 292 of the 7774 companies engaged

do managers influence their pay evidence from stock price reversals around executive option grants107 the authors tested their hypothesis that managers influence the grant date stock price for their stock options they used data base of 605106 option grant filings by insiders between 1992 and 2002 the authors found that the abnormal stock return reversals on the grant date were consistent with the influence hypothesis they found that the marketadjusted return for the 90 days preceding the grant date is about36 and the return for the 90 days following the grant date is about 94 108 the authors concluded that the much smaller absolute value of the return before the grant date than after the grant date suggested that the firms were engaged in behavior that went beyond controlling the timing of the grants and the timing of corporate information disclosures109 the authors also advanced the hypothesis that grant dates are set on backdate basis that is in many cases the lowest stock price during window is picked as the grant date expost110 they found statistical evidence that was consistent with their backdating hypothesis111

titled the economic impact of backdating of executive stock options in the michigan law review 112 they discuss four consequences of misdating that can adversely impact shareholder value 1 legal issues there are legal consequences arising from backdating or forwarddating without complete disclosure in addition the ethical issues raised might have economic consequences as they undermine the investors confidence in the top executives 2 tax issues the tax treatment of inthemoney options with implications for both the company and its executives 3 corporate disclosure issues disclosure of misdating practices can lead to restatement of earnings as the camouflage d pay is recognized as compensation expense the reduced earnings can result in downward reassessment of shareholder value and 4 incentive issues misdating amounts to stealth compensation if this is done because executives have captured the compensation process then the managers are being inefficiently compensated resulting in incorrect incentives 113 the authors computed that the upper bound of the average benefit from potential backdating was 3 million for executives based on sample of 39864 option grants from 43 firms listed on wall street journal website114 in comparison these firms experienced an average loss of 510 107 mp narayanan and h nejat seyhun do managers influence their pay evidence from stock price

grinstein and urs peyer examined what they called lucky grants which they defined at stock option grants given at the lowest price of the stock during the month 116 they found that during the period 19962005 about 1150 lucky grants to 850 ceos about 10 of all ceos and provided by about 720 firms about 12 of all firms involved opportunistic timing primarily backdating 117 the percentage of lucky grants declined from 15 before sox to 8 after sox118 the authors identified links between the manipulation of the timing of granting stock options and business governance the authors state that lucky grants are more likely to occur when the firm lacks majority of independent directors and when the ceo has longer tenure both factors associated with greater ceo influence on the companys paysetting and governance processes relatedly we the authors find that ceos receiving lucky grants also receive total compensation from other sources that is higher relative to peer firms thus finding evidence that extra gains from grant timing manipulation was used by firms as substitute for other compensation forms119 the authors also found links between the manipulation of the timing of stock options and the potential gains from this manipulation not only is manipulation more common in firms with higher stock price volatility but it is also more likely to occur for given ceo and firm in months in which the potential gain from it is higher relative to other times our analysis also highlights the existence of serial luck luck is persistent with ceos more likely being lucky in their next grant when their prior grant was lucky 120 finally the authors concluded that by providing estimates of the substantial incidence of lucky grants firms and ceos in old economy firms their analysis dispels the impression that grant manipulation is concentrated in new economy firms121

before sox and 254 after sox124 an estimated 1389 directors or 46 of all directors received one or more opportunistically timed grants125 several statistical tests were consistent with the hypothesis that backdating played significant role in opportunistic timing grants of options that benefitted directors 126 the authors acknowledge that their methodology does not measure timing manipulation of

options135 he formulated the hypothesis that some ceos arranged for the award of the stock option to occur shortly before public announcements of positive information about their companies this concept was later called springloading in order to test his hypothesis he used sample of 620 stock option awards to ceos of fortune 500 companies between 1992 and 1994 at 1 level of significance he found that the average abnormal increase in option award value was 30000 after 20 trading days and 48900 after 50 trading days 136

professors keith w chauvin and catherine shenoy analyzed abnormal stock price decreases prior to executive stock option grants137 they developed the hypothesis that executives cause bad news to be released prior to the time that options are granted in order to set the strike price of the options at lower level this negative information could be in the form of formal public announcement or else insiders can put more negative spin on information than otherwise speak off the record to analysts or strategically use rumor and innuendo to leak information the authors statistically analyzed sample of 783 stock option grants from may 1991 to february 1994 issued to 209 ceos and found significant stock price decrease prior to executive stock option grants 138

professors sandra renfro callaghan p jane saly and chandra subramaniam investigated the hypothesis that executive stock option repricings were systematically timed to coincide with favorable movements in the companys stock price142 if the exercise price of the stock options falls well below the market price of the stock some executives maintain that the stock options should be repriced in order to retain valued employees and to restore incentives143 the authors used sample of 236 repricing of options for 166 companies from the period 1992 through 1997144 their statistical analysis suggested that managers opportunistically timed repricings in conjunction with the release of corporate news145 executives who anticipated favorable earnings reports repriced their option prior to the public announcement of the report conversely executives who anticipated negative earnings reports repriced their options after the public release of earnings
