6312c05 shspec327 basic auditing some of the data in this tape is also to be found in hcob 26nov63 all levels star rating new triangle basic auditing technique case analysis the problems of auditing are divided into three categories 1 basic auditing 2 technique 3 case analysis technique means the exact patter and procedure for getting something audited on the pc we have dug up lots of old processes all of them are still valid except mockup processes processes like spot three spots in your bodyin the room run long enough tend to exteriorize people another exteriorization process is where arent you these processes are ok if they are not run to exteriorization exteriorizing someone tends to result in his coming back into his body more solidly because he becomes alarmed he is unstable this occurs at higher levels eg levels v or vi the pc tends to come back in and hold harder actually what upsets him is the energy masses that he is going through which exert certain emotional responses upon him the liability of these old lowerlevel processes is that they run the pc into gpms and can pull ris out of line eg the liability of tell something you wouldnt mind forgetting is that you could run into the ri forgetting but such an occurrence is very rare people coming up through level iii are in the charge of the top ris but they are getting destimulated as they get more oriented and wiser in their environments just remember when running repetitive process that there is some danger of restimulating an ri especially if the process has fancy or oddball wording you even run this risk at level i when you ask what solutions have you had to that since the track is just series of solutions what saves your bacon is the pcs lack of reality on other lifetimes starting at level iii you would be wise to preface processes with in this lifetime do this for sure at level iv since the pcs awareness has come up and he will slip back on the track pretty easily your main problem will be the manic at level i who insists on running only past track this came up in elizabeth nj with the first foundation when couple of coauditors could only find pastlife engrams to run on each other joe winter parker morgan and john campbell tried to pass motion to make research on or mention of past lives offlimits because it had bad public presence they found out then that lrh could get mad public presence has nothing to do with the truth there is such thing as acceptable truth that is really just lie there is room in pr or public image for truth pr is nice but dont build on it build on truth with most pcs any attempt to go backtrack before their ptps are handled will produce nothing but disaster you are asking them to confront big new datum when they cant even confront their environment most processing failures come from the attempt to process someone higher then his class the classifications are laid out on gradient scale of increasing responsibility for self and the dynamics the processes laid out in any given class form gradient scale too plotted against increasing responsibility so it starts with motivators and ends with overts all this is still techniques the programming of techniques is based on case analysis every level has its own case analysis the three basic steps of case analysis are 1 find out what the pc is sitting in 2 get the pc to tell you about it fully get any lies off 3 handle it by locating and indicating charge as accurately as possible that is the pattern that you would use at any level this delivers the whole world of healing to us it was research target set last january and it has been met at level i this could consist of getting the person to talk about some illness that they have had at levels ii and iii you would find what incident the person was sitting in in dianetics this was done with an ageflash at level vi it is done with all the tech of case analysis asking if it is an actual gpm an implant gpm etc at level 0 it is how do you feel today what have you done about it do you feel better as pc runs actual gpms the subitsa and the pcs ability to itsa come closer and closer together on case analysis they fold over about half way to ot where the pcs ability to itsa surpasses the meter if the pc doesnt say itsa the meter wont read the meter depends on mass and shortcircuits in the mass you will eventually reach point where the person is selfdetermined enough that unless they think it it isnt so somewhere along the line you will also run into their recognition that they are creating all the mass what you will do there hasnt been worked out you will have to get across it and back to the beginning and the earliest postulates with regard to the making of mass and the creation of all this type of bank see pp 337339 above it is rough go unless your basic auditing is superb your basic auditing at levels ii and iii has to be magnificent because the pc doesnt know what you are talking about he has nomenclature he has reality on it he cant put these things together smoothly the whole burden therefore is on basic auditing on handling the pcs itsa improving the pcs itsa never give the itsa to the pc on the meter when he can give it to you dont refuse to check the meter if he asks but wean him off it the only things that vary in basic auditing are the addition of more complicated metering as you go up the levels note that at levels v and vi you never use sensitivity higher than 8 other wise the needle is too loose improving ones basic auditing is the way to improve the amount of ta that one gets given particular technique used dirty needles come solely from out basic auditing see hcob 25nov63 dirty needles on level vi the ta moves around so much that you cant wait until the ta stops to say something you have to talk when it slows down the pc will get heat during bds which will be suppressed if you talk so that you will have to get the suppress off the heat to get it to turn on again if there is nothing going on it is up to the auditor to start something if there is something going on with the pc then there is need for the auditor to start something at the upper levels basic auditing had better be as free from attention as walking this sounds obvious but it is horribly true youve got plenty to do with the meter you dont have time to record ta except when you give the question and when the ta blows down when the pc gives the item apart from that you need ta counter to keep record of it just dont move the ta while the pc is moving around or you will get falsely high count youve got to stop the needle at set with your thumb in order not to cut the pcs itsa while centering the needle you will put in comm lag if you delay while centering it and the pcs attention will go to the meter there are numerous tricks that you can do with meters for instance you can brake the needle to stop it from wobbling know the needle well enough to be able to spot missed withhold without asking for it or to repair havingness without having to run any by getting the pc to spot what upset his havingness etc you can know ta behavior well enough to spot trouble before it arrives so that you are not startled when the pc erupts at level vi technique is an alldevouring monster you can spare attention for the meter or for basic auditing aspects such as the comm cycle there is zenith on how good your basic auditing can get you could probably make some mistakes with techniques and case analysis not many but you cant afford to make any mistakes with basic auditing especially if you do make mistake in another area nothing very serious will happen to pc because of technique or case analysis errors especially below level vi but basic auditing errors will pitch the pc on his head the only serious things that can happen to pc occur because of out basic auditing pcs feel badly when basic auditing is out invalidation is the only way to turn on somatics at level vi ot processes are as rough as there is invalidation it isnt that items turn on pain it is that if you invalidate right item or goal the pc can get good and sick this makes the steps of case analysis mandatory but if your basic auditing is in such that the pcs itsa is in you are less likely to make these mistakes because the pcs opinion and knowingness are consulted the greatest dividend you can get from training is improvement of your basic auditing to point where you can relax and get technique and case analysis to hum get it perfected and your tone arm motion will triple
