congress since the founding of the federal government in 1789 36 of 43 presidents have exercised their veto authority total of 2562 times congress has overridden these vetoes on 110 occasions 43 presidents have vetoed 82 appropriations bills and congress has overridden 12 146 of these vetoes order code rs22188 updated july 18 2008 regular vetoes and pocket vetoes an overview kevin r kosar analyst in american national government government and finance division summary the veto power vested in the president by article i section 7 of the constitution httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22188 has proven to be an effective tool for the chief executive in his dealings with congress since the founding of the federal government in 1789 36 of 43 presidents have exercised their veto authority total of 2562 times congress has overridden these vetoes on 110 occasions 43 presidents have vetoed 82 appropriations bills and congress has overridden 12 146 of these vetoes this report will be updated as events warrant constitutional basis and importance the us constitution article i section 7 provides that for bill to become law it must be approved by both houses of congress and presented to the president for his approval and signature1 the president may sign bill into law within the 10day period excluding sundays provided in the constitution2 let it become law without his signature or veto it the constitution states that when the president vetoes bill he shall return it with his objections to that house in which it shall have originated this type of action is called regular or return veto if on the other hand congress has adjourned within the 10day period after presentation of the bill to the president thereby preventing the return of the bill to congress the president may simply withhold his signature and the bill does not become law practice that has been dubbed pocket veto3 the presidents veto authority is among his most significant tools in legislative dealings with congress illustrative of this point is the fact that presidents have vetoed 1 pamela hairston crs information research specialist provided assistance in updating the veto statistics in this report 2 us constitution art i sec 7 3 beginning in 1929 several judicial decisions have attempted to clarify when an adjournment by congress prevents the president from returning veto for information on these cases see crs report rl30909 the pocket veto its current status by louis fisher crs2 2562 bills since 1789 of these congress has overridden 110 43 moreover the veto also can be effective as threat sometimes forcing congress to modify legislation before presenting it to the president this report presents information on how congress can override regular vetoes the number of vetoes by each president and the use of vetoes in relation to appropriations bills the report does not address two other types of vetoes lineitem vetoes since the president has such power at present and legislative vetoes which are wielded by congress not the president4 it also does not address presidential signing statements5 overriding veto if bill is pocket vetoed while congress is out of session the only way for congress to override the veto is to reintroduce the legislation as new bill pass it through both houses and present it to the president again for his signature on the other hand congress may override regular veto without introducing new legislation httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22188 according to article 1 section 7 of the constitution when the president chooses not to sign bill and instead returns it to the chamber that originated it the chamber enters the message of the president detailing the reasons for the veto into its journal and then proceeds to reconsider the bill because the constitution does not state exactly how congress should reconsider vetoed bill house and senate procedures govern the specific treatment of bills returned by the president6 passage by twothirds margin in both houses is required to override veto before the end of the congress in which the veto is received7 if twothirds vote is successful in the originating house that house informs the other of its decision to override the veto by message neither house is under any constitutional legal or procedural obligation to schedule an override vote it is not unusual for congress to make effort to override the veto if congressional leaders do not believe they have sufficient votes 4 on these types of vetoes see crs report rl33635 item veto and expanded impoundment proposals history and current status by

rs22654 veto override procedure in the house and senate by elizabeth rybicki 7 although the constitution states that approval requires two thirds of that house congressional procedure tradition and judicial rulings have interpreted this requirement to mean twothirds of those members present and voting provided there is quorum present crs3 vetoes exercised and overridden pocket vetoes and returned vetoes table 1 shows that since the beginning of the federal government in 1789 36 of 438 presidents have exercised their veto authority on total of 2562 occasions of that number 1496 584 were regular vetoes that is the rejected legislation was returned to the congressional house of origin while it was in session with presidential message of explanation and 1066 416 were pocket vetoes or rejected while congress was adjourned9 congress has overridden 110 74 of the 1496 regular vetoes this percentage though is skewed downward by the enormous number of vetoes in administrations prior to the 87th congress which began in 196110 if one counts only the normal vetoes since 1961 the beginning of the kennedy administration one finds 231 vetoes and 37 overridden 16 george w bush was the first president since john quincy adams 18251829 to serve full term without wielding his veto president since thomas jefferson 1801 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22188 1809 has served two terms without

enacted into law because the president had not returned the legislation these two disputed vetoes are not included in table 1 president george w bush characterized his veto of hr 1585 as pocket veto since the 110th congress treated it as normal veto this report counts hr 1585 as normal veto 10 most of those vetoes prior to 1960 were of private bills ie legislation that would confer benefits upon single person or company and were almost never overridden in 1971 congress gave administrators more discretion to handle the claims of individuals thus the need for congressionally passed private bills has dropped dramatically from hundreds per annum to few dozen and therefore the opportunities for vetoes on private bills see crs report 98 628 private bills procedure in the house by richard s

furlough of federal employees and the interruption of federal programs and services11 despite these high stakes presidents have vetoed 82 appropriations bills since 1789 more than half of these vetoes have occurred since 196812 for example presidents carter reagan george h w bush and clinton were presented with total of 387 annual appropriations acts and vetoed 30 of them 7813 president george w
