handling the pts lecture given on 8 june 1965 thank you well sir this is the 8th of june yes the 8th of june ad 15 saint hill special briefing course i am speaking to you today in the voice of somebody who knows weve got it made i am actually working very very hard now on your final plot of the r6 gpms and i am doing the suffering so you wont have to because you never would have got it straight thats the end of that so im running them down and fortunately didnt release any of the materials before i did run it down and this new run youve got r6ew it works beautifully you need lot of it before you need any gpms anyhow when you finally run into the gpms why you will find that they are all there all plotted very neatly and all correct its like playing tag with tiger and thei found out accidentally that i had run three out of the middle of the bank and three of them incorrectly in addition to that out of the middle of the bank some 680 gpms below where i was supposed to be turned on marvelous case of bursitis and didnt call the doctor simply straightened out the gpms but this is the sort of thing that you can run into because you see its so hotly charged that everything reads so im doing the run on down the bank and although you have lot of people amongst you who have just gone release and so forth and theyre walking around bragging and shining and doing all sorts of things like that i dont know whether ill speak to them or not actually because ive got the first six gpms of the track run out absolutely correctly go on now give all these new releases applause too thats very funny phenomenon somebody whos had successful run on release and so oni wouldnt do this lightlybut walk up to him and infer scientology doesnt work i think youve got to get sohed probably spit in your face youre walking against an unshakable certainty dont you see as long as youve got something which is partially working and its doing him some good and he didnt have too many problems and it made them little bit easieryou know that level of certainty why you can get pretty reasonable about the entheta kid you know and he walks up to you and he says nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah bank bank bank bank bank bank bank bank bank bank you know dramatize dramatize dramatize kill everybody kill everybody kill everybody you know and you say well maybe hes right you know because the results ive had you see i had little present time problem one time and it eased up little bit in session certainty so of course persons got certainty why he can be lied to and howeverwhats happening at this particular present time is i was listening to mary sue the other day and somebody had inferred something or other about scientology there were sparks coming eighteen inches out of each eye it was remarkable phenomenon you know i lit cigarette on it and thought about it i notice now that theres lot of doubt and wonder about ethics and so on here and there and so forth what is ethics i just heard one from chicago just before i came to the lecture and so forth scientology is to help not to punish people laughing how the hell would he know hes never been helped by it hed made lot of dough with it but hes never had any tone arm action ive ever been able to find out suppressive so we are developing simply systems by which to handle the public at large is all we are doing and right now it goes in with thud against some staff members and so forth and students collide with it and that sort of thing good get used to it because the action is actually intended for the public dont you see but until you have familiarity with law and order amongst yourselves and some experience with how it works and what seems unjust and what seems just and that sort of thing you never can grab ahold of it now you cant go nonchalantly knocking off the united states government or something like that without at least issuing an hco suppressive order you know i mean it wouldnt be fair now lets come down to cases give them warning give them chance to recant whats interesting about it is if you dont have system of law and order you will never have law and order you will just have cruelty duress suddenness revenge these sort of things how about one of theseone of these releases and that sort of thing supposing you had system whatsoever with which to handle an impolite entheta or suppressive person well he of course is thinking on broader number of dynamics now lets just move it up little bit this guy goes clear and he goes ot its part of his experiential track that people are nasty to him occasionally part of his experiential track that the melbourne parliament is filled full of dingos dont you see now i hate to go whole track on you but youve been lot more active talking about it than i have and the truth of the matter is thatdont you think that person would get penchant for turning that parliament building upside down dont you think hed think that was an awfully good idea if he didnt have anyplace to step that day dont you think that hed think that was an excellent place to step now with his brilliance and effectiveness returned dont you think for moment that when this subject came up he wouldnt turn his effectiveness in the direction of knocking it out regardless of whether he could handle the masonry or not lets leave that as an unreality you might not be used to handling masonry lately but lets supposing he got very bright and very able and that sort of thing dont you suppose hed shoot that melbourne parliament down in flames hm it can be done weve got the us courts now talking in our language didnt take much doing all the findings about scientology now are couched in scientology terms they define an emeter with our definition not with the fdas definitionours thats the courts those are hearings so you can make penetration one way or the other but supposing you just went for broke on this supposing you decided that the melbourne governmentparliament down there in victoria wasnt good for people and you decided you were going to wipe them out i can assure you you would be perfectly capable of doing that now that gives us problem if you dont deliver into the hands of executives and scientologists and releases and clears method of uniform justice and procedure by which it can be accomplished youre going to have chaos you wont have new civilization youll have some rubble because of this fact two or three of them would have to get together to decide what they were going to do before they did it in order to have anything just about it or work it out in any way and that wouldnt be the way they operated if system existed that wouldnt be the way they operated at all one guy would say lets do ron favor thats the end of parliament down in melbourne boom well at least declare them suppressive first now war was defined by fellow by the name of clausewitz i dont know if you ever knew him in any past life he was philosopher on the subject of war and frankie the limperpardon franklin delano rooseveltnever read clausewitz he never read clausewitz he would have taken vocabulary or something his vocabulary endedbegan and ended with my friends and give us another appropriation i think that was the end of his just to be suppressive about it so mr roosevelt did not know clausewitzs definition of war and i can shorthand thisits in horrible german and if you quoted it completely and so forth it would break your brains and youd have to go look up in dictionary and it would all be misunderstood and youd commit overts on him so ill give you the shortened version which is simply this war is means of bringing about more amenable frame of mind on the part of the enemy laughing and thats what war is and thats all war is frankie however he wanted unconditional surrender now would you please figure out what unconditional surrender has to do with that definition of war by clausewitz unconditional surrender is not more amenable frame of mind on the part of the enemy at all its an obliterated enemy now that sounds more like genghis khan talking to than an enlightened statesman unconditional surrender so he continued the war with germany two years and he continued the war with japan one year they were trying to surrender they already were in more amenable frame of mind the end of war had been achieved but the machinations of war had to move forward in one case two years in another case year smashing everything in sight knocking out lord knows how many of the other people and how many of ours and telling how much of that last periodwhen we were trying to get unconditional surrenderhow much that cost in terms of rehabilitation of the country i think most of the damage in the country must have been done during the last period of the war not the first period of the war see in other words that was very costly and stupid thing to do unconditional surrender uncle joe stalin and the rest of the boys wished it off on him down there at casablanca and he went along with it and so they decided that germany had to unconditionally surrender and japan had to unconditionally surrender and that was going to be the end of war well that is not the end of war war is simply bring about more amenable frame of mind on the part of the enemy and that is all war is and when you fail to halt it at that point and then negotiate and fix up the differences why youre fool now what are we looking for here now there are certain elements in the society that declared war on us some time ago if you dont believe it its not my imagination so on they said there wont be any emeters and there wont be any anything and nobody must get better yeah down with those people you know and just about in that level of intelligence you see they declared war of course we know the mechanics of such people those people are caught somewhere on the trapin the track within trap of an engram and theyre fighting whoever has got them there theyre fighting the sioux indians or somebody like that so everybody in present time to them with terrific generality you see are sioux indians thats right if you ever looked into their anatomy you would find out that they were fighting enemies that longer existed and theyre imagining enemies that dont exist they bring then discreditable mockery situation into place where you have some enemies and if fighting enemies is paranoid you see then if you fight anybody then thats paranoid that doesnt seem to be very logical to somebody walks up to you hes going to bash your head in and steal your wife and because youre afraid that itll make you look paranoid you dont take any action toward him well thats not logical thats asininity moving up to the nth degree dont you see and people dont think like that as they get clear and so forth they tend to work on greaterthe greater good for the greater number of dynamics dont you see and some guy walks up and starts clobbering everything in sight and knocking everything around thatwhile youre trying to do your job and so forth take some suitable action but how much action should you take now thats the question how much action well its justlets put it in the area of war for some reason or other some man somewhere or some government bureau or some parliament or something suddenly declares war on scientology see well they arent educated enough to know why theyre usually doing it from the basis that they once upon time were jumped on by implanters and theyre still fighting them oryou know or theyre being born and theyre fighting the doctor or we dont know what situation they think theyre in were in the immediate advantage of we know they dont know what situation theyre in well we jolly well had better know ourselves what situation were in and the situation were in is that our people get chopped up and our organizations get enturbulated by certain actions taken in the environment against scientology well now how much reaction should there be to that and it should be just enough reaction to bring about more amenable frame of mind thats all thats on the broad broad public view now supposing when anybody walked into an organization started chopping up the registrar or that sort of thing she simply sent for the ethics officer the ethics officer came over and took the persons name and address and moved it on down through cf and central files and parked the guy in dead file and that was the end of his communication line supposing that happened you know that they would have better frame of mind with regard to us we would have enforced one little point be polite just be polite to scientologist see well now if thats all you were intending to bring about why it would win you see itd win very easilybe polite to scientologists see because theyre impolite dont you see and by that impoliteness theyre declaring sort of cold war dont you see well all youd have to do is reverse that situation dont you see somebody writes you nasty letterim not talking about somebody who is simply enturbulated in class or in the hgc or something like thatbut somebody writes you nasty letters and you dogs you bums and that sort of thing you mean everybody on staff has got to read this thing whats the popularity here for entheta because theres only maximum at any given time of 20 percent twenty percent is the absolute maximum that entheta or impolite letters go you mean youre going to concentrate on this 20 and youre going to neglect the 80 you mean youre going to let everybody out there rot while you have marvelous time playing ball with this 20 that doesnt seem to to be the greater good for the greater number of dynamics it seems to to be sort of reverse superdefensive look and yet youll find uniformly that as these letters entheta letters come through the line and chop up people that they rather routinely get handed in to the highest executives in the place because they will always require special handling but this funny frame of mind results the highest executives in the place never see the other 80 they dont realize that 80 percent are just happy as clams with scientology so they dont gauge their service for the 80 percent they gauge their service for the 20 percent so therefore youve got to give them some method of handling that 20 percent you got to give them some way to handle it so that it doesnt tangle up their lines so they dont service the 80 do you see all were trying to do here you see is bring service to the greater number of people well thats very simple to do take the 20 off your lines they get too bad and scream too loud why issue an order make other people disconnect from them other people do and the very funny part of it is as soon as ghost of system goes in by which one can enforce slightly greater degree of politeness on his environment whether as an executive or an auditor and so forth youd be very amazed what immediately happens his reach is increased and what has happenedhe doesnt have to sit back here and hold it all in you know hes got route to put it on this is what you do you do one two bang zzzt thats that well after thats worked out and grooved in and so forth then this persons reach is better he doesnt have to stake for this nonsense because hes got something to do with it so he wont argue with it so therehere he wont stick into it dont you see therefore he in an organization can go uptone not keep getting pulled downtone see its all sound technology as far as were going here all right our nextour next approach to the situation then is to bring it about where the individual can reach the 80 effectively without being entangled by the 20 and its just the percentages of it now that means then that youve got to keep the auditor and the executive in the frame of mind that services the 80 not that tangles with the 20 something is very interesting here ill give you two very good examples here at saint hill of very recent times it was quite shock to some people to find out there were literally thousands and thousands and thousands of letters in central files coming in from founding scientologists those applications were just pure theta these people were satisfied right down to the ground and the only ones the executives knew about were the sour ones that had come in and they were just little tiny handful i think thats fantastic i mean heres this whole ocean of terrific letters you see but the ones that had been forwarded through and that they knew about were this very little bunch see pretty wild pretty wild now ill show you how this comes in more intimately right at the moment im doing forty casesforty meself forty folders day thats trick but out of those forty folders there will be maximum nowdue to ethics and other actions which are taken and so forththeres maximum there of three to four cases that are not running perfectly by the book out of that fantastic number of cases you can chalk it up against the process we can take guy thats all enturbulated and spun in going backwards and upside down and so forth and still stretch him out straight so he soundszunglike violin string pulled at both ends you know but nevertheless you see theres those three let us say folders and theres something bad about those folders now i look at those because theres maybe on them you see you dont take fast action on it and you fall into this kind of trap you forget the thirtyseven thirtyseven cases running perfectly by the textbook to an exact desirable result see there was thirtyseven auditing sessions there that just ran smooth as grease and you look at those three what are we going to do about those three well worry think look for data and so forth well if id do something like that im sure that any d of p in any organization would do something like that im sure that an auditor practicing by himself someplace would forget about those twenty that ran so beautifully and remember those two that didntdo you seeand worry about those in other words you tend to get fixated on the maybe which is very interesting and this is the other thing that brought ethics into view there are only two sources of difficulty with cases only two the auditing comm cycle and ptspotential trouble source those are the only two difficulties that really get in your hair you can make mistakes everyplace else and still somehow get by just those two the auditing comm cycle now of course we could have the gross auditing error of he didnt even run the process we could have the gross auditing error of there was session took place at all i dont mean that by descriptive i mean the pc never appeared and the auditor never appeared you see these are gross errors but lets not look at them quite so gross this auditing comm cycle well the auditing comm cycle might include bit of alteris or q and or something it might include some other devious things how do you police this thing what do you do just go on as d of p saying well i hope all the auditors do all right see because amongst any such body of auditors theres going to be two or three auditors that are showing their teeth and their teeth will show in some fashion along this theyre having some personal trouble or theyre doing something or other dont you see well who looks at all this what are youas d of p or something like that what do you do go charging down to the hgc personally and grab the fellow and say what the hells the matter with you for telling your pc not to answer the auditing question you know that didnt seem to to be good thing to tell your pc and so forth whats all that about well actually you never as d of p get chance to do that your lines are long the work is many theres lots of cases you never get chance to do that well youve got something you can do with that you in the first place would have review division in an organization that is pardon qualifications division for which youd have department of review if you wanted to know what was really going on with this you could send your auditor for check over on the comm cycle you could send the pc for check over on his case immediately youre going to get lots of data that you werent able to have before you dont have to solve this thing by hit or miss hunt and punch lets get both of them checked over now we know where we stand well now supposing its just case of i aint gonna better my comm cycle well im afraid that there has to be another place to send them to bring about more amenable state of mind because hes declared war we cant have this and the place to send him of course is ethics and he goes over to ethics and ethics says whats the matter with you why arent youwhats this complaint ive got here from the d of p so forth well so forth rrrrrrrrrrrrr well they straighten it out they find hes pts or they find it this or that or something has going wrong or they find out hes never had case gain you know they turn up something and then they give some sort of an action with regard to it and eventually this gets back onto your technical lines and you eventually get technical in dont you see but you dont keep that one goinggoinggoing busting up case after case after case you see you can stop that right there so you can get technical in by just the simple expedient of taking that one out of the lineup until it can be straightened up and thats advantageous too are you going to use the united states navy principle on which to do this the way the armies and the navies of the world do this is one guy goes awol goes over the fence after taps so the whole regiment is instantly put on half rations and hard marches you realize that they always apply these general regulations most of your government regulations take place because some guy has goofed the ordinary citizen never really has to be policed but he is policed continuously because of the goofs of three or four criminals do you see so its an everybody bears the burden of couple of crooks do you follow and youll find that most of your arbitrary laws and savageness on the part of executives and officers and so forth stems from the fact that they are unable to handle the couple that goofed and if they have enough loses in handling these guys then they get savage toward everybody if you want to keep them in sweet frame of mind you have to permit them to isolate the guy who is goofing and do something effective about itby the number and then you dont have an executive getting into savage frame of mind thats how your governments turn into suppressive organizations and so forth because they really cant handle the criminal at all theyre quite incapable of doing this all right so you get broad punishment of everybody in sight all the hgc auditors are suddenly turned over toevery night all night long why theyre going to have to do the comm course all over again while you get the idea well its all right to give them comm course once in while when youre brushing them up and getting them on the line but now well lets not have them everybody in the hgc must do comm course because one hgc auditor doeshas been goofing on the comm course that doesnt seemthat seems to to be awfully wog type of management see lets fix it up so this one auditor can do the comm course and he knows whats going to happen if he doesnt do the comm course and straighten out do you get the idea hes suddenly caught between two fires well there must have been something going wrong with him or his lifetime or something like that if he wasnt on the ball he must be in some frame of mind which is grim well is there any reason to visit your reaction to that frame of mind on all the other auditors who are doing their job definitely not so our action with regard to the pc nowlets take up the pc youll be very thankful for this mechanism because the auditor doesnt just get sacked and forgotten about and mauled and that sort of thing you can straighten him out this way lets take this pc i found uniformly that when pc does not run under averagenot brilliant but under averageprocessing he is pts or an sp and those letters mean potential trouble source or suppressive person inevitably and invariably hes pts or sp this doesnt include the fellow who thinks the process was flat and the auditor wants to run it some more and the pc revolts for while something like that were talking about the guy whose case just isnt running you cant seem to patch this case up now you just mark this down in letters of fire and youll never miss and youll also have all kinds of 0 and i and ii level auditors who will be able to audit zoom and they will be getting results all over the place and you will see needles going free and so onon these processes if its d of ped this way pts sp now of course in the case cracking unit at the present moment we simply do not give damn if somebodys an sp bah so what bah if we can hold him down long enough to answer the auditing questions why hes longer an sp you understand its that sudden see ptsthats different thing we now with the new lineup of processes there are also incidentally handling the pts it took couple of days to get that technology i found out that it wouldfound out this datum we couldnt handle the ptspotential trouble source well now that is simply somebody whos connected with an sp who is invalidating him his beingness his processing his life hes connected with suppressive person and the real trouble that you get into is by handling or trying to handle the potential trouble source with auditing and all this data applies definitely to the processes below the power processes it applies to all the processing that we have ever had and this was whyif you keep this comm cycle in mind as the other factorbut this was why processing didnt work do you understand its as elementary as this it had nothing to do with the fact that it would or would not bite the case you could apply it badly it was falling down on the pts now the people who are more likely to come to you for help are ptses so you have greater number of ptses potential trouble sources walking in on you than any other particular type and unless you handle it by ethics or ship them to saint hill and get them power processed you can power process right over the top of that factor now but not with anything else unless you handle him as pts as given by ethics your processing matter what you do is going to fail because hes going to rolly coaster didnt matter how good you made him in the session hes going to come back to the next session on his face and ifeven if you patched him up in that next session hes going to come back to the next session on his face and youre actually processing him into the ground because somebody is arc breaking him faster than you can patch him up now it was this factor alone that we sensed but didnt totally describe when we started giving twentyfivehour intensivesthirtysix hour intensives earlier consecutive processing fast in chunk got the guy up before the environment could knock him down now thats what we were looking for when we said the environment could knock him down we were looking for the sp whos the suppressive person thats keeping that fellow from functioning in life who is it now that person was out of our view we had our hands on this personthis girl let us say and shed rolly coaster shed get better shed get worse shed bleahblah processing would work for moment and then wouldnt work and next day you wouldnt have anything functioning and all kinds of wild things were occurring with this case and the d of p just racking his brains driven into unusual solutions driven into inventing new processes to run uhoh anything everything what are we going to do about this case worry worry worry worry worry ah he was handling potential trouble source he couldnt audit this person up faster than the environment was knocking the person down well what do we mean by environment we mean an sp there was an sp somewhere around that pc and the funny part of it is very often the sp is never even spotted by the pts the potential trouble source does not know the suppressives in his environment now the reason for that is quite interesting the mechanical fact is that suppressive persons commonly speak in total generalities they use everybody they they hear one catty comment itsin the next few minutes becomes on their lips everybody says do you see they broaden and generalize entheta and their identity broadens and generalizes and if you want picnic sometime just ask person this question who has invalidated you dont run it im not recommending that as process it mightyou might use something like that to clean up the beginning of session or something like that but lightly lightly im talking about supposing you tried to run that as process lets be more fundamental name suppressive person you have known hey you know the person youre trying to run that on will go absolutely bugeyed hell try to remember and he wont be able to grasp it and he cant quite figure it out and he cant answer the question and hes getting into terrible confusion because youre running almost straight tell an arc break or tell heres the process youre running tell the source of your arc break thank you and it just wont run as process because the generality around the terminalthis continuous use of they and everybody and so onhas masked the terminal and he cant pick them out and therefore dont think somebody wants to be punched in the head all the time because he still although fifty years of age is still living with mother hes just never spotted the fact that mothers suppressive you can watch mother you see whos now an old dowager of seventytwo knocking this bird appetite over tin cup and preventing him from being married and telling him what he has to eat for breakfast and so on my god hes fiftyyears old and you can watch this and he comes to session you know and hes dressed in weird looking dull gray suit you know thats terriblyabout 1890 cut and so forth and if you ask him who made you wear that suit well mmm i just have to but you could have heard his mother say now george dont you ever wear any other clothes than that you see and its perfectly visible to you see that mama is keeping this guy under hydraulic press its not visible to him he cant spot her anymore shes invisible in the environment shes terrific duress like alike bank now you try to process this fellow and hell go zzzrrrzzzzmmm and hell go upoh he had wonderful firstoh but the next session troubles doesnt matter what youre running him on00 or anything else were not just talking about power processes and if you sit there trying to figure out new processes and trying to figure out this and trying to figure out that you say has anybody been invalidating your processing or anything nobody thats right he answered correctly nobody that person doesnt exist he didnt even hear it yet it registered total now you could drive yourself around the bend trying to handle his case but ethics tells you how to handle it lets look this person over lets ask few indicators this is not processing put the person on meter just who do you know who do you live with who are you connected with thats against scientology oh well mother doesnt like it very much thank you and it falls off the pin well that isnt all its been doing now pts you say all right heres the policy letter handle or disconnect handle or disconnect from mother oh oh but oh yes yes gee you actually havent given him the force necessary to make the decision you have actually pointed out whats wrong with his life and the funny part of it is if you name the wrong suppressive person this ethics technique doesnt work so when the pts doesnt handle or disconnect and instantly go bang then you can assume that you have named the wrong sp youve named the wrong suppressive person thats about the only trouble you have with ethics and frankly sometimes they give you so much trouble that you dont bother to call him back and name the right one hes given everybody around the place headache as far as we can see and that generality is intentionalthere wasnt single soul he didnt give headache to that was in the place and heyou dont get fascinated see youre not in big state of quiver of lets help this person well you didnt make him that way dont you see youve given him the out youve shown him what the score is your responsibility however should extend far enough if youre dealing with ethics and so forth to punch around and watch for the persons face to lighten up say well all right i found out that youre connected with suppressive personyour mother and here is the ethics order and youve got to handle or disconnect he says my mother handle or disconnect oh yes ohho well what do you know youmy mother yeah thats right you know i never thought of that you know zoomzoomzoomzoom youre getting tone arm action youve never seen it on his case before you see to any great degree here the tone arms running and everythings going at mad rate fabulous big case change right there handle or disconnect yeah hell handle or disconnect next guywhy its hosiah somebodyorother and youre saying all right weve been having trouble with you in processing now you must be connected with suppressive person or the guys gotten tone arm action in the past so you know hes not suppressive its oddly enough terrifically in our favor that it isntit isnt becausewe dont call them suppressive because they dont get well im sure that youll hear somebody saying this sooner or later that is the indicatoris ta and when they didnt get ta youve always got yourself suppressive by definition you dont have to look at his conduct you just look at this case behavior of ta see whats ta well its less than ten now this individualthis individual then could himself be suppressive or he could be rolly coaster and this is the other technical aspect and the rolly coaster aspect is he gets better he gets worse he gets better he gets worse hes connected with suppressive so he is pts so all the question you askall the question you ask of the case folder is lets see this fellow have any wins in processing hes never had any wins in processing suppressive all right has this person ever had any wins in prooh yes he was doing all right last summer yes and he was doing all right when he came in for the intensive this fall yes and he seems to collapse between those two times and here he comes in now this winter here andoh hes flat on his face and hes in terrible condition why he didnt leave here in that condition oh look hes in terribleah pts see thats all you need to know it doesnt take any vast technical acumen once its been reduced to the ne plus ultra the simplicity of all simplicities that is the simplicity and youll find these things will carry out now youve gottremendous other ramifications with regard to this you understand oh you could find out all kinds of things about conduct and this and what he did and continuing overts and you could find this and that and you could just stack these items up to hundreds see and the ptsoh you could get the data on that endlessly more data and more data and you could find out the trouble you had in spokane was because this pts got better and that made the suppressive on the other side of him go to the police and we never knew that before dont you see all these things you start pulling on one of these little linesyou start pulling up the pts lineand you get one little tiny bugflea comes out of the line see if you started to investigate it and you pulled on the line little bit further youd find out there was dog and you pull on the line just little bit further and you find out that theres giant starts walking out of there and you pull on it little bit further and youll find an elephant and you pull on the line just little bit further and you got general sherman tank never fails this is the wildest thing when you start investigating but all you have to know on the surface of itall you have to know on the surface is pts or sp thats all you had to know with that data you can make releases and if you dont have that data you cant you can handle students cases you can handle free scientology center cases supposing youre mucking around in free scientology center and theyre walking in off the streets you know whats this scientology i havent drunk any yet youre going to find 80 percent of those guys some rough figure of that character bang boy theyre right with it they go straight on up the line providing you dont get all tangled up with the other 20 that go thud now that 20 certain number of them are going to go appetite over tin cup theythe student auditor gave them little session they felt much better they came back the next day and i felt good last night but today i feel terrible where do you send them you send them to the ethics section thats where you send them now look if you havent got any place to put him hes just going to keep on standing there and you cant process him any further because youre liable to kill him why are you liable to kill him well theres two different ways youre liable to kill him the higher he tries to rise the more somebodys going to smash him down youve doubled up the attack on him you can process him practically into his grave and if he got good enough lets supposinglets supposing this guy was marriedwas married to some girl that had counted comfortably on his kicking the bucket when he got to be sixtyfive because he has thrombosis of the yumbussis and here he is sixtyfour and he walks into the free scientology center and there went his yombosis of the thrumbussis and he comes back home and he says i dont have that horrible pain in my head now gertrude well if this sort of thing kept up very long shed slip him the cyanide you think im kidding when you get into those situations theyll go to extreme see youre dealing with life in the raw these people would be totally uneducated totally unindoctrinated they wouldnt know about anything from anywhere dont you see but they run into all these phenomena just onetwothreefour see now this fellow comes back in and he says what are you people doing around here anyway i came in the other night and some fellow talked to and i dont feel any better and so on so on what do you do with this guy stand there and talk to him or do you go process somebody or get somebody processed that will get gain you send him to ethics what happens to the pts when he gets to ethics youve got to have an operating ethics section then what happens to the pts when he gets to ethics he simply sits down and says all right now do you have somebody whos invalidated your processing or invalidated scientology oh is that so your wife all right very good did you ever recognize your wife was suppressive person i dont care whether you use terminology or not see i neviooooh yeah shes apparently got it in for you one way or the other say you know youre right i often wondered why ive left so many jobs i always seem to be able to do good and then all of sudden i would do bad hey well then youd all of sudden get blowdownsee ethics would youre not processing him and they hand him policy letter and they say all right here you are handle or disconnect and when youve done that whyso forth and heres an order which you already haveso forth and well put this in the file when youve cleaned this up why you come back here and you tell us what youve done and its all set and you can get some more processing you havent slammed the door in his face otherwise youre going to slam the door in his face and if you want to see all hell break loose deny the world auditing now how about the sp well actually you dont slam the door in the sps face right now power processing is only available at saint hill itd never be available i dont think in free scientology center but someday itd be available in your org so you could say to this fellow all right we know whats really wrong with you you have very rough ease now thats talking the truth he also wants to bump everybody off including you dont bother to tell him you got very very very rough case and theres only one place in the world at the present moment that could handle that thats at saint hill they can handle these thats over in england go to england well you have very rough case if you dont watch it youre going to die its true too tell any human being on earth thatperfect truth we got to get you to an auditor quick youre going to die if you dont the doctors gag but this time with some truth because the doctor killed them now the mainthe main action there is you havent denied this guy anything you say youre very tough case youre veryyoure very easily upset about things you fight lot of things i dont care what you tell him see and were not enemies of yours we happen to be friends of yours you can be processed at saint hill in year or twoin couple of years we will have type of unit here which is sufficiently skilled and so forth to handle your case but up to then why and were just going to have to ask you to stay away well have to put this tag on you and you can either do one of those but in the meantime why just stay away because its very restimulative to you makes sense as far as hes concernedall makes sense all right without these tools and tricks you cant process the world thats for sure youre handling life in the raw and if you dont have channels and if you cant keep edges on those channels youre just going to keep mishmash from here on till hell freezes over why youre just never going to make it thats all youre going to take the 20 and fall all over the 20 percent and neglect the 80 and get enturbulated by the 20 and the organizations lines cant hold and because its all being enturbulated this way or that and your pcs dont gain and so forth well supposing you can handle these two factors the organization stands together very neatly things stay in very orderly fashion and in addition to that even your most elementary processes dont fail on the pcs because you see process has rollycoastered ethics actually what you do is send them into review and review sends them to ethics its onetwo bang everything on its route everything with its label and the other thing is its terrible terrible unkindness not to label somebody and were perfectly willing to be that unkind occasionally if somebody keeps writing us letters or talking to the people in nasty fashion all the time or trying to chop us up and we dont seem to be able to do anything we know the person is suppressive and so forth believe were never going to always issue an order always go to full panoply of dress parade this is suppressive person and post the orders on him nah nah nah weve got another system to handle it dead file it just cuts his comm thats all now when he wishes to straighten himself out with regard to the dead file he of course will have to have more amenable frame of mind youve won your war he can be processed or trained its elementary dont you see if he declares war on you if you dont handle it in the framework and definition of whats happening why youre in mess so you of course got to bring about more amenable frame of mind on his part dont you see hes declared the war you havent now if you want toif you want to fail all the way down the line just keep on auditing ptses without ever recognizing that they are keep on having to use only saint hill graduates in the hgc because the newer auditor coming in the class 0 that could just as well be sitting there auditing pcs and so forth is insufficiently indoctrinated and also needs discipline now dont furnish him any disciplinejust dont hire him that doesnt sound to like any kind of solution at all he doesnt think that its important that he does this or that first time hes been up to see ethics hell begin to realize that theres some importance in doing what the process said well thats fine so thats all right with him well thats what you do hell get some results this way what are you supposed to do stand around and give him full hca course while youre waiting for this important datum to sink in or are you simply going to be able to use him if you dont have discipline you cant use his services so you wont hire him so therefore you wont get lot of people processed you see how this thing is figured out and the biggerthe bigger lookthe bigger look at all this of course is the fact that you know youre going to raise hell with this civilization theres going to be organization after organization is going to go down before this onslaught it doesnt matter how nice we are how mild we are how sweet we are how theetieweetie we could possibly be itll still happen theyll fold up well id rather they folded up on an assimilable basis that is to say they fold up on the basis of send us some auditors so we can straighten the place out rather than fold up at the blisteringhot muzzle of gun you understand or under the crack and roar of lightning id say thats very dramatic that will undoubtedly occur id just like to cut it to minimum theres reason to have any more dead bodies around than is necessary you can inject certain positive technology into civilization of this particular character you could almost at this moment sit still and do nothing as far as promotion is concerned you really wouldnt have to reach at all were on the other end of the flow here at saint hill were going to have to resort to such mechanisms as dodged prices you know reservations way up to hell and gonethis sort of thing if we were to try to handle the traffic which we have right now for case cracking and so forth if we were to handle it all in one fell swoop without putting some brakes on the traffic line of some kind or another we just wouldnt be able to make any part of it so weve got to hold the line and give service while were expanding the service and were doing that very easily furthermore weve not only got to expand this service at saint hill this has got to go into other organizations under heavy wrapsthat is to say its got to go in in highly disciplined fashionwhat were doing here because you cant turn this loose in the middle of the kansas prairie man whoever tried to do anything with it hed just go appetite over tin cup an auditor running what were running now has to be wellbacked up auditor and he has to be well backed up by the d of p and he has to be backed up by an ethics officer and he has to be backed up by review and if hes backed up all the way along the line he could run this you could get away with running the lowerlevel processes without such perfection of organization but you couldnt get by with the power processes the horrible trap thats waiting for some auditor whos going to get ahold of the power processes someplace and go out in the middle of the chicago wilderness and start to power process some people oh itll look good you see for couple three weeks itll look all right then he starts to run into all the other hats connected with it and he wont be able to handle these hats even if he had couple of friends they wouldnt be able to handle these hats and the next thing you know chicago starts to beat his door down so then whats he do he would try to train some people who also wouldnt have he wouldnt recognize that his failure on this was not having an organization that could handle it and hed try to train some people to do it to relieve him and next thing you know people will be knocking his blocks off theres nobody nastier than somebody whos been dished by the power processes by the way its twoedged sword god people go nattery you never heard the like of it so what weve run into here is organizational technology not individually administered technology at all if guys got an organization that can back it up he can take the world done by bunch of individuals sitting unprotected and alone against the whole onslaught of the society and so forth thered be nothing but one solid mass of casualty this you could be sure of so your organizational look has had to be worked out now lets take look atlets take look at what this does to processing offered this is very importantimportant to organizations important to individual auditors if theif it takes an organization to administer the power processes effectively it isnt the d of ping thats hard to do it isnt the auditing thats hard to do its just the whole crashing demand line the channeling the lines the this that and the other thing because youre manufacturing plant the second you go into this see you gotyou think well were just going to audit one pc and then well audit another pc and the next thing you know the thing tries to put itself into an assembly line and your waiting list starts stacking up and this well if you dont have this all planned and grooved perfectly and there isnt somebody wearing each vital hat that is on each vital post and so forthwoo rrrrrr all right so that requires high degree of perfection of organization ordinary processes to be successful also have to be backed up now you can get away with auditing an occasional pc but why dont auditors stay in long term practice is it because they get tired oh they make lots of money in the field is it because they wear out is it because of this because of that theyre just not enough of team to handle pcs remember weve already seen psychotherapy go by the boards ive gotten results with that psychotherapy its called psychoanalysis why didnt it ever take the world i think they were so busy trying to handle ptses and sps on an individualpractitioner basis with absolutely rundown that they could never complete their research now they might have found some of our sub0 material if theyd continued to research but psychoanalysis had certain degree of workability we shouldnt snarl at papa freud because he is very bright man but it was the world that kicked papa freuds head in and papa freud was not quite strong enough or able enough to take it but he nevertheless got across to the world the idea that psychosomatic illness could stem from the mind he got across several other points all of which are very interesting his technology is sufficiently workable that i wrecked navy project which wouldnt have amounted to anything at all by sitting under tree and psychoanalyzing their research patients see i wanted their data for myself and they werent going to do anything with their data anyhow except file it so i threw the book you say howd you do this well i was sitting up in the middle of oak knoll naval hospital i didnt have anything to do and they had project running by which they were testing people with endocrine hormones and so forth and they kept book on it of course and i was very good friend of the doctor who was running this project and they would take these people one after the other and theyd run them through this lineup and the doctor would tell enough about thiswed sit around and chin chinand hed tell enough about this that i finally got interested and i started studying up on what he was studying up and studied up on few things off my own kick and found out what his project was all aboutand had been interested in it before that anyhow and i thought what beautiful tailormade experimental line so i merely looked at those patients that he wasnt getting any result on to see if i could change it by mental shift and boy i sure fixed it up i didnt put hisi didnt put his project out of action because i told himafter while but i found out datum which is absolutely invaluable to us that the mind has dominance over structure structure does not dominate the mind and that differentiates us from the medico the medico believes that structure monitors the mind and it doesnt its the mind that monitors structure because the endocrine which is the midway point you might saythe switchboard of regulation and so forthwont monitor structure as long as the mind is unaffected that is to say if the mind is left alone in large number of cases the endocrine treatment will not monitor structure including the glands or anything else there it is but when you remove few psychic blockstraumas if you pleasefreudian style all of sudden zingo it bites and monitors structure now you could change the mans diet you could change his exercise you could do anything you pleased with him you could change his operating environment and you did not change the environmental factor enough to make the endocrine dosages work in other words with the changed mind conditions why hormones would work but with changed physical like conditions the aspect of the hormones did not change that was very very fundamental thing because it laid in my lap something very interesting well it was freudian analysis did that because i didnt use anything on these boys sitting under tree out in the hospital grounds oh i think your name is jones isnt it hiya hiya jones understand youre part of that project up there hmm that so what are they doing up there mmhm have much to do with what you used to think about life and so forth you ever been worried about yourself you ever thought about this sort of thing oh is that so well thats very interesting what sort of childhood did you have did you ever have any unfortunate sexual experiences in your childhood oh is that so you know light straightwire all of sudden hed say you know id never remembered that you know youd get this bugeyedblowdown type of look mark it down in your little book jones november 1945 5th next time youre in seeing the doctor and so forth week or so later and so forth lets look at joness weight and physical record same same same same same november 5thhaaa and id say thank you very much this doctor by the way he washe was young fellow and he didnt takehe didnt take mental treatment seriously he didnt think it worked hed never been educated in it in any way but he was nice young bloke and he didnt blow his stack very much he was very pleased after while to find out what had been going on it didnt draw any conclusion from him and he didnt owe anybody the record but the medical department in the navy so the devil with it but he had wondered why these sudden shifts and changes dont you see well those sudden shifts and changes on that dozen or so patients and so forth was strictly and entirely doingto what we would call today straightwire andbut it was run on entirely freudian basis so you see there was some workability to that technology well then why didnt they advance any further because we were doing technology just little bit superioron straightwire basisto that in 1950 we knew more yeah but why why didnt it move why didnt it change why was there change at all in any of the freudian line why was freudian analysis the same in 1910 as it was in 1894 why was it the same in 1922 as it was in 1894 why did this subject never grow it wasnt that it was successful its just that the individual practitioner never could organize never could get anyplace never could do anything they never developed an organization which would have carried forward the research see thatsafter all its the same mind do you follow it isnt anything different so thats why i tell you today that our greatest dangerour greatest danger as we move forwardis that the technology which we have becomes shattered by unworkability misapplication and so forth that isnt what you want to do with it what you want to do with it is put it together in an organizational line and you want to put it together so that you know all of the accidents you can have with it and you want to take care of every eventuality with it and the second you do something like that it starts moving out with high roar now at that particular point it comes into collision with the society it comes into collision with vested interests it comes into collision with suppressive persons it knocks things appetite over tin cup for the medicos the psychiatrists who the hell would go to see psychiatrist we got shock treatment graph the other day somebody had been processed and had afterwards been forced into an electric shock treatment by some suppressive first time id ever seen one we had seen graph and the persons graph was quite normal and quite good before that electric shock treatment and the electric shock treamentthe graph taken after the electric shock treatment was rightlying down along the lower band of the oca graph well whats the appropriation these boys take in the society lets just look into that field of healing whats their appropriation whats their annual appropriation well i know thati know that its over the billion dollar mark in the united states for medicine i dont know what the figure is for psychiatry in the united states i couldnt even guess but it must be something pretty high because theyre operating hospitals all over the united stateslots of staffs lots of this lots of that you better start taking look at this because youre going to inherit the lot of itand not before very long what are you going to do with spinners you say well all im interested in is going free youre going into go into condition of power all right you go into condition of power the most serious thing you can do is disconnectbang its the quickest way to bring about collapse dont even have to do this on gradient scale you cant disconnect just like thatbang youve been woven in with the race and the universe too long to all of sudden pack it up you pack it up and itll pack you up oh theres quite game going forward here im just pointing out to you few angles and what im trying to do at this particular time is to work out smooth lines and smooth flows now when we look at this list over here of certificates we see here that weve provided route now that route is double route its route by study its route by processing and we havent begun to explore or exploit what can be done by study alone i taught an acc one time and didnt permit any processing during that acc at all and they got better graphs than theyd ever gotten on an acc well i think thats fascinating thing to have happen so i just set it aside casually and said well take that up later on when we need the datum the fact of it is you could probably study somebody right up these levels and straight up through to the top but he would only come cropper on study when he hit v hed finish right there because theres tiger lying between himlying between release and clear clear and ot but lying between release and clear theres tiger known as the r6 bank youre not going to go through that r6 bank by changing your mind thats all right for somebody to get the idea that theyre just going to shift couple of postulates nope nope thats tiger i know ive been bucking this tiger im very very well acquainted with this tiger and it unfortunately isnt something which just keys out like that and youre rid of it you can key the pc out of it and hes in pretty jolly good shape but when you move him up from release up over the jump it will be by the vanquishment of the entirety of the reactive mind have to be clean sweep and there wont havewont be any dust left in the corners and the floor will be beautifully polished and there wont be any floor and then youve got it and theres nothing of value in that bank at all every now and then youonce in blue moon as person starts into it they say but what would i do if id ssuh it gets sillier and sillier as concept as you go on you see to think that it has any value or any use so with that limitation you could study your way up to releasewith that limitation but the actual fact of release might or might not occur but you probably could study your way up to it isnt that interesting that is route that is route and it is route that you must not neglect its the ideas you get the looking at the rules and the laws and adding them up to your life and cogniting on them becoming wiser smarter along these particular lines you suddenly look at that and blow that and you understand something else and boom that goes and so forth this is not something that you should neglect as case advance yes its always an advance in wisdom but have you ever really looked at it as straight case advance well we already have this datum there were quite few on that acc and actually their graphs showed conclusively that at the end of an acc where they had simply received lecturesand theyd receive about one or two lectures daywith this alone and whatever other texts and so forth had been assigned to them their cases went way up some of those cases were quite resistive cases too we never looked for them to have any gain at all but of course they never had any time to tell the auditor they werent making case gain they probably hadnt even noticed it so therefore this is hidden line of advancethis line of advance of the levels now we have something poor on this chart in that we call this 0 i ii iii iv v vi viiwere calling those levelsand now we have second set of levels and youll find out that this is sooner or later confusing so these are actually classes class for auditors see so youll probably find yourwhen its all written up to be in concrete youll probably meanwhen we say level we probably will be meaning these minus thirtyfour on up to plus fifteen or something like that and when we say class why we will mean this youre already speaking of yourselves in classes of grades now this chart is fascinating chart from numerous lines because theit goes as many as seventy levels below minus thirtyfour but to get down as far as minus thirtyfour is quite remarkable because youre down into screaming insanity long before you get there now what are the aspects of these people well theres things liketheres things down here like false cause now the way you interpret this i call to your attention that the interpretation of these minus levels and so forth is very tricky because this is the first time youve ever had this scale itsyou think you know all about it and its the tone scale and so forth and yes the personyes this persons always numb so therefore hes athes at minus ten please this person may be at minus fiftyfour do you see whats wrong is this person aware of the fact that hes always numb well if he was aware of the fact he was always numb hed be at minus ten see do you follow this its what he is aware of now you take this thing like false cause that is to say down below the bottom here now you say well im aware of false causes so am i at false cause please the individual could only be aware of false cause without knowing it was false do you follow that see so you tell himyou tell him babies are found in cabbage patches and he would become aware of that as datum and say isnt that interesting and hed accept that as datum because its false cause but that would be what he could be aware of he could only be aware of causes that were false but he wouldnt be aware of the falsity of causes do you follow so this is very very trickyvery tricky to use and you could make some blunders with this but you can also make some very very bright adjudications with it you all of sudden one fine day become aware of the fact that well you saynot you particularlybut somebody says you know im always thinking i need changes you know hey what do you know you know im always thinking i need changes cognition see there he is minus four he has become aware of it so you might say thats his cognition level now how about the fellow who never cognites well hes just not being audited or trained at the level he could cognite thats all thats very simple very elementary hes over his head in terms of levels its just as elementary as that what can he be aware of well what can hehe could be aware of he could cognite on actually this lays the pattern then of gradient cognitions as it comes right up the line that person would cognite in that gradient of cognitions so what ive been talking to you about admits of the fact that we can now take somebody although we have processes which go up along all these classesthe processes go theretheres also this other phenomenon which has occurred of the power process which just bodily takes anybody who can respond and yanks them up with thud up to iv crash now although id have to give you complete lecture on this some of the manifestations which occur there are quite interesting and some of the data is very fascinating that turns out of this because it tells you that what you have recovered is terrific ability to know an ability to be awareat this level of releasewithout necessarily attaining any more than you knew before do you got that but you have this terrific ability to get there in an awful hurry you see you can look at this washing machineand before you couldnt even read directions to one see maybe something like that oh you say what do you know isnt that interesting hm hm your washing machine is busted the whachacallit and soandso fits into the sumsum and that needs adjustment you know well how did you know that and youd be very surprised because how wouldnt they be able to see that are they stupid or something you get the idea you become very quick study very capable of becoming or knowing or coordinating or acting or figuring something out or putting something together dont you see thats whats increased at thatat that level of release now i could say by extrapolation this probably is what will occur at clear and ot that is just redoubled youve got it so much more plus the fact that you can also do creative actions and move things creatively and make things and bring things about which you never could have done before such as not depending on body and things like this but the actual truth of the matter is that the individual will not know more about how to do that by having been but his present level of beingness will be such that his ability to grasp the potential and act upon the potential assimilate and accomplish at that particular line is just lightning fast do you follow therefore with this data falling out and this data is basedits empirical data i mean this datumdata surprised i didnt have total grip on exactly what this was all about dont you see i couldnt instantly say well an individual knows more than he ever would have known before dont you see he only knows what he knew before it doesnt matter how clear you clear him see he onlyhe only now knows what he knew before of course he has this slight advantage he knows what he knew before as good as when he knew it before but if somebodys been on long snore for eight trillion years dont expect him to know everything that happened in that eight trillion years he now knows as much as he knew about the eight trillion years when he was passing through the moments of the eight trillion years you understand and it wasnt very much see that didnt increase his knowledge of that what it did was increase his potential his ability and so forth so he isnt bothered by his past his awareness of his present is what is coming there so therefore we have to deal with this fact this isthis is new fact and its been little bit hard to isolate this and ive been studying it now bit for several weeks and not quite sure what i was looking at and finally i realized what i was looking at the person is never going to make it without being trained sure he could go through universityhe could go through university in two or three months you get the idea to sixyear course you see sure he could do all these things yeah yeah thats fine but remember hed have to go through the university whats very interesting iswhat youre going to see out of this is quite interesting because the first thing hes going to be aware of as he moves out of comatose wog state into higher level of actionfirst thing hes aware of is scientology i think thats very interesting its the first thing there to be aware of and its the first thing there to study and its the next thing which leads to higher ability level well youre going to take this fellow up there and youre just going to drop him huh the cruelest thing you could possibly do would be to audit somebody through to clear that would just be about the cruelest thing you could do to anybody not train him not have him know anything about being an auditor not know anything about the bank not know anything about life not know anything about himself not know anything about anything and youre going to audit him all the way through to clear now he has this terrific potential to know and you havent made it possible for him to assimilate the technology which has brought him to this state although it wouldnt kill him it would put him in most dreadful confusion itd be cruel thing to do hed say whatswhats this all about i never realized state like this could exist he has gradient dont you see well he could grasp it with great readiness unfortunately the faster way to do it is to bring him up to release on an express elevator and then let him study his way up to where hes got to you know these were the floors oh i wondered what that blur was and then put the tools into his hands where he can move himself through the remaining step to clear and then give him organizationally something into which he can extend this benefit and use his potentials instead of just going out and picking safes idly at night in other words youre takingyou have to take very total responsibility here you cant handle something like this lightly you go appetite over tin cup if you do so were trying to take as much possible responsibility as can possibly be taken along this line along with that you have to have 1 the route which brings somebody up in hurry or the route by which they could be processed up slowly we havent totally discounted grade processing you see but certainly provide these various routes by which it can be done provide this fast one which before the individual who was way down here couldnt have made it at all well he can make it on an express elevator today what are we going to do with this guy hes right away going to say oh there is state of clear and im very aware of that and itd be very very nice and why dont somebody process through to clear why doesnt somebody blow my head offhes asking the same question you say well ill tell you what you do i think you have beginning scientologist certificate correct all right well why dont you just start moving up the line catch up your data figure it all out get it all straightened up and bring yourself up the line and so forth and youll eventually be able to get your class vi trailing and then you can go on through to the top by this time he knows what its all about he knows how other people function youve given him familiarity with the existence in which he lives now at the same time youve done this when youve moved him up along this line you have therefore moved him up as well in his span of knowledge of what is in scientology his organizational scope he has come up to an understanding of the usefulness of the various tools of scientology and he has also found out that these new states arent just being left willynilly to fall where they may but are moving up into type of civilization which can also exist now having discovered these various things when he moves out through the top youre not going to have lot of catastropheyoure going to have lot of order youre going to have lot of happy people this is whats taking the totality of responsibility along some certain line and although taking that much responsibility doesnt seem to be indicated its only not indicated to wog look whats happened to the atom bomb now the nut that dreamed that up never took any responsibility for its potentials he didnt have his ethics in at all and not having it so why one of these days its liable to blow the world apart unless we get there first so we have to get his ethics in for him as well as for ourselves and well be able to do that too but when you dont take responsibility for powerful knowledge itll all go crash and youve got to take responsibility for it to the degree that it is powerful and we for the first time in the history of this universe have total grip on life and whats it composed of and can bring people up with an express elevator clear up all the way to the top over and out thats lot of power wed better measure up to it all ways thank you
