has been expressed about the esfs ability to make foreign loans without congressional approval appropriation legislation in the 104th congress imposed limitations on the use of the esf pl 10452 section 632 and pl 104208 section 628 but the limitations expired at the end of fiscal year 1997 seven bills were introduced in the 105th congress which would have imposed restrictions on the amount of esf loans but did not receive floor action amendment 16 to hr 4104 restricting the amount of esf loans was defeated in house vote on july 16 1998 in the 106th congress hr 1540 esf transparency and accountability act which would impose limitations on esf loans was introduced on april 22 1999 but has not received floor action the exchange stabilization fund was established by section 20 of the gold reserve act of january 30 1934 48 stat 337 341 to stabilize the exchange value of the dollar at that time the esf received an appropriation of 2 billion from the revaluation of us gold holdings

1999 the esf had about 30 billion available to lend the esf engages in monetary transactions in which one asset is exchanged for another such as foreign currencies for dollars it is under the control of the secretary of the treasury subject to approval of the president the treasury department cites 31 usc section 5302 as its statutory authority for providing financing to other countries through the exchange stabilization fund one use of the esf has been to provide resources for intervention in the foreign exchange market the esf also has been used to finance shortterm loans to both developed and developing countries and since 1980 has provided loans to 18 countries from 1980 to 1994 mexico brazil and argentina were by far the largest borrowers since 1995 mexico has been the only recipient of esf loans after the 1994 mexican peso crisis esf loans to mexico totaled 12 billion which were repaid by january 1997 the argument in favor of restricting the use of the esf is that the congress should have voice in how billions of dollars are spent the argument against restrictions is that the esf provides the treasury department with muchneeded quick and flexible tool to respond to

financing to other countries through the exchange stabilization fund the purpose of this report is to provide an overview of the past and current roles of the exchange stabilization fund the loans provided by the esf to foreign countries since 1980 and bills introduced in recent years to limit the esf brief history the esf was established by section 20 of the gold reserve act of january 30 1934 48 stat 337 341 to stabilize the exchange value of the dollar at that time similar funds of european countries were having significant effect on exchange markets the purpose of the esf was to give the united states adequate financial 1 discussion of the global financial crisis is beyond the scope of this report see crs report rl30012 global financial turmoil contagion effects and policy responses by dick k nanto crs2 resources to counteract the activities of the european funds2 it was established with 2 billion appropriated from profits realized from the revaluation of us gold holdings the gold reserve act provided temporary authority for the esf which was renewed periodically until it was made permanent in 1945 the esf was used actively in the 1930s to manage the dollars exchange rate after world war ii when the international monetary fund imf was established the esf was the source of funds for the us contribution as provided in the bretton woods agreement act of 1945 59 stat 514 18 billion of the esfs capital of 2 billion was used to make partial payment on the us subscription to the imf3 the bretton woods agreement act of 1945 also included permanent authority for the esf during the 1960s the likelihood that the united states would have to withdraw foreign currencies from the imf to support the dollar increased the esf was authorized to receive foreign currencies which the united states withdrew from the imf in 1968 when the imf first issued special drawing rights sdrs the esf was authorized to receive the sdrs allocated to the united states the statutory language reflecting the purpose of the esf was changed somewhat in 1976 and 1977 after fixed exchange rates were replaced by floating exchange rate system in 19734 the imf articles of agreement were amended to conform to the current international monetary system in the second amendment to the articles of agreement of the imf which became effective in 1978 countries were longer required to maintain fixed par values for their currencies to conform to the second amendment the language alluding to stabilizing the exchange value of the dollar was deleted and language referring to being consistent with us obligations in the imf regarding orderly exchange arrangements and stable system of exchange rates was inserted one use of the esf has been to provide resources for intervention in the foreign exchange market since 1962 the federal reserve system has also taken an active role in foreign exchange intervention and has swap reciprocal currency arrangements with canada and mexico totaling 5 billion as of march 31 19995 generally us treasury loans to foreign countries are made under special swap arrangements negotiated when necessary while the federal reserve has continuing 2 us congress

carry out this section proceeds of sales and investments earnings and interest shall be paid into the fund and are available to carry out this section however the fund is not available to pay administrative expenses 2 subject to approval by the president the fund is under the exclusive control of the secretary and may not be used in way that direct control and custody pass from the president and the secretary decisions of the secretary are final and may not be reviewed by another officer or employee of the government b consistent with the obligations of the government in the international monetary fund on orderly exchange arrangements and stable system of exchange rates the secretary or an agency designated by the secretary with the approval of the president may deal in gold foreign exchange and other instruments of credit and securities the secretary considers necessary however loan or credit to foreign entity or government of foreign country may be made for more than 6 months in any 12month period only if the president gives congress written statement that unique or emergency circumstances require the loan or credit be for more than 6 months c1 by the 30th day after the end of each month the secretary shall give the committee on banking finance and urban affairs of the house of representatives and the committee on banking housing and urban affairs of the senate detailed financial statement on the stabilization fund showing all agreements made or renewed all transactions occurring during the month and all projected liabilities 2 the secretary shall report each year to the president and the congress on the operation of the fund d repayment of any part of the first subscription payment of the government to the international monetary fund previously paid from the stabilization fund shall be deposited in the treasury as miscellaneous receipt the esf has also been used to finance shortterm loans with both developed and developing countries the shortterm nature of the financing has been emphasized by an amendment to the esf statute requiring the president to notify the congress if 6 swap arrangements are shortterm reciprocal currency agreements between major foreign central banks and the us federal reserve and the us department of the treasury in effect they are lines of credit up to an agreed upon amount that either country can draw on it if needs foreign currencies to intervene in the foreign exchange market or to make short term loans to foreign governments that are experiencing balance of payments problems see also crs report 95169 the mexican peso devaluation and swap arrangements by arlene wilson crs4 loan or credit to foreign country is made for more than 6 months in any 12month period most of the esf swap arrangements were part of multilateral financing package usually in anticipation of or in support of an imf stabilization program or together with loans by foreign central banks through the bank for international settlements bis income and resources of the esf funds have been appropriated to the esf since the initial 2 billion appropriation in 1934 one source of the esfs income is interest on its investments or loans the exchange stabilization fund invests part of its funds in us and foreign securities which pay market interest rates and have high degree of liquidity and credit quality it also receives interest and some fees from loans to foreign countries second the esf has both gains and losses from its operations in foreign exchange markets except in swap agreements which have exchange risk on balance over the years gains have exceeded losses providing substantial amount of income as of late september 1999 resources available for lending are approximately 30 billion esf financing from 1980 through march 1999 table 1 on pages 5 and 6 provides information on the drawings and repayments under exchange stabilization fund swap agreements between 1980 and 1999 it is important to note that the table reflects only esf financing agreements financing was also provided through federal reserve swap arrangements over this period as shown in table 1 mexico brazil and argentina were by far the largest borrowers from 1980 to 1994 in this period drawings from the esf totaled 30 billion for mexico 21 billion for brazil and 17 billion for argentina importantly all drawings were repaid except for 600million swap agreement with mexico in 1982 all drawings were repaid within 6 months in fact some were of much shorter duration two drawings costa rica and peru were

absence of specific dates or because more than one drawing was made under one swap agreement in the case of mexico each of the seven drawings under the 1995 20000 million swap agreement is listed separately because of their large size 90day loan which was rolled over three times mediumterm 2 to 5 year loan since 1995 mexico has been the only recipient of esf loans the 1994 mexican peso crisis resulted in 38 billion international support package of which the united states agreed to contribute 20 billion mostly through the esf the 20 billion large in relation to previous esf swap agreements also included mediumterm crs7 loans and loan guarantees although loan guarantees are relatively rare there are several precedents the esf guaranteed bis loan of 500 million to brazil in 1982 and bis loan to yugoslavia for 75 million in 1983 and provided guarantee for an unspecified amount for macedonia in early 19947 as it turned out esf loans to mexico totaled 12 billion all of which were made in 1995 of the 12 billion 105 billion were in mediumterm 2 to 5 year loans one of the shortterm 90 day loans was renewed three times all of the loans were repaid in timely way the mediumterm loans were repaid ahead of schedule all loans were repaid by january 16 1997 loan guarantees were not used legislative activity 104th congress in the fiscal years ending september 30 1996 and 1997 appropriation legislation included some limitations on the size and duration of esf loans that could be made without congressional approval the provisions of pl 10452 section 632 which applied to fiscal year 1996 were the same as those of pl 104208 section 628 for fiscal year 1997 the main provisions of both laws were as follows an esf loan of more than 60 days to foreign country required the president to certify to the appropriate congressional committees that there was projected cost to the united states and that the us expenditure was adequately backed by an assured source of repayment an esf loan to foreign government greater than 1 billion for more than 180 days required an act of congress with waiver if the president certified in writing to the congress that financial crisis in foreign country was threat to us interests or to the international financial system if the congress within 30 days enacted joint resolution of disapproval the certification would not take effect to become effective such joint resolution requires the signature of the president or veto override expedited procedures for such joint resolution were detailed in both laws esf loans to mexico under the assistance package announced by the president on january 31 1995 were specifically exempted from the provisions of both laws 105th congress 7 treasury and federal reserve foreign exchange operations federal reserve bulletin march 1983 p 144 and june 1983 p 407 and statement by the us department of the treasury february 1 1995 crs8 since the expiration of pl 104208 on september 30 1997 there have been congressionallymandated restrictions in effect on esf loans seven bills were introduced in the 105th congress that would impose restrictions on the amount of esf loans under certain conditions require money to be transferred from the esf to another fund or require reports by the administration on the esf8 none of these bills received floor action on july 16 1998 house amendment 16 to hr 4104 the treasurypostal operations appropriations bill was introduced the text of the amendment was at the end of the bill insert after the last section preceding the short title the following new section sec 648 none of the funds made available in this act may be used to make any loan or credit in excess of 250000000 to foreign entity or government of foreign country through the exchange stabilization fund under section 5302 of title 31 united states code after floor discussion9 house amendment 16 failed by recorded vote of 195226 106th congress on april 22 1999 hr 1540 esf transparency and accountability act was introduced it requires the secretary of the treasury to provide specified congressional committees with detailed financial statement on the exchange stabilization fund and to make the funds annual report to the president and the congress available to the public hr 1540 also prohibits the secretary of the treasury from making any expenditure or loan or more than 1 billion from the fund without congressional approval unless the president certifies that it is necessary to address financial crisis as of september 20 1999 hr 1540 has not received floor action pros and cons of limiting the esf the argument in favor of restricting the use of the esf is that the congress and ultimately the taxpayer should have voice in whether and how billions of dollars are spent since appropriations are not required for the esf the congress does not under current law have an opportunity to debate or vote on potential loans to foreign governments it is argued that since the congress openly debates authorizations and appropriations of far smaller amounts congress should have the chance to do so when esf funds to foreign governments are committed the argument against imposing restrictions is that the esf provides the us treasury department with rapid and flexible tool to respond to international financial crises in recent years technological change and large increases in 8 hr 3106 hr 3138 hr 3573 hr 3114 hr 3580 s 1458 and s 1962 9 see congressional record july 16 1998 p h56985719 crs9 international capital flows mean that crises can spread more rapidly the treasury contends that the availability of the esf could play crucial role in stemming potential crises there is evidence to suggest that the esf has abused its authority previous esf loans to foreign governments were all repaid in timely way recent study which examined the history legal bases and financial operations of the esf focused on the basic question how can the united states maintain democratic accountability for executive branch officials engaged in international financial rescues and at the same time preserve capacity to respond to financial crises with speed flexibility and effectiveness10 the study concluded that since financial markets are imperfect the united states should maintain the exchange stabilization fund under the sole authority of the department of the treasury however the study also concluded that the secretary of the treasury should continue to manage the esf conservatively and should increase the transparency of the esf while the congress should maintain oversight over the secretarys administration of the esf 10 c randall henning the exchange stabilization fund slush money or war chest institute for
