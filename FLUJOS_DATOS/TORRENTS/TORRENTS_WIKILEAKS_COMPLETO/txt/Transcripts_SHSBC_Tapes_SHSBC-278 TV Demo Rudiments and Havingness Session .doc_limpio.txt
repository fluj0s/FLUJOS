tv demo rudiments and havingness session and short lecture lecture and demonstration given on 20 march 1963 lrh were going to give you demonstration of rudiments and havingness just simple put in the rudiments and run bit of havingness and thats it now im not going to follow any particular breed of session or anything im just going to do it the way its being done these days thats good enough isnt it now weve got bit of randomity here perhaps i think you can see the meter however and youve got another picture and all this should work out very well okay theres actually nothing very fancy going to happen here so dont hold your breath but you might notice you might notice as we went along that it is an auditing session and actually we got tired of looking at those x unit sessions so we decided wed do one for you okay all right all right now lets forget about the audience and your chairs okay pc yes lrh all right room all right to audit in pc yes lrh after all this sweat pc yes lrh okay pick up the cans please all right squeeze the cans all right good enough what im going to do here is just put in your rudiments pc mmhm lrh since the last time i audited you pc oh dear lrh and run bit of havingness pc right lrh and perhaps put the rudiments in for the session well see how that is get very redundant here and end it down hows that pc its fine lrh very good all right all right with you if i begin this session now pc yes lrh all right here it is start of session pc right lrh all right has the session started for you pc yes lrh very good all right what goals would you like to set for this session pc well to clean up the period since the last time you audited lrh all right pc and oh feel better at the end of the session lrh very good all right all right here is the first question here when is the last time i audited you pc must be about three weeks ago lrh oh yeah pc three weeks ago in this very room lrh mmhm all right very good you got that spotted pc yes lrh all right now since the last time i audited you has anything been suppressed pc well my auditor must have been done good job on because i dont see thing in see anything there but undoubtedly i have suppressed lot um suppressed um i was going to say um well suppressed concern over the way the staff coaudits been going at times um suppressed um well suppressed worrying you about it occa on occasions um i dont get anything else that ive deliberately suppressed theres nothing readily coming to mind here lrh all right all right thank you ill check that on the meter since the last time i audited you has anything been suppressed all right i have read here there it is there there pc well that was right at the beginning of the when you said you were going to audit i um suppressed looking at anything id done recently so that lrh oh all right pc you very you very considerately sort of left it to the last minute so i didnt stir everything up beforehand but even in that second as i went out to the to phone over about this picture i can recall sort of thinking well have i not suppressed it anything any thoughts of looking back at all over anything that would likely come up in this session at all lrh all right okay since the last time i audited you has anything been suppressed all right did you think of anything pc lrh all right now since the last time i audited you is there anything you have been careful of pc well ive been careful um as far as my auditing has gone not to um self audit out of session and i have quite thing on this i dont like i like to forget the session as soon as ive gone out of it and some people think it may think this is not interested in my case but i am but i dont like to think about it too much out of session i think thats the place to do it an ideal preclear you see lrh uhhuh pc but ive been careful not to overdo this anyway because inevitably something does come up you do start to look at these things but theres one way ive been careful something ive been careful of um i was careful of the way i drove my car i just remembered i did tell you something about this when policeman pulled up and thought i was new driver after thirty years i thought this was bit much um uh very careful possibly too careful over in auditing and um very careful in the in the checks ive done to really make sure that these things are reading and so on and to go over them careful to try and try and get all the data that youve given us lately um i feel quite free otherwise on my carefulness lrh very good all right ill check that on the meter since the last time i audited you is there anything you have been careful of i have read there what have you been careful of there there there there pc um this was careful not to worry you today um about this uh what youre going to do on tv tonight and i left consequently i left it last minute probably by design on your part but anyway thats how it went thats what ive got there lrh ummm pc i was careful not to bother you earlier on and oh i made and with that i made all the provisions that i possibly could so that whatever you decided to do it only meant little bit of sweat to get it on lrh all right okay since the last time i audited you is there anything you have been careful of all right i have another one here pc well that is careful not to um um uh well to upset people um by reason of my job or go over go offline as it were lrh mm mmhm all right since the last time i audited you is there anything you have been careful of have you thought of another one there pc i havent thought of anything else there lrh all right all right good good its very equivocal read and well just skip it all right since the last time i audited you is there anything you have failed to reveal pc ive failed to reveal where im uh um living to my wife and family um ive failed to well ive failed to reveal on quite lot of occasions what im really what im really thinking ive i do that quite lot but its uh um if i disagree with somebody i might not come right out with it and say so thats uh i just dont reveal it i find this is very dangerous thing to do because i find that later on that ive uh uh said something that is wrong anyway and so that its not good idea to go and blurt out immediately what you think lrh all right pc i think thats it lrh hm pc i think thats the lot lrh all right since the last time i audited you is there anything you have failed to reveal all right do you have another answer there of any kind pc i dont have one ready lrh all right take up the next one since the last time i audited you has anything been invalidated think of one offhand pc uh ive invalidated peters auditing on occasions to him um ive invalidated myself lot but this is this i think i cant think of the things now because ive cleared these pretty well in session with peter because theyve been coming up on these various goals weve been running so i cant think of anything else right away not unless i dig dig dig lrh all right since the last time i audited you has anything been invalidated i have read there pc well i got i immediately get this my driving with this policeman when he came and told that td gone around the corner too slowly or something um now that also i was involved i was involved in slight accident going back last friday going back to london somebody hit smack in the b in the rear and um i invalidated myself because when i got out of the car theres pathetic guy hed smashed his car _ the front of his car like nobodys business all ive got is little bit of beading damaged on mine good old jags theyve taken it but um i invalidated myself then because i thought i must have done something wrong for this guy to have hit in the rear i mean the insurance was cut anddried case in my favor but i thought well what did i do here didnt i give enough warning i was going to pull up or something like that and so on but there was an invalidation there this came up after the other car incident lrh oh all right okay since the last time i audited you has anything been invalidated all right did you have an answer pc lrh very good since the last time i audited you has anything been suggested i think thats one pc well im always suggesting things ive made lots of suggestions send you up suggestions you must get fed up about various things and they uh to do with the congress thats coming to do with this course and so on yes theres lots been suggested um dont think theres any bad suggestions done there i just think thats the lot lrh all right since the last time i audited you has anything been suggested i think theres another read there pc well youre suggesting now that theres trouble up in that corner because its rattling i think you seem to be looking at it actually its the pipes cooling off and its one of the ghosties of this room lrh all right pc sorry for that lrh okay all right did you have another one pc um i didnt have another one but ill find one um well ive suggested um uh various courses of action to students when theyve come up with their uh preclears cases to during the day lrh all right very good check that again since the last time i audited you has anything been suggested all right i dont think there was read there did you have an answer all right now since the last time i audited you has mistake been made equivocal think of an answer pc i didnt have one lrh all right all right let check it again since the last time i audited you has mistake been made i dont think theres read there all right since the last time i audited you has anything been protested pc i dont think so i dont do much protesting really um i dont get any protesting its not lrh all right all right since the last time i audited you has anything been protested oh i think that probably was clean since the last time i audited you is there anything youve been anxious about you get an answer pc uh anxious for some of the students on this course at times and their progress um im anxious now uh with the um slightly with the uh doing these rudiments in front of everybody um i dont get anything else here that im really anxious about lrh all right very good see if i have read here since the last time i audited you is there anything youve been anxious about im afraid there is read there pc um lrh there there pc um yes this is um yes this was an anxiety that came up to do with the course today following on the um new system of checkouts and also the new s new pro the new um timetable and i was little bit anxious lest we got off too far uh from what went too far and um got too much again onto the checksheets as in various ways do you see lrh hm pc i could see this possibility happening today lrh all right since the last time i audited you is there anything youve been anxious about i dont think theres much unless youve got an answer straight off pc i havent lrh all right okay now one more since the last time i audited you has anything been decided pc um well yes i well lots of things have been decided um what comes immediately to mindi um decided to rearrange the coaudit schedule um decided to make suggestions to you about the timetable and so on um i dont get anything else beyond i mean one can go into such things well i decided to get up this morning but i cant remember sort of making that decision i can sort of recall making the decision to alter the alter the um timetable and so on and um and to despatch you on various things and other people um oh i decided today to go to the post office to collect some cigarettes that were sent to from america at long last uh thats about it i think lrh all right since the last time i audited you has anything been decided i have reaction on that pc well lrh there there there pc um yes i think im getting on this its um my father telephoned on last saturday morning i havent seen him for some while and he was um had got very good excuse for to go over and see him because he wanted something signed and i decided i didnt want to go over there uh this is an overt this decision as i see it and um so i just said well put it in the post and so on and ill handle it um which i did i think that must be the decision mmhm lrh all right good enough since the last time i audited you has anything been decided all right there is another decision pc yes i this comes off on the same thing its um the uh this is the uh norman my boy um hell be home soon and i was wondering um whether to uh see him um whether to sort of arrange to see him and i decided to make move in the matter lrh tomakeno pc move lrh all right pc in that direction lrh very good okay since the last time i audited you has anything been decided all right i dont think there was read on that pc good lrh okay now lets get in the random rudiment pc right lrh all right all right ill take it easy on this all right since the last time i audited you has anything nearly been found out probably read there pc well i i um i seem to give myself away all over the place i dont think anything has been nearly found out hm theres something around um yeah um yes its it was norman again he came up he came up to my office last saturday morning and um uh he i wasnt there or i dont know what time he came i heard afterwards hed been up and um he nearly found out i was there and its more or less found out what id been doing and so on had he come along i felt you know when id heard hed been up well you know what would have happened and um i think that was what was kicking there lrh all right now what made you believe it was nearly found out anybody say or do anything there pc yeah um marjorie my wife wrote to and said hed been up you see and so on and that was the thing that made that was the moment when i wondered corbli you know what did he lrh all right pc what would have happened then lrh okay now let see this since the last time i audited you has anything nearly been found out there may or may not be read there pc well i think this is possibly the um the rest of the last answer that lrh oh yeah pc sort of came up i was about i was looking at it and um one doesnt feel too good about this and uh about the family situation and uh i suppose had he come up i felt i might have shown up in bad light and thats what was lrh all right pc nearly nearly found out you see lrh i see all right okay let check that again since the last time i audited you has anything nearly been found out all right you had an afterthought there what was it pc just i think its clean lrh all right pc i didnt um lrh all right pc i didnt have anything else there at all lrh all right well were going to let that go for now okay pc right lrh all right now lets go onwere going to run little bit of

fine all right now that was the last command of that process all right pc what happened did it lrh its fine it still works pc good lrh it still works all right now how are you doing in general pc very well lrh all right pc very well lrh i notice your needle seems to have calmed down here looks pretty good looks better youre thinking something what are you thinking pc nothing lrh all right now the only thing i am going to do now is just end the body of the session pc right lrh all right okay pc mmhm lrh all right have you made any part of your goals for this session pc yes i feel better certainly lrh all right pc and uh done some cleaning up of the intervening period yes lrh okay all right i did that in reverse because its rudiments and havingness session you know pc right yes lrh all right now is there anything you care to ask or say before i end this session pc well thank you very much lrh all right all right if i end this session now pc yes lrh okay here it is end of session pc right lrh all right session ended for you pc yes lrh all right tell im longer auditing you pc youre longer auditing lrh very good very good okay now well give these good people break and well excuse you from the auditing room ill just talk to them here for minute you dont have to go pc all right all right lets take look at this now the pcs havingness process is almost equal between to feel and to touch but there was less stability in the one than the otherless stability in to feel than to touchand you could run either one of them or back and forth but to touch was giving him better stable gain than to feel i think you saw it in other words pcs havingness process can look to be perfectly all right and there is better one interesting eh all right the rest of the situation here as far as rudiments and havingness are concerned is you saw there at the beginningif youll excuse my saying sobecause of not liking to be in session particularly for large audienceand i think its very decent of him to volunteer for these sessions lets give him hand shall we all right thank you now its very decent of him to volunteer this way because he has his own problems with stage fright and that sort of thing and you noticed that needle you noticed that needle well that tells youthat tells you that his auditors been nagging him little bit on the subject of rudiments or something theres something going on there otherwise that needle would have been glacially smooth or should have been or well give his auditor break and simply say that the needle was simply rough because of the audience but you noticed at the end of the session beyond his wondering about somethingwhich you saw as ticktick which was spottable there otherwise the needle was clean and flowing now exactly what did we do were there any great significances came off in this session was he badgered did i nag and nag and nag well actually the needle there at the beginning of session practically couldnt be read so who am i to nag him because i cant read his needle you understand you get that point of view now lot of auditors simply punish the pc because they cant read his needle well look if you cant read pcs needle easily hes in state of mind when you mustnt punish him so therefore take what he says and get out of there he might even have had missed withhold but look heres the testhes not mad at is he see hes not mad at so he couldnt have had missed withhold you see thats better test and there we had some rudiments and we had some havingness and the pcs happy about it and he didnt get nagged and his needle smoothed out i want to show you that you dont need an axe to clean up needle thats whats important you think that needle gets cleaned up because you pick up all the thoughts of the pc see thats wrong needle cleans up because the pc has more confidence and more arc with the auditor just put it down to more basically more arc that needle is as clean as the pc feels arc with his auditor now just think of that for minute it isnt cleaned up on the significance of what he told do you understand the whole operation was he was more willing to talk to in spite of you now when you look that over it cleaned up his needle do you see that now of course this can go too far the other way fellow has very dirty needle and he wont talk to the auditor funny part of it is if his arc eventually comes up he will then tell the auditor but he wont so the first requisite of rudiments and havingness session is always always always always always to build arc with the pc by reason of auditing you can give pc with dirty needle and bad havingness and low tone arm and high tone arm anything else you give that pc three nice rudiments and havingness sessions at the end of that he ought to have smooth needle his tone arm ought to be more stable and more reasonable and the pcs havingness ought to be more stable now thats just fact thats all i mean its not what you did dont you see it is how you did it this raised havingness because it raised arc but look i want to show you something i was taking all of these answers and his havingness dropped why did his havingness drop well actually he was having to answer them to you too thats basically why but i could have gone ahead and raised that up again in spite of all that dont you see the significance of all this is that the havingness process which didnt require him to divulge anything to all of you was then more instrumental in smoothing out the needle than the mid ruds were hey how do you account for that you see thats significance you see now do you understand little bit more about rudiments and havingness and the why of rudiments and havingness it isnt the significance of what you get its that the pc feels more confident in being audited by you and if youre the kind of an auditor who cleans cleans and the pcs got thought that he wants to tell you and you wont let him tell you you see he says you say well is there anything been suppressed and the pc says well uh and you say oh well i didnt get read here thank you well bang there goes the whole thing you see it requires very adroit and very smooth handling but you should be able to take pc and give him one two three sessions with just rudiments and havingness make him feel better and his arc will increase that is not because he feels better he feels better because his arc increases to point where the pc reads very beautifully on the meter and has very smooth meter you see where his havingness stays up and so forth you should be able to do that you see its not what you got done with the pc not what you got done in terms of significance not what big withhold did you get off of him in terms of significance but just that you gave him very smooth session now that is the first requisite of all auditing if you cannot give pc rudiments and havingness session which winds up with smoother cleaner needle at the end than at the beginning then brother youre not going to be able to do 3m do you follow that youre not going to be because its first requisite of auditing is to be able to audit i hate to give these horrible platitudes away with but the first requisite of auditing is to be able to audit it is not what you audit its if you can audit do you see that now on that firm foundation you can do anything the pc will go over niagara falls in barrel as far as the bank is concerned for you because hes got confidence he knows youre not going to desert him and you can pull him out in other words you have to get pc to be able to confront his auditor before he can then confront his bank do you see that so it is just this basic fundamental idea of auditing it is just how you audit its just the smoothness with which you audit and its just that your pc is feels better at the end of it and he has been able to confront your auditing hes been able to confront your auditing session and as soon as hes able to confront your auditing session he feels that oh you can throw him into the bank you see the big mistake most people make with raw meat is not to audit raw meat they really dont audit they kind of monkey around you know they just fool around they dont really put them into session they sort of give the guy full dress parade auditing session but do something relatively insignificant or nonsignificant and youll find out he feels quite good why its the old effect scale at work isnt it the person gives this feather touch and he feels better the auditors in there with battering ram doesnt make the pc feel better so what are we looking for here in the rudiments and havingness or in that type of session all we want is basic auditing to work to make the pc feel better thats all do you see that well you should have been able to get out of this session tonight that the pc felt better on the havingness than he did out of the rudiments and havingnessi mean he did out of the rudiments why well he had all of you to get his rudiments off to and he didnt know what thatwell level was because hes been mean to you all week so asin short why his havingness tended to drop little bit there all right but that wasnt because we missed any reads or anything like that theres significance to it if i were to give him two three tv sessions just rudiments and havingness youd find out that the rudiments would have increased his havingness why well because he then would find out that he could get these things off in front of you you see in other words he didnt feel he could get them offive tried to make an objective example of this tonighthe didnt feel totally that he could get them off and his havingness fell all right i gave him straight havingness and hes not having to get anything off with you hes just responding to my auditing command and im not getting him in trouble and his havingness goes up i even changed his auditing command ive run three auditing commands on him three different processes doesnt make for any constancy or stability still it came up and whats all this mean it means that if your basic auditing is excellent and if you are excellent as basic auditor making the pc feel better and smoothing out the behavior of that needleif you can do that you can run any process in the world but if youre not smooth basic auditor god help your pc when youre trying to run 3m and youve cleaned upall except for three quarters of its itemsthe first bank and youve cleaned upall except for half of its itemsthe second bank and youve gone fifteen items into the hird bank without its goaloh youll do things like this i know i know you all right listen look if youre basically good auditor and if youre smooth hah you say hey wait minute i somethings goofed around here someplace and you can find the pcs third goal and go back and put the other two gpms together and hell be smiling the whole time hell be telling his friends well my auditors doing wonderful job youre doing lousy job you see you should be hanged for the job youre doing leaving halfcleanedup things behind you and all that sort of thing but your basic auditing was so good you could get away with it you follow that youll find some people quote do 3m perfectly and their pcs are in agony and some people do 3m terribly and their pcs feel fine whats the variable well the variable is the fact that some auditors can audit very smoothly and make people feel better and others cant and the pcs of people who are having hard time with their basic and fundamental auditing of course feel worse than the others do you get the difference this is an important factor for you and if you at any one time think that rudiments and havingness is practice session then you will never find out how to clean up pcs needle now its true that you can occasionally find an item that cleans up needle right now thats true but in actual fact your most consistent method of cleaning up needle and making pc read on meter is to raise the pcs arc pcarc determines whether or not he reads on the meter when heyou ever notice pc in an arc break does not read on the meter all right well take that as gradient scale of auditing if pc doesnt have high arc with the auditor he doesnt read on the meter if he has arc with the auditor he reads on the meter and if he has marvelous arc with the auditor he reads marvelously on the meter and thats all you can say about it so your basic auditing is where you take off from if you think you can fly airplanes with landing fields well more power to you more power to you but when you run out of gas dont tell i didnt tell you because you will be in bad way because you havent got basic auditing to fall back on now theres what you should be studying when you audit smooth auditing basic auditing and so forth im not setting up this session particularly as paragon of virtue in the way of auditing but you noticed the pc was not worried he wasnt harassed felt fine about things he was willing to talk to now thats all i have to say on the subject but thats rudiments and havingness session i leave it to you whether the session you have just seen bears any resemblance to the rudiments and havingness sessions which we have seen recently on tv and frankly i gave this demonstration tonight because i couldnt stand it anymore okay so on lecture like this we always end with go thou and audit badly more okay thats it thank you very much thats all of the program for this evening good night
