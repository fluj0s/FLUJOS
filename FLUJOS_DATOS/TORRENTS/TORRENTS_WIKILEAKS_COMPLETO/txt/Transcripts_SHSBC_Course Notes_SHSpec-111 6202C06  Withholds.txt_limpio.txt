6202c06 shspec111 withholds withholds and the dynamic principle of existencesurvive as per 1938 data are now seen to be interrelated this is good because where principle has been an amplification of survive it has worked like mad with pcs we also have the reason why an identity is aberrative an identity is that accumulation of withholds that make an individuation when the pc gives you his name you have one part of routine 3dxx already done where you have to recognize person from his identity rather than from his beingness there cant be much beingness present 3d item is maximal identity and minimal beingness every now and then you get identity and beingness crossed and you get an historic character lrh has used identity on the track to make effects but it was mistake to think that he was successful in creating the effects because of the identity it was really because of the beingness you could reach more and influence more than other people so you did the identity side of it was to be more of lump of than anyone else which defeats the reach you can conceive of beingness as the ability to permeate pervade communicate to or fill up an area identity is method of not having to identity puts it on automatic an identity is substitute for communication and reachingness beingness is current activity identity is past activity fame etc the only thing this universe punishes are being there and communicating it is an antibeingness universe and proidentity universe withhold is notreachingness it is not communicating this includes holding onto piece of information that would damage survival of course since thetan cant really be hurt withhold must be to protect the survival of an identity not beingness so withhold goes beyond matter of mores it is something person thinks would reduce his survival as an identity if it were not withheld if you are building an identity on repute which is the standard trick in this universe and working to enhance your repute you withhold those things which would depress the survival identity thetan goes cautious on this and withholds more than he has to selfpreservation is of course misnomer it is really identitypreservation any identity that remains in the bank is the direct result of identitypreservation so we find these suspended 3dxx items hanging around the points that are really stuck however are the points where one failed to preserve ones life because those are the failed postulates the postulated impulse was to preserve the life so death hangs up more than life as failed postulate as an auditor finding some picture hanging up on the track you could ask what would you withhold about that picture and the whole incident would unreel as the pc found the identity that had to be suppressed for purposes of survival despite the fact that there may have been lot of survival in the action you get the withholds and the compulsive outflows off you could almost free up the track by asking what should you have told people about it will run at first with withholds then get into bragging that got withheld where there is conflict whether to withhold or let it out you get hung up on the track you could say that any difficult situation is an unequated or unresolved problem in survival so any hangup on the track is an unresolved problem in survival there were balanced factors involved in communicating or not each hungup identity is hung up with these computations such as the computation that to communicate or not to communicate is equally nonsurvival by pulling withholds off the case you release all these things an individual withholds an identity until it parks on the track when you find an identity you have key to tremendous section of track the identity is dedicated to hiding so finding it takes off tremendous amount of charge because the identity is withholding itself by hiding and you handle the withhold by finding the identity each identity has the feeling or computation they are probably still looking for if they find watch out he was trying to make the identity famous then failed to survive as the identity the pc gets very alert as you come near it feeling like wanted man this is the feeling of guilt which former therapies sought the source of the feeling of guilt is as much brag as anything else but it contains the feeling of being wanted when theres feeling that one has problem of survival which cant be solved on any of the dynamics it will come right up to pt and knock ones head off when one of these comes off identities come off and withholds come off with the identities pulling any identity off invariably involves getting connected withhold otherwise it wouldnt be in the bank and floating up to pt thats the common denominator of anything in the bank since it is there to solve survival of course efforts to survive are silly since thetan cant do anything else what the effort is really directed to is getting an identity to survive if there is an effort in the thing it must be built around lie that the person doesnt recognize the person doesnt realize that he is one thing and his identity is something else he also thinks his beingness and his communicatingness is his identity actually these are deteriorated because he is being joe doakes therefore all these things have withhold connected with them whenever you miss withhold person gets restimulation of withhold and he gets the idea that he is in danger that is all there is to it q and stimulusresponse mechanism if person has withhold that he must withhold he must be in danger because the reactive mind works on an the conclusion can put into action the causation for instance we put george in wrecked car with blood on it not in his car or wreck if george was asleep or drunk or something when we put him there when he wakes up his conclusion will be that he has been in wreck he would mock up sequence to explain his being there the least he would get out of it would be little shock of should i tell anybody or what is this what are the consequences of having wrecked this car in extremis he would show psychosomatic injuries etc so if you give someone the end product of chain of responsibility he will attempt to assume some of the earlier responsibility given b one concludes from evidence this leads pcs to write script in session sometimes sometimes the pc doesnt know what led to the consequences so he figures he must have withhold from himself it is interesting to find the material he must be withholding from himself but isnt his anxiety about identity would cover the whole picture say you have found terminal on 3dxx an angry man you could run what responsibility have you taken for the continued survival of an angry man you would see the package an angry man fall apart into separate identities if you have been responsible for something and then ceased to be responsible for it you can get your block knocked off thats about the only way you can get your block knocked off if you have taken wide identity then while in that identity have ceased to be responsible for it during decline or whatever next time around you take responsibility for the area that leaves the wide area permeated but responsibility for it matter what your identity is because it is only beingness after all people can try to shift their identities to change everything but it is only beingness that counts if he has beingness in his background which is associated with his identity and then suddenly cuts his beingness down to nothing in order to limit his identity he will be in trouble every time he cant function in his limited sphere because he has already accepted much larger sphere so he is always in trouble we could then ask him what responsibility have you taken for the survival of the wider zone thetans are always doing this having taken responsibility for the whole of europe and having battered europe to pieces in order to liberate it all nations who took part in that activity then drew back and said well have peace now and let the whole of europe go to hell sure enough thats what happened world war ii that is withhold of magnitude because it is withhold of ability so withhold can be withhold from anything that the pc has had permeation into or communication with when communication is followed by nocommunication the advent of the communication operating as withhold reduces survival we have made huge area survive now we are only going to make little part of it survive there will be some countersurvival in the area where you were formerly taking full responsibility that is the mechanism of individuation first communication into then refusal to communicate into you have established oneness with something by communicating into it or by taking responsibility for it you cant segmentalize responsibility into smaller zone without bad consequences once you have taken responsibility for energizing an area then retreat the area you retreat from is on your wavelength and clobbers you the people who cut your throat are your own police guard as soon as you decide that you can longer occupy the palace you cant take responsibility for the physical universe and then take responsibility for one room in boarding house in two successive lives and not have planets hit you in the head if the huge zone of responsibility is cut down by series of withholds which it always is then because it is now energized it can kick your head in survival process therefore discharges all withhold processes so the principle of survival is senior to all overtmotivator sequences responsibility processes survivaltype processes persistency processes and identity processes are all senior processes the most horrible opponent being can have is himself of course its got his wavelength in scientology we are making man his own best friend if one finds oneself withholding one automatically assumes one must be trying to survive hence that one must be in danger so if you miss withhold on pc that is the conclusion the pc comes to so he takes defensive actions at once the sequence is as follows 1 the pc finds himself withholding 2 therefore he reactively assumes he must be in danger 3 therefore he must take action to survive ie attack or defend himself if you miss withhold you get 2 and 3 above wild animals are only savage because one pulled their withholds they are individuated any withhold restimulates them though they are not natively savage as beings wolves interpret almost anything as withhold of theirs or yours so they attack rather easily so they must withhold in the vicinity of almost anything so you seldom run into them in order to handle wolf so he wont bite you you have to demonstrate to him conclusively that he is not withholding anything lrh handles wolves that way very successfully the trick is to show them that there is point in withholding anything because they are not going to damage you and you are not going to damage them you can get remarkable results this way but walk up to wild animal as though you are withholding something and you have had it go up to him as though you are not withholding anything and he will look at you and wonder what you are doing so you show him what you are doing dont excite his curiosity so you dont have withhold from him now if you have given the pc the impression in sec checking that he is withholding then dont pull the withhold to show the pc that he is not now withholding he is liable to go into defending himself by attacking pulling his withholds is the only thing that keeps him from individuating missing his withholds however will restimulate them and make him feel that he is in danger and must attack not pulling withhold is ok as long as you dont restimulate it otherwise you would have to get all his withholds in one session it is the missed withhold the one that is restimulated and not pulled that causes the trouble information available and not asked for or information asked for and not gotten is what makes wild animal out of the pc
