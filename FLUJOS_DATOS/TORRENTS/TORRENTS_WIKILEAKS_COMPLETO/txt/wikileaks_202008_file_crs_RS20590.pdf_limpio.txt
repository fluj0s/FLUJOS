law crs report 95964 in which the authorities for the statements made here may be found this report summarizes proposed bills that c ould result in increased interaction between military and civil authorities hr 1986 hr 1815 s 1042 s 1043 the posse comitatus act 18 usc 1385 is perhaps the most tangible expression of an american tradition born in england nd developed in the early years of our nation that rebels against military i nvolvement in civilian affa irs the declaration of independence listed among our grievances agai nst great britain that the king had kept among us in times of peace standing armies without the consent of our legislatures had affected to render the military independent of and superior to the civil power the articles of confederation addressed the threat of military intrusion into civilian affairs by demanding that the armed forces assemble d during peacetime be more numerous than absolutely necessary for the common defense and by entrusting control to civil authorities within the states the constitution continued the theme it provided that civilian the president should be the commander in chief of the army and navy of the united states and that civilian authorities the congress should be solely empowered to raise and support armies provide and maintain navy and make rules for their government and regulation the bill of rights limited the qua rtering of troops in private homes us const amend iii and noted that well regulated m ilitia being necessary to the security of free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20590crs2 const amend ii the constitution on the other hand explicitly permitted the congress to provide for calling out the militia to execute the laws suppress in surrection and repel invasion us const art i 8 cl16 s oon after congress was fi rst assembled under the constitution it authorized the president to call out the militia initially to protect the frontier against hostile incursions of the indians and subsequently in cases of invasion insurrection or obstruction of the laws the presidents authority to call upon the state militia to aid in putting down insurrections is reminiscent of the authority enjoyed by the sheriff at common law to call upon the posse comitatus in the beginning the two were comparable but unrelated even though cong ress empowered the president to call out the militia to overcome obstructions to law enforcement it continued to vest the federal equivalent of the sheriff the federal marshal with the power to call forth the posse comitatus in performance of his duties congress in some cases specifically authorized recourse to the posse comitatus for the enforcement of particular statutes under the fugitive slave act for instance owners whose slaves had escaped to another state were entitled to an arrest warrant for the slaves and to have the warrant executed by federa l marshals the marshals in turn might summon and call to their aid the bystanders or posse comitatus of the proper county and all good citizens were commanded to aid and assist in the prompt and efficient execution of this law whenever their serv ices may be required as aforesaid for that purpose 9 stat 462 463 1850 attorney ge neral caleb cushing declared that the bystanders contemplated by the fugitive slave act might include members of state militia even when not in federal service and in fact encompassed members of the armed forces by virtue of their duties as citizens as part of the posse comitatus following the civil war the use of federa l troops to execute th laws particularly in the states that had been part of the confederacy continued even after all other political restrictions had been lifted the posse comitatus act was passed as part of an army appropriations bill in response with exception of refere nce to the air force it has remained essentially unchanged ever since although congress has authorized substantial number of exceptions and has buttressed the act with an additional proscription against use of the armed forces to make arrests or conduct searches and seizures while the war against terrorism has led some to call for reexamination of the role of the military in domestic law enforcement congress in establishing the department of homeland curity expressed its sense reaffirming the continued importance and applicability of the posse comitatus act 6 usc 466 when the act does not apply constitutional exceptions the posse comitatus act does not apply in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the constitution 18 usc 1385 it has been observed that the constitution contains provision expressly authorizing the use of the military to execute the law that the exception was included as part of facesaving compromise and that consequently it should be ignored the olde r commentaries suggest that the word expressly must be ignor ed for otherwise in their view the posse comitatus act is constitutionally impermissible effort to limit the powers of the president the regulations covering the use of the armed forces during civil disturbances do not go quite that far but they do assert two constitutionally ba sed exceptions sudden emergencies and protection of federal property the question of whether the constitutionalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20590crs3 exception includes instances where the pres ident is acting under implied or inherent constitutional powers is one the courts have yet to answer statutory exceptions generally the posse comitatus act does not apply where congress has expressly authorized use of the military to execute the law congress has done so in three ways by giving branch of the armed forces civilian law enforcement authority by establishing genera l rules for certain types of assistance and by addressing individual cases and circumstances with more narrowly crafted legislation thus it has vested the coast guard branch of the armed forces with broad law enforcement responsibilities second over the ears it has passed fair ly extensive array of particularized statutes like those permittin g the president to call out the armed forces in times of insurrection and domestic violence 10 usc 331335 finally it has enacted general legislation authorizing the armed forces to share information and equipment with civilian law enforcement agencies 10 usc 371382 these last general statutes were crafted to resolve questions raised by the socalled wounded knee cases see below the legisl ation contains both explicit grants of authority and restrictions on the use of that authority for military assistance to the police federal state and local pa rticularly in the form of information and equipment 10 usc 371382 section 371 specifically au thorizes the armed forces to share information acquired during military operations and in fact encourages the armed forces to plan their activities with an eye to the pr oduction of incidental ci vilian benefits the section allows the use of military undercover agents and the collection of intelligence concerning civilian activities only where th ere is nexus to an underlying military purpose under sections 372 through 374 milita ry equipment and f acilities may be made available to civilian authorities members of the armed forces may train civilian police on the operation and maintenance of equipment and may provide them with expert advice and military personnel may be em ployed to maintain and ope rate the equipment supplied the authority granted in sections 371382 is subject to three general caveats it may not be used in any way that could undermin the military capability of the united states the civilian beneficiaries of military aid must pay for the assistance and the secretary of defense must issue regulations to ensure th at the authority of sections 371 to 382 does not result in use of the armed forces to make rrests or conduct searches and seizures solely for the benefit of civilian law enforcement military purpose the armed forces when in performance of their military responsibilities are beyond the reach of the posse comitatus act nd its statutory and regulatory supplements neither the act nor its legislative history resolves the question of whether the act prohibits the army fro m performing its military duties in manner which affords incidental benefits to civilian law enforcement officers the courts and commentators believe that it doe s not as long as the primary purpose of an activity is to address military purpose the activity n eed not be abandoned simply because it also assists civilian law enforcement efforts willfully execute the laws the act is limited to willful misuse of the army or air force the senate version of the original act would have limited proscription to willful and knowing violations 7 cong rec 4302 1878 the house version had limitation 7 cong rec 4181 1878 the compromise which emerged from conference opted to forbid only willful violations but nothing in the legislative history explains whathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20590crs4 the limitation means it seems unlikely that court would convict for anything less than deliberate disregard of the laws requirements when has the army or air force been used to execute the laws existing case law and commentary indicate that execution of the law in violation of the posse comitatus act occurs when the armed forces perform tasks ordinarily assigned not to them but to an organ of civil government or b when the armed forces perform tasks assigned to them solely for purposes of civilian govern ment while inquiries may surface in other contexts such as the use of the armed forces to fight forest fires or to provide assistance in the case of other natural disasters posse comitatus act questions arise most often when the armed forces assist civilian police the tests used by most contemporary courts to determine whether military forces have been used improperly as police forces in violation of the posse comitatus act were developed out of disturbances in 1973 at wounded knee on the pine ridge indian reservation in south dakota nd inquire 1 whether civilia n law enforcement officials made direct active use of military investigators to execute the law 2 whether the use of the military pervaded the activities of the civilian officials or 3 whether the military was used so as to subject citizens to the exercise of military power which was regulatory prescriptive or compulsory in nature military coverage navy and marines the posse comitatus act proscribes use of the army or the air force to execute the law it says nothing about the navy the marine corps the coast guard or the national guard the courts have generally held that the posse comitatus act by itself does not apply to the navy or the marine corps they maintain however that those forces are covered by similarly confining administrative and legislative supplements which appear in the depa rtment of defense dod directive coast guard the posse comitatus act likewise says nothing bout the coast guard the coast guard is branch of the armed forces located within the department of homeland security 14 usc 1 as amended but relocated within the navy in time of war or upon the order of the president 14 usc 3 the act will apply to the coast guard while it remains part of the department of homeland security while part of the navy it is subject to the orders of the secretary of the navy 14 usc 3 and consequently to any generally applicable directives or instructions issued under the department of defense or the navy as practical matter however the coast guard is statutorily authorized to perform law enfo rcement functions 14 usc 2 even while part of the navy its law enforcement activities would come within the statutory exception to the posse comitatus restrictions and the re strictions applicable to components of the department of defense w ould only apply to activities beyond those authorized national guard the act is silent as to what constitutes part of the army or air force for purposes of proscription there is little commentary or case law to resolve questions concerning the coverage of the national guard the civil air patrol civilian employees of the armed forces or regular members of the armed forces while off duty strictly speaking the posse comitatus act predates the national guard only in name for the guard is the modern militia reserved to the states by art i 8 cls15 16 of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20590crs5 constitution which has become an organized force capable of being assimilated with ease into the regular military establishment of the united states maryland v united states 381 us 41 46 1965 there seems every reason to consider the national guard part of the army or air force for purposes of the posse comitatus act when in federal service when not in federal service historical reflection might suggest that it is likewise covered recall that it was the state militia called to the aid of the marshal enforcing the fugitive slave act which triggered attorn ey general cushings famous opinion the posse comitatus acts reference to posse comitatus or otherwise is meant to abrogate the assertion derived from cushings opinion that troops could be used to execute the law as long as they were acting as citizens and not soldiers when they did so on the other hand the national guard is cr eature of both state and federal law condition which as the militia it has enjoyed since the days of the articles of confederation courts have he ld that members of the nationa l guard when not in federal service are not covered by the posse comitatus act similarly the dod directive is only applicable to members of the national guard when they are in federal service off duty acting as citizens and civilian employees the historical perspective fares little better on the question of whether the posse comitatus act extends to soldiers who assist civilian law enforcement officials in manner which any other citizen would be permitted to provide assistance particularly if they do so while off duty congress passed the act in response to cas where members of the military had been used based on their civic obligations to res pond to the call as the posse comitatus the debate in the senate however suggests that the act was not intended to strip service members of all civilian rights and obligations the more recent decisions have focused on the nature of the assistance provided and whether it is incidental to action taken primarily for military purpose some have questioned whet her civilian employees of th armed forces should come within the proscription of the act but most frequently without comment seem to consider them part of the armed forces for purposes of the posse comitatus act the current dod directive expressly includes ci vilian employees under the direct command and control of military officer within its posse comitatus act policy restrictions geographical application the posse comitatus act contains expre ssion of extraterritorial application but it seems unlikely that it was meant to apply beyond the confines of the united states its territories and possessions congress enacted it in response to problems occurring within the united states and its territories problems associated with the american political process and policies and actions that promoted military usurpation of civilian law enforcement responsibilities over americans congress does appear to have intended the authority and restrictions c ontained in 10 usc 371382 to apply both in the united states and beyond its borders consequences of violation prosecution the posse comitatus act is cr iminal statute under which there has apparently never been prosecution it has been invoked with varying degrees of successhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20590crs6 however to challenge the jurisdiction of the courts as defense in criminal prosecutions for other offenses as ground for the s uppression of evidence as the grounds for or defense against civil liability and as mean s to enjoin proposed actions by the military exclusion of evidence allegations that the posse comitatus act has been violated are made most often by defendant s seeking to exclude related testimony or physical evidence but most cases note the absence of an exclusionary rule often avoiding unnecessary analysis of the scope of the act and whether violation has occurred jurisdiction and criminal defenses defendants have found the act helpful in prosecutions where the government must establish the lawfulne ss of its conduct as one of the elements of the offense several defendants at wounded kn ee persuaded the court that evidence of possible vi olations precluded their convi ctions for obstructing law enforcement officials lawfully engaged in the performance of their duties civil liability the eighth circuit has declared that violation of the act might constitute an unreasonable search and seizur for purposes of the fourth amendment giving rise to bivens cause of action against offending federal officers or employees compliance the most significant impact of the posse comitatus act is attributable to compliance by the armed forces as administrative adoption of the act for the navy and marines demonstrates the military has long standing practice of avoiding involvement in civilian affair s which it believes are contrary to the act and which date back to military acceptance of civilian aut hority since the founding of the republic proposed new exceptions hr 1986 would amend title 10 to allow the secretary of defense to provide military personnel to assist the department of homeland security when n ecessary to respond to threat to national security pos ed by the entry into the united states of terrorists drug traffickers or illegal aliens specially trained service members could be assigned to assist the bureau of border security and the us customs service but would not be authorized to carry out searches seizures or other similar law enforcement activities the secretary would be empowered to establish ongoing joint task forces to carry out these activities military members w ould first have to undergo training in issues related to law enforcement in border areas nd would have to be accompanied by civilian law enforcement officers hr 1986 passed the house as section 1035 of the national defense authorization act for fy2006 hr 1815 but without limitation that would have ended the authority after september 30 2007 s 1042 and s 1043 the senate defense authorization bills would add new section 383 to title 10 which would authorize the secretary of defe nse to use unmanned aerial vehicles and dod pers onnel to conduct aerial reconnaissance within us northern commands area of responsibility in order to monitor air and sea traffic along the border and coastline and to communicate resulting information to the appropriate federal state and local law enforcement fficials the activity would be funded from counterdrug appropriations the prohibitions against milita ry personnel participating in searches seizures or arrests would apply
