resources science and industry division january 17 2008 abstract perhaps not fully appreciated during the cipro incident was the fact that existing laws provide mechanisms for addressing potential conﬂicts between intellectual property rights and homeland security needs these mechanisms include government taking of the intellectual property subject to reasonable compensation owed to the patent owner as well as government purchase of patents legislation introduced in the 107th congress would have called for the award of compulsory patent license in the event of public health emergency other current or proposed legislation also relates to the intersection between intellectual property and homeland security including the invention secrecy act and proposed patent extension for ﬁrms that develop antiterrorism technologies this report addresses each of these issues in turnhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32051g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156

high technology solutions to detect and prevent future terrorist attacks as well as to respond to any future attacks that do occur some concerns exist however that patents trade secrets or other intellectual rights may impede the prompt widespread and costeffective distribution of innovations that promote homeland security in 2001 these concerns arose with respect to pharmaceutical cipro an antibiotic that treats inhalation anthrax some commentators called for the us government to override privately owned patent in order to distribute cipro to persons who were potential anthrax victims although the patent holder ultimately chose to increase production of cipro and lower costs this scenario remains possibility for other technologies that bear upon homeland security perhaps not fully appreciated during the cipro incident was the fact that existing laws provide mechanisms for addressing potential conflicts between intellectual property rights and homeland security needs the principal statute concerning us government use of intellectual property is 28 usc 1498 this statute allows the federal government to exercise eminent domain authority against private intellectual property rights as result the federal government may use patented inventions without the prior consent of the patent owner subject to an obligation to compensate the rights holder on monetary basis the federal government may not be enjoined from infringement of an intellectual property righ t intellectual property owners may enforce this government compensation obligation by bringing suit in the us court of federal claims number of more specialized statutes such as the atomic energy act also allow federal government officials to declare compulsory license with respect to particular patent reportedly these provisions have been used infrequently legislative initiatives have proposed that us law provide for other kinds of compulsory licenses including compulsory license that the government could invoke during public health emergency existing legislation and proposed reforms should be evaluated in view of the agreement on traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights this trips agreement places some limits on the ability of wto member states to award compulsory licenses for the use of private persons patented invention if an invention was developed using federal government funding the government may possess certain rights in that invention even though the government contractor obtained patent many entities of the federal government enjoy the statutory authority to purchase patent or other intellectual property right several other statutes and legislative proposals also concern issues at the intersection of homeland security and intellectual property the invention secrecy act controls the disclosure of inventions that raise national security concerns legislative proposals would also call for patent term extensions to award technological

september 11 2001 resulted in significant endeavors to combat terrorism and ensure homeland security among other efforts the us government and private firms are seeking high technology solutions to detect and prevent such attacks as well as to respond to any future attacks that do occur1 biometrics digital surveillance and vaccines are among the antiterrorism technologies subject to current research2 the intellectual property laws have role to play in the research and development of anti terrorism technologies the patent system has long been viewed as promoter of technological development including inventions that may aid homeland security efforts3 on the other hand some commentators have expressed concern that the existence of intellectual property rights may impede homeland security needs4 one possibility is that an individual or firm might own patent that covers an antiterrorism technology in such circumstances the exclusive patent right may be perceived as conflicting with the rapid and widespread deployment of that technology for purposes of homeland security5 intellectual property rights might also increase the market price of the patented technology and limit the ability of others to further develop it6 if the patent is owned by foreign individual or enterprise then additional security complications may potentially arise us government demand for the antibiotic cipro in late 2001 provides past example of this potential conflict in october 2001 an unknown person or persons sent refined form of the bacteria bacillus anthracis commonly known as anthrax through the us mail to members of congress and members of the media7 the us government responded by administering treatment of pharmaceutical compound known as ciprofloxacin hydrochloride to affected individuals8 ciprofloxacin is sold under the trademark cipro by the german firm bayer ag 9 although widely prescribed for several medical indications cipro was at that time the only antibiotic approved by the us food and drug administration fda for inhalation anthrax10 as the incident proceeded attention focused on the availability of large quantities of ciprofloxacin hydrochloride for public use some observers noted that bayer owned the pertinent us patents on ciprofloxacin hydrochloride and therefore possessed the ability to exclude other 1 see crs report rl31914

the united states11 additional commentators encouraged the us government to purchase ciprofloxacin hydrochloride from generic manufacturers who had been producing and selling the drug in foreign countries where bayer did not possess patent rights12 these commentators observed that generic versions of ciprofloxacin hydrochloride were available for much lower prices than bayer was charging in the united states13 others went even further calling for the us government to override bayers patent and purchase ciprofloxacin hydrochloride from other suppliers14 subsequent events ultimately diffused public concern over the availability of cipro bayer agreed to reduce the prices it charged the us government and to increase production15 also the fda quickly approved alternative antibiotics for the treatment of certain strains of anthrax including the one used in the attacks16 nonetheless this scenario remains possibility for other technologies that bear upon homeland security perhaps not fully appreciated during the cipro incident was the fact that existing laws provide mechanisms for addressing potential conflicts between intellectual property rights and homeland security needs17

g18g138g157g142g151g157g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561 by providing individuals with exclusive rights to their inventive products and processes the patent law allows innovators to secure the economic benefits of their discoveries absent patent system competitors might readily be able to appropriate the benefits of an innovators research and development efforts aware of these potential free riders firms might devote few if any resources towards innovation the patent law solves this market failure problem by providing economic incentives for individuals and institutions to engage in research and development 20 the patent system is also said to encourage the disclosure of new technologies21 each issued patent must include description sufficient to enable skilled artisans to practice the patented invention22 issued patents may also encourage others to invent around the patentees proprietary interest others can build upon the patentees disclosure to produce their own technologies that fall outside the exclusive rights associated with the patent23 patent rights may also facilitate technology transfer24 absent patent rights an inventor may have tangible asset to sell or license in addition an inventor might otherwise be unable to police the conduct of contracting party any technology or knowhow that has been disclosed to prospective buyer might be appropriated without compensation to the inventor the availability of patent protection decreases the ability of contracting parties to engage in opportunistic behavior by lowering such transaction costs the patent system may make technologybased transactions more feasible 25 the patent system may also provide more socially desirable outcome than its chief legal alternative trade secret protection trade secrecy guards against the improper appropriation of valuable commercially useful information that is the subject of reasonable measures to preserve its secrecy26 taking the steps necessary to maintain secrecy such as implementing physical security measures imposes costs that may ultimately be unproductive for society27 also while the patent law obliges inventors to disclose their inventions to the public28

obligations of the patent system may better serve the goals of encouraging the diffusion of advanced technological knowledge the patent system has long been subject to criticism however some observers believe that the patent system encourages industry concentration and presents barrier to entry in some markets29 others believe that the patent system too frequently attracts speculators who prefer to acquire and enforce patents rather than engage in socially productive activity30 still other commentators suggest that the patent system often converts pioneering inventors into technological suppressors who use their patents to block subsequent improvements and thereby impede technical progress31 when analyzing these contending views it is important to note the lack of rigorous analytical methods available for analyzing the effect of th patent law upon the us economy as whole the relationship between innovation and patent rights remains poorly understood concerned observers simply do not know what market impacts would result from changing the patent term from its current twentyyear period for example32 consequently current economic and policy tools do not allow us to calibrate the patent system precisely in order to produce an optimal level of investment in innovation

and submit applications to the us patent and trademark office uspto if they wish to obtain patent protection 33 uspto officials known as examiners then assess whether the application merits the award of patent34 in deciding whether to approve patent applic ation uspto examiner will consider whether the submitted application fully discloses and distinctly claims the invention35 in addition the application must disclose the best mode or preferred way that the applicant knows to practice the invention 36 the examiner will also determine whether the invention itself fulfills certain substantive standards set by the patent statute to be patentable an invention must be useful novel and nonobvious the requirement of usefulness or utility is satisfied if the invention is operable and provides tangible benefit37 to be judged novel the invention must not be fully anticipated by prior patent publication or other knowledge within the public domain38 29 john r thomas collusion and

skills of competent artisan at the time the invention was made39 the uspto publishes most pending patent applications approximately 18 months after they are filed40 for example if an inventor filed pate nt application on august 1 2006 then the uspto will make that application available to the public on or after february 1 2008 pregrant publication of patent applications potentially alerts interested parties of the possibility that patent might later be issued 41 however if the inventor has abandoned the application or has certified that patent applications on the same technology will be sought outside the united states then the uspto will not publish the pending application42 if the uspto allows the patent to be issued the patent proprietor obtains the right to exclude others from making using selling offering to sell or importing into the united states the patented invention 43 the maximum term of patent protection is ordinarily set at 20 years from the date the application is filed44 the patent applicant gains enforceable rights until such time as the application is approved for issuance as granted patent however once the patent expires others may employ the patented invention without compensation to the patentee patent rights do not enforce themselves patentee bears responsibility for monitoring its competitors to determine whether they are using the patented invention or not patent proprietors who wish to compel others to observe their intellectual property rights must usually commence litigation in the federal district courts the us court of appeals for the federal circuit federal circuit possesses exclusive national jurisdiction over all patent appeals from the district courts 45 in turn the us supreme court possesses discretionary authority to review cases decided by the federal circuit46

build highway this authority is ordinarily termed eminent domain this government right is not unlimited however in particular in some circumstances the government must compensate the property owner for use of the property 48 these general principles are most frequently applied to real estate but they generally apply to intellectual property as well49 as result the us government effectively enjoys the ability to declare compulsory license that allows it to use patented invention without obtaining the permission of the patentee in turn the federal government has consented to suit by private patent owners in order to obtain compensation for government uses50 section 1498a of title 28 of the us code provides in part whenever an invention described in and covered by patent of the united states is used or manufactured by or for the united states withou t license of the owner thereof or lawful right to use or manufacture the same the owners remedy shall be by action against the united states in the united states claims court for the recovery of his reasonable and entire compensation for such use and manufacture the remaining paragraphs of 1498 provide analogous provisions pertaining to other intellectual property rights including copyright plant variet protection certificates and semiconductor mark works51 section 1498 potentially applies to the use of any patented invention by the federal government not necessarily those directly related to homeland security to the extent the us government engages in such activities as filling abandoned mines52 or constructing

of claims and from 19821992 it was named the us claims court56 the court of federal claims also possesses jurisdiction over number of other causes of action against the us government including certain tax and government contract cases 57 the president appoints sixteen judges to the court of federal claims for fifteenyear terms58 the court of federal claims has national jurisdiction allowing the court to subpoena witnesses and documents anywhere in the united states or its possessions59 court proceedings against the government under 1498a are conducted using the same general standards as does litigation between private parties the patent owner represents itself while the attorney general and department of justice are responsible for representing the us government in 1498 cases60 unlike private patent suits however there are jury trials in 1498 cases61 appeals from the united states court of claims proceed to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit62 as compared to remedies available in patent infringement suits against private parties the remedies available in 1498a suits are more limited in private patent litigation the adjudicated infringer is ordinarily enjoined from using the patented invention throughout the remaining term of the patent 63 the adjudicated infringer may also have to compensate the patent owner for profits lost due to the infringement64 additionally if court deems the defendant to have been willful infringer the court may order the defendant to pay the patent owner up to three times the actual damages suffered65 in contrast 1498a limits available remedies to reasonable and entire compensation to the patent owner as result the government may not be enjoined from practicing patented invention the courts have also generally limited the damages that the government must pay to the patentee to the level of reasonable royalty66 reasonable royalty for purposes of patent 55 see carterwallace inc v united states 496 f2d 535 ct

willful infringement are not available against the government68 the number of 1498 suits has been relatively modest over the years one commentator reports that since 1949 the court of federal claims and its predecessor courts have decided an average of 55 cases per year 69 in the twelvemonth period ending september 30 2002 total of 6 suits under 1498a were filed in the court of federal claims70

contractor infringes patent while performing obligations under federal government contract 1498 ordinarily applies as result the patent proprietors infringement remedy consists of an action in the court of federal claims against the us government in such cases the private contractor may not be enjoined from infringing the patent while performing government contract in the event the court of federal claims decides that patent infringement has occurred ordinarily the us government pays any resulting monetary judgment 72 if the contract between the private contractor and federal government includes socalled patent indemnity clause however the private contractor may have to reimburse the federal government for any damages owed for patent infringement the federal acquisition regulations far include complex set of rules that require patent indemnity clause for certain government contracts prohibit it for others and render the clause optional for still others for example the far requires that government contract for any kind of performance that normally appears for sale on the open market include patent indemnity clause 73 however government contracts for small purchases or for performance that occurs outside the united states may not contain patent indemnity clause74 67 wright v united states 53 fed cl 466 2002 68 degraffenried v united states 228 ct cl 780 1981 69

for the use of patented inventions modest number of additional compulsory licenses exist within the us patent system each pertaining to specialized subject matter75 for example the atomic energy act allows for com pulsory licenses if the invention or discovery covered by the patent is of primary importance in the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy 76 the clean air act contains similar provision relating to devices for reducing air pollution77 finally the plant variety protection act provides for the compulsory licensing of seedbearing plants that are protected by plant variety certificates patentlike instrument granted by the department of agriculture78 legal research completed in connection with this report has failed to discover even single instance where any of these compulsory licenses has actually been invoked plainly none of these provisions has been frequently employed in the past79 some commentators speculate that the threat of compulsory license usually induces the grant of contractual licenses on reasonable terms as result there is need for the gove rnment to invoke compulsory license formally80 legislation introduced in the 109th congress would have created an additional compulsory license in the patent law hr 4131 the public health emergency medicines act would have allowed the government to use the patented invention without the patent owners permission if the secretary of health and human services determined that the invention is needed to address public health emergency under the bill the secretary of health and human services would have determined compensation for government use of the patented invention the bill provided in part in determining the reasonableness of remuneration for use of patent the secretary of health and human services may consider 1 evidence of the risks and costs associ ated with the invention claimed in the patent and the commercial development of products that use the

comprising the world trade organization wto83 the trips agreement addresses number of intellectual property laws including patents copyrights tradem arks and trade secrets in part this agreement requires wto signatory states including the united states to ensure that their intellectual property laws comply with specified standards part iii of the trips agreement addresses compulsory licenses as noted above compulsory licensing refers to the grant of license by government to third party to use patent without the authorization of the patent holder84 the trips agreement places some limits upon the ability of wto member states to award compulsory licenses for the use of private persons patented invention among the most detailed provisions of the trips agreement article 31 imposes in part the following restrictions upon the issuance of compulsory licenses each application for compulsory license must be considered on its individual merits the proposed user must have made efforts to obtain authorization from the patent owner on reasonable commercial terms and conditions and must demonstrate that such efforts have not been successful within reasonable period of time however this requirement may be waived in the case of national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency any such use shall be authorized predominantly for the supply of the domestic market of the member authorizing such use the compulsory license must be revocable if and when its motivating circumstances cease to exist and are unlikely to recur the patent owner must be paid adequate remuneration in the circumstances of each case taking into account the economic value of the authorization 81 hr 4131 section 2 proposing to add new 158 to the patent act the bill had been previously introduced in

human services may adopt regulations to implement the purposes of this section consistent with the agreement on traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights referred to in section 101d15 of the uruguay round agreements act in the event that us law did not comply with the trips agreement standard the possibility exists that the united states could be called before the wto dispute

the dsb if the member states cannot resolve their dispute then the dsb will convene panel to hear and resolve the dispute panel decisions are subj ect to review by the dsb appellate body the wto agreement calls for compensatory trade measures in circumstances where the dsb finds member state to be in violation of the trips agreement yet that member does not amend its laws86 in addition to the possibility of trade sanctions under the trips agreement policy makers at the intellectual propertyhomeland security interface should be aware of recent us foreign policy that has supported the creation of strong patent rights overseas many commentators credit the united states with incorporating minimum standards for patent protection within the framework of the wto 87 since the trips agreement came into effect the united states has continued to encourage other countries to limit the issuance of compulsory licenses88 some commentators believe that calls from certain us government officials to override bayers cipro patent have made it difficult to defend the us view that developing countries should avoid issuing compulsory patent licenses to address their own domestic health needs 89 as result if future discussion occurs over potential reforms to the patent system in view of homeland security needs it may be advisable to account for possible us foreign policy implications

intellectual property ownership issues may be increasingly important in the field of homeland security the bayhdole act governs the ownership of patent rights in inventions resulting from research and development supported by federal government funding92 the bayhdole act is the popular name for pl 96517 which is codified in sections 200212 of title 35 of the us code93 the bayhdole act establishes presumption that ownership of all patent rights in government funded research will vest in any contractor who is nonprofit research institution or small business94 1987 presidential memorandum instructed federal agencies to apply some bayh dole rights to all contractors regardless of their size95 the purpose of the bayhdole act was to encourage companies to undertake the additional efforts necessary to bring governmentfunded invent ions to the marketplace experience showed that without title to an invention firms were less likely to commit resources to commercialize inventions by providing universities nonprofit institutions and small businesses with intellectual property rights congress intended both to pr omote collaboration between commercial concerns and nonprofit organizations as well as to promote the commercialization and public availability of inventions96 the bayhdole act describes in some detail the license given to the federal government on any subject invention made under government contract the contractor may elect to retain title to the invention unless the us government determines that it is in the nations best interest to take title to the invention97 if the us government makes this determination the us government must pursue lengthy process of justifications and approvals before it can take t itle under the statute if the contractor is allowed to retain title the federal government receives nonexclusive nontransferable irrevocable paidup license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the united states any subject invention throughout the world98 this license is not negotiable and is the minimum that the government receives under procurement contract grant or cooperative agreement this minimum license allows the government to use the intellectual property for its own purposes and to give such intellectual property to any other entity including another commercial entity to build or to use on the governments behalf 99 continued funded research and development centers ffrdcs by michael davey 91 see morgan supra footnote 1 92 35 usc 210 2006 93 see diane m sidebottom updating the bayhdole act

government can require the contractor to grant reasonable licenses to third parties under specific set of circumstances for example if patentee fails to take effective steps in reasonable amount of time to achieve practical application of the invention or the action is necessary for public health and safety reasons or is required by public use regulations the federal government can require contractor to grant license or can even grant license itself100 the federal government has also established data rights regulations that operate independently of the bayhdole act these regulations apply both to technical data and computer software produced during the performance of government contracts101 the term technical data includes research and development data engineering drawings manuals and any other recorded information of scientific or technical nature that is proprietary to the government contractor102 the data rights regulations provide the federal government with the right to access and utilize computer software and technical data that belongs to government contractors the regulations also establish conditions under which contractors can maintain rights in their software and data against the government103 the data rights regulations have been described as some of the most complicated regulations in the government procurement system104 in brief however when technical data and computer software are developed by contractor exclusively with federal funds the united states enjoys unlimited rights to use the information and freely disclose it to others 105 in other circumstances however the government obtains more restrictive rights to use contractor technical data and software for example if the government has funded only part of the costs of developing technical data and the contractor indicates that the data is confidential then in some circumstances the government has reduced ability to share the data with others and must maintain the data as confidential 106 opinions vary on whether the bayhdole act and data rights regulations have been fair and effective some commentators believe that th rules are inflexible and overly favor the governments position visavis contractors for example richard n kuyath an attorney in the office of general counsel of minnesota mini ng and manufacturing company 3m contends that unless the laws are reformed to improve the intellectual position of government contractors many commercial laboratories will continue to refuse governmentsponsored rd107 attorney diane sidebottom has argued in accord contending that current government contracting rules are too rigid and lead to one size fits all thinking in her view the governing laws and regulations should be changed to encourage flexibility in the negotiation of intellectual property rights in 100 35 usc 203 2006 see tamsen valoir government funded inventions the bayhdole act and the hopkins v cellpro marchin rights controversy 8 texas

addition to invoking compulsory license of proprietary right another government option is to seek voluntary license or simply purchase outright an intellectual property right that pertains to homeland security congress has already authorized the armed forces to license or purchase outright patents and other proprietary rights funds appropriated for military department available for making or procuring supplies may be used to acquire any of the following if the acquisition relates to supplies or processes produced or used by or for or useful to that department 1 copyrights patents and applications for patents 2 licenses under copyrights patents and applications for patents 3 design and process data technical data and computer software 4 releases for past infringement of patents or copyrights or for unauthorized use of technical data or computer software110 this legislation provides for voluntary negotiation between the armed forces and the intellectual property rights holder the extent to which the armed forces or any other federal government entity has in fact licensed or purchased an intellectual property right from private party is unclear notably if us government entity in fact uses the patented invention without authorization the maximum extent of its liability is reasonable and entire compensation to the patent owner within the meaning of 28 usc 1498 this amount is ordinarily set to the value of voluntarily negotiated license an amount presumably less than the total worth of the intellectual property right 111 given the availability of 28 usc 1498 the ability to license or purchase an intellectual property may be of comparatively limited value to the government 108 sidebottom supra footnote 93 at 241 109 eg brett frischmann innovation and

problems in some circumstances the disclosure of new chnologies may itself lead to possible homeland security issues112 recognizing this potential congress enacted the invention secrecy act of 1951 in order to control the disclosure of certain inventions based upon concerns of national security113 under the act the director of the uspto possesse s the power to withhold from issuance patent applications due to national security concerns if the director believes that the disclosure of particular invention may be detrimental to national security he makes the patent application available to the head of the appropriate defense agency114 if that individual agrees with the directors assessment the director may issue secrecy order on that patent application this order obliges the applicant not to disclose the invention to others for the duration of the order115 failure to comply results in the rejection of the patent application and possibly fine and imprisonment116 secrecy orders are announced for oneyear periods117 they may be renewed on an annual basis upon showing by the appropriate agency head that the national interest continues to support the secrecy order secrecy orders can be terminated prematurely if these national security interests cease to exist118 inventors whose applications are subject to secrecy order are entitled to certain relief first applicants may file petition to have the secrecy order withdrawn119 applicants whose patents have been withheld due to secrecy order have right to compensation120 if patent does ultimately issue from an application that was subject to secrecy order the patent is entitled to term extension on dayperday basis for the length of the secrecy order because the 20year patent term is ordinarily based upon the filing date this provision ensures that the inventor receives the same term that he would have had the patent been issued without secrecy order 121
