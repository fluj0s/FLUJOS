argue that peru has had some problems in the observance of the ilo core labor st andards and that impr ovements must be made in perus legislation on collective bargaining9 labor provisions proposed

proponents and opponents typically cite the following streng ths and weaknesses of the labor provisions of the ptpa strengths of the ptpa labor provisions ptpa reinforces peruvian labor reforms and ilo commitments supporters argue that the ptpa reinfor ces perus labor reforms in 2003 2004 and 2005 in addition enforceable ilo core labor sta ndards in the body of the agreement overlay and reinforce perus longterm ratification of 71 ilo labor c onventions including all eight ilo core labor standards two in each of the following categories 1 the right to organize and bargain collectively

preference laws proponents point out that key democra tic priorities incl ude fully enforceable ilo core labor standards and th same dispute resolution pro cedures that were available for commercial disputes the ptpa would go beyond protections afforded peru under the andean trade preference drug enforcement act atpdea pl 107210 and the generalized system of preferences gsp pl 98573 as amended which set for benefits eligibility the lower standard of providing or taking steps to provide workers internationally recognized worker rights11 weaknesses of the peru tpa labor provisions despite recent progress perus bor laws and enforcement have been weak critics argue that with enforceable ilo core labor standards in the language of the agreement the main issues at this point are perus adoption of new labor laws and enforceability they argue that recen t peruvian labor refo rms have not reversed the weakening of labor laws during the fujimo ri administration and that both ilo reports and the 2005 state departments country reports on human rights practices document the failure of perus compliance with us internationally recognized worker rights and ilo core labor standards such failures in clude 1 the lack of basic protection of the right to organize for large numbers of workers casually employed as temporary or contract workers and therefore not permitted to join labor unions of permanent workers and b the 60 of all peruvian workers in the largely unregulated informal sector 2 reports of forced or compulsory labor practices particularly involving indigenous families in remote areas in violation of perus laws 3 violations of child labor laws an estimated onefourth of all children between 6 and 17 years of age are employed mostly in the informal sector including so in prostitution and na rcotics production and 4 noncompliance with minimum wage guideline s in that roughly half the workforce earned the minimum wage or below many of them in the informal sector ilo core labor standard language and us laws before the new ptpa language was releas ed some observers noted that the united states has ratified only two ilo conventions while peru has ra tified all eight in addition the us has some laws that may not totally conform with language of ilo conventions possible example is some state laws which permit employmentwithoutpay for prisoners consequently they express concern that including enforceable ilo core labor standards into trade agreements could subject the entire us labor code to challenges by trading partners this issue is addressed by language in the ptpa that restricts the application of the ptpa provisions to trade related matters and b incorporates only the principles of the four basic ilo rights listed in the ilo declaration and quoted on p 4 footnote 2 rather than the detailed lang uage of the specific eight conventions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22521crs6 12 us international trade commission usperu trade promotion agreement
