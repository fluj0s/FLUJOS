resources science and industry division summary lead from various sources poses key envi ronmental threat to childrens health and the regulation of lead in drinking water has been key component of federal efforts to reduce exposures to lead lead contamination of drinking water became major issue in washington dc in 2004 when news reports revealed marked increases in the levels of lead in tap water the local water authoritys failure to effectively inform the public about the high lead levels angered citizens and damaged public trus t in the local water supply these events led policy makers to examine the adequacy of the environmental protection agencys epas lead in drinking water rule including the rules monitoring and public notification require ments and epa and state enforcement of the rule oversight hearings were held on these issues during the 108th congress and legislation to strengthen lead regulation was offered but not enacted this report reviews issues surrounding the elevated lead levels in dc drinking water and actions to address this problem more broadly it discusses the lead regulatory framewor k and epas national review of the rule and its implementation to determine whether the situation in washington dc denotes wider problem in need of broader response this report will be updated to re flect developments overview in january 2004 the washington post reported that the dc water and sewer authority wasa had found elevated lead vels in the drinking water of more than 4000 homes in washington dc during testing done in 20031 subsequently water suppliers local officials and regulators have undertaken numerous actions intended to respond to citizens concerns to abate furt her exposures to lead from tap water to identify the cause of the problem and ultima tely to reduce the occurrence of lead in dcs water and assess whether similar problems are occurring in other citieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21831crs2 2 epas 1991 lead rule required community wa ter systems to conduct initial monitoring by december 1992 the results of the first round of monitoring for systems serving more than 50000 persons showed that 130 of 660 systems exceeded

review to determine whether the problem in washington dc is more widespread and to evaluate the effectiven ess of the lead rule epa has undertaken national review of lead monitoring c onducted by water systems from 2000 through 2003 as of june 2004 epa had received monitori ng data for 744 89 of the 834 systems that serve more than 50000 persons epa reported that 27 36 of these systems exceeded the action level of 15 parts per b illion ppb at least once since 2000 and that 12 of 316 systems reported exceeding the ac tion level during the monitoring period ending after january 20032 these 12 systems serve total population of 52 million people among all systems serving more than 50000 persons 66 reported that the highest level observed during any monitoring period since 2000 was less than 5 ppb epa also received data for 6678 91 of 7833 systems that serve from 3300 to 50000 people of these systems 237 34 reporte d exceeding the action level at least once since 2000 and 76 systems serving tota l population of 52 million reported exceeding the level for monitoring period ending af ter january 2003 in this size category 71 of systems reported that the highest vel observed since 2000 was less than 5 ppb3 in each size category 1 of water systems reported exceeding 25 ppb last autumn news reports of possible mani pulation of lead monitoring data by some systems to avoid noncompliance with the lead rule raised concern that larger number of systems may have exceeded the action level in response severa l members of congress asked the epa inspector general to examine the adequacy of enforcement of the lead rule and to determine whether elements of the rule allow data manipulation so that systems remain in compliance epa announced that if utilities have violated the law by providing false or misleading data epa or th state would take appropriate enforcement actions4 however in its evaluation of the rule and monitoring concerns epa did determine that systems needed more guidance for collecting samples and calculating the lead 90th percentile to determine compliance with the rule in november epa issued memorandum clarifying these requirements the guidance reflects requirements of the lead rule as currently written and may be modified if epa decides to revise the rule health effects of lead lead exposure is considered major environmental health threat to young children because lead affects their developing nervous systems and intellectual and behavioral velopment fetuses and childre n under six years of age are most at risk in 1991 the centers for diseas control cdc adopted blood lead level of concern for children of 10 micrograms per deciliter gdl in response to evidence associating adverse health eff ects with blood lead levels above that level recent studies indicate that blood lead levels below 10 gdl also may be associated with negative effects on childrens intell ectual development5 in adults lead may increase blood

environmental protection agency lead in drinking water at httpwwwepagov safewaterleadleadfactshtmlt apwater visited january 6 2005sources of lead exposure lead is widespread in the environment and can be found in older homes with leaded paint and in soil plumbing materials pottery glazes pewter and elsewhere the main source of lead exposure for children is house dust from leadbased paint exposure to small amounts of paint dust and flakes can elevate blood lead levels another major source is soil c ontaminated by leadbased paint and past vehicle and industrial emissions6 epa estimates that 10 to 20 of exposure to lead may come from drinking water but notes that infants who consume mostly mixed formula can receive 40 to 60 of their lead from water if lead levels are elevated in tap water7 lead is rarely present in water when it leaves treatment plant the most common sources of lead in water are lead service lines that connect water mains to homes lead solder and pipes within homes and brass plumbing fixtur although older homes are most likely to have lead pipes joints and solder new homes may also be at risk because under the safe drinking water act leadfr ee pipes may contain up to 8 lead these pipes can leach lead for seve ral months following installation the most common cause of lead in drinking water is corrosion reac tion between the lead pipes or solder and the water the corrosivity of water depends on the waters characteristics such as acidity epas 1991 lead and copper rule the safe drinking water act sdwa di rects epa to promulgate national primary drinking water regulations for contaminants that may pose public health risks and that are likely to be present in public water supplies these regulations generally include an enforceable numerical standard maximum contaminant level mcl to limit the amount of contaminant that may be present in drinking water if it is not economically and technically feasible to determine the level of contaminant epa may establish treatment technique in lieu of an mcl 1412b7a at least once every six years epa must review and revise as needed each drinking water regulation 1412b9 the 1986 sdwa amendments directed epa to issue new lead regulation and in 1991 epa issued the lead and copper rule 56 fr 26460 june 7 1991 this rule replaced an interim lead standard of 50 pa rts per billion ppb wh ich was outdated and not protective of public healt h moreover the interim regula tion did not require sampling at the tap to show compliance with the standard in 1988 epa had proposed lead rule that would have lowered the mcl for lead to 5 ppb applied to water leaving the plant and also would have required treatment technique corrosion control to further redu ce lead in water many expressed concern with the proposed rule arguing that standard applicable at the treatment plant would nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21831crs4 indicate the amount of lead in tap water and that complia nce at the tap was essential epa and utilities were concerned that an mcl applied at the tap was not workable because lead in household plumbing could be major cause of violations situation beyond the control of the water system some utilities also were c oncerned that setting an mcl for source water in addition to trea tment technique for corrosion control would result in confusion among the public and the regulated community 56 fr 26472 the final 1991 lead and copper rule lcr did not include an enforceable standard mcl instead the lcr established treatment technique corrosion control to prevent lead and copper from leaching into drinking water other requireme nts include tap water monitoring public education source water tr eatment and lead rvice line replacement some members of congress and environmen tal groups argued that because lead is measurable the law required epa to establish an mcl rather than treatment technique however epa concluded that an mcl at the tap was not feasible because lead levels are often influenced by factors beyond the control of the water utility the rule generally required all large wa ter systems serving more than 50000 people to conduct corrosion control studies and recommend an optimal corrosion control treatment to the state or epa smaller systems were required to optimize corrosion control when tap water monitoring showed that it was necessary the state or epa then approved or designated treatment as optimal and water systems were given two years to install optimal corrosion control and one year to conduct further monitoring the lead rule also establis hed lead action level of 15 ppb at the tap based on the 90th percentile level of water samples water systems are required to sample tap water in locations that are at high risk of lead contamination primarily homes with lead pipes andor lead service lines the number of sa mples water system must take depends on the systems size and the results of earlier testing large systems generally must take 100 samples in sixmonth monitoring period ho wever systems that meet the action level or maintain optimal corrosion control trea tment for two consecutive sixmonth periods may reduce the number of sampling sites to 50 sites for systems serving more than100000 people and reduce collection freque ncy to once year monitoring may be reduced to once every three years if the 90th percentile lead levels are 5 ppb or lower if lead concentrations exceed the action level in more than 10 of samples the water system has 60 days to deliver an epadeve loped public education program to customers the education program must contain informati on about leads health effects and sources and explains steps to take to reduce exposure to lead the water system also must offer to sample the tap water of any customer w ho requests it the system is not required to pay for sample collection or analysis if water system still exceeds the action level after installing optimal corrosion control treatment and source water treatment it must replace annually 7 of the lead service lines under its ownership the water system must offer to replace the privately owned portion of service line at the owners expense addressing lead in dc drinking water the safe drinking water act allows epa to delegate primary enforcement authority primacy for the public water system supervis ion pwss program to states states that have primacy oversee water systems and thei r compliance with federal drinking water regulations if primacy is not delegated to state epa is responsible for implementinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21831crs5 8 studies show that switch from free chlorine to chloramines can greatly increase lead leaching mechanisms that may cause this effect include the following 1 free chlorine reduces lead solubility compared to chloramine 2 chloramines can greatly increase lead leaching from brass and 3 galvanic connection between lead pipe lead solder to copper pipe may be involved effects of chloramine on leaching from new lead pipe do not seem significant marc edwards and dudi role of chlorine and chlora mine in corrosion of leadbearing plumbing materials

washington aqueduct owned by the us army corps of engineers which treats the citys drinking water and the dc water and sewer authority w asa which buys water from the washington aqueduct and distributes it throughout washington dc the aqueduct also provides water to several communities in northern virginia in march 2004 epa reported that wasa exceeded the action level at the 90th percentile for taps monitored during 6 out of 15 reporting periods since january 1992 three times before 1994 and three times si nce 2002 epa wasa and other local officials worked with the corps of engineers to determine the cause of the elevated levels it appears that changes in treatment processes at the washington aqueduct made the water more corrosive causing more lead to leach from lead pipes in the distribution system and from lead plumbing inside homes in november 2000 the corps had changed its secondary disinfection trea tment from free chlorine to chloramines to comply with new epa regulation that placed strict limits on disinfection byproducts after that more than 10 of tap water samples taken by wasa exceeded the action level8 as result of this finding the corps of engineers worked with technical work group to develop new corrosion control process in june the corps tested process that uses orthophosphate and found negative effects this commonly used compound is expected to form protective coating in pipes and reduce lead leaching in august epa approved use of the process for the entire aqueduct service area and imposed supplemental monitoring and reporting require ments on the affected public water systems epa determined that wasa had failed to comply with numerous sampling public notification and reporting re quirements contained in th lead rule epa and wasa reached consent agreement requiring wasa to improve its public education program upgrade its database management systems and replace mo re than 1600 lead service lines in response to high lead levels in wash ington dc tap water the dc department of health doh and the us public health service offered blood testing for residents through may 2004 5331 individuals had been sc reened of

effectively notify the public of the detections renewe d congressional interest in examining the adequacy of the lead rule including its monitoring and public notification requirements and ove rall enforcement of and compliance with the lead rule during the 108th congress the house energy nd commerce and government reform committees and the senate environment and public works committee held hearings on this issue and bills were introduced to streng then the regulation of lead in drinking water in march 2004 members of the house government reform committee requested that the epa administrator review the lead rule the committee members and others argued that regulatory gaps appear to be undermining the rules effectiveness in protecting public health issues that were raised incl ude the following 1 monitoring under the lcr may not be broad or frequent enough to indicate the level of lead exposure in community 2 allowing 10 of samples to exceed the action level without requiring systems to take steps to reduce lead levels allows known exposures to continue 3 the rule does not require systems to notify homeown ers of monitoring results 4 systems are given 15 years to replace lead service lines and once the action level is met in 90 of samples the system may discontinue this effort and 5 unlike an mcl the action level is not enforceable exceedances of the action level trigger other regulatory requirements critics expressed concern that this regulatory structure ma have delayed the response to high lead levels in washington dc and c ould allow significant lead problems to go undetected or unaddressed in cities nationwide epa is conducting thorough review of the lead rule to dete rmine how well it has worked whether it is being effectively imple mented and enforced and whether it needs revision elements of the rule receiving mo st scrutiny include the public notification monitoring and lead servi ce line replacement requirements in october 2004 the agency announced that the nationa l data from 73000 water uti lities demonstrated that lead in drinking water is not wide spread problem however ep did determine that systems needed more guidance for collecting samples and calculating the lead 90th percentile to determine compliance with the rule in november epa issued guidance to clarify requirements for lead sampling and calculating compliance as part of its effort to address compliance issues epa has offered workshops to improve water system compliance and issued new guidance to states to improve implementation and enforcement of the rule as with other drinking water regulations an issue central to effective implementation of the lead rule is the need for cities to upg rade their water infrastru cture s 2550 water infrastructure funding bill reported in the 108th congress included provisions to address lead contamination simila rly consideration of this issue in the 109th congress could occur in tandem with discussions of
