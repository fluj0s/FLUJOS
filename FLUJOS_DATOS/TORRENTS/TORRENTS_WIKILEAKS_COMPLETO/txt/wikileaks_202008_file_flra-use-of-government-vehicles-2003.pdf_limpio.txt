re ntal vehicle or their wn vehicle the government vehicle costs are included in the office of the general counsel allocated regional office travel budget the use of the government vehicles f or travel when correlated with case workload is not significant however the fact that investigations are conducted via telephone as well as onsite is factor that needs to be recognized also during the past two years the denver and boston regional offices were given travel required cases by the washington regional office because of their increased workload an d the fact that they had regional di

rt ri c ape cod ma virt ually all new england states are small and can be reached within one to three hours by driving the increased airport check in time requirement and the small airplanes used for

he regional director pported thi s usage if i t did not in terfere wit h another mploye s need of vehicle there is gsa policy supporting or restrai ning such use from home to airport but it is not prudent way to justify the need for government vehicle while taxies are available boston regional off ice employees rarely use them because most downtown locations are within walking distance if taxies are used for downtown travel the fare is approximately 5001000 using taxi to get to surrounding area outside the downtown area would be anywhere between 3000 and 6000 one way the taxi fare to the logan airport from the boston regional office is approximately 2000 51 miles the mta subway is located within ½ mile of the boston regional office and most rides cost between 100 and 200 bus

boston regional office employees all stated that having government vehicle was convenient and saved time if the government travel vehicle was unav ailable regional office investigation agents used

and three empl oyee s 1 or 2 tim thr ee in vestig ation agen ts and the ne w reg ional atto rney have not yet used the governm ent vehicle this year part of this reduction in use this past year is related to the fact that 276 cases wer transferred to the boston regional office from the washington dc regional office this past year and several boston regional office investigation agents had to travel to w ashington dc the boston regional office s use of government vehicle documentation was incomplete and many forms signed by users did not include the date of return and mileage used for all

29conclusion over the past three years the four regional offices that used government v ehicles cost the office of general counsel over 4200000 on yearly basis from fy 2000 to august fy 2003 these regional offices spent the individual amounts listed on page ____ all of the subject regional offices felt their travel budget was sufficient but would need to be increased if telephone investigations were eliminated although all of the bject regional office s maintained som statistics on the use of governm ent vehicles they were not standardized or detailed enough to provide reliable basis for cost effectiveness data related to the use of rental and privately owned vehicles by investigation agents needs to be available to properly compare government vehicle costs to the use of public and private transportation t he information obtained by the inspector general from the subject regional offices national travel nation business center and local ren tal taxi bu s and train compani can only be conside red approxim ate the basis of the final decision on whether to continue the use of government vehicles at the boston denver and washington dc regional offices or decide to use public transportation or rental vehicles should be based on th lowest co st to governm ent however it is very i mportant for manag ement to acknowledge that the statistics of the last three yea rs may be low er than what they will be the next few years because of the fact that the w ashington regional office had to transfer significant amount of cases because of the absence of regional di rector and senior reg ional attorney the bosto n regional office and denver regional office also had washington regional office cases which required travel to the washington geogr aphical j urisdictio n area tra nsferred to them these facts have red uced the us age of the government vehicles in all three regional offices another factor which should be considered is the fact that all three regiona l office s employees fe lt that having governmen t vehicle supported tim eliness in case processing cost benefits in holding hearings8 and dealing with representation cases having government vehicle also provided co nvenience to employ ees which is huma n capital sset while most subject regional office investigation agents stated that having government vehicl was convenience and suppor ted the timeliness of their case processing and associated travel m ost of these individuals stated that they could adjust to using rental vehicles if the processing of getting such vehicle was not tim consumi ng or diffi cult for official use only 9if there is an accident while using rental vehicle if insurance is paid for the rental vehicle company not the flra would be responsible for fixing damaged vehicles 30although m anageme nt and em ployees from the d enver regio nal office xpressed th strong ne ed of government vehicle to conduct their mission the fact that the gov ernment vehicle was used for only 8 trips during fy 2002 and 8 trips during fy 2003 does not support the need however the fact that there was general counsel and 25 regional office vacancies in fy2002 and part of fy 2003 the dhs moritorium and reactions to the propose d collins bill h ad an influence on case investigations filed and processed the use of government vehicles for local and reasonable driving to and from jurisdictional locations at the boston denver and washington regional office provides convenience and supports timeline ss for case processing hearings and training by the regional offices the bo ston and denver region office statistics and inspector general interviews indicated reduction in the use of government vehicles over the last t hree years and the preference andor willingness of several employees to use their own vehicles rather than the government vehicle or rental vehicle w hile the washington regional office used their gov ernment vehicles the most it has the best source of public transportation and proximity of rental vehicles the cost of having maintaining and facility parking is more at the washington regional office than at the other two subject regional offi ces the cost for maintainin g the government vehicle at the washington regional office was exceeding high in fy 2002 because f 3 accidents and the ne ed to repair the vehicle after each accident9 also at each subject regional office there were one or two employee who used the government vehicle mu ch more th an others management must also consider the facts that the atlanta dallas and chicago regional offices do not and have not had government vehicles and handle their travel requirements without negative effect also the san francisco ffice havi ng reviewed their statistics f the use of gov ernment vehicle eliminated its use it is also important to consider that similar adjudicatory agencies eeo and the nlrb are using government vehicles for their investigations but the offic of general counsel uses rental vehicles instead another consideration is the fact that the flra office of general counsel uses telephone investigat ions as well as onsite unfair labor practice charge investiga tions which has and can considerably affect the need and cost of regional office employee travel if these telephone investigations are eliminated the current data maintained by the boston denver and washingt on regional offices regarding the use of government vehicles doe s not suppo rt the expre ssed need f or continu ing the asing of th vehicles although maintai ning government vehicles t the subject regiona l office locations provides co nvenience and saves som travel tim the use f rental vehi cles taxies or public transporta tion is via ble altern ative the money spent for the leasing parking and maintenance of government vehicles could be used for additional subject regional office travel an d perhaps provide the cha nce for more onsite investigations the majority of unfair labor practice charges for which government vehicles are used by the denver and washington regional office are associ ated with militar organizati ons since the departm ent of defense authorization act of 2004 was just approved by congress and provides the department of defense thefor official use only 31authority to establish new labor relations and appeals process this will probably affect reduce the department of defense related unfair labor practice charge workload of the flra regional offices in the future irregardless of the management decision of whether government vehicles should be retained or eliminated the office of the general counsel management should require standardized and more detailed data for the regional office s travel expenses use of government vehicles as well as other modes of travel transportation rental vehicles taxies and other ty pes of transportation in cluding personal vehicles for case processing and other mission related activities so that future decisions can be based on valid standardized cost statisti cs if man agement decides to keep governm ent vehicles policy should be provided to elimin ate misuse and standardize appropriate data for decision making the use of government vehicles b the boston denver and washington dc regional offices pro vides convenience and supports the timeliness of traveling to processes cases hold hearings and provide training it is definitely considered human capital asset by the employees over the last two years the use of the government vehicle by the subject offices has diminished significantly the boston regional office has out of state jurisdiction areas which are easier and take less time to drive to than take public or air transportation the denver regional office is located about mile from public transportation has restricted train and bus service and had the least amount of usage of the government vehicle majority of employees preferred to drive their own vehicles which they routinely drove to work w hile the washington regional office has the most usage of the government vehicle to get to customer locations that are difficult or expensive to reach by public transportation andor taxis and are easier to get to by vehicle driving it has two rental vehicle locations within one block of the office because of 4 accidents inv olving the washington regional office government vehicle in fy 2002 2003 their travel cost was excessive because of maintenance and repair charges and an expensive parking space charge findings and recommendations finding 1 the use of the government vehicles by the boston denver and washington regio nal office has diminished over the last three years for various reasons and cost effectiveness is questionable public transportation andor re ntal cars are available to all offices recommendati on 1 managem ent should consider eliminating go vernment vehicles from the three subject regional offices at the end of fy 2004 the subject regional office travel budgets should retain the money and use it for rental vehicles when driving is necessary andor other modes of public transportation or air travel if there are future changes which increase these offices caseload significantly in the future and management can support the need of government vehicle it could be reinstatedfor official use only 32finding 2 the flra does not have internal travel policy and guidance for employees nor does it maintain standardized statistics to allow the proper budget allocations and monitoring of travel costs for all modes of transportat ion in its compone nts and sub componen ts recommendation 2a because of the significant amount of travel by some agency component and subcompone t employees appropriate agency internal travel policy and statistics need to be defined and maintained by all three components of the agency to properly assess travel costs and budget travel allocations 2b flra budget and finance division travel officer should semiannually
