6107c20 shspec32 games conditions games condition means an agreement of cant have amongst beings its have for self and cant have for others in true games condition but as an agreement its cant have on all flows its agreement that nails it in concrete widespread cant have agreement gives you lots of mass for instance the christian prohibition on sex which is very fundamental as cant create bodies are necessary as favorite vehicles and identities but theres penalty in the christian system for creating them this results in mustmust not it is in the field of disagreement and can be processed in various ways but how did you get suckered into position like this where you could accumulate motivators like this you must have been party to the cant have somewhere along the line you cant suffer any consequences you had hand in creating and you must have done it by agreement with lot of others with the disagreement youre objecting to the game you helped to create in the first place if you get the disagreement off you get considerable resurgence you could undercut it by getting all the agreements to have the game games condition process seeks to isolate the basic agreements on some kind of game games condition is derogatory term it means package consisting of fixated attention inability to escape coupled with inability to attack to the exclusion of other games theres nothing wrong with having games but game condition is unknown arbitrary reactive performed outside ones choice without his consent or will its sort of mental doingness trap in it youve got to do things assume certain beingness and have communication with anyone not part of the game the world thus becomes massless timeless spaceless and peopleless very rapidly most marriages that go on the rocks are in games condition where theres total agreement that neither one can have anything overlaid with another set of agreements that are in disagreement with that fundamental cant have agreement their tenderest moments are when theyre in disagreement with the basic agreement of cant have this gives us interesting maxims like hell hath fury like woman scorned which reflects the later disagreement when two people get this fixated the rest of the world ceases to exist they just stay with each other and shut out the rest of the world games conditions can exist on any dynamic wars are an example on the third or fourth dynamics one can find portions of the track where one has repeatedly gotten into the same game eg defending the capitol by being part of an interceptor squadron shooting down or being shot down by the enemy right over the middle of the airport this was games condition because it was an unknowing fixated activity it did nothing effective for the society the clue to games condition is that the person is doing compulsive confront that makes it necessary for him to assume compulsive beingness in order to play this game one must deny certain havingness the us has in its last two wars demonstrated itself to be in war games condition because it cannot have the fruits of any of its victories in games condition matter what the person says he always ends up with havingness so you get an obsessive beingness and doingness and cant havingness everybody has few games conditions few have complete games conditions going the latter are in the spin bin when you see one of these games conditions it defies all logic because its obsessive it has nothing to do with the real world this is true of all aberration its out of pt the rationale which rationalizes games condition has holes in it but dont try to argue someone out of it audit him out of it you cant educate someone out of games condition because its aberrated and he cant look at it analytically the situation of person who cant influence his bank with thinkingness is interesting the gradient scale of less effectiveness in this regard ends in effectiveness if you give such person an auditing command he doesnt do it and even if he did do it it would have effect on the bank such person breaks auditors hearts and gives people loses it is of interest to understand the anatomy of this phenomenon which exists to some degree in all cases since clearing person means putting him in control of the bank weve been working on the question of how person could get into condition where they could not affect the bank since 1954 the answer is withholds the fellow is backing out of life hes withholding as part of games condition denying something to someone else the withhold gives him cant reach pullback multiply this by lot of instances and you find that eventually the person practically exits from the dynamics but this is really not possible to do so he inverts on them as far as hes concerned his effort is to leave compounded with the withhold and notreach thus you get an ineffectiveness you cant control something you cant reach and from which you are withholding yourself the mustnt reach is really mustnt be reached of course this is true especially when there is punishment involved punishment compounds withholds so as we go downscale on reach we get 1 ineffectiveness 2 destructiveness the pc cant communicate with something well enough to understand it so when he does reach he can only be destructive 3 inability even to destroy something 4 inability to have any influence at all of any kind 5 inability even to affect his own mind add up all these withholds and cant haves on all dynamics and you get someone whos totally withdrawn individuated totally ineffective on his own bank when he runs cant have on people he makes them less familiar and more withdrawn from things then by the overtmotivator sequence this reacts on him so he stops reaching and starts withholding at 100 withhold or 100 withdraw he cant influence anything including his thoughts and bank if he reads on the meter you know something is effecting his bank dont be amazed if the pc has never noticed really the condition hes in he cant think or rationalize on the subject he will buy wrong whys on it readily so if you run command that you havent tested for read you are doing something adventurous since if it didnt read youre in an area where hes still totally ineffective or totally effective pc can be compulsively exterior the detached case freud could never help this kind of case thats someone who is backed out of the dynamics and backed out of his head people will tell you they feel detached that indicates games condition in the area where they feel detached most homosexuals are detached in this sense in any area person is in games condition about he is detached how do you reverse the games condition find something that reads on the emeter and is therefore something he can effect ie something real to the pc real means can the pc be effective in that sphere get the pcs withholds and cant have off the subject on gradient scale you take off the games condition and the pc can now reach in the area and regain effectiveness its basically idiotically simple but if you violate that doingness you dont get results in auditing say you want to cure psychosomatics with auditing you can find people who are so much the effect of their psychosomatics you can have more effect on them than the they can you can make them well but they dont know it so they never thank you for getting well what you should do to avoid this situation is to assess all the persons difficulties get the best read get off all the persons withholds on the area get the games conditions in the area cured and the difficulty will right itself you can eradicate illness and upsets but you have to assess them first the fact that the pc complains about something all the time doesnt prove anything it could be circuit or mechanism or it could be part of some other games condition there is gradient scale of difficulties the pc may have lots of them but may be effective only in one area thats where you must start thats been the barriered line on healing and help if you run command that doesnt read the pc is ineffective in the area therefore its auditor vs the pcs bank with help from the pc hell be arc breaky hard to audit because youre just auditing bank and the pc isnt there this violates the basic auditing principle auditor plus pc is greater than the bank
