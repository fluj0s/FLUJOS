untitled document date is it possible to be happy by l ron hubbard is it possible to be happy great many people wonder whether or not happiness even exists in this modern rushing world very often an individual can have million dollars he can have everything his heart apparently desires and is still unhappy we take the case of somebody who has worked all his life he has worked hard and he has raised big family he has looked forward to that time in his life when he at last can retire and be happy and be cheerful and have lots of time to do all the things he has wanted to do and then we see him after he has retiredand is he happy hes sitting there thinking about the good old days when he was working hard our main problem in life is happiness but ill tell you more in moment the world may or may not be designed to be happy one it may or may not be possible for you to be happy in this world and yet nearly all of us have goal to be happy and cheerful about existence you know very often we look around at the world around us and say that nobody could be happy in this place we look at the dirty dishes in the sink and the car needing coat of paint and at the fact that we need new gas heater we need new coat we need new shoes or we would just like to have better shoes and so how could anyone possibly be happy when actually he cant have everything he wants he is unable to do all the things hed like to do and therefore this environment doesnt permit person to be as happy as he could be well ill tell you funny thinga lot of philosophers have said this many many timesbut the truth of the matter is that all the happiness you ever find lies in you you remember when you were maybe five years old and you went out in the morning and you looked at the day and it was very very beautiful day and you looked at the flowers and they were very beautiful flowers twentyfive years later you get up in the morning you take look at the flowersthey are wilted the day isnt happy day well what has changed you know they are the same flowers its the same world something must have changed probably it was you actually little child derives all of his pleasure in life from the grace he puts upon life he waves magic hand and brings all manner of interesting things into being out in the society here is this big strong brute of man riding his iron steed up and down and boy hed like to be cop yes sir he would sure like to be cop and twentyfive years later he looks at that cop riding up and down and checks his speedometer and says doggone these cops well what is changed here has the cop changed just the attitude toward him ones attitude toward life makes every possible difference in ones living you know you dont have to study thousand ancient books to discover that fact but sometimes it needs to be pointed out again that life doesnt change so much as you once upon time perhaps you were thinking of being married and having nice home and having nice family everything would be just fine the husband would come home and you would put the dinner on the table and everybody would be happy about the whole thing and then you got married and maybe it didnt quite work out somehow or other he comes home late and he has had an argument with the boss and he doesnt feel well he doesnt want to go to the movies and he doesnt see how you have any work to do anyhowafter all you sit home all day and do nothingand you know he doesnt do any work either he disappears out of the house hes gone then he comes back later in the evening and quite an argument could ensue over this actually both of you work quite hard well what do we do with condition like this do we just break up the marriage or touch match to the whole house or throw the kids in the garbage can or go home to mother or what do we do well there are many many things we could do and the least of them is to take look at the environment you know just look around and say where am i what am i doing here and then once you have found out where you are why try to find out how you can make that little more habitable the day when you stop building your own environment when you stop building your own surroundings when you stop waving magic hand and gracing everything around you with magic and beauty things cease to be magical things cease to be beautiful other people seek happiness in various ways they seek it hectically as though its some sort of mechanism that exists maybe its little machine maybe its parked in the cupboard maybe happiness is down at the next corner or maybe its someplace else theyre looking for something but the odd part of it is the only time they ever find something is when they put it there first now this doesnt seem very creditable but its quite true those people who have become unhappy about life are unhappy about life solely and completely because life has ceased to be made by them here we have the single difference in human being we have here human being who is unhappy miserable and isnt getting along in life who is sick who doesnt see brightness life is handling running changing making him and here you have somebody who is happy who is cheerful who is strong who finds that there is something worth doing in life and what do we discover in this person we find out that he is making life and there is actually single difference are you making life or is life making you and when we go into this and we will find out that person has stopped making life because he himself has decided that life cannot be made some failure some small failure maybe not graduating with the same class or maybe that failure that had to do with not marrying quite the first man or woman that came along who seemed desirable or maybe the failure of having lost car or just some minor thing in life started this attitude person looked around one day and said well ive lost and after that life makes him he doesnt make life anymore now this would be very dreadful situation if nothing could be done about it but the fact of the matter is that it is the easiest problem of all the problems man faces changing himself and changing the attitudes of those around him it is very very easy to change somebody elses attitude yet you are totally dependent upon other peoples attitudessomebodys attitude toward you may make or break your life did it ever occur to you that your home holds together probably because of the attitude the other person has toward you so there are really two problems hereyou would have to change two attitudes 1 your attitude toward somebody else and 2 their attitude toward you well are there ways to do this yes fortunately there are for many many centuries man has desired to know how to change the mind and condition of himself and his fellows actually man hadnt accumulated enough information do this up to relatively few years ago but we are making it very fastpaced world we are making it world where magic is liable to occur at any time and has man now understands great many things about the universe he lives in which he never understood before amongst the things he now understands is the human mind the human mind is not an unsolved problem nineteenthcentury psychology didnt solve the problem but that doesnt mean it has not been solved in modern times the most interesting miracles are taking place all across this country and across other continents of earth what do these miracles consist of they consist of people becoming well when they were ill incurably ill they consist of people who were unhappy becoming happy once more they consist of abolishing the danger inherent in many of the illnesses and many of the conditions of man yet the answer has been with man all the time man has been able to reach out and find this answer so perhaps man himself had to change perhaps he had to come up to modern times to find out that the physical universe was not composed of demons and ghosts to outlive his superstitions to outlive the ignorance of his forebears perhaps he had to do everything including inventing the atom bomb before he could finally find himself well he has pretty well mastered the physical universe now the physical universe is to him rather pawn he can do many things with it and having conquered that he can now conquer himself the truth of the matter is he has conquered himself the religious philosophy of scientology came about because of mans increased knowledge of energy man became possessed of more information about energy than he had had before in all of his history and amongst that he came into possession of information about the energy which is his own mind the body is an energy mechanism naturally person who cannot handle energy could not handle body he would be tired he would be upset he would be unhappy and he looks all around him to find nothing but energy if he knew great deal about energy particularly the energy of himself and the space which surrounds him he of course would know himself and that in the final essence has been his goal for many thousands of years to know himself scientology has made it possible for him to do so l ron hubbard from the book scientology
