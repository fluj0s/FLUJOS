this legacy would appear difficult to overcome in addition most of the traditional centers of power in haiti such as the military the catholic and protestant churches the business sector and the traditional elite find democratic reformist ideas threatening in the haitian context the government apparatus is still staffed principally by duvalierist appointees many of whom have resisted change during the numerous postduvalier governments and will most likely continue to do so longstanding racial conflict haitian history is marked by conflict between two racial groups the mulatto elite and the majority blacks the vast majority of haitians are black poor illiterate peasants the mulattos established their economic power and elite status principally by controlling the business sector both groups enjoyed periods of political dominance black rulers generally emphasized haitis african roots and traditions including the africanbased folk relig ion voodoo the mulatto elite emphasized european catholic traditi on because of their edu cation mulattos held some government positions even during black rule race relations have improved in recent years the once disdained creole dialect used by the majority is now an official language spoken by all haitians interracial marriages are common and the government is longer as dominated by mulattoes but recent political events have again heig htened racial and class tensions within haiti the poor black majoritys only access to power has been through public protests when tolerated and the recent elec tions the mulatto elite wields most of the economic and political power in haiti and generally resists dramatic changes toward redistribution of wealth and privilege to improve the lot of the poor

sovereignty many haitians charged the united states with discriminating against blacks by placing mulattoes in positions of power by 1932 the us withdrawal fro m haiti was well underway during the administration of herbert h oover because of growing concerns about the effects of the occupation president hoover had appointed commission 1930 to study the us involvement in haiti the commission concluded that while the occupation had brought about material impr ovements to haiti the us occupation also excluded haitians from positions of real authority in the government and the constabulary

aristide government4 hopes that haiti would leave behind its authoritarian past were raised on december 16 1990 when haitians elected pr esident national legislators and municipal officials despite security concerns and lack of democratic tradition voter turnout was estimated to be 70 percent on electi on day and international observers declared the elections generally free and fair the elections were in part the result of strong democratic moveme nt that had emerged in the late 1980s in support of an elected government that would establish order in nonrepressive manner the democratic movement encompassed many elements of haitian society including political parties as well as peasant labor human rights and professional organizations many observers also credited the success and relatively peaceful nature of the elections to the heavy pr esence of international observers whose presence the government of haiti had reque sted and to the ec onomic and material support provided by many nations and international organizations jeanbertrand aristide was elected presid ent with 675 percent of the vote and was inaugurated on the fifth anniversary of the collapse of the duvalier dictatorship 37yearold populist roman ca tholic priest he was the most controversial of 11 candidates ruled eligible to run by the independent provisional electoral council cep to his supporters aristide is ma rtyr willing to risk his life to defend the poor an advocate of liberation theology aristide spoke out against duvalier and the military rulers who followed him in september 1988 an armed group attacked and burned aristides church killing 13 and wounding 70 surrounded by his parishioners aristide escaped unharmed to his detractors aristide is potentially dangerous demagogue whose inflammato ry oratory they say encourages the rampages known as dechoukajes or uprooting in creole in which suspected tontons macoutes are attacked or killed by angry mobs aristide reportedly denies that his book 100 verses of dechoukaj condones violence nonetheless the salesian religious order expelled him fo r preaching politics from the pulpit including what the order called class struggle when aristide became candidate he toned down his revolutionary and anti us rhetoric aristide previously opposed democratic elections in haiti arguing that free and fair elections were impossible as long as duvalierists still had hold on economic and political power nonetheless he joined th race in response to former tontons macoutes chief roger lafontants potential candidacy lafontant was ruled ineligible to run for the presidency and in early january 1991 he led an attempted coup against presid ent trouillot in an effort to prevent aristid whom he called an ultracommuni st from taking office on february 7 1991 lafontant seized the national palace and tried to declare martial law instead the army arrested lafontant and promised to have him tried in the civilian courts the popular celebration that followed turn ed violent as crowds hunted down and lynched dozens of suspected macoutes mobs also burned down the 220year old cathedral in apparent reta liation for homily by the archbishop whose relationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs93931crs5 with aristide have long been tense that warned of coming regime of authoritarian politics many foreign diplomats criticized aristide for not condemning the street violence quickly or forcefully enough president aristide was faced with some of the most serious and persistent social economic and political problems in the western hemisphere after 8 months in office aristide had received mixed reviews he was credited with curbing crime in the capital reducing the number of employees in bloated state enterprises and taking actions to bring the military under civilian c ontrol but some observers questioned the new governments commitment to democracy neither aristide nor his prime minister belonged to political party and leaders of other political parties criticized him for not reaching out and establishi ng spirit of cooperation among the democratic elements many legislators including some from aristides own coalition protested the presidents appoi ntment of supreme court judges and ambassadors without consulting the senate as required by the constitution aristide later agreed to consult the legislature but relations between the two branches remained strained aristide was also criticized for his attitude toward the judicial system lafontant was tried in july 1991 for his role in the failed january coup atte mpt aristide called for life sentence which lafontant received although the constitution limited sentences to 15 years aristide declared the next day national holiday many observers expressed concern over the trial saying it di ffered little from trials under the duvaliers it lasted for over 20 cons ecutive hours important witnesses were not called and the court appointed five lawyer trainees to defend lafontant because even his own lawyer felt it too dangerous to defend him initially criticized for not having clear plan the aristide government in july 1991 presented macroeconomic reform nd public sector investment plan to representatives of several nations and international lending institutions who lauded the plan and pledged 440 million in fy1992 aid most of that aid was suspended because of the coup that overthrew ar istides government on september 30 1991 aristides human rights record in the area of respect for human rights president aristide also had mixed reviews he was criticized for appearing to condone mob violence but was also cred ited with significantly reducing human rights violations while he was in office some observers believe that as president aristide helped to polarize the situation in haiti by refusing to condemn violent acts of retribution and holding out the threat of mob violence against those who disagreed with him for example aristide refused to condemn the practice of pere lebrun or burning someone to death with necklace consisting of gaso linesoaked auto tire after the former head of the tontons macoutes was senten ced to life in prison aristide gave speech in which he noted that without popular pre ssure and the threat of pere lebrun in front of the courthouse the life ntence would not have been chosen

advocated lawful redress for abusepresident aristide d duty to refrain from any statement that could be understood to support pere lebrun and to speak out firmly and consistently against this barbaric practic his failure to fulfill this duty is serious blemish on his human rights record8 the report also reflected the views of many in the international community when it recognized president aristide as th sole legitimate haitian head of state elected with twothirds majority an unus ual mandate in the he misphere the report further stated while we recognize the need to correct the human rights shortcomings of the aristide government we believe firmly that these failings cannot be used to justify committing yet fu rther serious human rights violation by depriving the haitian people of the right to elect their government9 most human rights monitors credit the aristide government with being the first haitian government to address the need to improve respect for human rights and the needs of the poor majority they assert that progress made during his term was undone by the military regime that followe d most sources credit aristide with creating much greater sense of security in haiti than there had been in years he greatly reduced common crime in the city the removal of the chefs sections or sheriffs many of whom had ruled rural haiti through extortion and violence for decades

number over 1500 role of the military in the democratic process under the military dominated interim governments the haitian army frequently impeded the democratic process after the departure of the st military dictator in march 1990 however some observers believed there had been transformation of the army to one supportive of democracy throughout th 1990 electoral process the 7000man army proved itself capable of establishing and maintaining order several factors accounted for the change including attrition of antidemocratic elements with the downfall of the various interim governments the armys inability to form viable government new generation of officers inte rested in reform and professionalization of the armed forces and growing domestic and international pressure for civilian democracy initially the army accepted aris tides assertion of authority including his purge of the haitian army high co mmand brig general cedras who oversaw security for the december elections was reportedly reluctant participant in the coup but as its spokesman he said ar istide was ousted for meddling in army affairs some analysts argue the army doe s not want to relinquish control so that it can continue to profit from band and narcotic strafficking in its attempts to implement provisions of the haitian constitution that impose civilian authority over the military the aristide government met significant army resistance for example the constitution calls for the separation of the police from the army with the police under the command of the ministry of justice the law also mandates that cases involving military abuses against civ ilians be tried in civilian courts not by the military the military had resisted previous efforts to execute those laws military personnel were prosecuted for human rights abuses under any of the interim governments when he was overthrown aristide was opening an attack on corruption pressing reforms in the ar my and creating civilian police force the militarys trend toward improve d human rights under the aristide government was reversed after the coup according to the state departments 1991 human rights report that and other human
