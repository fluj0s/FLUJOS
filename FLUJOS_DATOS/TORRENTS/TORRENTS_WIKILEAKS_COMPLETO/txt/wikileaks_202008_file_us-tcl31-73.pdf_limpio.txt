army however none contributed quite as significantly as major general baron fredrick von steuben his contributions as general george washingtons inspector gene ral of the army instilled discipline and professionalism into an army that previously lacked formalized training his drill manual taken from the prussian army w as the backbone of the continental army throughout the revolutionary war as bene factor of advisors such as von steuben the us army has since undertaken th role of advisor on numerous occasions throughout its long and illustrious history sf soldiers frequently serve as advisors the advisory role is fundamental to successfully performing the sf core tasks of unconventional warfare uw and foreign internal defense fid the demand for sf soldiers to perform s advisors continues to grow and gain visibility the success enjoyed by sf advisors may be ttributed directly to the crosscultural skills gained during training and through multiple deployments and operations the capability of sf soldiers to perform effectiv ely as advisors in multinational joint interagency and interdependent envir onments represents unique and increasingly important contribution as such it is likely that sf will serve as combat advisors with increasing frequency this chapter discusses the development of sf advisors through uw fid counterinsurgency coin and coalition warfare and describes the peculiarities of each mission environment roles of the advisor 11 the sf military advisor has three roles involving different responsibilities and arousing differing loyalties which at times conflict first and foremost the advi sor is member of us military organization with welldefined chain of command and familiar res ponsibilities within this organization he receives and executes the orders of his superi ors which may not always be in acco rd with the orders his counterpart receives from his superiors he s upervises subordinate advisors among other duties he must act unobtrusively but nonetheless positivel as an inspector generalobser ving evaluating and reporting on the performance of his counterpart and the unit to which he is attached 12 secondly the sf advisor wears the shoulder insignia of the unit he advises both figurativel and quite often as in vietnam literally living eating and working with the officers and men of his host unit the sf advisor soon regards himself as one of them the sharing of common hardships and dangers forges between him and his native counter part potent emotional ties the success and good name of his unit become matters of prime and personal importance to the advisor 13 finally the advisor is interpreter and communicator between his counterpart and his us superiors and subordinates he must introduce and explain one to the other help resolve the myriad of problems misunderstandings and suspicions which arise in any human organization particularly when people of starkly different cultures approach difficult tasks toge ther as has been demonstrated often the sf advisor chapter 1 12 tc 3173 2 july 2008 who has quick and easy access to an influential counter part can sometimes be the best possible means of communicating with him 14 for an advisor to be effective he obviously must gain his counterparts trust and confidence this relationship however is only prelude to the advisors major objective inspi ring his counterpart to effective action in pursuing this goalconstantly relentless ly and forcefully yet patiently persuasively and diplomaticallythe advisor must recognize conditions whic h can benefit or handicap his cause advisor screening and selection 15 not every soldier is well suited to perform advisory functions although certain individua ls seem to instinctively possess the requisite skill set others must undergo exte nsive interpersonal training the selection and training process for sf is designed to optimize soldiers i nherent abilities through variety of training and operational expe riences because advisors operate in very subjective environments it is difficult to establish objective criteria by which to asses s potential advisors however research and experience indicate that there are several personality traits that greatly enhance the sf soldiers ability to adapt and thrive in foreign culture these traits include z tolerance for ambiguity z realistic goal and task setting z openmindedness z ability to withhold judgment z empathy z communicativeness z flexibility z curiosity z warmth in human relations z motivation of self and others z selfreliance z strong sense of self z tolerance for differences z perceptiveness z ability to accept and learn from failure z sense of humor 16 of the traits listed above single trait is paramount sf selection and training program s seek to develop an understanding of the c ontributions of each of them special forces advisors in unconventional warfare 17 since the deployment of jedburgh teams to occupied france during world war ii wwii sf soldiers have been cast into advisory roles conducted by with or through irregular forces arly uw focused on guerrilla groups operating in nonpermissive environments sf soldiers operating with guerrilla forces lacked institutional or positional authority as such these advisors had extremely limited leverage they often were required to establish credibility by proving t hat their potential contribution to the surrogate force exceeded the risks associated with their presence these advisors depended upon their persuasive personalities and crosscultural skills to influence outcomes and ensure personal survival the ability to influence in the absence of authority is distinguishing quality of the successful sf advisor as uw scenarios continue to evolve these skills become increasin gly important advisors in foreign internal defense 18 in keeping with the premise that solutions to internal proble ms must come from internal institutions the united states developed the concept of fid to support nations faced with internal instability this special forces as advisors 2 july 2008 tc 3173 13 interagency concept stresses us support as part of an indigenous program designed to counter the causes of instability such as lawlessness subversion or in surgency because of their uw and fidderived cross cultural communication and advisory skills sf have become mai nstay of us fid efforts 19 throughout the cold war sf were called upon to im plement their uw skills in actions spanning from vietnam to salvador although sf knowledge of guerrilla warfare gw was important in establishing their preeminent role in these counterinsurgent operations their uwderived advisory skills were equally important us doctrine recognizes that longterm victory against n insurgency cannot be externally imposed it must be accomplished thr ough legitimate indigenous gove rnments and forces 110 cold war coin environments generally were mo re permissive than wwii uw operations and the security of the us advisor was fa r less dependent on the i ndigenous force however the ability to leverage counterpart cooperation remained difficult and critical task alt hough coercion may prompt surrogate forces to perform specific action it can never lead to institutionaliza tion of proper conduct and legitimacy lasting longterm success may only be achie ved through the patient app lication of influence 111 operations in salvador provide noteworthy examples of sf advisors applying mature coin doctrine employing minimal leverage and extremely re strictive rules of engagement roe sf advisors played critical role in defeating the communist insurgency by conducting operati ons by with and through their salvadoran military count erparts the salvador model c ontinues to be used today in colombia for example the planning assistance training team patt has evolved from single sf advisor to 65man advisory assistance program that incorporates sf and conventional army forces as well as air force and marine corps personnel advisors in coalition warfare 112 the postcold war era generated corresponding reliance on coalitionsmany being formed very rapidly coalitions present unique challenges in gene rating unity of effort and may be accompanied by distrust among members more specifically member nations are often reluctant to surrender autonomy to single chain of command in order to facilitate operational inte gration and enhanced control of these coalitions special forces liaison elements sfles have been employed with nonus military organizations these liaison elements possess the ski lls to advise and influence coalition units thereby enhancing the control exercised by the coalition comman d structure sfles also facilitate operational integration of the total force although technical for example communications and tactical for example coordination of air support capabilities ar instrumental to their success it is the crosscultural and advisory capabilities of sf that provide the greatest influence special forces and interdependent operations 113 military operations are rapidly evol ving beyond joint interagency or multinational characterizations and toward interdependency inte rdependent operations require nearseamless integration of agencies representing all the elements of us national pow erdiplomatic informational military and economic this same degree of integration must be extended to include such external or ganizations as ngos igos and those agencies representing the various elements of power in partner states 114 sf advisors commonly operate in complex joint multinational an d interagency environments as such these soldiers generally are more experienced in integrating the diverse participants in interdependent operations than their conventional c ounterparts indeed the negotiation and crosscultural skills that enhance their performance as advisors are also w ell suited to the complex interrelationships that characterize such operations sf is uniquely suited to operate in the seams betw een these interdependent actors although portion of this suita bility can be attributed to organi zation and equipment the advisory and liaison skills resident in sf soldiers account for most of their effectiveness organizational relationships 115 although organizational relationships may be define d they can often be misleading and must be clarified the actual interrelationships between and within organizations seldom follow lineandblock chapter 1 14 tc 3173 2 july 2008 diagram instead they are heavily influenced by circumstances personalities perceptions and resources all relationships and lines of authority are subject to negotiation sf soldiers must understand that the defining of roles functions and responsibilities is continuous proce ss and that each statement or action sets precedent for future interrelationships organizational culture 116 sf soldiers should approach external organizations as they would foreign counterpartsas unique institutions with distinctive cultures organizational dif ferences biases and approaches must be researched andwhenever possibleaccommodate d other government agencies ogas igos and ngos often have aims and methods that greatly differ from sf units within the department of defense dod each service has unique perspectives that lead to significant differences in obj ectives and approaches to various problems profound differences in perspective may even be found between the different branches of the us army these characteristics if not recognized and accommodated may create distrust disharmony and disruption during critical operations for example the internal organizational process of t he department of state dos is often described as cultu re of negotiation in this environment the current situation is deemed starting point and the details of the end state are left to be determined through the negotiating process this thought m odel runs counter to the traditiona l us army approach of first defining the end state and then backward planning re sourcing and sequencing actions over time to achieve the predetermined objective 117 the sf soldier must become hypersensitive to the most minor rganizational disparities the apparent similaritiesthe common language sociological b ackgrounds and citizenship can be disarming and lead the sf soldier to overlook very real differences if ignored these differences quickly c an become impediments to synchronization compartmentalization 118 sf soldiers mustas described in the speci operations forces sof imperatives balance security and synchronization overcompartmentalizing must be avoided often distrust can be prevented simply by not being overly secretive although sf soldiers must conduct careful cont inual risk assessment to avoid compromise the sharing of critical information is necessary for harm onious operations perhaps the chief complaint of nonmilitary agencies is that their military counterparts continuously demand information without sharing data in return 2 july 2008 tc 3173 21 chapter 2 culture and communication culture plays crucial role in premission planning and the development of area assessments during the course of his career the sf soldier travels to numerous countries and experiences wide variety of cultures prior knowledge of cultural differences aids in building effective rela tionships and prevents embarrassment loss of rapport and compromise of the mission this chapter discusses the various aspects of culture and references the readers unders tanding of contemporary us culture to provide framework for analysis and comp arison of foreign cultures for operational purposes note statements made in this chapter regarding particular groups of people are broad generalizations although these generalizations are be lieved to be largely valid the intent is not to create stereotypes of different groups it is always prudent to acknowledge the uniqueness of individuals and subgroups when analyzing any foreign culture the importance of culture 21 sf teams and advisors often occupy very sensitive positions the commander acts as the direct representative of the usg as such the commander and his team mu st be diplomats as well as military advisors appendix provides checklists useful to the sf adv isor appendix b outlines important cultural considerations 22 in considering cultural awareness sf soldiers must observe t he first sof imperative understand the operational environment special operations so missions require deployment outside the continental united states oconus to operate with indigenous populations whose language and culture may be very foreign to most soldiers sf soldiers derive their effectiveness in larg part from their ability to understand and work with foreign counterparts this capability depends on cultural awareness the definition of culture 23 merriamwebsters collegiate dictionary eleventh edition defines culture as the integrated pattern of human knowledge belief and behavior that depends upon the capacity for learning and transmitting knowledge belief and behavior to succeed ing generations the customary beliefs social forms and material traits of racial religious or social group 24 in brief culture is the set of opinions beliefs values customs and mores that defines the identity of society it includes social behavior language and re ligion culture is learned behavior for example food is basic need that is not based on culture however how person cooks and what when and how they eat are all products of their cultural environment 25 culture is adaptive the customs that group develops are based largely on partic ular environment culture is integrated into every facet of society it is neither random jumble of quaint customs nor laundry list of dos and donts that traveler should know the physical environment and mass medi are two of the strongest driving forces in changing culture opinions may change fairly quickly where as beliefs are slow to change basic values are the slowest to change chapter 2 22 tc 3173 2 july 2008 the concept of culture 26 the fact that people learn culture is probably cultures most essential and defining feature many facets of human life are transmitted gene tically an infants desire for f ood for example is triggered by physiological characteristics determined within the human genetic code an adults specific desire for milk and cereal in the morning on the other hand is l earned that is cultural response to morning hunger the notion that milk and cereal is breakfast food and largely inappropriate for other meals is product of culture as body of learned behaviors common to given society human culture acts li ke template shaping behavior and consciousness within society fro m one generation to the next all learned behavior is in some degree determined by culture the concept of shaping template and body of arned behaviors can be broken down into the following categories z systems of meaning of which language is primary z ways of organizing society from kinship groups to states nd multinational corporations z distinctive techniques practiced by group and the characteristic products of these techniques 27 several important principles follow from this concept of culture systems of meaning or meani ng systems consist of negotiated agreements between members of human society rega rding the relationships between words behaviors or ot her symbols and their corresponding significance or meanings because meaning systems involve relationships that are not essential and universal for example the word door has essential connection to the physical object people simply agree to call th at object door in english different human societies will inevitably arrive at differe nt relationships and meanings 28 just as the process of learning is an essential characteristic of cu lture the process of teaching is crucial component because the relationship between what is taught and what is learned is not absolute that is some of what is taught is lost and new innovations are introduced culture is in constant state of change throughout most of human history cultural cha nges occur quite slowly taking place over period of many years in series of sl owmoving accommodations to new circum stances however in recent times number of rapid cultural changes have been introdu ced the attempt to assimilate these rapid changes often creates tension or even violence culture and the physical environment 29 the environment is the foundation of culture the bedouins of the arabian deserts provide classic example of how environment shapes culture in constant search for water the bedouins evolved culturally as nomadic herders of camels and goats the nomadic nature of their society conditions much of their belief system their social st ructure and even their diet because nomadic people cannot sustain positional warfare their concept of war is series of raids and skirmishes 210 learned culture serves as lens that filters all incoming informati on more importantly it helps individuals decide which information is important and what it means the system of meanings t hat constitutes culture can dramatically influence the way p eople perceive and make sense of the physical world around them information passes through this lens of culture and is filtered or interpreted into recognizable pattern human perspective regarding the surrounding environment is good example of th is the same physical object or environmental element can have widely divergent meanings when perceived through different cultural filters as described in the following examples 211 in the judeochristian cultural tradition rain served as tool of gods wrath although c ertain biblical narratives describe rain as blessing the old testament story of noah and the flood is familiar to nearly everyone in the western worl d consequently it has been very influential in establishing the place of rain and storm imagery in the cultural meaning system one result f this system of meaning is that images like thunder lightning wind and downpours tend to symbolize ominous things like anger danger and hardship in cultures that descend from the judeoch ristian tradition examples of this effect can be found throughout western legends and literature 212 unlike the judeochristian culture the anasazi peopl believed rain to be s acred the anasazi lived in the four corners region of the us southwest arizona colorado utah and new mexico n arid highdesert environment reliant upon the winter snow in the mountains to feed streams and springs culture and communication 2 july 2008 tc 3173 23 throughout the year and reliant on spring rain showers to supplement their strenuous irrigation effort s the anasazi culture came to view rain as gift from the rain god as result of this system of meaningin which rainfall symbolized the benevolence and generos ity of the natural worldanasazi tradition tends to represent rain in positive way 213 regardless of the region these systems of meaning operate as fil ter giving significance and meaning to the group members perceptions of the physical world around them cultural regions 214 the concept of cultural regions is widely accepted however there remains some disagreement about the number of regions and exactly what each region comprises countri and peoples within each region tend to have similar governments economic system s languages religions social organizations populations and resources the boundaries of these regions are neither permanent nor rigid for example although the countries of eastern europe are clearly part of the european cultural region th eir lengthy domination by the union of soviet socialist republics ussr left them with certain characteristics more typical of russia and the independent republics for purposes of this tc the world is divided i nto the following seven cultural regions z north america and europe including australia and new zealand z southwest asia and north africa z south and central america including mexico z subsaharan africa z pacific rim excluding the americas z russia and the independent republics z oceania the pacific islands subregions 215 each of the major regions listed above may be fu rther divided into subregions there may be two large very distinct culture groups within single region or even single country south africa for example has large populations of both european and subsaharan african cultures likewise australia has large populations of both european and aboriginal cultures other regions may have numerous cultural subregions for example south america may be divided into cultural subregions classified as tropical plantation europeancommercial amerindsubsistence and mestizofarming discontinuity 216 regions may be geographically discontiguousaustra lia and new zealand are considered to be in the european cultural region even though they are located on the opposite side of the globe additionally some geographically connected members attempt to separate the mselves from their cultural region for example brazil is part of the south and central american culture regio n however brazilians do not perceive themselves as hispanics the reason for this is that brazil wa s former colony of portugal and not spain therefore brazilians are from lusitanianand not hisp anictradition although this may appear minor point to certain outsiders it is considered very imp ortant distinction to brazilians as such brazilians may take offense at being referred to as hispanic or bei ng addressed in spanish subcultures 217 additionally all cultural regions have marginalized subcultu res that are typically quite different and distinct from the majority culture the montagnards in southeast as ia and native americans in the united states are two such subcultures often ignored or actively persecuted by the local government these types of subgroups may be particularly important to th sf advisor historically sf personnel often found themselves working with members of such marginalized groups chapter 2 24 tc 3173 2 july 2008 significance 218 recognition of culture is important because humans are social beings and have throughout history come together in groups these groups have developed unique characteris tics experience teaches that the more that people understand about other people and places the more th ey can enrich their own culture and the less likely they are to blunder in to conflict as the world becomes increasingly more accessible so are becoming more dependent on the ability of the special advisor to demonstrate an understanding of the rest of the world kluckhohn models 219 figures 21 through 27 pages 24 through 27 are simplifications of the kluckhohn value orientations method developed by florence kluckhohn and fred strodtbeck of harvard university two pioneers in the field of cultural anthropology they are generally referred to simply as kluckhohn models as presented here they represent sweeping generaliza tions about very large regions they are deliberate simplifications intended only to capture some of the basic cultural differences and similarities among cultural regions

component of culture 220 the baseline definition of culture indicates that learned behaviors are an essential component of culture learned behavior in this sense can mean almost anythingthe way pers on dresses the way they speak or the food they eat whenever individuals brush their teeth cross their legs send birthday cards kiss someone listen to music or choose form of recreation they are practicing learned behaviors that are part of their culture these learned behaviors encompass all asp ects of life and include attitudes toward z specific people such as family members l overs or spouses teachers and friends z authority figures such as military superiors or police officers z small social groups z large social groups z eating and food preparation z work or production z home building maintenance and cleaning z recreation and relaxation 221 behaviors do not always define culture frequently there are more telling cultural signs in the meaning attached to behavior than in the actual behavior for example one individual may use marijuana in amsterdam while another does the same in new rk city their behavior may be identical however the significance of that behavior is different in amsterdam where marijuana is l egal than in new york city where it is not similarly although many modern urban americans hunt the significance of hunting for them is very different than it is for the eskimo cultures above the arctic circle 222 the meaning systems that provide the context for learned behaviors overlap broadly with the meaning systems that constitute societys values and beliefs t his can be illustrated by the meanings assigned to various forms of recreation in american society recreation is not only set of pleasant pastimes it has meanings and associations attached th at go well beyond the simple activity itself table 21 illustrates how certain recreational activities ar associated with typical participants table 21 example of activities associat ed with different parts of society activity participants polo upper class including royalty male skateboarding blue or white collar teen or preteen male golf white collar male and female bowling blue collar male and female gymnastics white collar young female beliefs 223 beliefs can be said to take two forms values and opinions values are broad moral conclusions about the way life should be lived they reflect strong personal beliefs drawn from faith childhood environments and life experiences th ey lend shape and order to peoples lives helping them to decide if they settled on the right actions words behaviors friends ma tes leaders religions and careers values culture and communication 2 july 2008 tc 3173 29 are not easily changed opinions are immediate conclusions about some aspect of the nvironment they are usually quite specific and are susceptible to change 224 values and opinions are important because they guide the way that individuals deal with the world around them as deeply held beliefs about rightness va lues shape how individuals think things should be values may never be articulatedin fact they may not even be consciously he ld at times the beliefs of an individual may even contradict one another 225 many cultures believe that their internal values are universalthat every body knows right from wrong as they perceive it figure 28 depicts 20 values or qualities that are dmired by most americans those who do not accept these values often are viewed as deluded perverse or evil the sf advisor must strive to avoid this mindset in order to be successful advisors often must work with counte rparts with different or opposing values any time spent trying to ch ange counterparts basic values is time wasted furthermore such efforts are likel to create lasting resentment figure 28 twenty basic american values or qualities 226 advisors should have at least some understanding of counterparts value system values are usually nonnegotiable they are basic rules about what is right and wrong in dealing with counte rpart who has conflicting values it is typically best to pe rsuade the individual that the advocated action or behavior is not really in conflict with their values 227 the systems of values and opinions that are charact eristic of culture overlap significantly with the other components of culture these systems determine the cultural significance of even recreational pursuit like bowling in the learned behavior component and how religious belief systems can in tertwine with systems of social orga nization like political government 228 opinionvalue systems overlap so much with these other components of cultural systems largely because opinions and values play ch pervasive role in culture the baseline definition of culture suggests that culture consists essentially of learned behaviors and the templateeffect by which growing changing culture is passed on from gene ration to generation because beliefs affect virtually every learned behavior the cultural template consists to significant degree of belief systems thus belief systems are central component of the larger cultural systems in which they exist chapter 2 210 tc 3173 2 july 2008 229 belief systems involve stories and myths the interpretation of these storie s and myths provides people with insight into how they should feel think and behave the elaborate polytheis tic mythologies of the ancient greek and roman civilizations are good examples of belief systems th at influenced the daily lives of the societies members th most prominent systems of beliefs tend to be those associated with formal religions however any system of belief in which the interpret ation of stories impacts peoples behavior for example system of superstitions can be contributing component of societys culture 230 value systems differentiate those feelings thoughts and behaviors considered right from those considered wrong value systems often develop from larger belief systems in the united states for example the value system behind the good samarita n law which is designed to protect citizens from being sued when they help in an emergency is direct descendant of the christian belief s ystem 231 religion plays fundamental role in the development of societys values careful ana lysis of regions religious systems is crucial to understanding the local value system r eligious doctrine stories and myths provide enormous insight into the culture of the com munity typically these religious elements explain why life is the way it is and suggest the valu that the community hol ds dear ultimately the values which are most prized within system of religious beliefs affect that cultures systems of social organization their learned behaviors and th eir relationship to the physical environment systems of social organization as an element of culture 232 one common characteristic of human societies is that they tend to become increasingly organized over time initially most societies or elements of society exist s smallscale systems or microsystems such organizations might include family groups work teams or communal groups that share tasks nd products as societies become larger and more advan ced largescale systems or macrosystems of social organization usually develop 233 systems of social organization grow out of their host culture and simultaneously change t he host culture by becoming deeply embedded within it the organizing systems that s ociety devises or has imposed upon it become part of the system of cultural meanings for that society for example in us culture the basic premise is that all people are cr eated equal and can advance according to their own merits the us economic system then allots certa in value to each persons productive role therefore citizens often are judged by the outward tokens of their advancement and value such as houses cars clothes and leisure pursuits the organizational systems are in this sense insepara ble from the cultural meaning systems one cannot fully understand one without understanding the other family 234 the term family refers to groups of individuals that are linked by bloodrelation in less formal way it may also be used to indicate group of persons who live and work together in order to satisfy basic collective needs and goals the role of the family is to care for and educate offspring the family provides for such needs as food shelter and clothing and prepares offspring to be functional members of the society in which they live 235 the concept of family is heavily steeped in religious and other cu ltural norms the family is one of the most influential elements of social institutions it is the starting point for the development of all other forms of social organization families teach human beings what is demanded of them in the real world it is within the family unit where humans learn to transcend themselves persons first experiences with power and authority occur with the family 236 it is important for the sf advisor to remember that counterparts are equally affected by the fa mily although it may be in very in different ways even if counterparts may have similar cultural values and norms they will act upon those values and norms differentlyeach in accordance with differing family values culture and communication 2 july 2008 tc 3173 211 religion 237 religion is more than just belief in deity it is philosophy and way of life religion can define who people are how they view the world around them and how they interact in every society peopl have searched for the meaning of life the need to understand why things happen and what will happen in the future is an ongoing epic that continues to shape peoples beliefs and values religion as component of culture 238 religion is component of culture at its most basic level religion is bot h the individual and communal expression of contact with supernatural forces although it is common for individual pract ice to be considered important most religious people also choose to meet with others of si milar beliefs expressing common religious understanding helps people to make sense of the events and issues of their world by providing explanations for human suffering natural disa sters broken relationships inequality between mankind and death religions provide pe rspective that describes life beyond the grave 239 all societies have some variety of religiontypically set of sacred beliefs and rituals that control the members by providing common understanding of mo ral codes and proper conduc t not all religions have supernatural basis the marxismleninism ideology is often cited as cular belief that has all the salient characteristics of religion including the demand for faith similarl some contemporary forms of environmentalism are nearly indistinguishable from an cient forms of earth worship and incorporate forms of priesthood and the recognition of godlike earth 240 if society is insulated for long enough the beliefs and customs tend to become harmonious and interdependent however these concepts frequently ppear to lose their infl uence when changes occur rapidly and frequently for example contemporary social problem in western society is t he breakdown of common understandingsparticularly moral understandingsbrought about by the last 50 years of rapid societal transformation in other cases these beliefs may become stronger more funda mental and more extreme in the face of significan t change as in the case of segments of islamic and hindu societies in the past 30 years these beliefs may then clas h with more modern and secular approaches 241 in simple agricultural communities such as the aboriginal so cieties of the northern philippines everyone tends to do part of all essential activities and eve ryone tends to have similar views of life the activities and behavior of any one man or woman is i ndistinguishable from any other man or woman in the community in such societies each man performs the same rituals for th security of the crops and for sense of inner wellbeing the concept of gods and th notions of good and bad conduct are very much the same for everyone in the community an advisor w ho learns about any one member of such society learns great deal about every member that entire society 242 in complex societies the division of labor is high single person does more than small part of necessary tasks the people who participate in this division of labor are not homogeneous as i s the case with more selfsufficient prim itive societies because single pe rson understands the entire process individuals rely upon one another to accomplish tasks the ideas and understandings of any one member of an advanced society do not have the completeness th at is typical of more selfsufficient society 243 because religion is such an integral part of cu lture careful mission preparation and analysis should examine the religions and religious groups in the area of operations ao for given sion most of the people of our world practice religion and many take it very seriously religious beliefs leaders and institutions are central to the worldview of many societies the impact of religion on the local population must be considered when planning any operation common religious themes 244 for purposes of this tc it is impracticalif not impossibleto inc lude an indepth analysis of every world religion although each re ligion has different be liefs number of adhere nts and spheres of influence most religions share six common dimensions the six dimensions are z doctrine z myth chapter 2 212 tc 3173 2 july 2008 z ethics z ritual z experience z social organization doctrine 245 religious doctrine is the collection of teachings of faith tradition doctrine permits religious groups to reference their beliefs and pass them on to ot hers it provides body of teaching that can be communicated to successive generati ons the monotheistic traditions suc h as judaism christianity and islam are replete with doctrine these faiths utilize sacr ed texts not only to record their doctrine but also as primary bases of authority other belief systems such as animism have little if any formal doctrine myth 246 it is important to understand that in the academic fi eld of religious studies the term myth carries overtone of falsehood the religious connotation of myths describes the na rrative stories of faith tradition that capture the truths of common belief among believers most religions have myths th at share the essence of their beliefs with others alt hough many religious myths appear prim itive they can be very effective tools in passing on the primary content of faith traditions such stories serve as effec tive vehicles to remember truths and events ethics 247 moral codes and ethics provide faith traditions with justification of their prohibitions of certain behaviors or beliefs all groups need boundaries to gove rn their participants moral codes provide these boundaries within religion groups the term ethics describes the deliberate justif ication of how group labels actions as either moral or immoral ritual 248 most religions make sacred certain spaces times pe rsons things and events in worship in this context sacred means holy separate or special relig ions attempt to affect transactions between humans and the supernatural forces rituals are the evidence of thes transactions and represent the collective and accepted ways of approaching this in teraction they are repeated in sequence and kind for continuity sacred persons and symbols have power and value within faith traditions experience 249 religious individuals and groups report that their traditions pr ovide vivid and sting experiences with the supernatural forces participants believe with conviction that they experience the supernatural and also transcend this worlds limita tions to reach heights of knowledge bliss insight and understanding many traditions offer trancelike escapes from the problems of the world and allow individuals to experience temporary exposure to realms beyond this world social organization 250 religions provide individuals an understanding or explanation of the supernatural religious traditions unite individuals into groups and instituti onalize their collective faith in social forms for example organizations or congregations with established hierarchies broad impact of religion 251 in almost every society the followers of the dominant religious traditions have strong societal impact this influence may be exerted at varying grees upon the individual citizen sections of society the economy the military and the po litical structure and environment culture and communication 2 july 2008 tc 3173 213 individual impact 252 religions impact individuals by addressing ageold questions bout identity and purpose these questions of identity and purpose provide challenges to an individuals perspective religions provide the framework to answer these questions and provide pe rsonal moral codes for behavior some religions may provide sense of hope while others impart feelings of resignation social impact 253 religions help to define community for subgroups of larger societies the belief systems of religious groups provide the normative codes of conduct for group members religions can serve to legitimize or disqualify leaders of society based on their practices and personal lifestyle religions often serve as the primary collectors and maintainers of scholarship capable of weathering social cha nge many religions and their institutions provide degree of stability in the midst of shifting influence among other groups economic impact 254 practically every religion addresses the means in which their adherents should acquire use and distribute their resources participants are challenged with n obligation to care for the less fortunate and to support the collective effort of spreading their beliefs religions impact taxation banking and employment practices by dictating acceptable and prohibited forms of work and levels of profit religious tenets are considered in the formation of international agreements and often influence foreign economic policy military impact 255 religions may describe acceptable military conflic ts military service and the treatment of noncombatants and enemy prisoners of war epws religions enable groups to view their enem ies as evil and their conflicts as mandated by divine force many conflicts ar ise when groups are not permitted to practice their beliefs without restriction religions help to define the reasons why and when certain conflicts are deemed acceptable for ex ample christianitys just war theory and how these conflicts should and should not be fought political impact 256 religions may influence the rise or fall of political leaders polic ies and issues even in secular systems where the separation of chur ch and state are widely accepted nd enforced religious groups often wield tremendous political power many societies struggle to balance the desire to permit religious expression with the unwillingness to promote every relig ious group as valid political elites may practice religion that is different from the majority of th population as such leaders often face scrutiny from religious groups for their beliefs and practices in some nationstates re ligious groups form political parties and are awarded seats of representation in the pa rliamentary governmental bodies based on number of adherents the study of religion for operational purposes 257 sf soldiers should approach the analysis of religious groups in an ao by remaining object ive and keeping an open mind soldiers may draw from their experience but they should avoid judgmental conclusions that reveal an attitude of superiority thorough analysis should address the interaction of religious groups within and beyond the ao and the potential impact of these groups upon the ssion and the force 258 religious area studies should begin with review of the history of the predominant re ligions in the region and the ao planners should attempt to trace th growth influence and changes that religious groups made over time as general rule the fo llowing periods of history

analysis should address how religious groups weathered social movements global conflicts and the postcolonial creation of nationstates it is often possible to ca tegorize the winners and losers of conflict by their religious groups becau religious conflict with violent dimension is typically virulent and longlasting planners must analyze the historical perspective to fully understand the positions taken by religious groups nd leaders additional factors that should be addressed in religious area study are described in figure 29 pages 214 and 215 history or background attempt to

civilizations one of the systems of social organizati on that typically develops and grows in complexity is government throughout history formal government or the state is most often associated with urban civilizations where the economy supported numerous spe cializations city growth resulted from sustainabl agriculture and technol ogical development and as cities developed social hierarchies emerged with identifiable elites the increasing complexity of life in large communities required state organization 261 states are formed as result of number of factors working together for example as population grows in specific region competition for space and res ources also grows eventua lly the need arises to create more complex organizations to govern effectively the groups that organize most ffectively to improve or to defend themselves gain an importa nt advantage over their neighbors another common contributing factor is the specific challenges or opportunities presented by the environment for example dry but fertile flood plain might s upport widescale food production when properly irrigated and large irrigation project is best done by state 262 the ruling class must establish that the rule of the group or individual in power is beneficia l right and necessary or unavoidable rulers often attempt to establish c ultural association between the leadership position and the values of the dominant local relig ion 263 unlike the federal government of the united states many countries have only single c entral government and all governmental entities are extensions of it generally such governments have the three following levels z national government z several regional entities for example states cantons districts s ectors or provinces z numerous municipalities 264 regional and municipal levels of government ve independent authority and may not for example levy taxes or establish budgets each level is an administrative extension of the next higher level the fact that members of local government are locally elected does not make th em independent of the national central government which exercises its authority through the sector or province 265 likewise military authority may or may not be ex ercised directly by th central government in some cases the midlevel governmental chief or even the senior municipal authority may have military command authority in other instances the military is largely indepe ndent of civilian control at any level cultural indoctrination 266 the value of cultural indoctrination is best introduced through sample of quotes from anonymous sf participants in various operations they emphasize the value of cultural indoc trination and sensitivity training in so and especially counterpart relations chapter 2 216 tc 3173 2 july 2008 cultural indoctrination you have to learn about the count rys history the customs the way of life things that make the country tick then you can deal with them you cant go in there and expect them to do things your way if you show you understand them respect their ways and treat them fairly theyll be easy to negotiate with youll win their trust you need to get feel for the native sensib ilities to be functionally effective in community you need to understand the nuances you dont have to be sympathetic in terms of being politically inclined to t heir view but you have to be able to absorb why they are fighting honor and face mean everything here t he volume and tone of your voice are important you could lose face quickly if you lost ur patience with an interpreter or got overly emotional about anything t he respected buddhist way was to be calm gentle low tone in your voice 267 culture determines persons perception of the wo rld the manner in which each culture views its surroundings may differ greatly from place to place areas that tend to have the greatest variation of cultural viewpoints include z family z gender roles z individualism versus group emphasis z age z friends z status z hygiene z personal space z time z education z gestures 268 in most cultures ideology leads individuals to see an ideal vers ion of their own culture rather than the one that really exists for example there is very large gap between the american culture perceived by us residents and the perception held by the rest of the world likewise as foreigners sf soldiers may view the hostnation hn culture through the prism of their own idealized culture this creates large gap between the culture sf soldier s ees and the hns real culture program of cultural indoctrination 269 the general theme of cultural indoctrination should be to gain the trust of the local people by demonstrating an understanding and sensitivity to wards their culture summary of training recommendations is provided in figure 210 page 217 270 an awareness of the cultural asp ects of the ao can significantly nhance the effectiveness of an advisor an extensive study program is best but even concise program is worthwhile if it provides cultural indoctrination the best programs involve credible speakers with personal expe rience in the country also the training process should be dynamic and move beyond the standard lecturewithhandout format for example small groups or discussion pane l are most effective cultural behavior and cultural familiarization handbooks can be extremely useful b ecause such handbooks vary greatly in accuracy and quality subjectmatter expert s should be consulted to determine wh ich handbooks to incorporate into the cultural study program

cultural training recommendation 271 the vast majority of those with operational experience stress the importance of c ultural indoctrination training many civilia n us agencies such as the unite d states agency for international development usaid have developed intercultura l effectiveness programs designed for their personnel working overseas often these programs can be revise d and tailored for military and paramilitary groups if available these programs are an excellent resource for predeployment preparation note it is possible for soldiers to try so hard to absorb every detail about new culture or country that they will actually suffer from effects similar to culture shock even though the individual has not yet left their home station cultural training should be thorough but not overwhelming cultural awareness 272 the crosscultural communications capabilities required to perfo rm as an effective advisor to foreign counterpart can be described in three levels at the lowest level is awareness followed by knowledge the highest level is reached when these tw are combined with welltrained and refined skills chapter 2 218 tc 3173 2 july 2008 awareness 273 awareness is the basic level of crosscultural capability awa reness of cultural differences and their impact is the first prerequisite fo r successful work with counterpart simply being sensitive to the fact that differences exist and carefully observing actions and reactions can assist the sf soldier in adjusting behavior and modifying actions to achieve greater influence with the counterpart awareness is not region specific and can be instilled in sf soldiers with relatively litt training knowledge 274 knowledge of the details and nuances of specific target culture is the nex t level of crosscultural capability this second level is attained through co mbination of academic study and immersion such knowledge is inherently areaspecific and does not transfer from one target area or culture t another developing the indepth area or regional knowledge n ecessary for effective cr osscultural communication requires an extensive and timeconsuming training regimen and should be supported by appropriate personnel assignment policies skills 275 skills fundamental to effective crosscultural communications when combined with awarene ss and knowledge form the highest level of crosscultura l capability although some individuals show greater natural talent for these skills than others all sf soldiers require tinual training in each in order to achieve and retain their full potential as adviso rs to foreign counterparts these skills are z professional competence z language z nonverbal communication z negotiation z interpersonal skills z observation z problem solving z leadership z instructional techniques z fitness z regionspecific skills professional competence 276 given the nature of the sf missions professional competence is critical to personal credibility without high degree of credibility advice is likely to be disregarded demonstrated professional competence in one area leads to presumption of co mpetence in other areas including some that may not be directly related additionally operational experienceparticularly successful combat experienceis extremely useful as this is universally considered hallmark of professional military competence as with all experience however sf soldiers must be careful not to overstate the applicability of their particular experienceforeign counterparts may consider this si mple bragging sf soldiers as the armys quiet professionals must take balanced approach to conveying experience to counterparts unit training programs should stress the following subjects and assist in relating them to the sf soldiers target region and culture z technical and tactical expertise z thorough knowledge of command and staff processes z sound theory of conventiona l and unconventional warfare z solid basic soldier skills for example marksmanship and map readi ng z personal fitness culture and communication 2 july 2008 tc 3173 219 language 277 language is fundamental to crosscultural communications the greater the proficiency in the local language the more easily quickly completely and accu rately the sf soldier can communicate complete timely and accurate communications are fundamental to mission success reaching level that permits the advisor or liaison to understand nuan ces and inferred or implied message s vastly enhances communications capabilities proficiency in the use of an interpreter can be substitu ted for language ability however matter how skillfully an interpreter is employed their use alw ays diminishes the capability to effectively and confidently communicate both language proficie ncy and the proper use of interpreters require significant training appendix c discusses the use of interpreters and translators 278 the perceived commonality of language may be mislead ing in many situati ons what an individual thinks they said is not what they actually did say likewise an individual may hear something that was not said or intended to be said each organization has its own unique jargon and has its own interpretation of key words and phrases sf soldiers must learn these variances and use terms and phrases appropriately body language is of equal importance what one orga nization perceives as poise may be interpreted by another as carelessness formalities accepted in one orga nization as normal courtesi might be viewed by other organizations as overly rigid and limiting the sf soldier should not automatically dopt the other organizations norms however they must remain cognizant of the impact those norms have upon th members interpretations of words and actions nonverbal communication 279 deliberate use of nonverbal communication that is gestures posture and positioning can be taught the use of nonverbal communications together with culturespecific knowledge enhances verbal communication and understanding incorrect or improper use of gestures or other nonverbal signals can inhibit communication destroy relationships and even result in mission failure although simp awareness of the impact of nonverbal communications provides some level of preparation to the sf advisor detailed regional and cultu ral training in their use is essential because most nonverbal communication occurs spontaneously and subconsciously repetitive practical exercises should be integral to any sf training program negotiation 280 typically advisors lack institutional or positional authorit they must negotiate effectively with their counterparts sometimes from position of relativ weakness to persuade them to take desired actions the skill of negotiation is dealt with extensively in chapter 4 interpersonal skills 281 interpersonal skills are effective techniques used to establish c ordial and mutually respectful relationships between two or more people such t echniques are employed in facetoface settings whether oneonone or in small groups they include tact tole rance of individual idiosyncrasies or cultural norms conversational skills personal hygien and courtesy training in interpersonal skills requires formal instruction but is easily integrated into training designed to acco mplish other objectives observation 282 advisors depend on their ability to observe and interpret their nvironment including their counterparts actions and reactions noting details of the setting nd activities framing an exchange with counterpart as well the nuances of the counterparts response can provide degree of understanding that leads to mission success recollection of such details and nuances fac ilitates postencounter analysis to capture what occurred and to enhance future exchanges other c rosscultural skills such as negotiation also rely heavily on the ability to observe accurately and comprehens ively like interpersonal skills training in the techniques of effective observation and recollection lends itself to integration into other training chapter 2 220 tc 3173 2 july 2008 problem solving 283 advisors must develop and employ keen problemsolving skills templates or solutions developed in advance are seldom adequate in dynamic and unpr edictable circumstances doctrinally accepted us tactics techniques and procedures ttp must be adapted and artic ulated in culturally acceptable and supportable terms problemsolving skills and confidence in ones own problemsolving abilities improve significantly with training leadership 284 basic leadership skills when prope rly adapted to the counterparts culture are very effective emphasis however should be on peer leadership t echniques leadership t echniques based on positional authority or other forms of coercion are of limited us to advisors and generally have longterm negative effects sf soldiers must be trained to employ leadership techniques appropriate t their role as advisors and to specific regions and cultures instructional techniques 285 advisors must be competent in both formal and informal methods of instruction once again these methods must be carefully analyzed and adapted based on cultural norms and practices n emphasis on informal methods of instructionparticularly those that are or appear to be cooperativea re most effective in crosscu ltural communications fitness 286 physical skills and the resulting personal fitness can be critica l to personal and professional credibility when dealing with military counterparts fatigue reduces overall capability diminishes perceptiveness impairs thought processes and impedes crosscultural communication phys ical training programs are readily adaptable to the requirements of given target culture and region regionspecific skills 287 as knowledge of given culture is developed cer tain activities or capabilities may emerge as critical to crosscultural communications and effective count erpart relations for example some level of proficiency in popular local sport may help estab lish interpersonal relationships that permit more effective communication and greater influence soccer is an example of widely played sport more localized examples include horseback or camel riding swimming trapping or even singing danc ing and playing musical instruments small investments in skills seem ingly unrelated to military mission requirements can provide disproportionately high returns in influence operational planning assi stance and training teams in salvador the operational planning and assistance tr aining team opatt mission required less than half of the 55 trainers permitted in countrygenerally fewer than 20 with such small number of advisors allowed for the mission and with six brigades to support it was critical to ensure that only qualified officers and noncommissioned officers ncos were assigned to the teams this was relatively easy with the oi operations and intelligence etss extended training service specialist positions which were filled in less than 6 months fr om the field of experienced senior ncos and warrant officers or wos from the 3rd battalion 7th sf gro up most sf senior ncos and wos had oi educ ation and experience and they were capable linguists as the result of both formal training and

region from numerous mobile training teams mtts in salvador and hondura s and significantly most had worked professionally with each other in past assignments cecil bailey opatt the us army sf advisors in salvador culture shock and adaptation 288 the term culture shock was first introduced in 1958 to describe the anxiety experienced by persons in completely new environment this term expresses the lack of direction t he feeling of not knowing what to do or how to do things in new environment and not knowing what is appropriate or inappropriate the feeling of culture shock generally ts in after the first 2 weeks of arriving in new environment the period of adjustment lasts approximately 6 months for most people 289 culture shock occurs because the mind and body have to go through peri od of psychological and physiological adjustment when individuals move from fa miliar environment to an unfamiliar one the cues received by all of the senses suddenly change during the day the foreigner is bombarded with unfamiliar sights sounds smells tastes languages gest ures rules requirements interactions demands systems and expectations 290 at nighteven during sleepthe brain continues to process unrecognizable sounds the nose continues to detect unfamiliar odors and the stomach continues to process unfamiliar foods even dreams seem to contain new and unfamiliar features and characte rs culture shock encompasses the cumulative effect of all of these stresses further psychological disorientation is brought about when values held absolute are brought into question b ecause of cultural differences sold iers tend to grow particularly frustrated when they are expected to function with maximum profici ency in situations where the rules have not been adequately explained 291 over time individuals have choice but to adapt to their environment there are two probl ems associated with this acclimation first the spoken rules of culture such as fa vored foods may not be simple or pleasant to adopt second the unspoken rules of culture may be difficult to ident ify although the native members of culture know all the rules they may not be capable of ade quately articulating those rules newcomers may need to be resourceful in order to extract the most basic informati on about why things are done in certain way and at certain time 292 foreign societies may also have culturebased xpectations that are unknown to the newcomer such expectations frequently surface during first few months in new country it is extremely stressful for soldiers to know that there are mu ltiple expectations at every turn and not know exactly what those expectations are or how to fulfill them psychologists agree th is stress is major contributor to culture shock 293 as described in preceding paragra phs culture shock is not the resu lt of single event rather the condition develops slowly from series of minor events or conditions both the causes and the effect s may be difficult to identify furthermore because the human reactions ar emotional they are not easily controlled by rational management 294 some of the differences that sf soldiers experi ence between their lives at their home station and their lives when deployed to foreign location ar obvious these differences include language climate religion food educational system and the absence of family and friends other di fferences may not be as obvious these differences include how people make deci sions spend their leisure time resolve conflicts express their emotions and use their hands faces and bodies to express meaning chapter 2 222 tc 3173 2 july 2008 295 being immersed in society with extreme cultural differences tends to cause feelings of uncertainty and anxiety the body and mind may react in unus ual ways some persons may experience more pronounced physical symptoms of stress such as chronic headaches or upset stomachs although uncomfortable some degree of culture shock is normal part of the adjustment process some c ommon reactions include z feeling irritable with or even anger toward ones own group or organization z feeling isolated or alone z tiring easily z changing normal sleep patterns either too much sleep or not enough z suffering minor but persistent body pains especially in the head neck back and stomach z experiencing feelings of hostility and contempt toward local pe ople z withdrawing from the local population that is spending excessive amounts of time alone reading or listening to music recognizing culture shock 296 there are four distinct stages in the culture shock process figure 211 page 223 some analysts include fifth stage known as reentry shock stage 1enthusiasm 297 stage 1 is best described as the incubation period in this stage the new arrival may feel self confident and pleasantly challenged he or she may be delighted by all of the new things encountered this is the honeymoon period everythi ng is new and exciting stage 1 ty pically lasts about 2 weeks stage 2withdrawal 298 in stage 2 person begins to counter difficulties and minor but nnoying crises in daily life it may be difficult to make oneself understood the situation encountered may not be what was origin ally expected local nationals may prove more difficult to d eal with than once anticipated in th is stage there may be feelings of discontent impatience anger sadness and even incompeten ce these symptoms occur in proportion to how different the new culture is from the culture of origin the transition between the old methods and the new is difficult process that takes tim to complete during this transition there can be strong feelings of dissatisfaction stage 3reemergence 299 stage 3 is characterized by gaining some understanding of the new culture renewed feeli ng of pleasure and sense of humor may be experienced one may begin to feel certain psychological ba lance the new arrival may not feel as isolated and feeling of direction emerges the individual is mo re familiar with the environment and is better able to belong this process initiates an evaluati on of old ways versus new ways stage 4achievement 2100 in stage 4 the person realizes that the new culture has both good and bad things to offer this stage is one of integration the person is increasingly able to function in the new setti ng sense of accomplishment reduction of routine annoyances and more solid sense of belonging accompany this integration reentry the fifth stage 2101 some analysts include fifth stagereentry shock this occurs when the individual returns to the united states one may find that things are not as th ey once were or how they are remembered changes that occurred in the persons absencetheir family their friends their c ommunities and themselves combine to present distorted imag of home that differs greatly from the one imagined or remembered culture and communication 2 july 2008 tc 3173 223 figure 211 stages of culture shock culture shock symptoms 2102 the stages of culture shock may be present at di fferent times in different people and different people react differently to each stage as consequence some stages ma last longer and be more difficult than others many factors contribute to the duration and effects of culture shock for example the s tate of mental health the type of personality previous xperiences socioeconomic conditions familiarity with the language family and social support systems and the level of education all contribute to an individuals reaction to culture shock common symptoms 2103 certain symptoms of culture shock are fairly common and less severe such typica l symptoms include z homesickness z boredom z lethargy z withdrawal z irritability z hostility z irrational anger z gastrointestinal distress z disruption of normal sleeping patterns chapter 2 224 tc 3173 2 july 2008 less common symptoms 2104 other symptoms of culture shock present more serious threat to the individuals phys ical psychological and emotional health and may compromise the success of the mission s ymptoms of acute culture shock mirror those produced by other forms of stress and include z sadness or depression z loneliness z preoccupation with health z allergylike symptoms z feelings of vulnerability z anger irritability resentment and an unwillingness to interact with others z

may experience real pain from culture shock it is also an opportunity for learning and for acquiring new perspectives culture shock can make one devel op better understanding of oneself and stimulate personal creativity 2106 one of the most important tools to overcome the obstacles f new environment is familiarity with the language an ability to co mmunicate in the new culture even at the most

sold iers should recognize that they too will make successful adjustment to the new culture stress 2107 comprehensive analysis of the complex nature of stress associated with sf depl oyments is beyond the scope of this tc instead this tc provides synopsis of historical stress fac tors and experiences review and comparison of acute and chronic stress and training recommendations designed to help counter the effect of stress on deployed personnel sources of stress 2108 sf deployments are inherently stressful features that may individually or collecti vely lead to stressrelated problems include z working in dangerous environment where an atmosphere of underlying tension is common for example local people in the ao may have been killed or injured law order and respect for human rights may be minimal and hostile attitudes by local peo ple may pervade z not being deployed or serving as formed unit for example some teams may deploy as sma ll group of individuals from various units once in theater these contingents may be further divided and deployed to different regions z being immersed in foreign culture adapting to cultural differences re quires soldiers to adjust not only to the culture of the mission area but also to the varied foreign nationals working with the unit this can include allied or coalition personnel not from the area z facing challenging deployment of short duration outside ones normal experience and terms of reference sf personnel are expected to be effective within short time of arriving in the ater the need to adapt and learn quickly is major source of stress acute stress 2109 acute stress is experienced when an individual is involved with or witnesses unexpe cted abnormal situations or incidents that are outside the realm of ones normal experience depending on the individual varying range of emotions accompanies these type s of experiences for example anger frustration or guilt critical incidents of this nature are not comm on however certain individuals experience symptoms of acute stress psychological firstaid that is individual and group pproaches to chapter 2 226 tc 3173 2 july 2008 dealing with mission stressors is fundamental to initial adaptation and effective ongoing performa nce common triggers of acute stress include z investigating massacres where wome n and children had been murdered z tending to emergencies and accide nts involving seri ous injuries z being exposed to mutilated bodies chronic stress 2110 chronic stress describes the result of experienci ng cumulative daytoday stressors from range of sources stressors may be environmental such as soldier attempting to ad just to extreme heat foreign diet or different cultural nor ms stress may result from restricted authority such as when soldier lacks any power of arrest where laws and internationa l moratoriums are blatantly disregarded soldiers tend to feel stress when working with bur eaucracies that are burdened with in efficient procedures and crippled by the lack of motivated missionoriented personnel other chronic stressors may be orga nizational such as being forced to work on small isolated patrol elements with members who are not team players who lack commitment to the mission or who disrespect the local people stress management 2111 leaders must recognize the unique potential sources of stress confronting sf personnel missi on specific stressors must also be addressed once the sources of stress are identified leade rs must develop knowledge of individual and group signs and symptoms for both chroni c cumulative and acute critical incident stress after thoroughly understanding the sources and symptoms of common stressors leaders must strive to understand individual and team copi ng strategies and techniques common stressreduction techniques include postpatrol team discu ssions and afteraction stress debriefings 2112 effective stress management programs enable comma nders to more effectively care for soldiers while accomplishing the mission the desired end state of stress management includes the following z operational effectiveness is enhanced due to improved ability to cope with various intheater stressors z individual and group stressors are recognized and addressed at an early stage z healthier and more realistic attitudes toward stress are develope d z cohesion and morale are improved when the team is viewed as support net by its members 2113 stress management is skill that must be trained there are nume rous techniques to develop and enhance group and individual coping t echniques panel discussions in which personnel recount stressful aspects of previous deployments and how they were addressed can be particularly effective panel facilitator with expertise in stress education can gui the discussion and high light key teaching points briefings that address scenarios typical of th mission area can also be valuable tools note commanders should strive to have unit pers onnel with recent experience discuss stressful scenarios and coping techniques the camaraderie felt among members of the same unit contributes to more credible and dynamic training process crosscultural communication 2114 communication is the transfer of messages from one person to the next these messages ma be passed along verbally in writing or by signals in essence the nder encodes the message and the receiver decodes it the type and st yle of encoding used is based upon th senders history beliefs values prejudices attitudes and preferences 2115 the receiver decodes messages based upon lifesty group membership and rank worldview status language and social practice communication is twoway process in which the encoding and decoding methods can affect both sending and receiving culture and communication 2 july 2008 tc 3173 227 2116 effective communication occurs when the message is perceived and responded to in the manner that the sender intended ineffective communication primarily occurs from poorly chosen words fla wed timing confused mixture of verbal and nonverbal signals poor listening skills and communication noise communication noise describes the influences that detract from effective communic ation bridging the cultural gap 2117 each culture has its own rules regarding who person may speak to how and when the person may speak and what topics the person may speak about many cultures rely heavily on nonve rbal signals to communicate in such cultures posture expression and actions convey more than spoken or written words 2118 language is the ultimate communication barrier the successful adviso r should study at minimum common phrases in the hns language add itionally advisors must recognize that there are topics of conversation that should be avoided whenever possible for example re ligion politics ideology and personal questions developing sense of cultural awareness 2119 advisors must recognize they are product of their own culture they must learn as much as possible about the culture of the people with whom they need to communicate when communi cating with people across cultures advisors must abandon any sentiments of ethnocentrismthe tendenc of individuals to judge all other groups according to their own groups standards behavior s and customs such notions lead an individual to see other groups as inferior by comparison recognizing differences 2120 each culture has its own way of accomplishing re quired daily tasks dvisors must understand that each particular society may appr oach things differently it does not m ean that they ar inefficient or less intelligent being different s hould not be seen as negative respect for counterparts must be maintained at all times learning to adapt 2121 advisors must be flexible and ready to adapt and adjust their behavior however they must be careful not to overdo their adjustment individuals who are overly flexible are often perceived s being insincere the successful advisor must strive to act in way that is appropriate to the target culture above all advisors should be themselves and show sincerity developing tolerance 2122 advisors must develop tolera nce for deviations from accepted nor ms events or activities that may seem extraordinary to newcom ers may be common practice in the culture advisors must be aware that members of the foreign culture may be astounde d by that which is commonplace in the united states careful observation should be made before judgments are rendered about seemingly peculiar behavior personal contact 2123 personal contact is the most effective way to br idge organizational barriers interorganizational stumbling blocks are very real nd the prejudices that arise from them are exacerbated by misunderstanding and ignorance often it is too easy to attribute nega tive attitudes and hostile motives to faceless groups the sf soldier must employ superior interpersonal skills and deal directly and closely with individual members of other organizations this type of contact can effectively rein force commonality and diminish the impact of disparity these personal relationships are the key to effecti ve interorganizational relationships appendix discusses useful techniques to establish and foster personal contact chapter 2 228 tc 3173 2 july 2008 factors affecting communication across cultures 2124 there are five key aspects that greatly impact communication across culture s these factors are z level of formality z level of directness and explicitness z perception of time z perception of the individual versus the group z show of emotion level of formality 2125 levels of formality vary greatly from culture to culture most asian cultures are on the high end of the formality continuum in contrast the north american culture pl aces very little emphasis on formality advisors must recognize the importance placed on fo rmality and adjust thei r behavior accordingly 2126 to most germans chewing gum when receiving briefing may indicate that the individual is not paying attention this translates into lack of re spect for the speaker and may even be construed as offensive conversely americans can be quite casual at work chewing gun during presentation m ay not indicate lack of attention in certain settings it may not even be considered lack of manners 2127 in order to be successful advisors must be aware of such cultural inconsistencies simple action that is completely acceptable in one culture may be considered distasteful in another time spent researching such issues of formality pays great dividends when serv ing in an advisory capacity level of directness and explicitness 2128 certain cultures are very direct and explicit in their communication whereas other cultures are indirect and vague when expressing themselves most people from asian and middle eastern cultures place high reliance on shared expe rience nonverbal cues and the c ontext in which the communication takes place consequently they often seem indirect and vague in their verbal communicati on in countries such as the united states switzerland and germany people tend to rely hea vily on the spoken word for communication as result verbal interactions are very direct precise and explicit reliance on context here is low as is reliance on nonverbal cues to outsi ders this style of communication may be perceived as too direct and overly talkative 2129 the indirectness that characterizes communication in some cultures often is strategy designed to prevent another person from losing face it may be view ed as consideration for another persons sense of dignity in cultures that are direct and explicit in their communication however this indire ctness may be perceived as dishonesty or insincerity suggesting that the speaker may have something to hide 2130 when communicating with people from more indir ect culture it is important to exercise extra cautionboth in what is said and how it is said bei ng overly direct may result in unintentional offense careful attention must also be given to nonverbal cues shared experience and the circumstances in which the communication takes place the true meanings of messages may actually reside more in these nonverbal cues than in the words uttered on the other hand when communicating with people from more direct culture typical american candor is more appropriate 2131 when dealing with more direct cultures illprepared advisors may be come offended when ideas or opinions are attacked with an unaccust omed degree of directness in orde r to be successful advisors must bear in mind that some cultures empl oy such directness as technique to achieve clarity advisors must be objective in listening to what their counterparts have to say and remember that att acks on ideas are not intended to be personal or deliberately embarrassing finally because direct cultures place little reliance on context advisors must pay particular attention to the spoken word perception of time 2132 cultures may differ greatly in their perception of time edward hall pro minent researcher in the field of intercultural communication made useful distinction between monochronictime and culture and communication 2 july 2008 tc 3173 229 polychronictime cultures in monoc hronictime cultures most western countries members place great emphasis on schedules precise reckoning of time and promptness in such cultures the schedule takes precedence over the interpersonal relation furthermore because of this urgency to maintain schedules members of such cultures tend to get to the point quickly this directness may be vi ewed as rude or brash in polychronictime cultures 2133 in polychronictime cultures time is viewed as fluid members of polychronictime societie s do not observe strict schedulesagendas are subordinate to interpersonal relations most asian countries as well as number of latin american and middle eastern countries are considered polychronic time cultures 2134 by knowing how the concept of time of embraced advisors can better adapt to new cultural environment because the united states is monochroni ctime culture americans must learn to be patient with polychronictime cultures for whom punctuality is at best unimportant and at worst negative trait perception of the individual versus the group 2135 cultures may be individualistic or collective in their orienta tion geert hofstede another prominent researcher in intercultural communication describ an individualist culture as one in which the ties between individuals are loosewhere people are expected to take care of themselves and their immediate families in collectivist culture people are raised from birth into strong cohesive groups these groups offer lifetime of protection in exchange for unquestioning loyalty 2136 in individualist cultures the individual takes center stage independence is highly valu ed individuals earn credit or blame for the success or failure of their endeavors 2137 in collectivist cultures an individual is regarded as part of the group interdependence prevails among individuals in the same group credit or blame for success or failure belongs to the entire group individuals do not seek recognition and often are uncomfortable if it is offered show of emotion 2138 each culture has its own system of expressing emo tion some cultures tend to be very expressive with their emotions and show their feelings plainly by laughing grimacing or scowling other cult ures tend to be more repressive rather than showing their feelings openly members of these cultures keep their emotions controlled and subdued 2139 when people from these two cultures interact misunderstandings are common those from the more expressive culture may view people from the repressive culture as cold or unfeeling s imilarly those from the more repressive culture may view their mo re expressive colleagues as immature and eccentric advisors must avoid snap judgments in order to communicate effectively the advisor must be able to display the appropriate level of emotion nonverbal communication 2140 nonverbal communication uses facial expressions gestures physical contact and body postures to convey meaning although there are many excellent books on the subject virtually every publ ication discusses nonverbal communication from particular cultural vantage point nonverbal communication and culture are inseparable one can only properly understand that this type of communication if one understands the culture from which it originates body language 2141 body language and gestures are products of custom and they are just as important to communication as spoken or written nguage the improper use of gestur eeven as simple as thumbs up gesture or twofinger peace signcan ups et carefully nurtured relationship 2142 the most basic survival gesturethe smileis visual signal that is unive rsally understood however even though the smile is understood in every culture some fine distinctions do exist between chapter 2 230 tc 3173 2 july 2008 cultures russians for example very rarely smile on the street the french believe americans smile too much japanese people seldom smile during what they consider to be formal circumstances such as photograph for drivers license or christmas card malaysians and indonesians tend to smileeven gigglewhen they feel nervous or embarrassed 2143 the common symbol for ok made by touching the tips of thumb and index finger is one of the best known gestures in the united states in other cultures however the same gesture may an something entirely different for example z in the south of france this gesture is used to indicate zero or something that worthless n individual who uses the symbol to indicate ok ma negate negotiated arrangement or offend counterpart by indicating that the deal or the individual is worthless z in japan this gesture is used to indicate coin or money an individual who uses th symbol to indicate ok may offend the counterpart by appearing to ask for bribe z in brazil germany and russia this gesture is used to indicate intim ate body parts an advisor carelessly using this gesture may appear to be suggesting something unintended 2144 advisors must pay particular attention to seemingly minor differences for example ameri cans tend to beckon waiter by raising single finger that type of pointing gesture is frowned upon in ja pan where pointing is done with the thumb of closed fist in most of europe person beckons wai ter holding their hand in front of them fingertips forward with the palm facing the floor and making scratching motion with the fingers another common beckoning gesture in the united states i s made by holding the index finger straight up facing inward nd curling it up and down in australia indonesia and mexico this gesture is reserved for animals and prostitutes 2145 the use of body language in the ao should be studied thoroughly prior to deployment once deployed advisors should continue to study the body language used by local nationals the surrounding circumstances must also be considered for exampl how the people call waiter or how they wave goodbye advisors should observe posture body langua ge and common gestures such as people tapping the sides of their noses or flipping the lobes of their ears the far reach of social blunders the danger of usg representatives committing cultural faux pas does not stop at advisor level on one occasion when pres ident richard nixon exited an airplane in brazil he raised his arms and made the ok symbol with both hands in brazil this symbol indicates an intimate body part in 1991 when presiden t george herbert walker bush visited australia he offered t he v for victory sign from the window of his limousine his hand however was facing toward his body instead of away from it in british commonwealth countries this gesture is the equivalent of the extended middle finger in the united states interpersonal distance 2146 the space people maintain around their bodies refl ects the desire to control which people are allowed to get close and the circumstances in which it is deemed acceptable an individual who violates anothers interpersonal space without consent is usually perceived as hostile or aggressive the perception of appropriate interpersonal distance varies between cultu res and reflects the style nd tone of the society at large figure 212 page 231 provides an intentiona lly broad overview of these variations the guidelines provided cannot be applied to every relationship or ci rcumstance even within single cultural group few areas of nonverbal communication are more sensitive than interpersonal space fortunately the appropriate distance is easy to respect once it is identified culture and communication 2 july 2008 tc 3173 231 culture interpersonal distance middle eastern same sex only mediterranean hispanic most less than 18 inches united states western europe 1836 inches asian african many greater than 36 inches middle eastern with opposite sex greater than 36 inches and often to the side figure 212 interpersonal distance 2147 for sf soldiers serving in an advisory role interpersonal distance is particularly important when administering or receiving criticism in such instances individuals must be sure they do not stand too close to one another too small an interpersonal gap can make one or both of the individuals feel threatened and defensive people who feel defensive have trouble expressing themselves clearly are re sistant to suggestion correction and criticism and may even become aggressive touching 2148 touch should be minimized when communicating across cultural lines although some cultures are more open to touching than others even the most demonstrative groups have rules of propriety and etiquette physical contact made at the wrong time can risk serious misunderstandings 2149 in mainstream american culture touching is generally discouraged nativeborn americans tend to abandon touch at an early age and substitute word s as the primary means of communication northern europeans such as the germans scandinavians british are sim ilarly uncomfortable with touch from anyone other than intimate family members or friends touching is discouraged in most asian cultures particularly to the back head or shoulder additionally small child ren are not to be touched by anyone outside the immediate family whereas it is common for an america n adult to playfully tousle the hair of small child such actions may be deem ed extremely offensive in some asia n cultures in the example of the small childs hair an advisors wellmeant attempt to ease tensio n display sense of humor and build trust would achieve the exact opposite 2150 there are rules for touching because us societ is so aware of the potential for people to use negative touch to intimidate or threaten most amer icans are careful in how they touch researchers classify americans as low touchers in relation to the rest of the world however the use of touch in such multicultural society varies some americans never touch anyon outside their immediate family even though they may prize such persons friendship others touch oftenusua lly on the shoulders and armsbut such contact is not designed to express any real meaning chapter 2 232 tc 3173 2 july 2008 2151 in the us touch is used mainly when individuals meet or depart for example handshake or casual hug americans can simulate the feeling of touch without ever touching by allowing ot hers to move in close when talking close friends may exch ange hugs pretend punches or kisses and may touch frequently when talking for acquaintances and superiors simple handshake is all that is expected some people are considered high touchers and give frie ndly arm back and shoulder toucheseven to new acquaintances some americans show in public what ght be considered private expressions of affection in other cultures for example prolonged kisses or other overt displays of affection 2152 handshakes exchanged in the united states tend to be more firm than other cultures for instance chinese japanese and most africans use light handsha kes this does not indicate that the individual is unassertive it simply is cultural trait russians and most europe ans use firm handshakes similarly this does not necessarily imply that the individual is assertive or tough eye contact 2153 rules for appropriate eye contact vary among cultures however few people consciously recognize that such rules even exist still individuals do act ia w with society norms these individual have unconsciously absorbed the rules of their culture 2154 among the majority of north americans the accepted rule is for individuals to make intermittent eye contact with the people to whom they are speaking if people hold eye contact for too l ong they may be considered aggressive if people hold eye contact too briefly they may come across as disint erested an individual who consistently fails to make eye contact may appear evasive or dishonest 2155 advisors must be sensitive to cultural variations when making eye contact in some african cultures for example it is considered impolite to make more than the briefest eye contact to most americans such an exchange would imply that the other party was distracted and not paying atte ntion facial expressions and gestures 2156 it is not unusual for americans to use facial expr essions to convey doubt surprise distrust anger agreement or rejection other cultu res are less expressive with facial expressions for example japanese counterparts face may be expressionle ss but inside he may be furious si milarly he may enthusiastically agree with recommendation although his outward xpression might be interpreted as indifference 2157 the majority of americans use wide hand gestures in most european and pacific rim countrie s hand gestures are kept to minimum in latin america the middle east and africa it is common for people to use wide gestures to emphasize their points of view advisors must exe rcise caution in both the number and magnitude of hand gestures communication with illiterates 2158 sf soldiers frequently operate in developing countriesand even some industrialized nations where large segments of the populati on are either illiterate or semiliterate in many cases such as haiti this segment of the population represents the primary target audience with whom the unit must communicate an illiterate or semiliterate audience presents challenge that requires creative and enhanced communication skills 2159 in reaching an illiterate or semiliterate segment of the population there are number of existing channels of communication that can be used others can be created radio is powerful means of reaching illiterate or semiliterate populations other techniques include interpers onal communication traditional or folk communication simple graphics and other basic prin ted materials when dealing with illiterate or semiliterate audience the sf advisor should z determine how people receive their information the lack of literacy skills does not necessarily indicate an absence in th flow of information z identify the key communicators for the target audience very often word of mouth is the be st way to share information among audiences fo r whom written materials are ineffective culture and communication 2 july 2008 tc 3173 233 z identify the informal communications networks the grapevine in the community in s ome areas the most effective communications networks l ack leadership or formal structure advisors must identify members of the community w ho trust the unit and are willing to help z include the use of printed materials photonovels comic books and wall posters that use more graphics and fewer words can convey powerful messages z cater visual communication materials to the target audience images that ffectively convey message in one culture might carry an entirely di fferent meaning in another artwork should be tested on sample audience topics to approach with special caution 2160 each culture has topics that ar considered forbiddensubjects that are simply not discussed in casual conversation the nature of these topics can vary widely however sf advisors should avoid at least initially the following three subjects z religion z politics z personal matters religion 2161 discussing religion can immediately destroy the communication process particularl if the local nationals believe that offense was given whether actual or perceived the damage done may be very profound as cultural sensitivities may be acute this is evident in the case of islam for example politics 2162 political discussions can become ve ry heated and should be avoided if possible in regions where political issues dominate the news avoiding such discussio ns may prove difficult if there is polite way to extricate oneself from the discussion advisors must ensure that it is handled in di plomatic manner personal matters 2163 it is considered rude to ask other americans highly personal questions advisors should extend the same courtesy to members of the local national population in certain rural area s of west africa where the world is seen in generalities it is considered extremely rude to ask specific questions final tips on communication 2164 researching target audiences culture can be an endless activity advisors must not get bogged down on the minute details of single cultural feature instead they should strive to unders tand all aspects of the culture if advisors demonstrate basic knowle dge and are willing to listen and learn they will achieve more effective exchange appendix d pr ovides number of valuable internet resources 2165 advisors should consult with individuals who lived in the hn and know the local cust oms 1hour interview with native may be more productive than week of formal language and culture training 2166 effective communication requires practice advisors should rehearse in order to practice favorabl body language and eliminate unfavorable gestures and postures body language is as important as the verbal message it should appear naturalnot labored or uncomfortable 2167 advisors must recognize that an american stereotypepossibly negative stereot ypelikely precedes them they should try to understand and discern this stereotype over time they may be able to improve the local impression of americans finally advi sors must be mentally pr epared to experience the unknown this page intentionally left blank 2 july 2008 tc 3173 31 chapter 3 dealing with counterparts merriamwebsters collegiate dictionary defines rapport as relation marked by harmony conformity accord or affinity when people discuss good rapport they describe relationship that is founded upon mutual trust understanding and respect relationships characterized by personal dislike animosity and other forms of friction often are described as rapport rapport for purposes of the sf advisor is term used to describe the degree of effectiveness establishing rapport 31 the requirement to establish rapport with hn counter parts is the product of the advisor being in unique military position that position is one in which the ad visor has positional authority over the actions of the hn counterparts this lack of authority means that the tr aditional that is doctrinal view of military leadership must be modified to emphasize interpersona l relationships and deemphasize authoritarian roles advisors use their interpersonal skills to in fluence the outcome of events 32 sf advisors must be armed with certain knowledge before they can establish effe ctive rapport first they must study fm 622 army leadership this publication provides the sf advisor with the basic leadership knowledge required to understand human nature and motiva tion in addition to fm 622 advisors must incorporate information specific to the culture and society of thei r potential counterparts this information may take the form of thorough area studies operational area studies and other research materials as discussed in chapter 2 33 the true measure of rapport is whether or not the advisor can motivate their counterpart to ta ke desired action for sf the basic techniques of motivation in the absence of authority are dvising setting the example compromise and coercion advising 34 advising the counterpart to select particular course of action is only effective if t he counterpart perceives that the advisor is professionally compet ent enough to provide sound advice if the counterpart does not perceive the proposed solution to problem is realistic the advisors competence will be questioned the advisor must take pains to explain to his counterpart that the recommended course of action coa is realistic and will be effective setting the example 35 setting the example for the counterpart must be an ongoing effort in order to avoid the appearance of do as i say not as i do attitude in setting the exam ple the advisor should make every effort to explain to the counterpart that what he is doing is the most effective form of behavior for the situ ation this is particularly true when the behavior or purpose is not readily understood by the counterpart in following this guidance the advisor may also reinforce his perceived competence compromise 36 when seeking compromise with the hn counterpart in the desired coa or behavior the advisor may create situation in which the counterpart has personal interest in succe ssful execution in some chapter 3 32 tc 3173 2 july 2008 cultures seeking compromise may allow the counterpart to save face furthermor in certain situations the counterpartbecause of practical experiencemay have better solution to the problem at hand 37 advisors must also recognize that when they seek compromise in certain cultures their perceived competence may suffer this may be mitigated somewhat by approach ing the compromise as two professionals the advisor and the c ounterpart reaching mutual conclusion in order to reach an effective compromise sf advisors may have to conduct ne gotiations the approaches and techniques of negotiations are covered in detail in chapter 4 of this tc note there are two areas of concern that must never be compromised for the sake of maintaining rapportforce protection fp and human rights coercion 38 coercion is the least desirable method of motivati on because it can cause irreparable damage to the relationship advisors should use coercion only in extreme circumstances that is life or deat h 39 american advisors frequently enjoy privileged st atus in the hn their mere presence may garner personal benefits for the counterpart simply because the counterpart s oneonone association with an american worried about losing these benefits counterparts may agree with advisors sim ply to avoid confrontation sf advisors must be careful to avoid unintentionally forcing their counterparts into ction 310 ultimately the sf advisor should strive to blish and maintain good ra pport by conveying to his counterpart that he is sincerely inte rested in him his nation and its cause that he will not belittle him or his efforts and that he has intention of taking over from him advisors must demonstrate that they have come to help because they believe the counterpart s goals are just fair and deserving of success policy and relationships 311 advisors must keep in mind that their primary aim is to forward us policy therefore rel ationships with hn personnel other us forces and ogas must be established and developed supporting united states and hostnation policies 312 sf advisors not only support us national policy in the areas where they operate they are lso obligated to forward the policies of the hn government unless otherwise directed by higher authori ty advisors may submit periodic situation reports sitreps to the embassy and should maintain communications with higher headquarters hq to sure that activities are in keeping with us objectives 313 hn national policies organization economy cust oms and education may dictate practices and procedures that appear inefficien t or uneconomical advisors should avoid criticizing or condemning such practices and procedures until they are thoroughly unde rstood recommendations that may be critical or contrary to hn policy should be made in private environment 314 the sf advisor must understand his status in the hn this is normally specified i n detail by status offorces agreement sofa or other arrangeme nt between the usg and the hn government these agreements vary widely they may offer little political protection or may provide for full diplomatic immunity if such agreement exists the sf advisor is subject to th full measure of local laws and customs and the jurisdiction of local courts even if sofa or other agreement exists that provides some form of immunity advisors are still expected to observe local laws 315 when an advisor enters country the hn governme nt may still be in the process of developing adequate administrative machinery the advisor should be aware of such scenarios and avoid being overly critical they should remain flexible and use their crea tive to find approaches that work in the absence of dealing with counterparts 2 july 2008 tc 3173 33 clear laws us soldier should conduct himself professionally and iaw us laws and regulati ons and the uniform code of military justice ucmj 316 the sf advisor must have knowledge of the political social and military organizations in the ao and the manner in which they interrelate in many c ountries these relationships depend heavily on personal relationships between indi viduals the sf advisor must understand the personalities political movements and social forces at work close contact with local civilian leaders military commanders and police forces helps to establish and update working knowle dge of these groups and their relationships command relationships 317 advisors must use the us chain of command to obtain and disseminate guidance and assista nce care must be taken to distinguish between the us chain of command and the hn chain of comma nd in particular advisors must prevent the counterpart fro m attempting to control subordinates through the us chain of command advisors provide recommendationsnot ordersto their counterparts only the counterpart should issue orders to subordinates 318 ogas ngos and other hn agencies may be collocat ed in the ao appendix d discusses these organizations in detail advisors should strive to in tegrate the efforts of all organizations into mission planning and should impress upon their counterparts that progress can only be achieved through such integrated efforts 319 advice should be presented in person if the dvice provided is not accepte d and the sf advisor feels it is appropriate to do so he may report the ma tter in writing through us military channels it is possible that hn or us policy conflicts at higher levels may prevent the counterpart from act ing on the advice provided if higher echelons are made aware that problem stems from policy conflict they may be able to align the policies 320 when reporting such matters the sf advisor should consider that written grievance may resurface at an inconvenient or embarrassing time or place such reports may have unintended and farreaching consequences for example report about an hn officer may be shared with highranking hn offic ial the hn official in an attempt to prove that he is working to correct the situation may fire the officer in question 321 effective communication is essential for the adviso r the use of proper channels should be stressed at all echelons sf advisors must keep their counterparts informed of advice given to their s ubordinates fellow us personnel should be kept informed of dvice offered to counterparts hn officials should be persuaded to pass information up down and across the chain of command 322 local customs and courtesies should be observed counterparts that are senior in grade should be treated accordingly if warranted by the hn military customs seniorra nking personnel should be saluted such individuals should be referred to by their rank as customs permit and shown respect and deference although hn officers may have command authority over th advisor effectiveness is greatly enhanced when the advisor displays respect for the counterpart and the hn chain of command figure 31 pages 33 and 34

encourage the development of such agreements the advisor can expect to find certain technical agencies and services that are extensions of hn na tional ministries their activ ities and efforts should

ities and must strongly discourage all such activities furthermore they must explain to their counterparts that they are oblig ed to report any atrocities of which they have knowledge role shock 346 role shock results from the discrepancy between the roles individuals expect to play and the roles they actually do play role shock may also be product of the tension created by individuals tr ying to do jobs themselves versus advising others how to do the jobs unlike culture shock which is usual ly of relatively short duration role shock tends to increas until about the anticipated midpoint of the tour furthermore role shock seldom disappears completely until red eployment the symptoms of role shock are similar to those produced by other stressful life events 347 many sf soldiers on deployment become entangled in the com plexities of bureaucracyboth foreign and americanand become increasingly frustrated when seemin gly familiar appearing things fail to respond in expected and predictable ways this c ontinuing frustration can be key contributor to role shock 348 sf advisors are not deployed to an ao to exercise technical speci alties rather advisors are sent to guide host nationals on how to perform certain ta sks sf personnel may be required to help their counterparts design and implement an organization pr ocess or procedure solutions to the attendant organizational political social and economic problems require thorough understanding of many variables outside soldiers usual military skill set in particular it requires knowledge of and skills in the techniques of advising and facilitating the efforts of others whe reas it requires certain skills to come into an area and extinguish fire comple tely different skill set is required to build fire department and sustainable fireprevention program 349 the sf soldiers roleif executed properlyis rarely pure in order to accomplish the mission the sf advisor must be professionally competent however the sf advisor also m ust be realist negotiator teacher creative thinker defender of th long view and organizer of aid and assistance from other agencies the advisor needs to represent an objective view by considering problems in total context and applying experience and sound judgment the probl ems facing an advisor are at times made more complex because he must address range of exp ectationsfrom his home unit from the hn from his team leader and from us missions or agencies at tim these expectations may not be fully compatible 350 although many sf soldiers undergo some degree of role shock over time they learn to take the personal living and social conditions in stride more challenging are the problems that arise in connection with their jobstheir professional roles relations hips with colleagues and indigenous peers personal achievement selfdevelopment selfdetermination and selfimage 351 the most frequent complaints voiced by sf soldiers pertain to the nature of the ssion the nature of the host government the relationships with counterparts or coworkers and the lack of self determination significant number of sf soldiers find that the duties and activities in which they engage during deployments are at least somewhat different from those expectedthe actual duties and responsibilities are greater in scope involve technical work outside of their assigned specialties and require honed administrative rather than military skills 352 many personnel tend to distinguish between what they consider to be their professional military role and their actual work role they may exhibit sel fconfidence as professionals but have problems in carrying out their work they perceive their work role simply as those activities carried out during working hours whereas their professional role encompasses onl those activities that require the technical skills associated with professional training for example whereas an sf engineer sergeant mos 18c may consider the engineering functions of project as part of his professional military role the administrative functions of the projectregardless of their importancemight not be afforded the same professiona l attention because the job of communicating ideas re quires wider range of interpersonal and cultural sensitivity skills than those normally considered professiona l the typical sf advisor finds that his work role behavior differs from that with which he is familiar chapter 3 310 tc 3173 2 july 2008 353 sf advisors should limit their activities abroad to imparting informati on and providing advice however many assume performance role these advi sors may rationalize this because actually doing an activity provides immediate and visible results advisi ng and supervising is slower less conspicuous and more difficult therefore the role challenges become so overwhelming that some advisors retreat i nto the familiar repetition of more productoriented activities 354 as with culture shock an individual that has ccessfully adapted to hn practices may be vulnerable to second role shock upon their return to their home station they may find that they have learned expectations and approaches to working that are quite inappropriate in the united states ambiguity of the professional role 355 advisors may differ greatly in their perceptions of structure some may regard rigid struct ure as guiding comforting and facilitating whereas others prefer th freedom and creativity afforded by more fluid organizations and assignment most advisory assignments are ambiguous what an advi sor is expected to accomplish is not always made clear furthe rmore what an advisor is assigned to achieve may conflict with what he has trained to do what others expect of him or what he wants or expects to do 356 factors unrelated to an individuals tolerance for ambiguity may introduce additional role confusion these include the administrative context of the assignmen t hn attitudes other team members and the influence of predecessors and counterparts 357 the united states and the hn may spend monthseven yearsneg otiating project still the overall objectives or definition of the mission to be accomplished might be expressed in very general terms various interpretations of what is to be acco mplished arise even more views surface regarding the most appropriate means of reaching those goals 358 many months may elapse between the time the project is agreed upon and the first advisor rrives on the scene in that time dramatic changes may occur in objectives and in the staffs of the american mission and the hn the arriving sf team may find that the local nationals openly or covertly disa gree with what they are supposed to accomplish and how they are to go about it advisors may perceive that the host government or individual nationals entered into assistance agreements only to get economic id or to achieve some unrelated objectives 359 advisors can be expected to ponder their role when confronted with such scenarios more specifically an advisor may become convinced that the situation lacks the prerequisites for the kind of assistance he can be expected to re nder the advisor may resist compromi in the technical approaches or levels of performance that the situation demands instead the advisor may direc t his talents and energies into activities thatin his mindpreserve or maintain his pro fessional image relations with counterpart 360 there exists an almost implicit assumption in most technical assistance proj ects that the sf advisor will work closely with host national whom the hn or military organization desi gnates as counterpart although this arrangement appears to be simple often it is unclear how the role is to be perform ed in way that will conform to the expectations of both the american sponsors and the hn 361 ideally the counterpart provides working contex t for the sf advisor and helps him to understand and adjust to the new culture historically those w ith good working relationships with their counterparts make better adjustments than those who have counter parts or bad relations with their counterpart good working relationships may be difficult to establish and maintain most advisors approach their assignments as teachers and mentors the counterpa rt may be resistant to such rela tionship particularly if he was expecting someone to take over and do all or part of the job in addition many counterparts want their advisors to share in at least some of the blame if something goes wrong 362 the united states has little control over the availa bility or capability of counterparts the assigned individual may be technically incompetent lack in professional commitment have other personal or dealing with counterparts 2 july 2008 tc 3173 311 professional interests or be unavailable when need ed in some cases numerous counterparts are assigned and rotate in their dealings with the advisor si ngle counterpart may not be assigned until the sf advisor has been on the scene for some time in some scenarios specific counterpart is never assigned participation in hostnation bureaucracy 363 although some americans might disagree the united states maintains syste m that isby world standardsrelatively permissive and nonbureaucratic as such advisors may become aggravated when confronted with or obstructed by indigenous bureaucr acy red tape administrative centralization and cumbersome decisionmaking process in the host government cultures that place great emphasis on consensus in the decisionmaking process can be par ticularly frustrating for dvisors in order to be successful the advisor must strive to understand the bureaucracy in which he must operate 364 communication challenges in overly bureaucratic so cieties further complicat advisor efficiency upward communication in traditionally authoritarian society presents particular obstacle advisors using foreign language or working through interpreters may fail to identify decision makers deci sionmaking criteria and the communication roles held by various levels of litary professionals 365 advisors should recognize the value of being or knowing the middleman this role is sometimes one of the key contributions an outsider can make middlemen are able to move in around and out of organizations somewhat independently of the local hierarchy protocol and customs they can li nk persons and offices that might otherwise have difficulty in communication many sf soldiers di slike this role and refuse to practice it however the middleman can be significant catalyst in any advisory operation response to american administration 366 as frustrating as hn bureaucracies may be sf advi sors may become even more irritated with american organizations being deployed overseas makes certai n individuals hypersensitive to difficulties in organization and administration most soldiers perceive organizations and organization charts as logically conceived structures that operate rationa lly they frequently fail to take into account the distances lead times diplomatic issues and other problems involved in establishing and m aintaining functional organization moreover many of the amer icans who manage these foreign based bureaucracies are inexperienced in dealing with the military these issues are furt her complicated by the usual tensions between hq and field staffs and between administrators and technical specialists expectations values and styles of behavior vary from group to group 367 this bureaucratic frustration is not unique to sf advisors many local nationals criticize us missions for exercising too much program guidance and control as well as for its general performance ineffectiveness in achieving goals direct interferen ce with the substance of programs and excessive bureaucracy 368 an sf deployment usually requires more than re performance of professional role it usually implies that the advisor is expected to bring about organizational and individual changes in behavior this may mean trying to change how nationals conceive nd play particular professional role it also may require modifying the organizational and political context in w hich the local national advisor operates it frequently involves all of these and more such as the effective employment of the professional role in stimulating or implementing broad institutional or national programs of social economic political or technological development 369 deploying personnel may not be familiar with the tasks of development and the vast range of problems typical of underdeveloped ar eas they come in eager to cont ribute their knowledge and skill and anxious to make maximum progress in the limited span of their assignment in so doing they ma fail to recognize that the factors that frustrate themsuch as the lack of professional skills and facilitiesare actually their reason for being there chapter 3 312 tc 3173 2 july 2008 diversity of personnel 370 organizations attract individuals who differ in abilities knowledge skills work ethics social behaviors values and attitudes advisors must be able to rec ognize personality ty pes and develop techniques to cooperate effectively with each type fi gure 32 identifies five di stinct personality types type description i professionally oriented most are abroad for the first time ii oriented to interpersonal and social approaches in the work rol majority have prior overseas experience iii oriented to the administrative pr ocess of technical assistance most are firsttimers with educat ional administration experience iv oriented more to the job and the bureaucracy t han to the problems peopl or administrative processes of assistance most have long service in governm ent or educational institutions v chiefly concerned with adventure all firsttimers figure 32 personality types final points to consider 371 despite the frustrations and challenges of overseas deployments most sf advisors reflect upon them as unique and memorable experiences they count th eir memories and personal rewards in terms of personal achievement travel adventure ex citement and crosscultural friendships 372 more perceptive individuals become introspective nd admit to such personal dividends as growth in maturity patience tolerance and selfunderstanding most find it much more difficult t assess how much they really achieved while abroad some are dissatisfied with the amount of progress the were able to make and minority feel their talents were not used or were misused similarly some may be disappointed with the degree to which their advisory experience is recognized or rewarded upon return to the united states 373 even so most advisors express positive attitudes toward their work and its importance despite the problems of crosscultural work in most cases advisors experience tremendous personal and professi onal growth in the course of developing ot her people instituti ons and countries 374 overseas deployments make it possible for soldiers to adjust and learn to make their c ontributions and to return with new attitudes points of view knowledge and skills this is the important dividenda dividend expressed in the numbers of people who can not only carry out their professional roles under field conditions but can move effectively in and out of intersocietal relationships 2 july 2008 tc 3173 41 chapter 4 crosscultural negotiations because negotiation is fundamental to problem solving the study development and honing of negotiation skills are critical to the sf advisor the principal form of negotiation that the sf advisor is likely to conduct is crosscultural negotiation crosscultural negotiation brings with it series of unique challenges and techniques culture fundamentally affects language and behavior it also significantly impacts t he way people handle conflict when it comes to negotiation one culture may prefer to use competitive style winlose whereas another culture may prefer compromise or accommodation winwin cultural differences may lead to conflict between what the parties expect and what their fa milies and communities expect this has an obvious impact on negotiating behavior negotiations among members of the same culture can be stressful negotiating with members of other cultures can be exceedingly difficult logically working with other cultures is basic skill for the sf soldier nd an absolute requirement when acting in an advisory or foreign liaison role u nderstanding the factors discussed will help minimize the difficulty of crosscultural negotiation perceptions 41 most americans have certain preconceived ideas about people from other cultures these perceptions may not be factually based but they do exist nevertheless and they influence the way people approach negotiations with foreigners 42 similarly foreign negotiators have certain perceptions about american negotiators again these perceptions may not be based in fact but they too exist advisors need to know how other cultures perceive american negotiators so that they can adjust their negotiating style accordingly the successful advisor must find ways to capitalize on the positive preconcept ions foreign negotiators have of americans and find ways to neutralize the negative preconceptions they may have 43 research indicates that different cultures hold different perceptions of americans for instance most cultures think that americans are hard working th japanese however dont associate this trait with americans at all most japanese perceive americans as rude and many foreigners think that americans are culturally insensitive they believe that most americans are interested only in their own culture language methods and customs this perception is based almost entirely on two key factors first m ost americans speak only one languageenglish many us negotia tors believe it unnecessary to learn any foreign language if negotiators from other cultures want to do business many americans expect them to do so in english second most americans have distinct busin ess customs from which they are unwilling to deviate these standards and customs are forced upon foreign nego tiators in practically every business transaction 44 because these perceptions can create negative attitude s us negotiators must be sensitive to the preconceptions of foreign negotiators and work to counter any negativity this is not to imply that negotiators must become fluent in every foreign langua ge by learning few simple phrases us negotiators can show that they are at least some what interested in and respectful of the local culture and customs at the very least negotiators should learn the following phras or their equivalent in the local languages z hello z goodbye chapter 4 42 tc 3173 2 july 2008 z yes z z please z thank you z good morning z good evening z i hope to see you soon 45 in addition to common terms and phrases negotiators must learn the proper way to address people in recent years it has become common fo r strangers in the united states to address each other by their first names this custom has not yet taken hold in othe r culturesmost prefer to be addressed by some honorific title many counterparts consider it rude if nego tiators address them by their first name this is especially true of those who hol d important government positions academic titles or military ranks in some african societies for example it is common to address government officials as chief m uch as us officials are often addressed as the honorable ms smith negotiators must research th locallanguage equivalent of military ranks and common titles for example mr mrs colonel professor and doctor formal titles should be used until the counterparts invite negotiators to use first names or other titles 46 negotiators may further counteract negative per ceptions about american cultural sensitivity by having information about them their organization nd their mission translated into the foreign language there are numerous software packag that can translate important messages into french spanish german italian and several other languages it is not necessary to translate every doc ument into the foreign language often translati on of one or two key documents will suffice this small gesture requiring minimal effort may be enough to show forei gn negotiators that the us negotiators appreciate their local language and customs individualism 47 the united states encourages largely individualistic culture as such the typical american negotiator prefers to enter into negotiations alone or if required as part of very small negotiating team two or three people at most this behavior is largely byproduct of us culture which focuses on the individual performance initiative and accomplishments 48 most other cultures of the world place less em phasis on the individual and more on the group cultures that are extremely groupconscious include the latin american countrie s of mexico argentina brazil venezuela and colombia cultures in the pacific rim such as ja pan malaysia hong kong china and taiwan are also grouporiented most societies in southern africa also emphas ize group decisionmaking in cultures where the groupnot the individualis responsible for decisionmaking negotiations can drag out for long periods of time figure 41 page 43 provides brief snapshot of the cultural views of the individual versus the group 49 when dealing with grouporiented cultures us negotiators may wish to reconsider the incl ination to enter into negotiations alone or with very small group in some scenarios the arriva l of single negotiator indicates to counterparts th at the individual and by default the united states is illprepared and unprofessional in their view single negotiator does not have the required experts to provide advice or support during the negotiation process in some culturesrussia for examplesending single negotiator or very small team may be taken to mean that the other side is not serious 410 additional challenges face unaccompan ied negotiators when an individual attempts to negotiate on their own with groups of ten or more they may become flustered rather than oneonone dialogue the sole negotiator must absorb pressure from many persons sole negotiators must convince every mem ber of the group the individual negotiator must divide his focus among the team members of the other s ide whereas they can focus on him alone this can prove to be nervewracking experience crosscultural negotiations 2 july 2008 tc 3173 43 figure 41 individuality 411 negotiators should increase the size of their team when conducting business with s uch cultures if possible negotiators should find out in advance how many people their counterparts plan to include in their team the number of us team members should be increased to mirror the counterpart and t his number should include subjectmatter experts smes to assist during negotiations 412 unlike the groupthink mentality of many cultures delegates from europe canada and caucasians in southern africa emphasize individual decisionmaking s till the decisionmaking processes employed in these regions are not quite as individualistic as that of us negotiators when negotiat ing with people from these cultures us negotiators may need to adjust their approach slightly alt hough they should concentrate on the chief decisionmaker they should not entirely overlook the other members in the team these individuals will still influence the decisionmaker du ring private discussions and caucuses punctuality 413 americans place great emphasis on punctuality viewi ng it as an indication of an individuals basic ability and commitment professionals from austra lia the benelux countries france germany switzerland sweden the united kingdom uk nd japan emphasize punctuality even more than americans conversely time is considered relative for those in mexico and other lati n american countries members of the most african cultures ca nnot understand why others ve to conduct all their activities according to clock appoint ments often start late are resche duled or are canceled altogether figure 42 page 44 provides snaps hot of the cultural views of punctuality pace of negotiations 414 the pace of negotiations in the united states is fast er than in most other cu ltures consequently the negotiating process between americans is usually mu ch shorter in the opening phase of negotiations american negotiators normally do not spend much time on introductions and getting to know their counterparts little attention is given to buildi ng rapport or creating positive and relaxed negotiating climate american negotiators typically do not show much interest in learning about th roles of the team members in the counterparts negotiating team in fact an american negotiator m ay not even spend much time introducing himself to the other members of his own team american negotiators nd to attack the task of negotiating as quickly as possible subsaharan africasouthwest asia north africasouth

resultsoriented approach is effective in many us scenarios it may crea the impression with foreign counterparts that the us negotiator is untrustworthythat he is tryi ng to force decision at the expense of the other side foreign counterparts may feel that the us negotiat or is trying to exploit both them and the situation such negative pe rceptions may lead the foreign negotiator to avoid making any deals the foreign negotiatorunlike his american counterpartoften does not want t simply arrive at settlement or conclusion he wants to build p ositive relationship for future negotiations 416 negotiators from many other cultures spend more time on relationship issues and building rapport particularly at the beginning if us negotiators do not consciously force themselves to slow this important phase of negotiations they will fail to get vital information from their counterparts creat distrust and weaken their chances of gaining vital concessi ons throughout crosscultural negotiations american negotiators resist temptations to make early concessi ons in order to move the negotiation forward or to demonstrate willingness to compromise american negotiators who rush may make unnecessary concessions and actually weaken their position interes tingly research suggests that the party who makes the first concession usually gets the worst part of deal 417 negotiators in the united states tend to close negotiations m uch faster than negotiators in other cultures often working under rigid timelines us negotiators must produce results quickly so th at they can turn their attention to other tasks the closing of negotiation is looked upon by many other cultures as the time to cement the relationship an american ne gotiator who rushes away from successful meeting may leave the foreign negotiator with lessthandesirable final im pression note counterpart may offer to help with travel arrangements as an act of courtesy negotiators should use caution in accepting this offer counterparts who make the travel arrangements become privy to how much time the us representative has to negotiate the foreign negotiator may use this information to add additional pressure as the scheduled departure time draws near 418 negotiators from canada the bene lux countries sweden switzerland and the uk maintain pace similar to that of americans the ne gotiating pace in countries such as it aly spain and even australia is somewhat slower than in the united states french german russian and japanese negotiators are used to much slower negotiating pace ne gotiators from

of longterm relationships british sca ndinavian and swiss negotiators however display slightly larger need to build relationships spanish nd italian negotiators have an even greater need to establish good relationships with their negotiating counterparts 421 except for southern africa negotiators from the african cultures often stress the need to build relationships among themselves but do not display similar emphasis with negot iators from nonafrican cultures when conducting negotiations most ea stern european cultures do not value personal relationships as much as americans this is unlike the neighboring russian cul tural region where negotiators display slightly greater need for personal relationshipsabout as much as that of their american counterparts 422 in latin america the middle east and the pacific rim personal relationships rate high among the needs of negotiators friendship opens the door to ccessful negotiation negotiators often expect to get together before negotiations so that they can get to know one another on social level even during negotiation members of these cultures spend long time on general conversation before they i ntroduce business negotiators from these three regions spend great deal of time on the opening phase of negotiations they first need to know the person with whom they are negotiating and they must have high level of to trust in that person before they start making deals 423 when dealing with persons from latin america the middle east and the pacific rim american negotiators should plan first to engage in smalltalk subjects such as politics race religion and gender issues should be avoided these topics seldom help to build relationships between strangers instead american negotiators should try discussing the foreign countrys history cultu ral heritage traditions beautiful countryside cont ribution to the arts economic successes and popular sports questions about local restaurants are usually safe neutral topics to be gin conversation negotiators must be prepared to discuss typical american traditions sports and cultural heritage however they must be careful not to go overboard with talk about america it may come

arab businesspeople government officials and military officers speak at least some nglish many are quite fluent 427 english is widely spoken in business circles of latin america and the pacific rim countries but not necessarily within local government and military circ english is common language in subsaharan africa because of the vast number of tribal dialect s english and french are common among the educated in subsaharan africa with english being more common in east africa english is an official language of kenya the western portion of subsaharan africa has more french speakers who often consider speaking french the mark of an educated person conducting crosscultural negotiations 428 the basic elements common to all negotiations must be applied in way that allows for the differing cultures of the participants elements that must be considered i nclude the following z opening strategies z directness z strengthening behaviors z movement z power z facesaving z formal agreements z mediation opening strategies 429 the opening strategies of negotiators differ from one culture to the next in the united st ates negotiators tend to open with offers or demands th at are very different from their final positions or expectations they leave healthy margin to bargain many other countries use sim ilar approach to negotiations however the application of this strategy may be very different 430 negotiators from most pacific rim countries also tend to open high but not as high as america n negotiators negotiators from these countries might not allow themselves as much bargaining room as american negotiators might expect 431 negotiators from the middle east and russia usually open with high to extremely high demands russians are wellknown for opening with extreme demands or offers some may even strain or exceed credibility therefore they allow themselves tremendous amount of bargaining room american advisors must be cognizant of this practice so that they can build enough fat into their own negoti ating range crosscultural negotiations 2 july 2008 tc 3173 47 432 doctor henry kissinger adapted his negotiating style to match his russian counterparts in his negotiations with the ussr dr kissinger alwa ys opened with extreme demands and offers if agreement must be reached somewh ere between the two sides openi ng positions he reasoned it would make little sense to open with moderate or reasonable demand with the distance between opening positions broadened dr kissinger allowe d himself sufficient bargaining room 433 african negotiators tend to open with high to extreme dema nds this is especially evident in labor negotiations in other regions such as western eur ope less spain and scandinavia and latin america less mexico negotiators open with moderate dema nds or offers that are close to their walkaway positions american negotiators may expect them to move slowly and to make small conc essions 434 regardless of the cultural differences between am ericans and negotiators from other countries it generally is wise to aim high high opening positions lower the counterparts expectations they convey silent message that the american negotiator believe s in his case they also leave enough bargaining space to allow the counterpart to win concessions without ma terially affecting the final outcome this allows the foreign negotiator to save face and report back to his superior that he was successful directness 435 american negotiators are extremely direct they ask counterparts direct questions such s how do you feel about my proposal ameri can negotiators are timedriven and want fast results because this approach is almost entirely unique to american and certain european cultural re gions it can create tension and difficulties negotiators from most other cultures do not appr eciate such directness they perceive americans as pushy and they resent direct behavior 436 negotiators from latin america russia africa and the pacific rim are less forthright than americans in particular members of the pacifi c rim cultural regionparticularly china and japan negotiate in very indirect manner the true message from japanese negotiator for example is usually found between the lines it must be extracted from th general context of the negotiations japanese negotiator may agree with an american negotiator without ever really saying yes similarly the same individual may say yes without really agreeing he may simply be indicating that he understands the message strengthening behaviors 437 american negotiators prefer to deal with one issue at time in the united states formal presentations are favored backup information is accurate differences are dealt with directly and detailed discussions of issues are common being resultsdriven us negotiators try to get through the negotiations as quickly and effici ently as possible 438 the negotiating practices of eur opeans are somewhat similar to the united states they candidly express disagreements however they do so politely europeans nd to be more precise with facts than their american counterparts they xpect greater detail in presentations and will take time to analyze the data very closely they appreciate conceptually strong presentations they are argument ative and like to debate issues to search for flaws in the logic of the opposing position if they discover such flaw they will focus on it and fully exploit it any hesitation in answering t heir questions is normally interpreted as sign of uncertainty weak preparation unprofessional behavior or even wo rse as an indication of deceit 439 african negotiators are less intere sted in the underlying logic of position and are more prone to focus on specific facts and the details of propositions with extensive questioning and debate negotiations are often long slow and frustrating the regional tendency for collective decisionmaking helps to slow the process even more negotiators often want to consult with persons who may be affecte d by the negotiations particularly those who were not present although they prefer to discuss groups of issues they are quick to pick out the good concessions and continue negotiating the ones they dislike they will usually state any disagreements quickly at times they may disagree so fiercely th at it may come across as rudeness however care should be taken in interpre ting their gesture normally it is less negotiating tactic than normal means of expression there is good chance that offense is intended chapter 4 48 tc 3173 2 july 2008 440 russian and eastern european negotiators also expect rational presentations and will ardently argue the reliability of the fact s presented they often link issues nd discuss them in groups instead of addressing issues one at time consequently the american negotiator must be thoroughly prepare d and ready to cover multiple issues at time 441 latin american and middle east negotiators are notably passionate and argumentativ emotions play significant role during these negotiations people from these regions express themse lves strongly and vividly they frequently wave their arms speak very loudly shake their heads and throw down their pens to show their astonishment at the opposing sides positions ne gotiator who does not expect this behavior will feel uncomfortable embarrassed and perhaps even ashamed of his proposals american negotiators must be prepared to deal with these emotional dis plays and not allow them to lead to unnecessary concessions the best way to accomplish th is is to allow the opponent to carry on without reacting to it it should never be taken personally the foreign counterpart proba bly does not intend to embarrass or make the american negotiator uncomfortable it is simply part of his c ulture the worst thing an american negotiator can do when encountering this behavior is to begin making concessions such actions simply reward the counterpart for his behavior 442 negotiators from the pacific rim prefer to have large amount of information to help them decide they use considerable technical detail to back up their proposals and they expect t he same of their opponents their negotiating style is re served they will quietly and polite ly disagree negotiations can be lengthy pacific rim negotiatorsparticularly those fro m japan china and malaysialike to carefully analyze data also the group decisionmaking practiced in most pacific rim c ountries slows the negotiating process because all the members must agree note one notable exception among the pacific rim countries is singapore where it is customary to negotiate briskly movement 443 americans are tough negotiators they concede points reluctantly and save concessions until late in the negotiations when they do concede an issue that concession often is the only one they are prepared to make on the issue because they are only prone to ma ke single concession th ey tend to hold out for long time without budging when they eventually do move they normally make the entire concession in single move 444 other cultures may have different concession behaviors the successful negotiator needs to become familiar with these behaviors if the american negotia tor knows what to expect he can better prepare to adapt the strategy accordingly 445 as noted earlier consensus is important to african negotiators and they tend to base t heir decisions on this group consent this significantly slows the negotiating process and leads to an esca lating pattern of concessionmaking with the larger concessions made toward the end negotiators from th pacific rim also move slowly here too group consensus is critical 446 negotiators from russia and eastern europe tend to take an even harder line than americans or europeans they do however move very slowly this includes the granting of any concessions historically russian negotiators possess very limited authorit and must regularly report back to their principals several negotiating sessions with lengthy periods between may be necessary to complete an agreement power 447 in the united states military business and govern ment organizational power tends to spread from the top downwards the most important job in any organization is the most senior officer who has final decisionmaking power however it is common for americans to delegate much of this powe r to subordinates of middle rank officers lower down the line often are involved in key decisions middle crosscultural negotiations 2 july 2008 tc 3173 49 ranking officer may enjoy considerable power in decidi ng everyday issues he may also have full authority to negotiate on certain issues 448 in western europe organizations the involvement of middle managers in key decisions is low delegation of power is limited in eastern europe power is even more centralized and bureaucrat ic this slows the negotiating process when conducting business in europe american negotiators must ensure that the counterpart has the authority to make decisions 449 in latin america the senior officer makes decisions middleranking negotiators take their cues from the senior member of the negotiating team negotiators operating in latin ame rica must focus on convincing the negotiation leaders of the merit of their proposals 450 along the pacific rim organizational power tends to be moreorless evenly distributed among t he various levels of management decisionmaking is ba sed on group consensus the leader of the foreign delegation may not have full authority to make commitments w ith the american negotiator often however this individual does have the authority to cancel negotiations in other words although he m ay not have the authority to say yes he may have the authority to say 451 in africa organizational power often follows the hierarchy of the organization the most seni or manager makes decisions but he will consult with manag ers lower in rank the senior manager will make decisions that he believes are correct even if it runs counter to the opinion of lower m anagers american negotiators should concentrate their efforts on the most senior member while convincing the ntire group facesaving 452 although nobody likes to be embarrassed american negotiators have comparatively low need to save face during negotiations negotiations are won or lost and the american negotiator moves on to the next project negotiators from cultures such as latin am erica japan and other pacific rim countries show far greater need to save face in these countries it can be major disaster to undermine the respect and value of your opponent in the eyes of his colleagues for instance an american negotiato r should never address the person on the other side who speaks the best english the more senior person in the other team may take this as great insultone that is not easily forgiven american negotiato rs should never use curses vulgar expressions or other expletives duri ng negotiations criticism s hould not be made unless absolutely necessary and should only be done in private most importantly american negoti ators must be prepared to make concessions that the opponent can take away as win or gain formal agreements 453 americans are known for their willingness to approach the courts for legal assistance the impact of this phenomenon on negotiations is that foreigners may not trust americans who want to create extensively detailed agreements they may see it as the american negoti ators first step toward taking them to court because the foreign negotiator wants to build relationship with the pe rson with whom he is negotiating he may feel that excessive paperwork is obstructive to building trust consequentl an american negotiator must be sensitive about these cultural differences and should attempt to balance the counterparts distaste for detailed contracts with the need to secure american intere sts 454 negotiators from latin american pacific rim and middle eastern countries nd to avoid extensive written contracts they want to create relationships not paperwo rk trust is the cornerstone of their negotiations if they do not trust someone that person will have serious problem in trying to make deal with them 455 the american fondness for detailed contracts is shared by other cultures negotiators from urope for example also tend to draft thorough contracts this is also true of many african negotiato rs american negotiators should experience few pr oblems when presenting extensive wr itten agreements to negotiators people from these countries chapter 4 410 tc 3173 2 july 2008 mediation 456 negotiation in the united states often is viewed as two sides each attempting to argue one position against the other the sf advisor taking part in fore ign negotiations may be required to assume unique rolea role that does represent one side against the ot her the sf advisor may need to assume the role of mediator between two opposing parties 457 mediation is peaceful method for resolving differences nd disputes with the help of an outside intermediary many cultures fail to appreciate the value of mediation because often it is not explained properly many people do not understand the process others mistake it for arbitration where some one makes decision for the parties culture affects the way people view mediation 458 cultural differences cause inconsistencies in the xpectations of mediators in western society neutrality of the mediator is important in african society mediat ors are expected to provide advice or to offer solutions if mediator does not offer advice the african parties may feel that the media tor is ineffective and the western party may feel that the mediator is doing great job similarly if the mediator does offer advice the african may feel that the mediator is doing great job and the w estern person may feel that the mediator is biased 459 if serving as mediator the sf advisor must present neutral posi tion presenting neutrality can be difficult when the mediator comes from different background than the disputants the two disputants may view the mediator and one another with such skepticism that mediation may not be possible at all the mediator will have major task c onvincing the disputants of neutrality the mediators must find ways to prove neutrality 460 cultural differences may affect communication during mediation for example eye conta ct during mediation may be appropriate between disputants of the same culture but it may be inappropriate between disputants from other cultures in some cultures maintainin g eye contact is sign of respect in others it may be viewed as offensive disputants from diffe rent cultural backgrounds must be sensitive to the significance of every gesture 461 mediators must try to guide parties through rational problemsolving stages this may cl ash with one or both of the parties cultural decisionmaking or conflictresolution patterns certain groups use circular reasoning or passionate discussions 462 in crosscultural conflicts an enormous imbalance of power may exist particularly between majority and minority groups the more powerful party may exer t greater influence because of better negotiation skills or greater resources in order to succeed at medi ation mediator may try to redistribute the power when this happens the more powerful group may conclude that the mediator is longer neutral and may as result withdraw from the process 463 mediators must understand that cultural values and biases influence everyone they mus t realize that cultural conditioning may be the cause of the parties negative feelings toward one another although the problemsolving approach makes sense to many people others wi ll revert to confrontational stance in certain situations to be successful mediators must develop th ability not only to see the conflict clearly from his perspective but also from the pers pective of each of the disputing parties 2 july 2008 tc 3173 51 chapter 5 joint and interagency environments the sf advisor will almost always to some degree operate in joint and interagency environment working alongside other entities of the usg this environment may include formal military command and contro l c2 structures such as joint task forces jtfs frequently will involve working alongside various interagency partners and almost always will fall under the responsibility of one of the elements of the country team of us embassy culture and the operational environment 51 sf soldiers often are assigned duties that enable or facilitate interdependent operations through interface with joint or serv ice elements these soldiers may serve as staff augmentation or as part of special operations command and control element socce even in these cases sf soldiers are serving as advisors to service component or joint component commanders and staffs each with its own culture therefore sf soldiers should approach their counterparts using the fundamentals of crosscultural communication the degree to which sf soldiers are able to influ ence the actions of the hq to which they are attached will be basedto large extenton process of nego tiation the principles and techniques of crosscultural communications and negotiation also pertain to joint environments sf soldie rs acting in such capacities should study and anal yze the organization with which th ey are working and attempt to determine the cultures of that organization this holds p articularly true in joint and combined organizations 52 in this context the cultures of the supported hq will either be joint or service component culture subcultures exist even within each service components examples include army branches naval qualifications such as air surface wa rfare and submarine warfare or air force tactical strategic missile and airlift organizations 53 thorough analysis of every component subculture is beyond the scope of this publication revi ew of joint publications jps service doctrine and training literat ure and other available source material is fundamental to gaining full appreciation of joint and service cultures and subcultures carl h builders book the masks of war is one such source 54 the following sections provide brief broad generali zations of joint and service culture they must be adapted to individuals and specific units the key to effectiv ely operating in the joint arena is to consider joint and service component elements and personnel as counterparts this demands an wareness that they come from distinct cultures knowledge of the particular culture repres ented and the application of crosscultural and negotiation skills as always th key to success for the sf advisor begins with the first sof imperativeunderstand th operational environment joint culture 55 the information provided on joint and service cultu res is anecdotal it is derived from numerous interviews with former sf advisors and illustrates percept ion of joint culture from an sf advisors perspective however these perceptions represent consistent theme among those interviewed and are worthy of consideration 56 for variety of reasons there is not yet true dis tinct universal joint culture that can be easily and succinctly defined there is however great variety of joint doctrine procedures and experience in the chapter 5 52 tc 3173 2 july 2008 us armed forces particularly in the last two d ecades since the terrorist ttacks of 11 september 2001 the us armed forces have greater experience and comfort in the joint environment on the positive side representatives from each service are generally considered to be expert s in their respective fields one negative effect is that the individual members of joint hq may not understand ll the terminology and procedures of both the joint environment and the othe r individual services often leading to frustration and stress interestingly as members of joint command united states special operations command ussocom sof tend to adapt much more quickly to the challenges of joint environments than conventional service members 57 although it is difficult to define truly joint or purple culture that is universal to l joint organizations it is useful for the sf advisor to think of joint culture as an amalgam ation of service component cultures functioning at the joint level th relative importance of each service culture within this mix varies widely over timeboth between and within individual hq relative dominance by one or another service culture within given hq follows along functional or organizational lines and varies according to the mission and environment such domin ance may even vary between phases or aspects of operations sf soldiers enabling interdependent ope rations must observe and analyze joint hq to determine which cultures are dominant under what circ umstances this analysis becomes the basis for crosscultural communications withand the infl uencing ofparticipating joint organizations 58 relative dominance by component service culture results from several factors careful ana lysis of these factors while observing and analyzing the actions and responses of the target hq can assist the sf soldier in determining the key aspects of the dominant service cu lture these factors include the z background and service affiliation of the unit commander z background and service affiliati on of key staff personnel z type of unit z nature of the mission or task z origin and type of subordinate operational units z origin and type of subordinate support units z service expertise associated with function or aspect of the mission z applicable joint or service doctrine 59 each service has its own distinct culture given the importance of the individual service cultures brief review of some of the most relevant points is listed below service component culture 510 each service has its own culture and subcultures detailed knowledge of the characteristics of each is the product of research study and experience servi ce documents particularly doctrine are an excellent start point for research and an advisor should re flect upon his experience and the experience of other advisors in dealing with the different service cultures army 511 there are number of distinct qualities that make up us army culture these qualities include adherence to standards selfless servi ce human focus the view of warfa re as an art and an acceptance of joint and interdependent operations adherence to standards 512 the army encourages the enforcem ent of standards and discipline which are clearly defined in army regulations and procedures although highly disciplined the average sf advisor may put little emphasis on uniform and appearance particularly in combat environment this would be mista ke however when the sf advisor deals with conventional its of the us army in such scenarios the sf advisor would benefit by conforming as much as possible to standard army policies for example w earing an issued soft cap instead of nonissued baseball cap such inconsistencies in appearance may cause tension between conventional and unconventional forces tension that is easily avoidable joint and interagency environments 2 july 2008 tc 3173 53 selfless service 513 the army feels deeply its attachment to the people of the country this may be attributed to the relative importance of the individual soldier drawn from the cit izenry into the service this reliance tends to lead the army to view itself as humble servant of the nation as result the army culture does not promote perceived grandstanding or showoffs and re jects perceived arrogant behavior if sf advisors maintain standards of behavior befitting quiet professionals they should have problems human focus 464 often expressed as equipping the man not manning the equipment this focus contrasts w ith the systemsfocused approach of the navy and air for ce the marine corps shar in the armys human focus view of warfare as an art 514 although the army still applies the tools of military science such as ba ttle calculus the army generally remains adverse to reliance on mathematical model s and other purely quantitative tools to predict outcomes or evaluate combat capability within certain branch of the army such as the field artillery engineer and armor branches there tends to be more of focus on the scien tific approach overall however the army sees warfare more as an art more than as science and frequently uses the term operational art to describe its approach to operati ons this view flows naturally from its human focus acceptance of joint and interdependent operations 515 the army has long accepted the necessity of join t operations reliance on the other services for deployment logistics nd other support are contribut ors to this attitude navy 516 it is important for the sf advisor to recognize and understand number of distinct qualities that make up usn culture these qualities include an adherence to trad ition an independence of command and strong focus on ranks and specialties adherence to tradition 517 the navy is perhaps the most tr aditional of the services although this dedication to tradition has certain positive implications it also l eads some conventional navy personnel to be very resistant to change sf soldiers must be respectful of navy traditions likewise every attempt should be ma to articulate ideas and operational concepts in professional ma nner consistent with existing navy thinking independence of command 518 for obvious reasons there can be only one captain of ship at sea because of the historical isolation of ships at sea the navy tends to vest more discretionary authorit in the captains of its vessels than other services grant to their subordinate commanders na vy units and personnel tend be less accustomed to routine external interference and out side presence than other services sf soldiers should be sensitive to this fact stress their role as an enabler and avoid the appearance of interfering w ith the prerogatives of the commander emphasis on ranks and specialties 519 the navy is scrupulously conscious of ranks and specialties and maintains distinctions betwee n those specialties rank separation is significantly more pronounced than in the other services sf soldiers accustomed to relative informality should take care not to inadvertently give false impression of irreverence for military structure and deference to rank chapter 5 54 tc 3173 2 july 2008 air force 520 there are number of distinct qualities that make up usaf cultu re these qualities include focus on technology and science an emphasis on pilots an emphasis on targeting and powerful selfimage focus on technology and science 521 the air force is technologyoriented and tends to view warfare as science that is domina ted by interface of humans and systems appli cations of technology are viewed as solutions to most if not all problems associated with warfare and national security the air force is generally more inclined to depend on the type and capability of specific system rather than on their n umbers this reliance on highcost lowdensity equipment may have im plications for risk acceptance emphasis on pilots 522 air force combat doctrine traditionally is based around the employment of pilote d aircraft as result pilots are far more likely than their nonpilot counterparts to ve ultimate decisionmaking authority and greater understanding of the application of force large portions of the air force exist to s upport the pilots in their mission as such pilots tend to be more individualistic and tend to have greater social standing similarly other members of the air force on flying duty are sidered to be more elite than those in support nonflying roles emphasis on targeting 523 the air force is extremely targetoriented and conducts tactical targeting on an operationa l scale very efficiently and more effectively than any other service the technological orientati on of the air force lends itself to complex systems that match appropriate platforms to targets the human dimensions of warfarethat is those that are not related to humanmachine interfacecan be subordinated to quantifiable target destruction speed and precision are valued far more highly than persistence and endurance powerful selfimage 524 the air force sees itself as the new combat ar m of decision the air force views air power particularly strategic airpoweras decisive and pot entially independent of the other services the air force views rapid decisive operations as key air force endeavor marine corps 525 the marine corps has culture independent of but related to the navy some aspects of the usmc culture include stress on contingency operati ons and unique view of joint operations stress on contingency operations 526 the marine corps is contingency force marines consider themselves an elite force designed to conduct rapid and violent operations longterm actions are viewed as resourcedraining affairs that are generally ceded to the army stressing the longterm commitment associated w ith many sf missions is far more likely to generate cooperation with marine elements than is an attem pt to articulate unique capabilities not resident in the corps unique view of joint operations 527 the marine corps generally is comfortable w ith joint operations because naval operations incorporate both the navy and mari ne corps given navy and marine air assets marine ground capability and navy maritime capabilities the marine corps is re luctant to integrate bey ond the fleet marine air assets are rarely ceded to the control of joint force air component commander jfacc lthough other service support is generally accepted the marine co rps generally prefers operational concepts supported by organic assets of the combined na vy fleet and the fleet marine force joint and interagency environments 2 july 2008 tc 3173 55 528 the recent development of the united states ma rine corps forces

strategic end states of so interagency operations facilitate unity and consistency of effort maximize the use of national resources and reinforce primacy f the political element joint hq conducts interagency coordination nd planning for certain missions the joint hq may delegate authority to the component for direct coordination with other agencies 529 in all cases the component must ensure appropriate authority exists for direct coordination components may in certain special missions work directly with or for another governm ent agency in such cases direct coordination is authorized and command arrangements are specified based on the situation 530 the office of the secretary of defense osd and th joint staff coordinate interagency operations at the strategic level this coordination

determine specific command relationships for each operation this command arrangement must cl early establish responsibility for the planning and execution of each phase of the operation 533 in addition to extensive usg coordination commanders must also fully integrate opera tions into local efforts when appropriate such integration requires close coordination with local government agencies and bureaus local military paramilitary or police forces and multinational partners structure such as mixed military working group composed of nior officials of the m ilitary and other agencies may assist such an effort belligerent parties also may be included 534 the tasks that sf units and individuals execute often evolve from foreign assistance programs the activities within these programs range from disasterrelief measures to ec onomic and military assistance it is important therefore for sf soldiers to have an overview of us foreign assistance organizations and collective security agencies and their responsibilities agendas 535 each agency has its own organizational agenda whic h generally is shaped by us policy however interpretations of policies and authorities sometimes vary between government agencies and sometimes even within the ag encies themselves this may at times make achieving unity of effort very difficult the key to success for the sf advisor is to assess the ope rational environment gain an understanding of the interplay between the various agendas and pers onalities involved and empl oy rapportbuilding and negotiating skills to best support the mission

programs that assist friendly foreign countries to tablish and maintain an adequate defense posture these programs also help them to improve internal security and resist external aggression 545 the

rument for most forms of support to friends and allies however its budgetary process makes it largely longrange preventive tool rather than shortrange reactive tool the security assistance budget is part of the do s program 150 foreign assistance budget the budgetplanning cycle takes approximately 2 years to respond to new progra m requirements moreover the general budgetary climate in which it evolves tends to be extremely limited due to these constraints the united states must usua lly engage in longrange programs of mutual defense planning with friend or ally specific security assist ance initiatives are especially effective in cases where the friend or ally already has sound financial program for its own defense 548 there are limited special emergency authorities in the foreig n assistance act faa and the arms export control act aeca which the president may use in crisis to speed up the budgeta ry process nevertheless they rarely are used and if used allow for relatively low levels of usg financing 549 when the united states provides security assistance to hn pr imary concern is the hns ability to plan and manage its defense resources by and for itself h n military organizations may never develop this ability additionally some hns may continue to re quest help when it is longer needed that is in areas where they have alread achieved selfsufficiency chapter 5 58

information engagement and media relations the field of information operations io is vitally important to all aspects of sf operations and it continues to develop nd grow io is covered in fm 313 information operations doctrine tactics techniques and procedures the armys capstone manual for operationsfm 30 operations specifically addresses information superiority and its components to include information engagement public affairs guidance stems from military regulations including army regulation ar 3601 the army public affairs program department of the army pamphlet da pam 360512 code of the us fighting force and da pam 360544 you and the law overseas fm 3611 public affairs tactics techniques and procedures is useful tool for the sf advisor to use to assist the counterparts planning for public affairs every special forces group airborne has public affairs office pao gccs and theater socs also have paos these offices can provide public affairs guidance on request paos are capable of providing the advisor with guidance on issues statements and media interaction information superiority 61 twentyfirst century conflicts occur in operational environments f instant communications information systems are everywhere exposure to news and opinion media is pervasive the pace of change is increasing and individual actions can have immedi ate strategic implications information shapes the operational environment at every level 62 information superiority is the operational advantage deriv ed from the ability to collect process and disseminate an uninterrupted flow of information while exploiti ng or denying an adversarys ability to do the same jp 313 it is imperative that us and allied forces c apitalize on the synergy between informational and other operational activities ther efore sf advisors must understand information superiority and advise hn counterparts to integrate it into fullspectrum operations as carefully as fires maneuver protection and sustainment sf advisors must build partner capacity in this cri tical mission area promoting informational activity nd capability by with and through hn fo rces therefore the sf advisor must ensure hn counterparts can understand visualize describe and direct efforts that contri bute to information superiority as described in fm 30 th army divides these contributors into four primary areas z army information tasks are tasks used to shape the operational environment z intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr activities are conducted to develop knowledge about the operational envi ronment this is an integr ated intelligence and operations function and one which is already thoroughly and historically integrated into sf operations z knowledge management is the art of using information to increase knowledge which enhances situational awareness sa at specific times and places and general s ituational understanding z information management is the science of using information systems and methods 63 of the four primary areas mentioned above inform ation tasks frequently are the most relevant and challenging tasks that an sf advisor must face on r outine basis particularly given the twentyfirst centurys operational environment of instant communica tions the army recognizes five information tasks chapter 6 62 tc 3173 2 july 2008 to shape the operational environmentinformation engagement c2 warfare information protection operations security opsec and military deception th sf advisor needs to prio ritize information tasks based on the hns capabilities and strengths 64 within the area of information tasks sf advisors can have the greatest impact by focusing on the task of information engagement the basic reason fo r this is that land operations occur among populations and as every sf soldier knows the key terrain in sf operations is the human terrain this s imple fact requires ground forces to constantly contend with attitudes and percep tions of populations within and beyond their ao therefore sf advisors working w ith hn counterparts use information engagement in their aos to communicate information build trust nd confidence promote support for friendly operations and influence perceptions and behavior information ngagement is the integrated employment of several important capabilities as described in fm 30 those capabil ities and their intended effects include the following z public affairs media relations to info rm us and other friendly audiences z psyop combat camera government strategic communications defense support to public diplomacy and other means necessary to influence foreign audiences z leader and soldier engagements to support the efforts listed above 65 todays operational environment yields key and of ten decisive advantage to the side which best leverages information as result sf advisors need to enable their hn counterparts to provide personal leadership direction and attention to fully integrating informa tion integrating information tasks into all operations requires including them in the operations process from the inception this further requires incorporating cultural awareness relevant social and politica l factors and other informational aspects into mission planning and execution given this reality the follow ing informationengagement capabilities deserve particular attention as the sf advisor can directly influence them z first leader and soldier engagement is funda mental and highly effective method to influence people this involves facetoface f2f interaction by leaders and soldiers that influences the perceptions of the local populace in sf common aspect of this f2f engagement is frequently referred to as key leader engagement kle deliberate process in wh ich sf meet with local and regional opinionshapers examples include local tribal elders elected or appointed officials military and police co mmanders and even ngo leaders z second combat camera is used to document wi range of tactical and operational successes and to counter enemy propaganda if there is dedicated hn combatcamera capability the sf advisor should recommend that hn soldier be designated equipped and trained for this function if that is not possible the sf advisor should obtain di gital camera and if necessary photograph relevant hn activities himself positiv photographs can have tremendous effect on information engagement and digital photos are easily taken and transmitted z third public affairs media relations can have profound and lasting effect on international perceptions of success or failure of operations these effects may have strategic consequences even when dealing with tactical operations this subject is co vered in detail in the next section beginning with paragraph 67 66 sf advisors must ensure hn counterparts focus th eir information engageme nt activities on achieving desired effects locally however because land operati ons always occur in broader regional and even global context informationengagement activities mu st support and complement those of the higher hq hn and usg strategic communications guidance when available and broader hn and usg policy where applicable use of the media 67 the most difficult portion of information engage mentwhen necessaryinvolves dealing with the media media contacts normally should be handled by the appropriate pao however this i s not always possible and silence is not always the best soluti on refusal to speak with accredited members of the media may create strong negative impressions with strategic implications information superiority information engagement and media r elations 2 july 2008 tc 3173 63 68 when information is withheld journalists often fall back on speculation such speculation is usually inaccurate however it is often near enough to the truth that it is accepted by large sections of the public and in some situations by established governments pa rtisan sources may find it advantageous to leak part of story to the press in order to build up public support for their positi on on occasion such activities can grow into fully orchestrated press campaigns 69 with modern satellites and communications technol ogy media are able to distribute reports and photographs faster than the information can be released by the chain of command incidents sometimes fabricated or slanted toward partisan viewpoint may be aired in living rooms across the globe the same day however this potential liability can be turned into major ad vantage for those prepared to deal with the media as the media provide powerful and farreaching opportunity to communicate with critical audiences therefore the sf advisor and hn count erparts frequently are in position to correct misconceptions and provide accuracy ad equate context and proper charact erization in timely fashion communication with the press 610 sf advisors must strive to convey positive impr ession and enhance the relationship between the press and the military official published pao guidance and command po licies regarding anonymity and opsec must be observed however if deemed accep table within the above gui delines advisors should attempt to z maintain list of trusted reporters and editors that cover the perations in the teams ao and keep them informed of significant activities z answer media inquiries promptly accurately and courteously if the answer is not known the advisor should attempt to find out and get back to the reporter or refer the reporter to another appropriate source this may establish the team as helpful information source and velop relationship for future balanced coverage z find out reporters deadlines and use them to the friendly forces advantage z stress the human aspects of story the impact of opposing operations on people that readers viewers or listeners can identify with advisors should point out the needs of the unfortunat and the fact sf soldiers and hn counterparts are working to address those needs z encourage the media to see what hn and sf soldiers are doing and to talk to them about t heir jobs advisors should identify location in advan ce for the press to take photos and videotapes z avoid reacting emotionally when reporters or editors appear sk eptical or hostile discuss issues calmly use facts to back up statemen ts and maintain focus on the mission advisor interviews 611 what advisors say or do can impact the mission consistency with national policy professionalism and clear communications are imperative to successful interview advisors should z know and follow the policies of the gcc us embassy and pao regarding media interviews z maintain general attitude that is friendly yet professional and learn and use reporters names z use language that is clear and easy to understand and avoid military jargon or terminology that others can misinterpret z remain positive greet the interviewer and welcome questions this may be difficult under stressful or tragic conditions however calm mature appearance earns respect from audiences z prepare notes and study them carefully advisors should never walk into an interview unprepared and should ensure that the facts suppor ting their position are up to date and come to mind easily z anticipate possible questions and think about various responses advisors should rehearse on location if possible and if time permits roleplay the tough questions z get to know the interviewers advisors should research their organizations the view s their organizations possess or try to defend their agendas and how they previously conducted interviews chapter 6 64 tc 3173 2 july 2008 z keep the interests of the local nationals or other beneficiaries of the miss ion at the forefront advisors should avoid talking from the point of view of us interests z answer only one question at time advisors should finish the first answer before going to another question if two or more questions are asked at the same time z avoid speculation and give only factual information that can be verified z use caution in quoting statistics as such data may be easily dis puted or reinterpreted z be careful when repeating questions if question contains incorrect information or inflammatory language advisors should not repeat it as this may result in misquote z strive to tell the truth if unsure of something the advisor should admit it it is better to admit ignorance than mistakenly lie z avoid exaggeration or claims that cannot be backed up z refuse all offtherecord discussions as there is such thing advisors should expect any statement to be quoted z avoid the phrase comment it makes it appear as if the advisor has something to hide z resist the temptation to attack other groups or organizations and avoi d committing information fratricide fm 313 if questioned about another agencys activities the advisor should refer to that agency for comment advisors should not speak for other organizations z remind reporters that photographing recognizable dead soldiers charts maps supply depots or electronic warfare ew assets is off limits z remind reporters that their personal security is not primary military c oncern z maintain objectivity advisors are representatives of the usg and must c onduct themselves accordingly personal opinions and beliefs should be kept for mo re appropriate time and place team interviews 612 although the pao normally has responsibility for dea ling with the press it is unlikely that deployed team will have pao representative ccasions may arise when the hn press will want to question advisors if conducted properly these interviews can assist in the mission and may even improve morale when preparing team members for an interview advisors should z identify the team spokesman ahead of time and keep this individual informed z provide team members with simple theme to convey to the press should they be in terviewed z conduct rehearsals in front of video cameras during mock interviews to practice communi cation of the theme z select interviewees based on their understanding of the theme covered not their comfort level in front of reporter shyness is normal trait that may add human touch to sensitive situation responding to misinformation 613 if the media has reported or quoted in an inaccurate and damaging manner the advisor must use caution in deciding coa advisors inform their chain of command and consider the following questions z is it important enough to correct or is it detail thatin the long termis not really important z how damaging is the charge criticism or error will correction si mply give greater visibility to an unfavorable point of view z is correction worth restatement of the entire problem to new audiences who did not read or see it the first time is it possible to target only the audience originally expose d to the story z can significant gain result from pointing it out 614 when misinformation is released to public through government or media sources the coa taken by the advisor will be unique to the situation but it must include plan to ensure that relevant government officials and the media recognize the inaccuracy of the information this may prevent future incidents of misinformation operational and combat experience since 2001 shows that in the struggl for information superiority it is critical to be candid and honest and to not allow enemy lies to stand unchallenged particularly in areas of great international interest 2 july 2008 tc 3173 a1 appendix advisor checklists initial contact a1 the predeployment

public school or road whereas the sf advisor thinks the village most needs well or clinic the need that the local peopl feel often is the best starting point regardless of its comparative appendix b b6 tc 3173 2 july 2008 merits once this aim is addressed people are more likely to be appreciative and cooperativethey begin to raise their expectations and become interested in working for other improvements in order to address the initial desires of the people the advisor may need to call in personnel with the speciali zed skills needed for the particular project although th is can result in somewhat of lay it will help the advisor to achieve greater cooperation over time work within the local cultural framework b8 the sf advisor needs to understand such basic cultural matters as the ethnic backgrounds of t he people family relationships leadership patterns value systems and the technologic level of the people as related to ways of making living he also needs some knowledge of local services s uch as health education communications and tran sportation many things will depe nd upon the advisors realism in the cultural field for instance the extent to which cally available physical re sources can be used help people believe they can improve their situation b9 the vast majority of the traditional peoples of south america as ia and africa live in largely static environment through their experience with change they are more fearful of losing status than they are hopeful of bettering their condition therefore changes suggested by advisors are often viewed with fear concrete local projects that yield eas ily observed benefits are helpful in convincing the villagers that they can improve their situation and make them mo re willing to cooperate in other projects be content with small beginnings b10 change tends to come slowly in areas where th ere have been few in recent times it is good to remember that historically speaking most scientific developments in the west occurred only recently the advisor should keep in mind that knowledgetechnical or otherwiseis cumulative once sm all beginning has been made greater activity and additi onal changes soon follow it is easier to achieve momentum than it is to maintain it the important th ing is for the advisor to make start within as promising framework as possible and with the support needed to sustain the momentum achieved utilize local organizations and recognize their leaders b11 people respond best when their local organizations are recognized as important and useful program is unlikely to succeed unless it is carried forward within the local organizational framework the recognized local leaders must be consulted and encouraged to make contributions as th ey can well conceived technical activity reflects cr edit on the local leaders associated with it attention must be given not only the officials and the family heads of local groups but also to the quiet behindthescene s leaders the surest way for an activity to be continued after the sf advisor leav is for it to have been launched and carried forward within the local or ganizational and leadership framework help the government get organized to serve the people b12 in order for the advisor to be most effective he must understand the local government organization and how his activity fits into the overall scheme there should already be set of greements between various local agencies and the national government usu ally through some sort of interministerial council that provides for coordinated effort in servicing the varied needs of the local people the sf advisor may need to work with appropriate agen cies to assist in getting such ag reements made if such agreements already exist sf advisors should be careful to recognize and strengthen them the work of t he advisor in one field is most meaningful when properly coordinated with the contributions of individuals and age ncies in other fields train and utilize subprofessional multipurpose local workers b13 selected young people in the villages can be tr ained and used as subpr ofessional multipurpose village workers to enable the advisor to make the best use of his t ime otherwise the sf soldiers influence cultural checklists 2 july 2008 tc 3173 b7 is restricted to where he is standing and the immediate vicinity furthermore th advisor may spend so much of his time establishing and maintaining enough ra pport with the villagers he may become incapable of rendering any real service at all the gap between the local population and the sf advisor is usually formidable one because of the great educational and cultural differences between them often the advisor works with villagers who are poor illiterate and devoi d of outside contacts vo lunteer or paid local workers who serve as liaison between the villagers and the adviso rs have proven of great help in getting the benefits of subjectmatter technical activities expect slow progress b14 as the local people begin to see successes from thei r joint efforts and begin to have new hope they naturally want larger hand in their own matters the advisor may so metimes feel they want to assume more responsibility than they are ab to carry these evidences of gr owing pains should be appreciated for they are necessary part of becoming able to assume responsibility they indicate that the local population is beginning to believe they can do more and more things for themselves the advisor needs to adjust to the growing desires of the people to help themselves transfer controls constructively b15 the matter of institutionbuilding is challenge to sf advis ors they need to help the local people see how they can build the newwhat they wantupon the foundations of the oldwhat th ey already have from the beginning of project the team needs to envision at least roughly and discuss with local leaders the various types of training of local personnel needed the means by which needed financi support can be had and the several progressive transfer s of responsibilities that are to be made before the full operation of the activity can be relinquished if ope rating responsibility is transferred too early there likely will be some breakageusually of material things if on the ot her hand the team keeps control too long the local people who have want ed to take over may become disillu sioned with them or even hate them for not relinquishing control to them when they thought it should have been the team mus t work out with local leaders the timing of the phasing out each technical activity that is started expect gratitude from those helped b16 people who benefit from assistance sometimes feel fensive in accepting assi stance they are in sense admitting their own insufficiency the selfesteem of person community or nation as whole is delicate thing the team should not therefore expect thanks rather the team should pproach the people in spirit of fraternity and humility taking satisfaction in the progress they may make the team should do its job the best it can and accept work well done as is its own reward this page intentionally

mmunication but there are situations where they may be necessary these indi viduals may be the only link between the advisor and his counterpart or other important local nationals the sf advisor must strive to maximize interpreters strengths and anticipate their weaknesses age gender and race c2 factors of gender age and race are potentially troublesome and can seriously affect your mission because differences from country to country vary greatly advisors should check with the incountry briefing teams for specific taboos or favorable characteristic s in certain cultures for example the status of females in the society is such that they should not be used as interpreters with ma sources time c3 when planning communications advisors must allow additional time for interpreters to do their job 10minute conversation may take up to 30 minutes depending on the interpreters ability advisors should plan accordingly when scheduling meetings rank and military affiliation c4 advisors must consider rank when planning for interviews if the interviewees are officers i t would be better to have an officer or civilian act as interpreter if the sou rces are enlisted an officer interpreter might intimidate them and stifle participation and interactio n c5 interpreters are usually contracted civilians they may not be accustomed to military methods hardships discipline and courtesies other considerations c6 when working with interpreters there are number of other factors that the advisor must consider advisors should z try to use twoman interpreter teams as one may catch what the other missed or forgot z avoid organizing interpreters in to interpreter pools this detr acts from their ability to react quickly to unexpected situations z keep opsec in mind and assume the interpreters first loyalty is to his c ountry not the united states z prepare the interpreter for technical terms the interpreter must know the subject rea and translate the advisors meaning as well as his words z establish rapport with the interpreter thr ough personal contact without cooperative supportive interpreter the mission could be in serious jeopardy z learn the interpreters background and show genui ne concern for his family aspirations and education z doublecheck that the interpreters understands many may attempt to save face by purposely concealing their lack of understanding appendix c c2 tc 3173 2 july 2008 z instruct the interpreter to mirror the tone and personality of advisors speech z instruct the interpreter not to interject his own questions or perso nality z avoid such phrases as tell him that and i would like to have you say z avoid looking at the interpreter during discussion remain focused on the other person z break thoughts into small logical translatable segments z avoid idioms jokes milita ry jargon and slang z control the interpreter the advisor should inform him or her to never ask questions of their own and to never paraphrase the interviewers question or the sources answers z instruct the interpreter to never hold back information given by the source such withholding regardless of how insignificant the interpreter may feel it to be may adversely affect the conversation and the mission z test the interpreter periodically for accuracy loya lty and honesty control of the interpreter is increased if he knows that he is periodically tested z avoid bullying criticizing or admonishing the interpreter in the presence of the source the advisor should criticize in private to avoid lowering interpreters prestige and thereby impairing his effectiveness checking interpreters we were checking on the condition of gr oup of elderly people in croat village and i was in the background the interpreter who didnt think i could hear asked the people if theyd had any problems or had t hey been harassed recently they said they had that group of soldiers from local unit had been around stealing and threatening to kill them if they reported anyth ing and then the interpreter said to the team leader these people have had problems you have to realize youre completely at the mercy of the interpreters if you dont possess some understanding of the language at the mercy of people who may be discussing arresting you or taking you hos tage and you dont even realize that you are in danger former sf advisor bosnia c7 the use of interpreters and translators seems very straightforwardthe advisor simply speaks in english and the interpreter repeats it in the appropria language however transl ation should not be taken lightly obviously language is vital to communication across cultures but language can so be the source of many misunderstandings in intercultural communication c8 translators and especially interpreters are seldom native speakers of both languages norma lly they are native speakers of one language with training in the other this means that they have good command of the formal language when used correctly and by speaker with an accent they are familiar with challenges when working with interpreters c9 there are number of challenges the advisor must overcome when working with interpreters these challenges include z translation z pronunciation z word choice and meaning z slang and idiomatic expressions working with translators and interpreters 2 july 2008 tc 3173 c3 translation c10 in communicating with people of different culture advisors should use at least few words or phrases in their language it is even better to have sufficient command of the language to be able to ensure that the interpreter or translator is not straying from the desired mes sage c11 there is strong tendency to translate message s literally wordforword from the speakers language to the target language this technique may wo rk well but it can lead to embarrassing situations pronunciation c12 misunderstandings in intercultural communication can arise even when two cultures us the same language even though english is used widely thr oughout the world regional differences exist in pronunciation this can make it difficult for speakers of english from two different countriesor even two different regions of the same c ountryto understand one another c13 english is one of the official languages of singapore it is often used as lingua francafor official communicationbetween the various language subgroups on the island and is often used by government officials and businessmen to communicate with their countrymen however englishspe aking foreigners frequently have difficulty understa nding because of the differences in pronunciation to americans singaporeans do not clearly pronounce words with similar beginning and ending sounds words such as tree and three or pen and pan become garbled this can lead to misunderstandings despite sharing common language word choice and meaning c14 advisors must use caution in selecting words to translate ambiguous and unfamiliar words should be avoided ambiguous words c15 the same word may have different interpretations in different cultures in most parts of asia for example the word family refers to parents siblings grandparents uncles aunts cousins and so on to an american or european family usually refers to the immediate family if two colleaguesone asian and one americanwere to carry on conve rsation about their families they may think that they are talking about the same thing but actually they are not unfamiliar words c16 the use of unfamiliar words can sometimes lead to expensive stakes for example in fictional discussion between an american businessman and japanese customer the american concludes by saying well then our thinking is in parallel they bid goodbye but months pass without further word finally the frustrated american inquires as to why the japanese customer replied you used word i did not understand parallel i looked it up in my dictionary and it sa id parallel means two lines that never touch the customer concluded that the amer ican businessman thought their positions were irreconcilable c17 in order to avoid miscommunications advisors s hould take simple measures to achieve greater clarity in meaning they choose words carefully ensuring they are unambiguous and easily unde rstood qualifications and definitions shoul d be provided for terms that are likely to be misunderstood finally advisors should never assume that the message wa s correctly understood instead they should ask for feedback to ensure the audience clearly understood the message as intended slang and idiomatic expressions c18 cultures develop their own slang and idiomatic expr essions that may be foreign to other cultures using the same language for example australians commonly refer to friend as mate but in the united states the word mate primarily refers to spouse idiomatic expressions can be especially appendix c c4 tc 3173 2 july 2008 confusing for nonnative speakers who are not very pr oficient with the language for example pulling someones leg is common idiomatic expression for joking around but an interpreter unfamiliar with this expression would be puzzled because obviously he had not even touched the speakerlet alone pulled on their leg because the world abounds in languages nd dialects and because it is often impossible to predict well in advance where sf advisor may be nt he may lack the linguistic ability to communicate effectively 2 july 2008 tc 3173 d1 appendix d nongovernmental and intergovernmental organizations in the course of performing advisory duti the sf soldier frequently will work in environments alongside large array of organizations agencies and groups in addition to the more familiar joint and in teragency environment of usg operations the operational arena increasingly contains wide variety of ngos and igos means methods organization and philosophy d1 the means methods organization and philosophy of most ngos and igos are very different from us military and governmental agenci however because these organiza tions play such vital role in development and humanitarian assistance programs the advisor must have some understanding of thes differences d2 ngos are transnational organizations made up of priv ate citizens that maintain consultative status with the economic and social council of the united nations ngos may be professional associations foundations multinationa l businesses or simply groups of individuals li nked by common interest in humanitarian assistance activities the term ngo has been xpanded in recent years to include the full range of nongovernmental relief developmen t and assistance organizations regardless of status d3 igos are organizations with global influence such as the and the international commit tee of the red cross icrc these organizations normally have official status of some kind to include defined privileges and responsibilities under international law d4 when dealing with ngos and igos the sf advisor should recognize number of characteristic s that are common to most such organizations for exam ple most ngos and igos are just as committed to their cause as the sf soldier is to his these organizations usua lly stress impartiality neutrality and independence above all else members of ngos and igos may have incountry experience th at vastly exceeds that of the sf advisor and they are essential in the transition to peace these organizations are generally opposed to assuming subor dinate or juniorpartner status with military personnel ngos and igos have central command and va ry widely in their willingness to work with the military some may be suspicious of the sf advisor and his purpose some may be willing to work nearbut not withthe military some perceive information gathering as interrogation united nations agencies and other international organizations d5 the emergencymanagement apparatus reorga nized and streamlined in 1992 has humanitarian

regional government organizations such as the organization of african unity oau the organiza tion of american states oas also included are subregional groups such as the economic community of west african states ecowas which is very active in liberia as with the ag encies these igos are characterized by their special status as legal entities under certain tenets of international law private nongovernmental organizations d8 private international organizations are in effect groups of ngos they are usually composed of individual national chapters and in clude worldwide and regional ins titutions involved in humanitarian missions examples of private international organizations i nclude the icrc the league of red cross and red crescent societies these organizations operate around the world independently of any government and may also enjoy special status as legal entities under international law d9 donor agencies are primarily national government funding organizations that provide official resources for development and relief they also provide much of the funding for ngos the principal donor agencies represent national governments directly or indirectly and include usaid the canadian international development agency cida the ja pan international cooperation agency jica the uks overseas development agency and the european community humanitarian organization echo which coordinates the efforts of several european government agencies the world bank and regional development banks are also donor agencies responding to the gui dance of their multiple members although the banks do not play role in relief efforts they are increasingly seeking ways to be responsive during reconstruction d10 there are thousands of individual ngos operating around the world some like the international rescue committee irc world vision cooperative for assistance and relief every where care christian childrens fund save the children and catholic relief services are regist ered in the united states and conduct their missions overseas others like oxford famine relief oxfam and médecins sans frontières doctors without borders msf opera out of other developed countries and partake in activities around the world other ngos are indigenous to the countries where relief and development needs exist d11 ngos differ in size resource base thematic nd geographic focus and access to and use of technology among other things some ngos are quite largefor example cares total support and revenue top 450 millionwhereas many others have operati ng budgets of less than 10000 the origin of funding may also vary greatly from ngo to ngo these organizations may be funded by z public resources such as grants and contract s from donor government agencies and international organizations z private resources such as contributions from individuals religious groups communities foundations and businesses in the form of either money or giftsinkind d12 most ngos rely upon combination of public and private funding however some ngos decline to accept government funding so as not to be compromi sed by specific government policy interests ngo personnel rosters vary according to funding and mission larger ngos have greater ability to respond to unexpected contingencies because of their increased resource base nongovernmental and intergovernmental organizations 2 july 2008 tc 3173 d3 d13 1995 report on global governance suggested that there were approximately 29000 international ngos domestic ngos have grown even fa ster in russia where almost none existed before the fall of communism there are at least 65000 such organizations dozens more are created dail around the world d14 some ngos are primarily helpersdistributing relie f where it is needed others ngos are mainly campaigners existing to promote issues their members deem important the general public tends to see them as uniformly altruistic idealistic and independent this is not always the case d15 growing

food delivered by the wfp body is actually distributed by n gos between 1990 and 1994 the proportion of european union eu relief aid channeled through ngos rose from 47 to 67 percent the icrc estimates that ngos now disburse more money than the world bank the big eight d16 eight major federations of international ngos control majority of worldwide annual relief funding known collectively

et solidarité international cooperation for development and solidarity or cidse z association of protestant development organizations in europe apdove types of nongovernmental organizations d17 by their very nature most ngos are charitable some ngos involve topdown effort that demands little participation by the recipients this type of ngo conducts activities directed toward meeting the needs of the poor for example the distribution of food clothing or medicine or the provision of housing transport and schools ngos of this type may also undertake relief activities during natural or manmade disasters such ngos often are criticized as being overly paternalis ticpromoting dependence rather than local development and autonomy d18 other ngos are participatory these organizations are characterized by selfhelp projects where local people are involved particularly in the implementation of project by contributing cas h tools land materials and labor in the classi cal communitydevelopment project participation begins with the need definition and continues into the planning and im plementation stages cooperatives often have participatory orientation d19 the aim of such participatory ngos is to help poor people develop clearer understanding of the social political and economic factors affecting their lives and to strengt hen their awareness of their own potential power to control their destiny sometimes these groups develop spontaneously around problem or issue at other times outside workers from ngos facilitate their development regardless of their conception this type of organization is characterized by maximum involvement of the people with the ngo acting as facilitator d20 many communitybased organizations emerge out of individual and collective initiative these might include sports clubs womens organizations neighbor hood associations religious groups or educational organizations there are large variety of these organizationssome are supported by ngos igo s or bilateral or international agencies others operate independently some communitybased organizations are appendix d d4 tc 3173 2 july 2008 devoted to raising the consciousness of the urban poor or helping them to understand their rights in gaining access to needed services others are involved in providing such services advantages of nongovernmental organizations d21 ngos may enjoy number of advantages over th eir military counterpart s when operating in foreign region some of these advantages include the following z they have the ability to experime nt freely with innovative approaches and if necessary to take risks z they are flexible in adapting to local situations responding to local needs and devel oping integrated projects z they enjoy good rapport with people and can rende r microassistance becau they can identify those who are most in need nd tailor assistance accordingly z they have the ability to communicate at all vels from the neighborhood to the top levels of government z they are able to recruit both experts and highly mo tivated staff with fewer restrictions than the military or ogas disadvantages of nongovernmental organizations d22 along with the advantages ngos enjoy there are number of disadvantages that they must overcome these disadvantages include the following z paternalistic attitudes that restrict the degree of participat ion in program or project design z restricted or constrained ways of approach to problem or area z reduced replicability of ideas and programs due to uniqueness or narrow focus of the project or selected area relatively small project coverage and dependence on outside financial resources z territorial possessiveness of an area or project between agencies such turf wars are common m ilitary nongovernmental organization interaction d23 ngos cannot be viewed as single homogeneous gr oup they represent many countries and many organizations throughout the world each with its own agenda and desired outcome of assistance some ngos are very cooperative and work well with the milita ry others such as the icrc accept military help with great reluctance others are unwilling to cooperate w ith the military at all such as msf msf is very active in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief work worldwide however it has stated that ngos cannot maintain their impartiality nd independence of action once they ag ree to act in coordination with or effectively under the coordination of military structure some ngos may continue to pay bribes and extortion fees to bandits even while military forces are in t he area to protect them these organizations consider the longterm scenario they believe that if they dont pay the fees now things will be worse after the military forces redeploy d24 military forces cannot exercise c2 over ngos howev er spirit of cooperation must exist between the two in order to be successful in some ways the military assumes the unusual role of service provider military forces often support and secure ngo operati ons humanitarian agenci do not or should not want the military to do their jobs for themthey si mply need

organizations 2 july 2008 tc 3173 d5 d26 ngos often complain that usg or objectives ar unclear thereby hamper ing planning efforts because of domestic political considerations member states sometimes prefer that objectives be purposely vague this lack of clarity however complicates the planning process for all involved incl uding ngos ngos are concerned about planning for partic ipation in humanitarianrelief aspects of the emergency response and not with m ilitary planning these organizations complain that once the military is involved the potential for disrupting informala lbeit effectivechannels of communication among ngos is considerable many ngos do not favor the militarys standardized approach to problems believing that it diminishes th flexibility that ngos enjoy d27 given the size and indepe ndent nature of the ngo community th ere are too many moving parts for consistent closely coordinated effort once numer ous actors become involved coordinating operations becomes very complicated for example ther were over 400 independe nt ngos in haiti during enduring freedom commanders intent is criti cal to military planni ng many ngos cannot identify who the commander is let alone the commanders intent d28 in operation joint endeavor bosnia 19951996 north atlantic treaty organization nato programs sought to identify normality indicator s as guidepost to assess the effectiveness of nato initiatives most ngos believed such indicators to be irrelevant and even misleading because local procurement contracts tended to inflate normality indic ators the very presence of the military skewed its own indicators and masked real velopment problems the ngo presen ce also affected local normality indicators although perhaps on different scale coordination d29 successful resolution of crisis requires collaboration across t he politicomilitary spectrum both the military and ngo communities have discovered that the establishment of cmocs is helpful in furthering operationallevel coordina tion and communication d30 many ngos do not understandand may even be susp icious ofthe militarys seemingly endless demands for detailed information on ngo operations one unidentified ngo field director stated even my headquarters in new york doesnt demand the kind detailed reporting the military does some ngos are openly skeptical about the way the milita ry might use the provided information training d31 several training initiatives have helped foster be tter relations between ngos usg agencies and the us military all organizations must deal with complications created by personnel changes and the need to keep training requirements current the us armys joint readiness training center jrt c at ft polk louisiana conducts training exercise s across the range of military operati ons and incorporates information about working with the ngo community into some of its exercises jrtc has begun to include m embers of the ngo community in its field exercises however must ngos have limi ted budgets and cannot afford to send key personnel to extende d military training exercises perspectives d32 the vastly different objectives and perspectives that the ngo usg and military communiti bring to crisis can be both beneficial and troublesome typically the ngo community has been involved in relief and development activities in given country long before cris is develops the evolving crisis prevents the ngos from carrying out their mission as the situation deteriorates and gains international attention the military begins to plan response wh political authority determines to deploy military force to stabilize and provide security for humanitarian operations it usually provides the armed forces with limited mission and often limited timeframe in wh ich to complete the mission once in the field the military mission to provide security to the overall operation and the ngo mission to carry out specific relief activities and return to normalcy may conflict although both communities have common goal in their response to the complex humanitarian emerge ncy stabilization of the situation and return to normalcy each has different perspective on how the goal should be achieve d and how long it should take ngo expectations regarding the militarys role in providing security for th eir operations may not be appendix d d6 tc 3173 2 july 2008 realistic if they do not fully understa nd or appreciate the militarys mission doctrine or approach to the use of force communication d33 effective communications are challenging during any operation involving ngos and military forces there are situations for example in which an ngo will be reluctant to comm unicate its plans to the military ngos express concern that in the process of sharing their plans with th military they would be broadcasting their intentions to indigenous armed groups d34 communications that are too integrated may also affect the hn perspective on the relationship between an ngo and the military host governments ma become suspicious when there is too much interoperability among igos ngos and the military ma ny ngos are reluctant to establish intricate communications nets in order to protect their neutralit additionally in contrast to the militarys hightech approach much of the ngo community uses antiquated equipment manned by locals d35 ngos and igos tend to cause the most trouble for th military at checkpoints some may even try to run through checkpoints checkpoints should be designed to prevent this one common irritation for ngos is redundant checkpoints that require them to undergo numerous checks of their vehicle and belongings ngos should not be given preferential treatment at checkpoints however sf soldiers m ust exercise restraint in the use of force roe help to identify the appropriate response most point out that lethal force should not be employed unless the soldier is danger of injury or death d36 most ngo field staffs have established local conn ections in an emergency onsite personnel doing development work may quickly shift their resources to relief work the relationships established by ngos can be immensely helpful to newcomers ngos operating in the area are likely to have z functioning offices z communications facilities z an indigenous staff and local contacts which can help newcomers understand z the local power structure z the shifting allegiances of particular political players z the hazards that relief work ers are likely to encounter z the potential blunders relief workers are likely to make d37 because of their longstanding relati onships ngos may also be able to provide valuable information about the details of particular area or culture and the relative dependability of various local groups and individuals ngo knowledge of situ ation and of locale can often yield intelligence however ngos may be very sensitive about sharing information if it is collected under that label they are likely to see their longterm success as dependent upon good will and open relationships with the indigenous population this can make them wary of compromising any trust they have established by telling too much to the military or even being seen too often with m ilitary personnel it is essential that ngo and military personneleach of whom is likely to have informa tion useful to the othercreate way of sharing information that addresses the inhibitions they each ma have about disclosure note additional information about ngo and igo st ructure capabilities and coordination may be found in jp 308 nongovernmental organization culture d38 in order to operateand cooperateeffectively sf advisors must have an understanding of ngo culture their peculiarities and thei r attitudes toward us and foreign government and military agencies nongovernmental and intergovernmental organizations 2 july 2008 tc 3173 d7 neutrality and advocacy d39 the ideas of neutrality and advocacy are deeply rooted parts of the ngo culture most relief operations follow strict policy of po litical neutrality they also consider themselves to be the advocates of their clients the majority of ngos including t hose based on religion believe their purpose is to relieve human suffering regardless of political ethnic religious r other affiliation this policy is exemplified by most of the development and relief ngos and by ngos that focus specifically on conflict resolution work the latter believe that being able to establish common ground between antagonis ts who can then resolve their own dispute relies upon their be ing perceived as having preference for either side of conflict d40 when conflict is well defined and opposing militari are fighting each other there exists some clarity as to what constitutes neutral behavior when civil conf lict includes the targeting of civilian populations or when strategy includes the denial of food to region even if it does not include physical attack ngo efforts to provi relief will not be seen as neutral ngos can even find themselves bringing aid and support to groups who are in sperate need but whose politics are well known and abhorrent to the international community in bot h somalia and rwanda relief organizations found themselves in situation where their relief work among perpetrators of conflict likely prolonged the conflict d41 some ngos have faced the neutrality dilemma by acknowledging that in some instances neutrality may not be possible to pretend that it is may assist oppressors one such organization is the mercy corps this ngo has declared mercy corps will not seek out occasions for advocacy but will respond to those circumstances when advocacy is the only responsib act mercy corps considers its clients the impoverished and the oppressed results inc is nother ngo that not only s abandoned neutrality but actually embraces advocacy its aim is to allevi ate poverty and it seeks influence through press conferences editorials and other lobbying activities d42 most human rights ngos are politically active and s eek to change conditions in the countries in which they work although neutrality has never been part of their creed human rights ngos must be careful of image they portray if th ey are seen as political as choosi ng one side over the other ngos can become targets characteristics d43 responsiveness in crisis is trademark of humanitarian ngos and many are poised to work effectively when rules are unenfor ceable and authority nonexistent this does not mean that these organizations do not make every effort to apply their experience and best thinking to crisis indeed the first step in mounting an ngo operati on is to have trained staff make an assessment of the situation d44 after the assessment relief workers go to the field to accomplish wide variety of tasks these may include renting office space hiring staff planning projects locati ng domestic suppliers importing goods to include dealing with customs and tax officials hosting visitors to include potent ial donors working with the media fact finding and reassessing the mission d45 field workers share many of the hardships of local inhabitants these may include lack of electricity lack of hot wa ter exposure to disease and illness and even occasional artillery shelling at the same time field workers enjoy ke privilege that the locals do notthe field workers can always leave in meeting their own needs ngos may inadvertently consume the best of available space workers and even food additionally ngo transportation and communi cation facilities may be better than those of the local government this can cause tension it can also make ngo target for ordinary cri that is theft of vehicles or relief supplies d46 security issues for ngos are magnified when relief efforts are conducted amid armed conflict such conflicts bring military and ngo personnel into close contact both groups must strive to understand each other and work together however difficulties are co mmon whereas some ngos may see the military as offering valuable protection others may see military security precautions as excessively cautious because most ngos wish to maintain nonthreatening image they may perceive close association with the appendix d d8 tc 3173 2 july 2008 military as endangering the protecti on their vulnerability affords some ngo staff and some of the local population may even see military forces as repressive rather than protective d47 as with those who join the military those w ho work for ngos are not seeking riches some members simply want to devote their energy and skills to an organi zation thatby definitiondoes not make profit others may be caught up by the inspir ation and ideals of particular ngo still others are committed to particular field such as human rights and working for an ngo is just one of several ways they are able to fulfill their purpose d48 compared to most corporate or governmental organizations ngos offer employment that maximizes independence mobility flexibility variety internati onal travel and the challenge of working in other cultures ngo staff members are attracted by the challenge of managi ng programs in developing countries often times in several languages d49 although some staff personnel are motivated by desire to live their ideals actual ly working in the field very quickly tempers idealism with reality even if field staff liv better than the people with whom they work they are likely to have great deal of responsibility and to experience significant hardship and at times real danger this is especially true when the government of an area has collaps ed and one is able to offer routine security or other essential functions d50 as with any organization field workers often experience tension with their hq fiel d staffs believe they are the ones with their ears to the ground every field worker has stories about preposterous directions received from their hq and also knows about failed project s based on theory not practice d51 field staff are likely to have the authority to sign or commit to specific projectsat least at the level of providing seed money if new project holds promise the hq staff begins designing proposal and seeking funds to permit fuller implementation new funds may come from the organizations own capital often though proposals are offered to the usaid the world bank echo or other agencies d52 local workers may need permission to work for foreign ngo this can create problems especially if they leave government work or seek military rvice exemption some remain government employees while working for an ngo and may explicitly or implicitly become informants for that government d53 staff coming from outside the area may live in secure usually small compound even in semi stable situation where friendly for ces are in place ngos can be caught in precarious situations such as when responsibility for operations in particular area shifts from one organization to another for example from the to nato or from one nation to another fo r example from the united states to australia d54 most ngo personnel are well educated permanent st aff members usually college degrees and many hold graduate degrees some work in their field of expertise although other professionals may work as administrators for example doctor working medical supply distribution may not be engaged in medic care at all d55 staff for large ngos must have honed administrative and entreprene urial skills whether for profit or not for profit large operation requires decisive action in difficult situations skilled financial management and firm control of geographically dispersed enterprise in addition ngo managers must be aggressive fundraisers and they must be able to fuse the energy and commitment of volunteers and paid staff d56 in order to remain focused on those being serv edrefugees and victimssome ngos refuse all public funding others expand thei r resources by accepting government monies but may be uneasy and reluctant recipients these ngos fear distorted priorities as result of governmental resource allocation priorities which may be based on economic or political considerations rather than solely on human need d57 in recent years some ngos have become more willing to plan coordinate and even to participate in postmission evaluations with othe r ngos agencies governments nd military forces for example the group world concern lists 74 agencies as its par tners oxfam america collaborates with such local ngos as the coalition for peoples agrarian reform philippines and the eritr ean relief association helen keller international partners with the aravind eye hospital i n india and others nongovernmental and intergovernmental organizations 2 july 2008 tc 3173 d9 d58 when numerous ngos are called to render relief in an emergency situation they may create loose coordinating system by signating or accepting one of them as the lead or coordinating ngo in sarajevo catholic relief services assumed this role in haiti rwan da and somalia care presided sometimes lead agency will be charged with responsibility for umbrella grants from the usg d59 ngos do not have hierarchical structure or chain of command work is accomplished through persuasion not as the result of an order to military professio nal this style may appear inefficient irrational or unreasonable however an effective ngo is capable of enlisting hands hearts and minds
