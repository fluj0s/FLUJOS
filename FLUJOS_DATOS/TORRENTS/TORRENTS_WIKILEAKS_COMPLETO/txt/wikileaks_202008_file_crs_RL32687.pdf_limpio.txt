and 109th congresses this report will be updated as warranted by si gnificant legislation or ot her relevant developments4 need analysis need analysis is complex system that is used to allocate billions of dollars of federal student aid under title iv of the hea it entails gathering financial data which is provided by the student via the fafsa5 calculating the expected family contribution efc and packaging of the applicants financial aid award by the postsecondary institutions fina ncial aid administrator th is section provides brief description of the efc and how it is calcu lated and the role of the fafsa this description is very generic for detailed information regarding the efc calculation and the fafsa the us department of ducation ed has posted descriptions for recent years6 expected family contribution the efc is the amount that the family is expected to contribute towa rd postsecondary education expenses in calculating the efc consideration is given to available income and for some families available assets in addition living expenses re tirement needs and federal and state tax liability are factored in cost of atte ndance coa is determined by each higher education institution the aid administrator determines the students need for federal student aid and other sources of aid ba sed primarily upon the efc and coa this is true for all federal student aid programs except for the pell grant program for nearly all pell recipients the award is calculated by subtracting the efc from the maximum appropriated pell grant for the year ie without regard to the coa7 the final outcome is the financial aid aw ard or package which consists of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32687crs3 8 to be eligible for the simplified needs test the student and his or her parents must not have to file an income tax return or must file or be eligible to file federal tax form 1040a or 1040ez this requirement is also met if the pa rents or student file form 1040 if that form is filed only to claim the federal hope or lifetime learning tax credit the same requirement applies to independent students and their spouse if any 9 the tax formfiling requirements specified for the simplified needs test must also be met 10 this amount is the current maximum amount of income rounded to the nearest 1000 that one can earn and still be able to claim the maximum federal earned income tax creditspecific sources and amounts of student aid each applicant will receive to help pay for hisher education related expenses the calculation of the efc varies pending upon the app licants dependency status this is important because parental financial information is not considered if the applicant meets the statutory definition of an independent student there are three separate dependency cl assifications for individual pplicants dependent student independent student without dependents and i ndependent student with dependents to be classified as statutorily independe nt title iv section 480d an applicant must meet one of the following conditions 24 years of age or older married enrolled in graduate or professional program have dependent other than spouse orphan or ward of the court or was up until age 18 or military veteran students who do not meet any of the aforem entioned conditions are considered to be dependent for the purposes of title iv student aid in addition to creating common applica tion form and single methodology for determining need the congress has also s ought to further reduce the application burden for those applicants with family incomes at or below specified threshold under the simplified needs test snt the efc calculati on does not consider assets for the student or spouse if married or pa rent if student is dependent if their adjusted gross income agi is less th an 50000 and certain conditions regarding federal tax returns are met8 the automatic zero efc hereinafter autozero efc 9 sets the expected family contribution to zero for dependent students parents and the dependent student or an independen t student who has pendents and has an agi that is not greater than 1500010 the autozero efc is not provided to independent students without dependents free application for federal student aid the fafsa is used to collect most of the information that is utilized to calculate the efc applicants are required to report identifying information such as their name and social security number information about the institutions where th eir information should be forwarded and financial information pertaini ng to income and assets as mentioned above there are three ways to complete the fafsa via the web electronically through higher education institution or using paper form the number of applicants completinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32687crs4 fafsa on the web continues to increase annually however s ubstantial number of applicants continue to complete the paper form the paper and electronic i ncluding the web versions of the fafsa differ in the way that submitted data are treated as result the electronic versions of the fafsa provide advantages that the paper fo rm does not for exam ple the electronic versions contain internal nd endofentry data edits wh ich require the applicant to resolve conflicts and complete all necessary fields prior to submission in addition the electronic versions contain skip logic which enab applicants if they choose to skip over the sections of the fafsa that do not pertain to them as result applicants who apply via the electronic formats are able to take advantage of either the snt or autozero efc because the t echnology allows sections to be skipped where applicable at present there is comparable approach available for paper form filers advisory committees recommendations this section reviews the charges to the advisory committee on student financial assistance concerning need analysis simplification and its final recommendations released on january 23 2005 legislative charges in response to growing concern about n eed analysis complexity the congress mandated that the advisory committee study the feasibility of simplifying the methodology for determining fi nancial need and the proce ss of applying for federal student aid consolidated appropriati ons act for fy2004 pl 108199 the advisory committees primary objectives in this effort are simplifying aid application forms and the aid application process and substa ntially reducing the number of data items requested the committee is to pay particular attention to the needs of lowincome and moderateincome families in the aid process the legislation identifies specific topics to be addressed in this feasibility study simplifying the calculation of the efc without significant negative impact on such elements as progra m intent cost and distribution of aid reducing the data used in calculating the efc and reducing thenumber and complexity of ques tions asked of aid filers considering whether the process of determining the data used in the efc calculation including the updating of offsets and allowances is the fairest most effective and most efficient way to determine available income and assets considering whether the treatment of income earned by dependent students and the impact of that treatment on pell eligibility effectively and fairly determines available income and student need identifying additional streamlining of among other elements ofthe aid process the nature and timing of the fafsa determination of eligibility and awards and delivery of aidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32687crs5 11 the legislation was enacted on jan 23 2004permitting students to complete just the portions of the fafsa considered necessary based on th eir financial circumstances and state of residence estimating approximate eligibility for different forms of federalaid when the simplified application is completed and verified qualifying students for the simp lified needs test based on data provided on forms used to determine eligibility for other federal needbased aid programs eg s upplemental security income food stamps and earned income tax credits and considering whether proposed ch anges to data elements the application form or aid appli cation process may have adverse consequences for program costs integrity award distribution and application developm ent or processing as part of its analysis the advisory committee is to consult broadly with different interested parties as well as with forms design expert regarding revised application form that is easily read and understood the advisory committee is also to consult regularly with the education committees of the congress the house committee on education and the workforce and the senate committee on health education labor and pensions ed is to provide requested assistance as practicable within six months of enactment of pl 10819911 the advisory committee was required to issue an interim report to the education committees of the congress and the secretary of education the final report was due within one year of enactment on january 23 2005 the advisory committee issued its final report regarding need analysis simplification the report offers ten recommendations pertaining to simplification of federal need analysis and improving access to higher education according to the advisory committee eight of the ten recommendations do not require an increase in program costs as pects of two of the recommendations require small investment that if necessary can be phased in over seve ral years p i of the ten recommendations two call for specific changes to the calculation of the efc that in general would reduce the number of data items that some filers would have to supply or respond to eligibility issues identified in pl 108199 five speak directly to the structure form and proce ssing of the fafsa and three address the broader issues of how potential college st udents learn about ava ilable financial aid and when they file the fafsa most of the recommendations are not accompanied by an estimate of their potential impact on the costs of federal st udent aid programs or on the number of students receiving benefits the two r ecommendations that the advisory committee states require an investme nt are accompanied by estimates however they are limited to the federal pell grant program the estimates are included where available efc calculation recommendations in general the advisory committee recommendations regarding the calculation of the efc seek to expand the population for whom efc is expected increase the eligibility of working students for aidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32687crs6 12 the cpi is measure over time of changes in prices paid for various goods and services for additional information see http wwwblsgovcpicpi faqhtmquestion_1 13 it is unclear whether this recommendation is in addition to or replaces the current simplified needs test eligibility criteria that in volve determination of the irs tax returns filed by the applicant 14 the income protection allowance is an exclusion for the basic living expenses of the family the amount varies according to the number of persons in the household and the number of students in college 15 the state and other tax allowance represents an exclusion of percentage of the parents total income and approximates the average amount paid in these taxes the percentage varies depending upon the state of residence and if the parents income is equal to or more than 15000 or is less than 15000 16 it would appear that the state and other tax allowance tables would still have to be produced in order to determine the size of th increases in the income protection allowances and whether they were adequate to hold harmless as many students as possible the committee recommends that in the event fficient funding to increase the income protection allowances as required is not appr opriated future updates of the state and other tax tables should be phased in to avoid loss of pell grant eligibility for large numbers of students 17 worksheets and b are forms that accompany the fafsa and assist the applicant with determining annual amounts received from source s such as tax credits the earned income credit untaxed social security benefits and child support the forms are not submitted with the fafsaand reduce the amount of asset and unt axed income information collected specifically the advisory committee recommends that the automatic zero efc apply to applicants with an agi of 25000 or less an increase from the current 15000 threshold the agi threshold for the automatic zero efc be indexed to theconsumer price index cpi 12 eligibility for the simplified needs test be expanded to includeapplicants with an agi of less than 50000 and who qualify for benefits from federal meanstested program such as food stamps 13 the income protection allowances14 for all students be raised by 1000 the assessment rate on available income for dependent students themselves and for independent students without dependents be lowered to 40 from the current 50 rate the state and other tax allowances15 be eliminated and all income protection allowances be raised sufficiently to protect as many students as possible from any adverse consequence of its elimination16 and some questions on worksheets and b17 regarding nontaxable income be eliminated specifi cally those involving nontaxable income primarily received by individuals with agis below 25000 or nontaxable income which is r eceived by few applicants or inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32687crs7 18 for additional information regarding federal student aid eligibility and drug convictions see crs report rs21824 student eligibility drug convic tions and federal financial aid by charmaine mercer and laura monagle 19 34 cfr 66854 states an institution shall require each applicant whose application is selected for verification on the basis of edits spec ified by the secretary to verify all of the applicable items specified in sec 66856 except that institution is required to verify the applications of more than 30 percent of its total number of applicants for assistance under the federal pell grant federal direct staffordford loan campusbased and federal stafford loan programs in an award yearsmall amounts examples offered in clude the earned income tax credit the child tax credit and untaxed social security benefits estimated impact according to the advisory committee increasing the ipa by 1000 for all students would resu lt in approximately 130000 new students acquiring eligibility for pell and 19 million students receiving higher awards for total cost of approx imately 523 million the report furt her states that reducing the income assessment rate from 50 to 40 for independent recipients without dependents and for dependent recipients themselves would add an estimated 140000 new pell recipients and increase the pell awards for more than 930000 recipients for cost of approximately 292 milli on additionally the advisory committee estimates that increasing the autozer efc to 25000 would increase the number of new pell recipients by approximately 29000 for total increase in program costs of 319 million nonfinancial eligibility the advisory committee proposes that the fafsa questions related to past drug convictions18 and selective service registration be dropped from the application the committee further recommends that the underlying statues be amended presum ably to eliminate selective service registration and prior dr ug convictions as conditions for aid eligibility structure form and processing of the fafsa the advisory committees recommendations concerning structure form and processing of the fafsa center primarily on the role of t echnology in simplifying the process of filling out and submitting the fafsa to that end it recommends that paper fafsaez be created for all students eligible for an automatic zero efc and the full paper fafsa be gradually eliminated the use of the fafsaez be ex tended to independent recipients without dependents who are also ligible for the snt and earn less than 25000 per year the fafsa on the web be modified to eliminate all questions foreach applicant that are unnecessary to calculate his or her efc including tailoring the questions asked to each applicants state of residence and the application verification process that higher education institutionsare required to c onduct be simplified 19httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32687crs8 estimated impact assuming the recommendation to increase the autozero income threshold to 25000 is adopted the advisory committee estimates that 23 million students would be eligible to use the paper fafsaez in addition extending the use of fafsaez to indepe ndent recipients without dependents who are eligible for the simplified needs test would allow an additional 17 million applicants to utilize the form it is estimated that this would cost approximately 64 million the advisory committee estimates that the eventual phaseout of the full paper fafsa will save approximately 5 to 9 million early awareness and f iling responding to its charge concerning the nature and timing of aid applications and the award process the advisory committee recommends that an early awareness system be implemented that will provide students with information about financia l aid including potential eligibility for pell grants and other aid ear lier in the middle and high school years efcs be calculated earlier in the college application process atleast in the fall of the year prior to enrollment with pilot program to identify the consequences of not requiring updating of the estimated income and asset data used in determining these early efcs and national partnership be created to make access to college andfinancial aid simple and certain legislative action this section reviews major legislation in the 108th and 109th congresses that addresses need analysis simplification th ere have been several bills introduced that pertain to need analysis however this section is limited to those that specifically address simplification these proposals are discussed below legislation during the 108th congress two of the proposals introduced during the 108th congress charged the advisory committee with undertaking study relating to simplification of the fafsa and the need analysis process hr 2956 and hr 3039 in addition the proposals would have required the secretary of educati on to undertake special outreach efforts targeted toward individual applicants who are eligible for the simplified needs test or the
