hollings crs8 crs9 chapter ii major reforms proposed by category this section of the report is organized into 15 subsections encompassing the 14 major areas of reform addressed in proposed 108th congress bills and miscellaneous category for provisions outside that framework in each subsection bills containing provisions that address that particular area are noted greater detail for each provision and sense of how bills various provisions might affect each other can be found in chapter iii where bill summaries appear in numerical order in some cases reference is made here to other provisions of the same bill for easy reference arbitrary decisions were made as to the primary nature and goal of particular provision many provisions however have multiple purposes for example bill that would raise the limit on an individuals contributions to political parties would empower both the individual and the political party such provision would be listed here under individual as it most directly affects what an individual may do even though the parties would benefit as well the first six categories can be examined in the context of hard money as they pertain to types of activity that are regulated under federal election law which specifies prohibited sources sets limits on permitted contributions and requires disclosure the six hard money categories are shown on the checklist in chapter i under larger heading of hard money with the first four individuals pacs parties and candidates further grouped to reflect the four principal sources of campaign receipts the eighth ninth and tenth categories comprise provisions dealing with soft money the eighth contains provisions relating to party soft money and some general provisions the ninth focuses on nonparty soft money direct activities of unions and corporations and the tenth addresses issue advocacy electionrelated communications that fall largely outside the purview of the federal election campaign act feca and often involve activities regulated under the internal revenue code as section 527 political organizations1 1 hard money generally refers to funds raised and spent according to the source limits and prohibitions and disclosure requirements of federal election law by contrast soft money refers to funds raised and spent outside the federal election regulatory framework but which may have at least an indirect impact on federal elections crs10 individuals hard money these bills would change limits and offer incentives to encourage greater role for individual citizens in federal campaign financing remove contribution limits hr 3525 doolittle provide tax incentives for individual contributions hr 157 petri credit and special deduction s 804 dorgan credit provide tax incentives on

candidates hr 3617 meehan s 1913 mccain candidates hard money these bills contain provisions that focus on spending and loans by candidates from personal or family wealth including the issue of repayment of candidate loans from campaign funds after an election and permissible use of campaign funds in general ban use of campaign or official funds for candidate salary hr 797 english ban repayment of candidate loans from campaign funds hr 681 english for winning candidates after taking office expand permissible uses of federal campaign funds hr 4818pl 108447 kolbe for donations to

constitutional amendment to limit candidate spending hjres 21 leach instate or indistrict minimum hard money this category includes bills that would require minimum level of candidates funds to come from residents of that state or district or in some way seek to encourage greater role for local residents crs12 require instate funding level hr 2529 hoekstra for house and senate candidates independent expenditures hard money independent expenditures are communications with the public advocating the election or defeat of clearly identified candidates made without any coordination cooperation or consultation with the candidates they are not subject to limits on amounts spent but the source restrictions and disclosure requirements of federal law apply this hard money activity should not be confused with issue advocacy which is largely outside federal election regulation this is treated in separate category below increase disclosure requirements hr 3641 tierney for clean money candidates coordination hard and soft money these provisions address the issue of what constitutes coordination under the feca which in turn triggers an activitys treatment as contribution or expenditure subject to relevant limits this issue has come to include both issue and express advocacy hence it contains both hard and soft money components define coordination and associated activities hr 3641 tierney define coordinated activity as contribution or expenditure hr 3641 tierney but exempts party spending for clean money candidates soft money party this term has traditionally referred to money that may indirectly influence federal elections but that is raised and spent outside federal election laws purview and that would be illegal if spent directly in connection with federal election prior to enactment of the bipartisan campaign reform act of 2002 bcra national parties commonly raised money from sources and in amounts that were federally impermissible these funds could then be transferred to state parties where permitted under state election law and used for grassroots and generic party activity party soft money was also used for share of administrative and overhead expenses and issue advocacy since bcras prohibition on the raising of soft money by national parties crs13 and federal officials this issue has largely been moot those few bills that address it focus solely on improving disclosure of state party funds add disclosure requirements hr 1878 andrews allows state parties to file copies of state reports with fec if substantially similar to what fec requires hr 3525 doolittle requires copies of state party reports to be filed with fec soft money nonparty nonparty soft money pertains to direct spending by and activity of groups as opposed to their donations to another entity such as parties the term is most commonly used to refer to union and corporate treasury money that federal election law allows for three exempt activities aimed only at specified restricted classes corporate executives and stockholders and families and union members and their families the three exempt activities are setting up and raising money for pac internal communications including express advocacy and voter registration and getoutthevote drives add election law disclosure requirements hr 1878 andrews issue advocacy soft money prior to enactment of bcra in 2002 observers had become concerned about communications that promoted political issues in reference to candidates but which by avoiding the use of specific election advocacy language eg elect jones or defeat smith were not subject to regulation under federal election law these issue advocacy communications contrasted with those that explicitly promoted the election or defeat of clearly identified candidates known as express advocacy since the courts had generally construed express advocacy communications in narrow sense ie using explicit phrases communications that may have been perceived as constituting thinlyveiled election activity could thus avoid federal disclosure and source regulations bcra addressed issue advocacy by creating new term in federal election law electioneering communication political advertisements that refer to clearly identified federal candidate and are broadcast within 30 days of primary or 60 days of general election the act prohibited unions and certain corporations from spending treasury funds for electioneering communications and required disclosure of disbursements of over 10000 and the identity of donors of 1000 or more in part because of bcras narrowlytailored response to issue advocacy concerns remain some believe bcra went too far and favor the repeal of its crs14 electioneering communications provision others believe it did not go far enough and favor more regulation in this area of particular interest has been the activity of political organizations defined by section 527 of the internal revenue code irc while congress in 2000 enacted public law 106230 to require disclosure by 527 groups through the irs much debate has ensued in 2004 as to whether their election related activities should require full regulation under federal election law repeal bcras electioneering communications provision hr 3801 bartlett s 2702 chambliss require regulation of 527s under feca declare 527 to be political committee

limits and public benefits bills in this category would in general provide 1 campaign spending limits for house or senate candidates on overall campaign or candidate personal spending or advertising time restrictions 2 public costsaving benefits to candidates or 3 both they are grouped together because many bills embody both concepts largely because voluntary system of limits with conditional benefits has been major response to the buckley v valeo ruling 424 us 1 1976 which overturned mandatory limits this grouping should not be construed as an inherent linkage between the two ideas there are very distinct principles behind spending limits and public benefits or financing options among spending limit bills include voluntary limits in response to buckley with or without inducements to participation through public benefits mandatory limits through constitutional amendment or benefits only provisions without adherence to spending limits offer voluntary spending limits in conjunction with public benefits hr 3172 mccollum with subsidies and for contributors tax credits hr 3641 tierney with subsidies and free and discounted broadcast time provide public benefits with spending limits
