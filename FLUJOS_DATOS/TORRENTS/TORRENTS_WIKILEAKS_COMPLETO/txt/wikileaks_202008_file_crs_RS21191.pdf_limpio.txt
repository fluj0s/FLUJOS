addressing the plaintiffs due process claim the court emphasized that there is fundamental right to adopt nor fundamental right to be adopted as adoption is privilege created by st atute and not by common law12 thus the court reasoned there can be fundamental right to apply for adoption13 as such the liberty interest biological parents enjoy in raising their children without state interference could not be extended to foster parent or guardian base d merely on the existence of strong emotional ties between the foster parent or guardian and the child14 moreover the court rejected plaintiffs argument that the supreme courts decision in lawrence v texas 15 identified an unarticulated funda mental right to private sexual intimacy the court stated that it was hesitant to infer new fundame ntal liberty interest from an opinion whose language and reas oning are inconsistent with standard fundamentalrights analysis16 the court noted the absence of two primary features of fundamentalrights analysis in the lawrence decision17 first the court stated that the lawrence opinion contained virtually inqui ry into the question of whether the petitioners asserted right is one of those fundamental rights and liberties which are objectively deeply rooted in this nations history and tradition and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty such that neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed18 second the court noted that the lawrence opinion notably never provides the careful description of the asserted fundamental liberty in terest that is to accompany fundamentalrights analysis19 moreover the court found that the holding of lawrence did not control in the adoption context as lawrence was limited to consenting adults and criminal prohibition the court reiterated that the relevant state action was not criminal prohibition but grant of statutory privilege in addition the court stated that the asserted liberty interest is not the negative right to engage in priv ate conduct without faci ng criminal sanctions but the affirmative right to recei ve official and public recognition20 therefore the courthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21191crs4 21 id 22

persons21 addressing the equal protecti on argument the court rejected the plaintiffs assertion that the court should apply strict scrutiny in analyzing the statute the court noted that as floridas adoption statute burdens fundamental right nor suspect class the appropriate standard of review was rational basis th court found that florida has legitimate interest in encouraging stable and nurturing environment for the education and socialization of its adopted children22 in addition the court reasoned that the state has legitimate interest in encouraging an optimal family structure by seeking to place adoptive children in homes that have both mother and father23 the court rejected appellants argument that the statute was not rationally related to this interest by noting that it is entirely irrelevant for constitutional purposes whether the conceived reason for the challenged distinction actually motivated the legislature moreover the court stated that neither the fact that statutory classification may be overinclusive or underinclusive nor the f act that the generaliz ation underlying the classification is subject to exception renders such classification irrational for purposes of equal protection24 instead the court stated that the question is whether the florida legislature could have reas onably believed that prohibiting adoption into homosexual environments would further its interest in placing adoptive children in homes that will provide them with optimal developmental c onditions the court found that there are plausible rational reasons for the disparat treatment of homosexuals under florida adoption law finally the court noted that any argument that the florida legislature was misguided in its decision is one of legislative policy not constitutional law the legislature is the proper forum for this debate nd we do not sit as superlegis lature to award by judicial decree what was not achievable by political consensus on january 10 2005 the united states supr eme court without comment declined to hear the case25
