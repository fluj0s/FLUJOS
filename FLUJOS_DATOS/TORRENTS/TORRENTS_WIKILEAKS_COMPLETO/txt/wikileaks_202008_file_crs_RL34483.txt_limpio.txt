programs under rhya that provide direct services to youth the basic center program bcp transitional living program tlp and street outreach program sop unlike prior law pl 110378 enables hhs to reallot any unused bcp funds from one state to other states and permits youth to remain in bcp and tlp shelters for longer period another change made by the law requires hhs to regularly submit report to congress that describes the incidence and prevalence of runaway and homeless youth the law also directs the government accountability office to report to congress on the process by which hhs awards bcp tlp and sop grants the provisions of pl 110378 reflect issues raised by policymakers and advocates about rhya during the reauthorization process one issue was the amount of funding allocated to grantees under the three directservice programs grantees expressed the concern that although congress has periodically increased funding authorization for these programs funding for individual grantees has remained relatively stable over time second issue was the lack of outcome data for youth who run away or experience homelessness finally the bill addresses issues related to the

has been reauthorized approximately every five years since the 1970s most recently in the second session of the 110th congress the president signed into law the reconnecting homeless youth act pl 110378 to extend existing programs and authorize new activities under rhya for fy2009 through fy2013 pl 110378 represents compromise between provisions that were included in two bills hr 5524 and s 2982 to reauthorize rhya2 on march 4 2008 representative john yarmuth introduced hr 5524 the reconnecting homeless youth act of 2008 the bill was referred to the house education and labor committee but was not taken up by the committee on june 9 2008 the house approved the bill by voice vote under suspension of the rules the version of the bill that was passed contained most of the same provisions as the original version on may 6 2008 senator patrick leahy introduced s 2982 the runaway and homeless youth protection act on may 22 2008 the senate judiciary committee passed s 2982 which included an amendment that substituted the introduced version with similar version of the bill on september 25 2008 s 2982 was approved by the 1 for detailed program information see crs report rl33785

house approved s 2982 on september 26 2008 and the president signed it into law as pl 110378 on october 8 2008 this report first provides broad overview of pl 110378 followed by more detailed summary of the laws provisions the second section discusses the issues that were raised during hearings in the 110th congress about runaway and homeless youth and the provisions in pl 110378 that in part address these issues table a1 at the end of the report provides sidebyside comparison of pl 110378 with prior law current regulation and hr 5524 as shown in the table notable differences include funding authorization levels the authorization for national homeless youth awareness campaign as proposed by hr 5524 length of stay at rhyafunded programs and the definitions of runaway youth and homeless youth overview the reconnecting homeless youth act of 2008 pl 110378 reauthorizes programs for runaway and homeless youth expands congressional oversight of these programs and establishes new activities the major provisions of the law relate to funding for the basic center program transitional living program and street outreach program requirements for grantees that receive bcp and tlp grants and accountability of programs and activities authorized under rhya funding pl 110378 authorizes fy2009 appropriation levels for the bcp tlp and related activities that exceed the levels authorized for fy2004 by 35 million these are the only recent years for which congress has specified authorized appropriation levels the law also increases the authorized annual minimum levels of bcp funding available for states and territories it further requires hhs to reallocate unused bcp funds from one state to another the amount allocated to states for fy2009 and fy2010 may not be lower than the amount appropriated to the states in fy2008 requirements pl 110378 allows youth to remain in program funded under the bcp and tlp longer they were able to under the prior law although the law imposes additional criteria for youth who stay longer at tlpfunded programs the law also changes the definition of homeless youth to permit youth older than age 18 and 22 to stay at bcp and tlpfunded programs respectively but only under certain circumstances another change made by the law specifies that in funding grants for research and other projects related to runaway and homeless youth hhs is to give priority to applicants that serve diverse youth and represent diverse geographic regions of the us the term diverse is not defined other requirements pertain to bcp and tlp plans submitted by grant applicants crs3 accountability pl 110378 requires hhs to promulgate regulations that specify performance standards for public and non profit entities that receive bcp tlp and sop grants the law further requires hhs to periodically submit to congress an incidence and prevalence study of runaway and homeless youth ages 13 to 26 as well as the characteristics of representative sample of these youth hhs must consult with the us interagency council on homelessness in developing the study the law also directs the government accountability office gao to evaluate the process by which organizations apply for bcp tlp and sop including hhss response to these applicants gao is to submit report on its findings to congress the discussion below provides more details of these provisions funding authorization of appropriations the prior law pl 10896 to reauthorize the runaway and homeless youth act authorized funding for all parts3 of the runaway and homeless youth act except the street outreach program at 105 million for fy2004 and such sums as may be necessary for fy2005 through fy2008 the street outreach program was authorized to receive such sums as may be necessary for fy2004 through fy2008 for all parts of rhya except the sop and the new incidence and prevalence study provisions the reconnecting homeless youth act of 2008 authorizes 140 million for fy2009 and such sums as may be necessary for fy2010 through fy2013 the law authorizes 25 million for the sop for fy2009 and such sums as may be necessary for fy2010 through fy2013 finally the law authorizes such sums as may be necessary for the study for fy2009 through fy2013 allocation for the basic center program funding for the basic center program and related training and other activities is allocated among states including the district of columbia and the territories and is distributed by hhs on competitive basis to communitybased organizations as the law existed prior to the enactment of pl 110378 each state and territory received minimum annual allotment of 100000 and 45000 respectively in bcp funds pl 110378 increases the annual minimum funding available for each state to 200000 and for each territory to 70000 the law also provides that funding for each state in fy2009 and fy2010 is to be less than the amount allotted to that 3 part pertains to the bcp part b pertains to the tlp part c pertains to the national communication system part d pertains to coordinating training research and other activities part pertains to the sop and part f pertains to general provisions such as assistance to potential grantees lease of surplus federal facilities reports records definitions and authorization of appropriations among other provisions crs4 state for fy2008 the bill is silent on minimum for territories in those years further unlike prior law pl 110378 enables the hhs secretary to reallot any funds that have not been obligated before the end of fiscal year for state to the other states the law does not specify the criteria for reallotting the funds the new law does not change the funding structure for the transitional living program and street outreach program funds for these programs are allocated competitively by hhs to communitybased organizations requirements pl 110378 changes program requirements related to 1 the length of time that youth are eligible to stay in basic center program and transitional living program facilities 2 the definition of homeless youth and runaway youth 3 bcp and tlp plans submitted by applicants and 4 applicants that are to be prioritized under the street outreach program length of stay the reconnecting homeless youth act of 2008 authorizes longer periods in which youth may stay at program funded by the bcp or tlp current regulation specifies that youth may remain at bcp shelter for up to 15 days however pl 110378 permits youth to stay at shelter for up to 21 days the new law continues to allow youth to remain at tlp projects for up to 540 days 18 months or longer for youth under age 18 and adds that youth may remain in the program for continuous period of 635 days approximately 21 months under exceptional circumstances this term means circumstances in which youth would benefit to an unusual extent from additional time in the program the new law further authorizes that youth in tlp who has not reached age 18 on the last day of the 635day period may in exceptional circumstances and if otherwise qualified for the program remain in the program until his or her 18th birthday definition of homeless youth and runaway youth under the law as it existed prior to the enactment of the reconnecting homeless youth act of 2008 homeless youth for purposes of the bcp was defined as an individual younger than age 18 for whom it is not possible to live in safe environment with relative and for whom other safe alternative living arrangement exists pl 110378 amends the first clause to define homeless youth as an individual younger than age 18 or an older maximum age if the bcp center is located in state or locality with law or regulation that permits this higher age for purposes of the tlp the prior law defined homeless youth as an individual age 16 through 21 for whom it is not possible to live in safe environment with relative and for whom other safe alternative living arrangement exists pl 110378 changes the first clause of the definition to include an individual ages 16 through 22 or an age exceeding 22 years old on the last day the youth is permitted under law to be at the shelter so long as the participant enters the tlp project prior crs5 to reaching age 22 as mentioned above pl 110378 permits stay of 540 days or up to 635 days if the youth would greatly benefit from being in the program finally under current regulation runaway youth is defined as person under age 18 who absents himself or herself from home or place of legal residence without the permission of his or her family pl 110378 enacts similar language that defines runaway youth as an individual who leaves home or place of residence without the permission of his or her parent or legal guardian bcp and tlp plans as required under the previous law applicants for tlp funding were required to submit plan to the hhs secretary specifying that they would provide directly or indirectly shelter and services among other types of assistance the reconnecting homeless youth act of 2008 amends the law to require that applicants provide by grant agreement or contract shelter services and other assistance4 also under pl 110378 applicants for tlp and bcp grants must develop an adequate emergency preparedness and management plan5 priority applicants for the sop and research projects under the law as it existed prior to enactment of the reconnecting homeless youth act of 2008 hhs was to prioritize nonprofit private agencies with experience in providing services to runaway and homeless youth including youth living on the street when awarding grants under the street outreach program pl 110378 requires that hhs also give priority to public agencies with experience in serving runaway and homeless youth pl 110378 also makes changes to the priority areas for awarding grants for research evaluation demonstration and service projects concerning runaway and homeless youth under the prior law hhs could prioritize projects that addressed one of nine priority areas pl 110378 modifies the language regarding two of these priority areas for one of the priority areas regarding access to quality health care the law changes the reference from projects addressing mental health care to projects addressing behavioral health care for the other priority area regarding access to education the law adds that the projects should decrease high school dropout rates increase rates of attaining secondary school diploma or its recognized equivalent or increase placement and retention in postsecondary education or advanced workforce training programs the law also inserts as tenth priority area projects that assist youth in obtaining and maintaining safe and stable housing finally pl 110 378 makes change pertaining to applicants that apply for grants to implement projects in one of the priority areas under the previous law hhs was to give 4 it is not clear whether the language will change the way tlp applicants subcontract services for runaway and homeless youth if at all prior grant applications for the bcp tlp and sop have asked applicants to submit information about any subgrants or contracts with other entities that provide services to runaway and homeless youth 5 the law does not define how this plan should be carried out or what is considered adequate crs6 priority consideration to applicants with experience working with runaway and homeless youth pl 110378 adds that hhs is to ensure selected applicants represent diverse geographic regions of the us and carry out projects that serve diverse youth diverse is not defined in the law6 accountability the reconnecting homeless youth act of 2008 includes provisions that seek to improve accountability of programs and activities authorized by rhya including requiring hhs to establish performance standards for bcp tlp and sop grantees directing gao to evaluate the process by which grants are awarded under the three programs and requiring hhs to periodically submit report to congress that contains estimates of runaway and homeless youth and certain characteristics of the population performance standards the reconnecting homeless youth act of 2008 requires that within one year after its enactment october 8 2009 hhs is to issue rules that specify performance standards for public and nonprofit entities that receive bcp tlp and sop grants in developing the regulations hhs is to consult with stakeholders in the runaway and homeless youth policy community the law further requires that hhs integrate the performance standards into the grantmaking monitoring and evaluations processes for the bcp tlp and sop existing performance review processes as they existed prior to the enactment of pl 110378 the rhya statute and accompanying regulations did not explicitly set forth performance standards for the grantees however grantees were and are collectively expected to meet certain performance measures established by the office of management and budgets omb program assessment rating tool part process7 the performance measures are as follows achieve the proportion of youth served in the tlp entering safe and appropriate settings directly after exiting care at 85 by fy2008 and 6 the department of health and human services through the family and youth services bureau has defined diversity in runaway and homeless youth programs to include characteristics such as gender race ethnicity socioeconomic and educational status sexual orientation physical capacity age personality type religious and spiritual beliefs regional customs and immigrant status us department of health and human services administration for children and families family and youth services bureau guide to enhancing cultural

system which includes range of data elements on the characteristics and shortterm outcomes of youth receiving services through the bcp tlp and sop8 further during the grant application process described below applicants must discuss the results or benefits expected from their programs for example applicants are advised to identify quantitative outcomes for their proposed projects that will fulfill the program purpose and scope of services as described in rhya and the grant announcement oversight of grant review process the reconnecting homeless youth act of 2008 directs the government accountability office to examine the process by which organizations apply for bcp tlp and sop grants specifically gao is to submit to congress findings and recommendations relating to 1 hhss written responses to and other communications with unsuccessful applicants to determine if the information in the responses is conveyed clearly 2 the content of the grant applications and other associated documents to determine if these materials are presented in way that gives an applicant clear understanding of the information that is to be provided and the terminology used in the materials c the peer review process if any for the grants d the typical time frame for responding to applicants and the efforts made by hhs to communicate about delayed funding decisions and the plans for implementation of technical assistance and training authorized under rhya and the effect of such programs on the application process for the grantees9 8 for additional information about neorhymis see

and programs by adrienne l fernandes crs8 existing grant review process applicants for bcp tlp and sop grants are currently evaluated and rated by an independent review panel made up of nonfederal reviewers who are experts in the field of runaway and homeless youth issues10 the review panel uses evaluation criteria to assign score up to 100 for each applicant and to identify the applications strengths and weaknesses the criteria are established in regulation11 and described in greater detail in the grant announcements as set forth in the grant announcements these criteria include the extent to which the application identifies the services that will be provided as required by and consistent with rhya among other requirements demonstrates the organizational capacity necessary to oversee federal grants through an explanation of the organizations fiscal controls and governance structure among other requirements identifies quantitative outcomes for the proposed project that will fulfill the program purpose and scope of services as described in rhya and the grant announcement among other requirements describes clear and appropriate program objectives that will fulfill the program purpose as well as clear need for the proposed project through discussion of the conditions of youth and families in the area to be served among other requirements includes an organizational chart that demonstrates the relationship between all positions including consultants subgrants andor contractors to be funded through the grant among other requirements and includes detailed lineitem budget for the federal and nonfederal share of project costs and demonstrates how cost estimates were derived as further described in the grant announcements the review panels assigned scores assist the fysb associate commissioner and program staff in considering applications applications are generally ranked in order of the average scores assigned by reviewers however the scores in combination with other factors determine whether an application is funded these other factors include but are not limited to comments of reviewers and government officials hhs staff evaluation and input geographic distribution previous program performance of applicants compliance with grant terms under previous hhs grants audit reports investigative reports and an applicants progress in resolving any final audit disallowance on 10 for additional information about the grant review process see archived grant funding announcements for the program httpwwwacfhhsgovgrantsgrants_archivehtml 11 45 cfr 135181 crs9 previous fysb or other federal agency grants according to hhs because rhya grants are highly competitive wellqualified applicants may not receive funding12 further in some years applicants with scores in the 90s have not been awarded grants because such large number of applicants receive scores of 100 or close to 100 hhs does not have an appeals process for unsuccessful applicants however in accordance with hhss awarding agency grants administration manual aagam unsuccessful applicants are notified by letter that they were not awarded funding with full explanation of the reasons the application was not funded13 the letter contains compilation of review comments outlining the strengths and weaknesses of their application as identified by the panel of nonfederal reviewers compilations are also available for successful applications however they are only sent at the request of these applicants scores are not automatically sent to any applicants but are available upon request prevalence and incidence studies the precise number of homeless and runaway youth is unknown due to their residential mobility and other factors and rhya as authorized through fy2008 was silent on whether hhs or any other entity was to approximate this number runaway and homeless youth often eschew the shelter system for locations or areas that are not easily accessible to shelter workers and others who count the homeless and runaways14 determining the number of homeless and runaway youth is further complicated by the lack of standardized methodology for counting the population and inconsistent definitions of what it means to be homeless or runaway15 in response to 2002 congressional request through the appropriations process16 hhs submitted report to congress in 2003 that discusses plan for developing estimates of the incidences of runaway throwaway17 homeless and street experiences among youth as well as plan for regularly monitoring incidence trends18 12

seeks to determine the number of youth who have run away or are homeless by requiring hhs to estimate at five year intervals beginning within two years of the enactment of pl 110378 october 8 2010 the incidence and prevalence of the runaway and homeless youth population ages 13 to 26 the law also directs hhs to assess the characteristics of these youth hhs is required to conduct survey of and direct interviews with representative sample of homeless youth ages 13 to 26 to determine past and current socioeconomic characteristics barriers to obtaining housing and other services and other information hhs determines useful in consultation with states and other entities concerned with youth homelessness hhs is to consult with the federal interagency council on homelessness about the studies overall the new law does not specify the methodology for carrying out the studies except to say that hhs should make the estimate based on the best quantitative and qualitative social science research methods available further if hhs enters into an agreement with non federal entity to carry out the assessment the entity is to be nongovernmental organization or individual determined by hhs to have expertise in this type of research as mentioned above the law authorized such sums as may be necessary for fy2009 through fy2013 to conduct the study the studies must be submitted to the house education and labor committee and senate judiciary committee and made available to the public issues during the 110th congress the house and senate conducted hearings on the challenges facing runaway and homeless youth and the federally funded services to assist the population19 the issues raised included inadequate levels of funding for rhya grantees limited information about the outcomes of runaway and homeless youth and the need for greater education and workforce opportunities for these youth the reconnecting homeless youth act of 2008 incorporates provisions that in part address the

crs11 funding at hearing conducted by the senate judiciary committee on april 29 2008 service providers and advocates for runaway and homeless youth raised concerns that funds appropriated under rhya have not been adjusted for increases in the cost of living provider in vermont explained that his rhyafunded programs have been levelfunded since 1994 while costs have risen significantly these same concerns were highlighted at july 24 2007 hearing on runaway homeless and missing children conducted by the house education and labor committee subcommittee on healthy families and communities further the government accountability office described in its february 2008 report on disconnected youth that funding has remained stagnant for federal youth programs including those funded by rhya the report states while overall transitional living program funding increased in fy2002 to support greater number of programs the amount available to individual local programs capped at 200000 has not changed since 1992 one runaway and homeless program director explained that considering increases in the cost of operation this amount funds only part of one staff rather than three as in previous years20 an analysis of per grantee award amounts from fy2004 through fy2007 indicates that bcp and tlp funding has remained stable or has declined slightly21 for example 444 million in bcp funds was awarded to 345 grantees for fy2004 resulting in an average grant of 128734 for fy2007 approximately 433 million was awarded to 336 grantees with an average grant amount of about 128821 average tlp award amounts declined over the period from fy2004 through fy2007 for fy2004 194 grantees shared 36744000 in tlp funds resulting in an average grant of 189402 the average grant award decreased to 181558 for fy2007 when 190 grantees shared 34496000 in tlp funds in response to concerns about funding the reconnecting homeless youth act of 2008 increases the authorization of appropriations in at least one year fy2009 for the bcp tlp and sop and increases the minimum bcp awards for states and territories however for most programs including those authorized under the runaway and homeless youth act congress has passed and the president has enacted continuing resolution for fy2009 pl 110329 which in most cases provides for the same level of funding as in fy2008 the resolution extends until march 9 2009 and does not reflect final funding levels for fy2009 20 us government accountability office disconnected youth federal action could address some of the challenges faced by local programs that

living on the street such as the inability to find work and connect to school one witness at the senate judiciary hearing described the assistance he received at tlpfunded program that now employs him as manager for the program he explained that through intensive case management he was empowered to stop using drugs and to live independently yet little is known about the outcomes of runaway and homeless youth generally local grantee organizations have limited information about youth after they receive services and research on whether youth experience homelessness as adults is dated some grantees may decide to follow up with youth who received services but hhs does not require longitudinal data collection hhss 2007 report to congress promising strategies to end youth homelessness states that longerterm studies of runaway and homeless youth are challenging because of the youths transient nature22 further knowledge about effective strategies for serving these youth is limited23 and few if any studies appear to have been conducted to determine the costs and benefits of these interventions to glean more information about the runaway and homeless youth population the reconnecting homeless youth act of 2008 requires hhs to determine the incidence and prevalence of runaway and homeless youth and to report on the socio demographic and other characteristics of the population although not specified goal of the act this information may help practitioners and social science researchers develop effective interventions for the population evaluation of tlp sites efforts are currently underway at hhs to learn more about the youth who are served by the transitional living program in august 2007 hhs approved subcontract to abt associates to conduct an evaluation of the tlp at select grantee sites24 the study seeks to describe the outcomes of youth who participate in the program and to isolate and describe factors that may have contributed to their successes

administering the survey instruments the sites will also need to be large enough to capture an adequate sample size youth participants will complete surveys at entry and while receiving services through survey administered by their tlp programs they will also complete surveys for up to one year after leaving the program youth will selfreport the data to website six months and twelve months after exiting evaluators will compare the individual outcomes of each youth to his or her benchmark data the youth surveys are pending executive branch review and fysb expects to begin collecting the data by the end of calendar year 2008 fysb anticipates making preliminary information available before the last surveys are completed further fysb expects to maintain the selfreporting website

august 25 200825 education and employment outcomes for runaway and homeless youth on june 19 2007 the house ways and means subcommittee on income security and family support held hearing on disconnected and disadvantaged youth with focus on runaway youth witnesses described disconnected youth as those youth who have weak social networks of family friends and communities that can provide assistance such as employment connections health insurance coverage housing tuition and other financial assistance and emotional support they also discussed measurable characteristics to indicate whether youth are disconnected such as the lack of high school or college attendance coupled with not having job over specific period of time eg one year26 runaway and homeless youth are vulnerable to becoming disconnected because of separation from their families absence from school and nonparticipation in the economy27 family conflict rooted in abuse and neglect school problems and 25 us department of health and human services administration for children and families proposed information collection activity comment request 73 federal register 50022 august 25 2008 comments are due

runaway and homeless youth act and disconnected youth in jodie continued crs14 drug and alcohol abuse can compel youth to leave home family disconnectedness is also evident among many runaway and homeless youth involved in the foster care system these youth are brought to the attention of child welfare services because of incidents of abuse and neglect further youth aging out of the foster care system experience homelessness at greater rate than their counterparts in the general population due in part to family disconnectedness some gay and lesbian youth also experience family disassociation when they come out about their sexuality some runaway and homeless youth spend time out of school while they are away from permanent home the fy2007 neorhymis survey indicated that about 20 of youth were not attending school regularly before entering the basic center program28 of youth in the transitional living program 21 had dropped out of school some homeless youth face barriers to attending school because of transportation problems and the absence of parents and guardians who can provide records and permission for youth to participate in school activities finally some runaway and homeless youth are removed from the formal economy and resort to illegal activity including stealing and selling drugs in exchange for cash other such youth are too young to work legally or experience mental health and other challenges that make working difficult the reconnecting homeless youth act of 2008 seeks to fund research projects that focus on connecting youth to work and school the act amends rhya to require hhs to give priority to research evaluation demonstration and service projects that increase access to education and career pathways for runaway and homeless
