president george h w bush approved the sale of 150 f16ab fighters to taiwan in september 1992 the prc ended its participation in the arms control in the middle east talks some critics argued that the sale in 1992 of f16 fighters violated the 1982 communique on reducing arms sales to taiwan113 in addition to concerns about the political context of crossstrait stability and not undermining the tough message to taipei there are issues about whether taiwans limited defense dollars might be better spent on other defensive requirements such as munitions logistics training professional personnel etc another question concerns the impact of only 66 fighters on the military balance in the taiwan strait advocates say that taiwans legitimate request for f16cd fighters needed to maintain airsuperiority

modernized with missile buildup and foreign arms acquisitions primarily from russia121 as result of the plas provocative exercises and missile testfirings in 1995 and 1996 that were directed against taiwan congress has increasingly asserted its role visavis the administration in determining security assistance for taiwan as stipulated by section 3b of the tra as well as in exercising its oversight of section 2b6 of the tra on the us capacity to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion against taiwan congress increasingly asserted its role in determining arms sales to taiwan before sales were decided moreover section 3c of the tra requires the president to inform congress promptly of any threat to the security or the social or economic system of the people on taiwan and any danger to us interests so that the president together with the congress shall determine the appropriate us response in march 1996 during the taiwan strait crisis when president clinton deployed two aircraft carrier battle groups near taiwan the state department nonetheless testified that the situation did not constitute threat to the security or the social or economic system of

before the house international relations subcommittee on asia and the pacific hearing on crisis in continued crs23 center on how effectively the administration is helping taiwans selfdefense the role of congress in determining security assistance to taiwan and whether aspects of us security assistance are stabilizing or destabilizing and should be adjusted based on changing conditions overall the question for policy is whether to disengage from or increase engagement with taiwan in number of specific areas extent of us commitment on defense the persistent question for us decisionmakers in the military administration and congress is whether the united states would go to war with the prc over taiwan and the purpose of any conflict the tra did not replace the mutual defense treaty of 1954 that ended in 1979 nonetheless some have called for clear commitment to shore up deterrence and help taiwans selfdefense advanced arms sales interoperability with taiwans military combined operational training and planning highlevel meetings and visits by us flag and general officers to taiwan others have argued that the united states should avoid war with china and needs cooperative china in number of global problems that trends in the taiwan strait are destabilizing and that the united states should limit security assistance as leverage to prevent provocative moves by taiwans leaders the question of us assistance for taiwans defense involves two aspects intention willingness and capability to assist taiwans selfdefense in march 1996 president clinton deployed two aircraft carrier battle groups near taiwan in response to the plas provocative missile testfirings and exercises another question arose in april 2001 when president bush initially said that he would do whatever it took to help taiwan defend herself if china attacked supporters have viewed such clarity as needed to prevent miscalculations in beijing and deter attacks against taiwan however critics have argued that bush encouraged provocations from taipei even if the message was not meant for taiwan and weakened willingness in taiwan to strengthen its own defense later when taiwans president chen shuibian advocated referendums and new constitution president bush said that the comments and actions made by the leader of taiwan indicate that he may be willing to make decisions unilaterally to change the status quo which we oppose in appearing with prc premier wen jiabao in the oval office on december 9 2003 at hearing in april 2004 in answer to representative gary ackermans questions about whether president bushs phrase on whatever it took to help taiwan defend herself means that the united states would go to war with china if taiwan makes unilateral moves toward independence assistant secretary james kelly stated that what the president said has meaning at the time he says it to those listeners we intend to fulfill the defense responsibilities under the tra to the extent necessary we oppose actions that would unilaterally alter taiwans status leaders in taiwan misunderstood if they believe that president bush supports whatever they do and decisions of war and peace are made by the president with consultation with congress assistant secretary of defense peter rodman replied that president bushs phrase was reaffirmation of the tra which leaves certain ambiguity 122 continued the taiwan strait implications for us foreign policy march 14 1996 104th congress crs24 rodman also warned beijing that its use of force would inevitably involve the united states123 in december 2004 deputy secretary of state richard armitage also clarified the us defense commitment by saying we have the requirement with the taiwan relations act to keep sufficient force in the pacific to be able to deter attack we are not required to defend and these are questions that actually reside with the us congress who has to declare an act of war124 on june 8 2005 president bush qualified us assistance for taiwans self defense if it is invaded by saying that if china were to invade unilaterally we would rise up in the spirit of the taiwan relations act if taiwan were to declare independence unilaterally it would be unilateral decision that would then change the us equation the us look at the decisionmaking process125 in september 2005 the defense department further clarified the mutual obligations under the tra and limits to us ability to assist taiwans defense deputy under secretary of defense richard lawless issued speech stressing the tras focus on taiwans selfdefense he declared that inherent in the intent and logic of the tra is the expectation that taiwan will be able to mount viable selfdefense for too long the taiwan relations act has been referenced as purely us obligation under the tra the us is obligated to enable taiwan to maintain sufficient selfdefense but the reality is it is taiwan that is obligated to have sufficient selfdefense there is an explicit expectation in the tra that taiwan is ready willing and able to maintain its selfdefense taiwan must fulfill its unwritten but clearly evident obligations under the taiwan relations act by appropriately providing for its own defense while not simply relying on the uss capacity to address threat in the strait the tra requires both parties to do their part to deter aggression or coercion visavis taiwan126 cochair of the house taiwan caucus representative steve chabot stated on september 27 2005 at the heritage foundation that taiwan is only one ally and that it is principally taiwans responsibility to defend itself he said that it has been frustrating and disappointing to many members of congress that taiwan delayed passage of the special budget on arms procurement he warned that if taiwan does not pass the special budget many members of congress will reevaluate the extent of support for taiwan 123 house international relations committee hearing on the taiwan relations act the

official ed ross on september 19 2005 in san diego ca at the defense industry conference of the ustaiwan business council while lawless was delayed in beijing at the sixparty talks on north koreas nuclear weapons crs25 taiwans president chen shuibian announced on february 27 2006 that he would terminate the national unification council again raising questions about new tensions senator john warner chairman of the armed services committee told admiral william fallon pacom commander at hearing on march 7 2006 that if conflict were precipitated by just inappropriate and wrongful politics generated by the taiwanese elected officials im not entirely sure that this nation would come full force to their rescue if they created that problem on april 24 2007 at hearing of the senate armed services committee with the new pacom commander admiral timothy keating senator warner said taiwan should not play the tra card when the us military is engaged heavily in the world changes in pla missile deployments there has been interest among us academic circles and think tanks for washington to pursue talks with beijing on its military buildup and us arms sales to taiwan instead of simply enhancing security assistance to taiwan127 one catalyst for this debate arose out of the us prc summit in crawford tx on october 25 2002 as confirmed to taiwans legislature by its envoy to washington cj chen and reported in taiwans media thenprc ruler jiang zemin offered in vague terms freeze or reduction in chinas deployment of missiles targeted at taiwan in return for restraint in us arms sales to taiwan128 president bush reportedly did not respond directly to jiangs linkage editorials in taiwan were divided on whether to pursue jiangs offer some argued that confidence building measures such as freeze or reduction in pla missile and other military deployments would improve the chances for cross strait political dialogue and lead to greater stability they said that the united states could explore how the prc might reduce the threat against taiwan such as dismantling missile brigades in verifiable manner since sales of us systems are based on taiwans defense needs they argued that jiangs offer represented the first time that the prc offered meaningfully to discuss its forces opposite taiwan others said that freeze or redeployment of missiles would not eliminate the prcs continuing and broader military threat against taiwan including mobile missiles that can be redeployed and that the prc should hold direct talks with leaders in taipei instead they argued that jiang did not seek to reduce the plas coercive threat but to undermine the relationship between washington and taipei including sales and deliveries of weapons systems which take years to complete they pointed out that the plas missile buildup has continued 127 see david lampton and richard daniel ewing uschina relations in post september 11th world nixon center august 2002 david shambaughs

the administration might deal with beijing on the question of us arms sales to taiwan policy considerations include the tra the 1982 joint communique which discussed reductions in us arms sales to taiwan premised on the prcs peaceful unification policy and the 1982 six assurances to taiwan including one of not holding prior consultations with the prc on us arms sales to taiwan at hearing in march 2001 secretary of state colin powell assured senator helms that the six assurances would remain us policy and that the administration would not favor consulting the prc on arms sales to taiwan129 the bush administration reportedly did not counter jiangs verbal offer noting the accelerated missile buildup continued military threats against taiwan the need for the prc to talk directly to taiwan the tra and the six assurances to taiwan nonetheless in april 2004 assistant secretary of state james kelly testified that if the prc meets its stated obligations to pursue peaceful resolution of the taiwan issue and matches its rhetoric with military posture that bolsters and supports peaceful approaches to taiwan it follows logically that taiwans defense requirements will change130 in may 2005 an official prc newspaper reported that the pla continued to debate the question of whether to withdraw missiles opposite taiwan131 china has continued its buildup of shortrange ballistic missiles whose adequate precision guidance could destroy key leadership facilities military bases and communication and transportation nodes with minimal advanced warning warned the pentagons 2004 report to congress on prc military power later the secretary of defense reported to congress that by late 2007 the pla had deployed opposite taiwan an arsenal of 9901070 mobile m9 and m11 shortrange ballistic missiles buildup that has continued to expand by over 100 year132 taiwans commitment to selfdefense and budgets congress has oversight of the administrations dialogue with taiwan about its selfdefense and military budgets congress also has discussed with taiwan these responsibilities since 2002 some have expressed increasing concerns about taiwans commitment to its selfdefense and lack of national consensus on national security the pentagons report on prc military power submitted to congress in july 2002 said that reforms in taiwans military were needed to achieve joint service capability to meet the growing challenge from the plas modernizing air naval and missile forces but warned that the defense budgets steady decline as percentage of total government spending will challenge taiwans force modernization133 the pentagons report issued in july 2003 further stressed that the relative decline in 129 senate foreign relations committee hearing

defense budget for 2004 was about us78 billion which accounted for 24 of gdp and 167 of the total government budget as compared with 38 of gdp and 243 of total spending in 1994 see the table below these relative declines took place even as the pentagon has warned of an increased threat posed by the pla to taiwan us support for taiwan has increased after the 19951996 crisis and the pla has obtained higher budgets meanwhile the prc has significantly increased military budgets budgets that the defense department has assessed as markedly understating actual defenserelated expenditures by excluding funds for weapons research foreign arms purchases etc the secretary of defenses latest report on prc military power estimated that chinas total defense spending for 2007 could be 97139 billion about two to three times the announced military budget136 the prcs defense budget can be used as one indicator of the priority placed on the plas modernization in march 2008 the prc announced its military budget for 2008 that totaled 588 billion claiming 176 increase over last years military budget actually the announced 2008 budget is an increase of 191 over last years announced budget vs actual budget using the prcs own announced military budgets the 2008 budget is doubling of the 2004 budget this trend of doubledigit percentage increases has continued for years nominally china has raised its announced military budget by doubledigit percentage increases every year since 1989 after the taiwan strait crisis of 19951996 chinas announced military budget has increased in real terms accounting for inflation every year including real doubledigit percentage increases every year since 1998 chinas military budget is the highest in asia some legislators in taiwan have argued that taiwans defense spending has been sufficiently significant that the legislature in the newly consolidated democracy has the right to scrutinize the defense budget that economic challenges constrain defense spending and that taiwan does not need us weapons in an accommodation with the prc the us approvals of significant arms sales in 2001 came in the one year of negative real change in taiwans gdp 22 according to global insight also taiwans officials and legislators pointed out that taiwan had funded defense out of separate special budgets in addition to the regular annual defense budgets

administrations policy on arms sales to taiwan was right but it came at the wrong time140 for 2005 taiwans ministry of defense requested defense budget of nt2607 billion reduction of nt31 billion from 2004 and the final 2005 defense budget was nt2585 billion about us80 billion141 in august 2005 the defense ministry requested budget for 2006 of nt2657 billion an increase of nt72 billion from 2005 however that budget included an initial request to buy pac3 missile defense units after the ministry lowered the special budget by removing funds for pac3 minister of defense lee jye acknowledged major crowding out impact on the 2006 budget resulting from adding the pac3 request to the annual budget he lamented that he had to cut out 53 new programs that would have invested in combat strength142 on january 12 2006 the legislature voted to cut nt112 billion us348 million from the annual defense budget for 2006 funds that would have been supplementary funds to support procurement of pac3 missile defense p3c aircraft and submarines and did not direct those funds to be used for munitions training or other defense needs taiwans final 2006 defense budget was nt2525 billion about us78

years as discussed above in 2003 taiwans military received the us cost estimate for new submarines as well as price and availability data for pac3 missile defense systems and refurbished p3c planes in may 2003 minister of defense tang yiau ming sent letter to us deputy secretary of defense wolfowitz saying that taiwan planned to submit special budget to the legislature to procure the three weapon systems however tang allegedly doubted the special budget would pass while looking to the regular defense budget to fund items of priority to the army145 as taiwan considered special budget the pentagon encouraged decision in april 2004 assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs peter rodman testified to congress that we have made clear to our friends on taiwan that we expect them to reverse this budget decline though our commitments to taiwan are enduring the american people and both the executive branch and congress expect the people of taiwan to make their own appropriate commitment to their freedom and security rodman also stressed that we expect taiwan to go forward with its plan to pass special budget this summer to fund essential missile defense and antisubmarine warfare systems and programs emphasis added146 on may 29 2004 the pentagon issued the 2004 report to congress on prc military power stressing that the principal indicator of taiwans commitment to addressing its shortfalls will be the fate of its annual defense budget and that the islands apparent lack of political consensus over addressing its military challenges with substantially increased defense spending is undoubtedly seen as an encouraging trend in beijing on may 21 2004 taiwans defense minister lee jye retired naval admiral personally committed to procuring

not 15 years after deputy secretary of defense wolfowitz personally expressed to the delegation us opposition to taiwans more expensive proposal to build submarines domestically and that they would consider splitting up the special budget to approve funds for the p3c aircraft and pac3 missile defense systems ahead of considering the subs149 however politicians made the special budget into

in the special budget and retained their majority in the ly rising us frustrations in speech in october 2004 deputy undersecretary of defense richard lawless urged taiwans legislature to vote in favor of taiwans national security150 in strong tone he warned that the special budget was litmus test of taiwans commitment to its selfdefense and that inability to pass the special budget would have serious longterm consequences for foreign support further intimidation from beijing and perceptions of taiwan as liability lawless also called for taiwan to expand its efforts from national defense to national security including countering coercion and managing crises by protecting critical infrastructure national command facilities telecommunications energy water media computer networks etc raising frustrations in the bush administration and congress that taiwan has not placed priority on selfdefense it became increasingly doubtful in 2005 that the ly would vote on the special budget and fund it at the full level even if it is considered meanwhile the united states has increased concerns about and shifted focus to the regular defense budget and other questions about taiwans selfdefense cutting the special budget in 2005 in january 2005 president chen shuibian told visiting representative tom lantos that pfp chairman james soong changed his position on the special budget

dollar and that the request would be reduced to nt480 billion us155 billion after removing certain costs including an estimated us23 billion associated with producing submarines domestically in taiwan153 the reduced figure also factored in moving some infrastructure costs to the annual defense budget but that budget has faced cuts the cabinet approved the new request on march 16 and submitted it to the ly154 two days earlier the prcs national peoples congress adopted its antisecession law warning that the government in beijing may use force against taiwan however chen and soong issued tenpoint consensus on february 24 2005 that did not mention the special budget indeed the pfp raised another objection saying that the major items should be funded out of the annual defense budget instead of special budget155 the defense ministry began to consider asking for funds for the pac3 missile defense systems out of the annual defense budget with submarines as the top priority rather than missile defense stressed by the bush administration156 in aprilmay 2005 the chairmen of the opposition parties kmts lien chan and pfps james soong made historic visits of reconciliation to

as kmt chairman prompting some to ask whether ma would show leadership in considering the special budget however he focused on the city and county elections on december 3 2005 when the kmt won 14 out of 23 seats on august 1 2005 three cochairs of the house taiwan caucus wrote to ma yingjeou as the new kmt chairman they urged him to lead efforts in taipei to ensure that the legislative yuan quickly passes special arms procurement package or increases its annual defense spending they also invited ma to visit washington160 however ma responded as the mayor of taipei on august 18 one day before becoming kmt chairman by blaming the dpp administration for procrastinating for three years negligence and lack of leadership with mention of wang jinpyngs ly delegation in june 2004 ma promised to focus his attention on the issue and to work closely with the kmt caucus in the ly after taking over the kmt chairmanship he also declined to visit in september writing that the ly will address tough bills like the arms procurement bill161 however after pfp chairman james soong met with ma on september 7 he announced that the kmt and pfp party caucuses will continue to consult each other on whether to advance the special budget for consideration in the ly162 meanwhile ma set up kmt task force to study the arms issue and there have been questions about whether the kmt would support certain arms purchases and incur rising differences with its weakening coalition partner the pfp after the december 2005 elections before the lys session began on september 13 2005 the defense ministry submitted new special budget to cover submarines and p3c aircraft moving the request for pac3 missile defense to the regular budget so that the special budget was about half of the original amount ly president wang jinpyng of the kmt acknowledged the reduction as goodwill gesture and said that it is time to address the issue163 on august 31 2005 the executive yuan approved special budget of nt340 billion us103 billion after removing nt140 billion us42 billion for pac3s on september 28 2005 the defense ministry issued details on its latest 158 lien chan chairman of the kmt letter to

limits to us help when asked about the lys delay in deciding to purchase us weapons secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said in august 2005 that under the tra the us obligation is to work with taiwan on security assistance but it is up to taiwan make its own decisions165 on september 19 2005 deputy under secretary of defense richard lawless issued another strong speech this time directed at taiwans people and saying that he was not urging the passage of the special budget because it has become political distraction lawless applauded the goal of increasing the defense budget to 3 of gdp he warned of the danger that taiwans steadily declining defense budgets and the resulting erosion in its own defense capabilities also adversely affect the status quo in addition to the pla buildup he expressed the us expectation that taiwan has the collective will to invest in viable defense to address growing threat and be in position to negotiate the future of crossstrait relations from position of strength he criticized the military for shortchanging itself on reserves of critical munitions and inadequate hardening for defense lawless stressed that under the tra taiwan also has an obligation for its selfdefense he warned that the time of reckoning is upon us the us ability to contribute to taiwans defense in crisis is going to be measured against taiwans ability to resist defend and survive based on its own capabilities as the lone superpower our interests are plentiful and our attention short we cannot help defend you if you cannot defend yourself166 separately the commander of the pacific command pacom admiral william fallon raised questions in press articles and interviews about his assessment of whether taiwan should prioritize its limited defense resources on defensive weapons rather than submarines given taiwans urgent need to effectively upgrade its selfdefense admiral fallon reportedly raised this question with taiwans chief of general staff general lee tienyu who recently had visited hawaii admiral fallon also told the united daily news his concern that if he is to be able to maintain the us commitment to assist taiwans defense then taiwan should have strong selfdefense capability167 on october 26 2005 eight members led by representative simmons asked admiral fallon to explain his discussions with taiwan on submarines admiral fallon responded that he has not tried to discourage this purchase he added however that pacom has strongly and consistently 164 tungsen hsinwen pao taipei september 28 2005 165 secretary of defense donald rumsfeld news

taipei october 18 2005 crs35 encouraged taiwan to acquire capabilities that would have an immediate impact on its defense and while submarines would provide taiwan with significant capabilities lengthy period of time would be needed to fulfill this longterm acquisition program168 on october 29 2005 at the transfer ceremony for the first two kiddclass destroyers marine brigadier general john allen principal director for asian and pacific affairs in the office of the secretary of defense gave speech saying that it is imperative that the people of taiwan hold their leaders of all political parties accountable for reaching consensus to increase defense spending while it is not appropriate for the united states to tell taiwan what budgeting mechanism to use the us role he said is to provide the assistance necessary to help taiwans strategy for stability but at the end of the day it is taiwan that must decide its fate in the first notification to congress on arms sales to taiwan since march 2004 the defense department in october 2005 put new stress on the tras objective which is to assist taiwan to provide for its own selfdefense like lawless the director of dsca air force lt gen jeffrey kohler also highlighted taiwans inadequate attention to its stocks of airdefense missiles and other munitions as well as pending decisions on defense spending in an interview in december 2005169 at hearing of the house armed services committee on march 9 2006 in response to representative rob simmons question about the submarine sale to taiwan admiral william fallon expressed the dilemma for pacom regarding taiwan fallon said that he was in bit of box here because im committed to defend this country in the event of any military aggression should that occur from the prc and yet the history is that they have not been forthcoming in investing in their own defense what id like to see is some steps being made some investment by taiwan to actually acquire some of these capabilities and to boost their own readiness and ability to provide for their own defense special budget blocked in legislature on december 13 2005 opposition lawmakers in the procedures committee voted for the 41st time to block the statute governing the special budget keeping it from the lys agenda since it was first introduced in 2004 however at the procedures committee meeting on december 20 the dpp and its allied lawmakers called vote at moment when they had majority and the committee voted 125 to report the statute to the ly on the eve of full ly consideration the kmt and pfp chairmen ma yingjeou and james soong met and announced their joint opposition to wealthy fools arms deal the ministry of defense announced it will move the request for p3s and reduce the special budget to one request of nt299 billion us9 billion about half of the original special budget for submarines meanwhile representatives rob simmons 168 letter to representative simmons from admiral william fallon november 8 2005 169 jim wolf pentagon official says taiwan short on weapons reuters dec 7 2005 crs36 and tom tancredo issued statements saying the special budget was critical for the defense of taiwan and applauded its passage out of the procedures committee representative simmons also said that blocking this arms package tells the united states correctly or not that taiwans leadership is not serious about the security of its people or its freedom the american people have come to the aid of foreign countries in the name of freedom many times in our history but americans will not in good conscience support countries that are unwilling to defend themselves170 when the ly convened on december 23 2005 to consider the special budget kmt and pfp lawmakers proposed to end the meeting before debating the bill taiwans lawmakers voted 113100 to end the meeting 20 minutes after it began this move effectively sent the bill on the special budget back to the procedures committee which then voted as before to block its progress on december 27 2005 january 3 and january 10 2006 the 45th time that opposition lawmakers in the ly blocked the statute on the special defense budget after its introduction in 2004 waiting for ma yingjeous kmt defense policy ly president wang jinpyng kmt visited washington on january 2425 2006 and promised kmt policy on defense from ma yingjeou including on arms sales in february or march unlike his visit in 2004 wangs highestlevel interlocutors in the pentagon were deputy assistant secretary of defense mary beth long and the principal director for asian and pacific affairs brigadier general john allen there were results from this visit in february 2006 representative rob simmons visited taipei and suggested lower cost for the submarine sale perhaps 8 billion and an interim step for taiwan to procure sub design perhaps 225 million also in february representative henry hyde chairman of the house international relations committee sent letter to ma citing deep concern in congress about the lys failure in the past two years to pass the special budget and about significant cuts in other defense spending that would improve readiness hyde also wrote that americans are left wondering whether taiwans legislators have the resolve to meet the challenges in providing for taiwans own defense171 in march 7 letter ma responded to representative hyde by blaming the dpp administration and promising his own policy in the near future while the house taiwan caucus in august 2005 had invited kmt chairman ma yingjeou to visit he scheduled trip to washington for march 2223 2006 while congress was in recess ma failed on march 14 to gain his partys approval to issue longawaited policy on defense and arms procurement despite his upcoming visit to washington ma had details on his defense priorities in meetings during his visit with the private sector and the bush administration while campaigning to be president ma issued defense policy in september 2007 with stance that supported purchases of us weapons including submarines 170 rep rob simmons us congressman congratulates taiwan on defense spending bill

february 21 2006 the procedures committee blocked the statute on the special budget for the 46th time thus in march 20 special report to the ly defense minister lee jye decided to request procurement of subs and p3s through supplemental funds in the regular 2006 defense budget instead of the special budget nt200 million about us6 million as working fees to study sub procurement program and nt17 billion about us52 million for p3c aircraft the defense ministry then decided also to request supplemental funds of nt37 billion about us113 million for pac2 upgrades not pac3 missiles the supplemental request for the 2006 budget for these three weapon systems totaled nt56 billion about us172 million this amount for the three proposed programs was included in the ministers broader 2006 supplemental budget request of nt137 billion about us420 million for 74 programs172 in march 2006 the defense ministry submitted its request to the executive yuan ey or cabinet which then approved on may 24 supplemental budget for the 2006 defense budget of nt63 billion about us194 million with the three weapons requests plus nt700 million for construction of an airstrip on taiwan controlled taiping island in the spratly islands in the south china sea the supplemental budget also needed to be approved by the ly but its session ended on may 30 and kmt legislators including lin yufang raised concerns particularly about the supplemental budgets legal basis173 the ly decided on june 12 to hold special session on june 1330 but consideration of the supplemental budget for defense was not on the agenda that focused on trying to recall president chen from office on june 14 the ey approved draft bill to govern the supplemental budget the kmt demanded in midoctober 2006 that the dpp administration withdraw the original special budget if the supplemental budget was to be considered while the dpp agreed to this compromise it fell apart when the kmt and pfp still voted on october 24 to oppose placing the 2006 supplemental request on the lys agenda this outcome prompted the us representative in taipei stephen young to call press conference two days later at which he strongly urged the ly to pass robust defense budget in this falls legislative session he pressed the legislators to permit the supplemental budget to pass through the procedural committee and be taken to the floor of the legislature so that an open debate can begin174 however his remarks stirred controversy in taiwans charged domestic political context in defiance of this latest us message the opposition kmt and pfp legislators voted in the procedures committee on october 31 to block the supplemental budget on december 26 2006 after some opponents forgot to vote against the supplemental bill it was passed out of the procedures committee three days later the ly voted 172 cna march 20 and april 4 2006 special report of the ministry of defense march 20 2006 and authors interviews in taipei in april 2006 173 during consultations in taipei in april 2006 lin yufang said that supplemental budget request would be illegal that the issue is not the budgeting mechanism but whether the three weapon systems should be procured and that such requests could crowd out other funding needs of the army and air force or other ministries 174 ait director stephen young press conference taipei october 26 2006 crs38

billion us22 billion175 proposal to buy f 16cd fighters made up nt161 billion us488 million of this increase176 without special budget or 2006 supplemental budget the bush administration us industry and congress shifted the focus to whether the ly would approve the 2007 defense budget with spending increase during what was considered its critical september 2006 to january 2007 session at the ustaiwan defense industry conference on september 1012 2006 the defense department declined to even issue policy address to taiwan after making the effort in 2004 and 2005 the state departments director of the taiwan office warned taiwans political figures from opposition and ruling parties that leaders who aspire to represent the taiwan people to the united states should recognize that their decisions right now on core national security issues will have an impact on the future bilateral relationship he also focused attention on how the ly will pass the 2007 defense budget this fall177 on november 6 2006 the lys defense and budget committees jointly passed an amended 2007 defense budget they approved requested funds to procure p3c asw planes and pac2 upgrades deleted about us347 million for pac3 missiles and cut the request for the sub program from about us139 million to us6 million for the lys own feasibility study for subs they also froze funds for f16cd fighters for five months ending on may 31 2007 pending us provision of price and availability data however the ly session ended on january 19 2007 without passing government budget including the 2007 defense budget because of another political dispute finally on june 15 2007 the ly passed the 2007 defense budget with about 6 million to conduct feasibility study on buying submarines not commitment to either design phase or submarines 188 million for p3c planes 110 million for pac2 upgrades and funds for pac3 missiles and 488 million for f16cd fighters with funds frozen until october 31 pending us

for the p3c planes and pac2 upgrades by formally notifying congress of the proposed sales in september and november 2007 however taiwans military has unused budgeted funds to apply to 2009 with progress presidential notifications to congress on several other arms programs and with the us refusal to accept request for f16cd fighters through august 2008 when taiwans executive yuan submitted the 2009 defense budget to the ly with the unused funds as one explanation the proposed 2009 defense budget is reduction from the previous years budget president mas administration submitted 2009 defense budget of nt3152 billion us102 billion accounting for 172 of the total government budget this budget would be 23 of taiwans gdp visits by generalsadmirals to taiwan as for seniorlevel contacts the united states and taiwan have held highlevel defenserelated meetings in the united states as discussed above us policy previously restricted highlevel military contacts but changed to welcome taiwans senior military officers and defense officials to visit the united states shifting the question to their willingness to make the visits at the same time the state departments policy has avoided sending to taiwan us flag and general officers or officials at or above the level of deputy assistant secretary of defense or state for hearing in 1999 assistant secretary of state stanley roth responded to submitted question on this issue by writing that following the 1994 policy review the administration authorized travel by highlevel officials including cabinet officers from economic and technical agencies however restrictions remained at the same level for visitors from military or national security agencies at or above the position of deputy assistant secretary and at the rank of onestar flag officer or above this policy is based on the determination that visits of such officials would be inconsistent with maintaining an unofficial relationship178 the state department issued guidelines on relations with taiwan to continue the policy to ban official travel to taiwan for state or defense department officials above the level of office director or for uniformed military personnel above the rank of o6 colonel navy captain179 the pentagon and some in congress have sought to lift this restriction in order to advance us interests in boosting taiwans deterrence capability and us leverage in taiwan seniorlevel exchanges could help to understand taiwans crisismanagement and selfdefense capabilities and limitations180 the tra does not specify unofficial or official relations with taiwan some have cited the nscs record of sending senior officials to taipei for clear and 178 senate foreign relations committee hearing on united statestaiwan relations the

opposed sending senior military officers and defense officials to taiwan as an unnecessary ineffective change to sensitive situation see congressional actions below taiwans missile program referencing the tras section 2b5 to provide taiwan with arms of defensive character policymakers face question of how to respond to taiwans increasing interest in counterstrike missiles ballistic and cruise missiles some politicians in taiwan and us advocates talk about missiles as deterrent182 some americans see taiwans strategy as inherently defensive against the prc with tactical utility for missiles others call this desire for longrange weapons unhelpful for stability and us escalation control183 bush administration officials reportedly raised objections to taiwans missile programs184 however this objection raised an issue of whether the administration contradicted its past position and undermined taiwans defense185 another issue covered whether the refusal to consider taiwans request for f16cds undermines this position third issue was whether the us stance should be stronger and clearer at press conference in october 2006 the us representative in taipei stephen young said that us policy helps taiwan to have selfdefense not to attack the mainland because that was never in the cards and still isnt now but to defend itself by april 2007 the administration became more concerned about misperception of us assistance for or approval of taiwans hsiungfeng 2e hf 2e landattack cruise missile program also us officials reportedly linked taiwans planned deployment of such missiles to consideration of request for f16cd fighters186 right after taiwans han kuang exercise in april 2007 the new pacom commander admiral timothy keating testified to congress about the situation in the taiwan strait while expecting dennis blairs full briefing on the exercise keating stressed how emphatically we emphasize to taiwan that its actions should be defensive in nature and not offensive187 finally because the han kuang military exercise included demonstration of the use of the lacm to blair national security council official publicly stated we think that developing defensive capabilities is the right thing to do we think that offensive capabilities on either side of the strait are destabilizing and therefore not in the interest of peace and stability so when you ask

stating that there were claims that the united states government approved of the use of longrange offensive missiles during the han kuang military exercise and that they even offered name for these systems i want to say categorically here on behalf of the us government that these stories are inaccurate he added that what we think taiwan should be placing its emphasis on is missile defense citing the pac3 missile defense system189 despite the lack of us support in december 2007 taiwans ly approved about 117 million but froze 77 million for the hf2e program in the final 2008 defense budget presidents freeze on arms sales notifications in 2008 congressional concerns and frustrations mounted about the delay in the presidents notifications and briefings to congress on eight pending arms sales as well as his refusal to accept taiwans request for f16cd fighters as discussed above president bush changed policy in april 2001 to consider taiwans arms requests routinely on an asneeded basis similar to acceptance of other foreign requests for security assistance however the administrations refusal to accept formal request from taiwan for f16cd fighters since 2006 has raised the issue of whether the administration violated or changed its own policy without public discussion in october 2007 the house passed hres 676 and senator lisa murkowski wrote letter to national security advisor stephen hadley see 110th congress below in addition to the uncertainty of the bush administrations decisionmaking there were also questions about any changes in the security strategy and defense policy of president ma yingjeou particularly given the past ambivalence of the kmt party there were questions about the kmts review of pending us arms programs reportedly including whether to pursue the submarine purchase190 in the summer and fall of 2008 president mas military viewpoint reportedly was influenced by us article critical of the proposed arms sales programs191 after the inauguration of taiwans kmt president ma yingjeou on may 20 2008 he promptly resumed dialogue with the prc on june 1213 resulting in expanded charter flights and tourism across the taiwan strait in july while the resumption of the dialogue for the first time in decade was welcomed both the ma and bush administrations were concerned about the timing of announcements on arms sales to taiwan during the first round of the resumed dialogue192 nonetheless taiwan later showed concern about the bush administrations delay in making progress on 188 dennis wilder special assistant to the president and

tra and was working on the notifications taiwans military was increasingly concerned about the potential loss of unspent budgeted funds for programs as it neared the end of the 2008 budget year members of congress suspected that the president effectively suspended arms sales to taiwan in violation of the tra and other aspects of us policy congress also was concerned about the lack of timely and complete information requested from the administration with disregard for the congressional role they feared that president bush was deferring to objections in beijing or other policy considerations even before june deputy secretary of state john negroponte testified to senator lisa murkowski at the foreign relations committee on may 15 2008 that after taiwans legislature approved funding of the weapons programs which was in december 2007 the administration did not take or plan to take subsequent steps in arms sales despite the lack of notifications to congress on pending arms sales to taiwan since the last notification in november 2007 assistant secretary of defense for asian and pacific security affairs james shinn denied at hearing that we made decision to put things in abeyance in testimony on june 25194 on july 16 2008 pacom commander admiral timothy keating confirmed at public event at the heritage foundation that the administrations policy was to freeze arms sales to taiwan he reportedly confirmed discussions with prc officials about their objections raising question about the administrations violation of the tra and six assurances moreover keating implied that arms sales would be destabilizing to the situation in the taiwan strait and that there was pressing need for arms sales to taiwan at this moment even as he acknowledged crossstrait military imbalance favoring the prc in contrast former pacom commander dennis blair who just visited taiwan in june said that taiwans military and civilian leaders understood the need to negotiate with the prc from position of strength and to maintain taiwans defense195 also former bush administration officials urged president bush to keep his commitment on taiwan196 some in congress became

congressional session president bush finally notified congress pentagon spokesman said that the pla canceled military meetings and port visits through the end of november in continued politicization of contacts198 however president bush submitted only six of the eight pending sales for total value of 65 billion or about half of the pending total the administration did not submit for congressional review the pending programs for black hawk helicopters or the submarine design moreover the sale of pac3 missile defense systems was broken up excluding three of seven firing units and about 50 missiles representative ileana roslehtinen stated on the day of the formal notifications that they were in accordance with the tra but criticized the president for not following the letter and spirit of the law and for keeping congress in the dark about us arms sales policy toward taiwan she noted this grave breach of executive branch cooperation with congress also senator john mccain pointed out that the arms sales have been on hold for too long and urged the administration to reconsider its decision not to provide submarines or f16 fighters199 congress might further reassert its legislated role in policy decisions the administrations longawaited decision to submit the notifications raised more questions about arbitrary decisions in addition to piling up the notifications for months one policy option is to resurrect the annual arms sales talks200 other options are to reassess us arms sales in strategic approach as well as to hold serious defense dialogue with taiwan policy reviews and us objectives during taiwans politically motivated impasse over funding for selfdefense former pentagon official warned that if taiwan did not pass the special budget and there were expected

policy toward taiwan204 at the ustaiwan business councils conference on taiwans defense in february 2003 in san antonio tx deputy assistant secretary of defense richard lawless told taiwans vice defense minister chen chaomin and others that while the president said that we will do whatever it takes to help taiwan defend itself taiwan should not view americas resolute commitment to peace and stability in the taiwan strait as substitute for investing the necessary resources in its own defense at the same occasion deputy assistant secretary of state randall schriver indicated new proactive us approach to taiwans defense modernization pointing taiwan to three priorities missile defense c4isr and asw taiwans election in march 2004 brought the reelection of president chen shuibian and his advocacy of new constitution for taiwan by 2008 in april 2004 the defense and state departments testified to the house international relations committee expressing readjustment in the bush administrations policy toward taiwan205 assistant secretary of state james kelly clarified us policy by stating the united states does not support independence for taiwan or unilateral moves that would change the status quo as we define it 202 testimony of assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs winston lord taiwan policy review before the senate foreign relations

years april 21 2004 crs45 and opposes statements or actions from either side that would unilaterally alter taiwans status us efforts at deterring prc coercion might fail if beijing ever becomes convinced taiwan is embarked upon course toward independence and permanent separation from china and concludes that taiwan must be stopped it would be irresponsible of us or of taiwans leaders to treat the prcs statements as empty threats the united states looks to president chen to exercise the kind of responsible democratic and restrained leadership that will be necessary to ensure peaceful and prosperous future for taiwan there are limitations with respect to what the united states will support as taiwan considers possible changes to its constitution we urge beijing and taipei to pursue dialogue as soon as possible through any available channels without preconditions one policy issue is the relative stress on crossstrait dialogue vs deterrence in his testimony assistant secretary of state kelly argued that premise of arms sales to taiwan has been that secure and selfconfident taiwan is taiwan that is more capable of engaging in political interaction and dialogue with the prc and we expect taiwan will not interpret our support as blank check to resist such dialogue however some observers have begun to question the continued validity of this premise james lilley former ambassador in beijing and representative in taipei warned in april 2004 that the implicit american premise was that secure and stable taiwan would be more willing and successful partner in dealing with china judicious arms sales to taiwan were part of this formula and in the past it has worked if elements of this broader formula are disregarded by the current taiwan authorities however then the successful historic pattern has been broken us military support and arms sales cannot be used by taiwan to move away from china they were meant to make taiwan feel secure enough to move toward accommodation with china our support should be conditional on upholding our successful pattern206 any policy review might be coordinated with allies in asia and europe while in beijing in august 2004 australian foreign minister alexander downer reportedly expressed doubts about whether any us military help for taiwans defense against china would involve invoking australias defense treaty with the united states207 in february 2005 secretary of defense donald rumsfeld and secretary of state condoleezza rice with japans ministers for defense and foreign affairs issued joint statement of the

crossstrait integration has raised concerns about the leakage of military technology and secrets from taiwan to mainland china as supporters of taiwan wrote in october 2006 there is little sense in americas continued support of taiwans defenses if taiwan has intention of using them to deter attack by the chinese washington is increasingly alarmed that taiwans politicians wittingly or unwittingly

airtoair missiles acquired from russia the report raised questions as to whether the pla already deployed the missiles meeting one of the conditions by which the united states would deliver the

the day of the last annual arms sales talks that he would drop the annual arms talks process with taiwan in favor of normal routine considerations on an asneeded basis219 due to the absence of diplomatic relations successive administrations used process in determining arms sales to taiwan that was institutionalized in the early 1980s as annual rounds of talks with taiwan defense authorities consisting of several phases leading up to final meetings usually in april220 in overseeing the new process factors or implications to consider included the following congresss role in decisionmaking

supporting security assistance have been civilian staff and retired or resigned military personnel in signing the bill into law on september 30 2002 president bush issued statement that included criticism of section 1206 major nonnato ally he said that section 1206 could be misconstrued to imply change in the one china policy of the united states when in fact that us policy remains unchanged

nonetheless the acting under secretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics michael wynne submitted letter to congress on august 29 2003 that designated taiwan as major nonnato ally

college review summer 2003 crs51 the us commitments under the taiwan relations act and for the presidents commitment to the defense of taiwan we believe that the objectives of section 1202 are best achieved by preserving the traditional statutory role of the secretary to exercise authority direction and control over the department of defense to conduct such activities as are needed to support those commitments including his authority to preserve the confidentiality of those activities the pentagon strongly recommends that this provision be deleted although we would not object to language that would call upon the department to brief the congress periodically on progress we are making to meet our commitments to taiwan security wolfowitz wrote as enacted on december 2 2002 the fy2003
