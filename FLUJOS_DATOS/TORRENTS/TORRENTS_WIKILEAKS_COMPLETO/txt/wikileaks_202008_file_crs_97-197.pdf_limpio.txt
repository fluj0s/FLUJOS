programs februa ry 1996 letter from us ambassador to the united nations albright to the chairman of the working group on strengthening the system proposed consolidating ll the technicaldevelopment assistance functions into fewer agencies under undp umbrella of funds and programs undp administrator speth also proposed re organization which would bring all the development and humanitarian assistance programs under new deputy secretary general absorbing undp some us critic s argue that reducing contributions to undp and other development entities has encouraged these consolidation measures the department of state argues that redu ced contributions undermine the work of administrator speth and threaten his reforms evolving undp role some in congress object to role in development and would limit activities to specific activities such as humanitarian assistance the majority of undp members however s upport strong development role development experts express concern at the growing percent of development aid devoted to emergency relief currently over 40 of assistance is directed to people in humanitarian emergencies according to undp in all but eight countries the undp

which began in 1995 provides greater country incentives for the design of more focused activities programs will be approved on the basis of their likely impact on the recipient countries as well as on the countrys poverty level these changes begun by administrator speth will not be presented and discussed by undp members until spring 1997 it is unclear whether they will be acceptable to the many undp members w ho prefer that aid be given to countries on per capita basis us influence having an american as undp administrator and making large contribution have ensured strong us in fluence over the organization the state department argues that influence over the direction and program content of undp quarantees that broad us foreign policy interests are supported by undp programs nevertheless
