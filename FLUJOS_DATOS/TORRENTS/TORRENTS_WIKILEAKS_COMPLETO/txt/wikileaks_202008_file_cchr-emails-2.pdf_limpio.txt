in the right direction clearwater voters expect city elections in march but when they go to the polls for the jan 29 presidential preference primary they will find they need to choose mayor and make decisions on six city charter amendments two of clearwaters bestknown politicians are facing off in the mayors race frank hibbard the current mayor would like second threeyear term rita garvey who was mayor from 1987 to 1999 is asking to return hibbard 40 served on the city council from 2002 to 2005 and became mayor in 2005 when one filed to run against him married father of two collegeage children hibbard is financial adviser and vice president at an investment firm he has lived in clearwater 29 years garvey 62 was first elected in 1980 and served as city commissioner until being elected mayor in 1987 she volunteers as coordinator of the bookstore at the clearwater main library widow with three adult children garvey has lived in clearwater 38 years this is pivotal election offering clearwater residents the choice of looking to the future or returning to the past frank hibbard has provided vibrant forwardlooking leadership as mayor garveys record as mayor was mixed and since she left office she has not followed city business enough to remain well informed the times recommends that residents give hibbard their vote though he was young and had only three years in city government under his belt when he became mayor hibbard had ambitions for clearwater he wanted the stagnation that had plagued clearwater during the 90s to end he wanted clearwater beach revitalized with modern amenities to support the citys vital tourism industry he wanted new people living in downtown to helpspark renaissance there he hoped to get neighborhoods some things they needed such as traffic calming hibbard takes the job of mayor extremely seriously and spends many hours at it despite having another fulltime job while garvey has always called clearwater small town and approached the mayors job from that folksy perspective hibbard knows clearwater is the secondlargest city in the most densely populated county in florida and therefore place that needs handson leadership he has helped make clearwater player in the tampa bay region because of his leadership skills he has been tapped for other roles including president of the pinellas mayors council chairman of the county metropolitan planning organization and board member of the florida league of mayors and the tampa bay partnership his skills and his interest in solving traffic problems resulted in an appointment to the board of the tampa bay area regional transit authority new group wrestling with how to bring modern mass transit to west central florida while hibbard has been mayor the city government has been stable and new development has occurred condominium towers are under construction downtown new libraries are open downtown and in north greenwood two neighborhoods have new recreation centers the glen

hotel built on clearwater beach in 20 years was opened and other hotel projects are in the pipeline beach walk is already partially built and once finished will provide great public amenity for walkers skaters bicyclists or those who just want to enjoy meal at sidewalk cafe when he was first elected mayor hibbard could not have guessed that bust in the housing market faltering economy and state tax reform soon would challenge officials at all levels of government when it happened the clearwater city council was one of the first in pinellas to implement spending controls and propose cuts the property tax rate was reduced almost 20 percent over the past two years while hibbard has been grappling with the growing complexities of governing garvey by her own admission has not been paying attention garvey says she decided to run for mayor at the last minute when it appeared one else would challenge hibbard it is important for voters to remember garveys last months in office on nov 5 1998 garvey was on her way to city hall to preside over an important meeting at which city commissioners would vote on plan to build roundabout and massive fountain at the entrance to clearwater beach she crashed her car into parked van walked back home and had her husband drive her to city hall two weeks later police announced that she was being charged with leaving the scene of an accident and driving under the influence tests placed herblood alcohol level at 0335 more than four times the level at which florida presumes drivers are impaired garvey announced that she was an alcoholic an admission that followed several months of unusual behavior by garvey at city commission meetings garvey lost her bid for reelection in march 1999 to brian aungst she also lost campaign for commission seat in 2001 year in which she now says she relapsed and sought counseling again for her alcohol problem it is not clear how much garvey drinks today garveys decision to run again has reopened public discussion about both her alcoholism and her record as city official some of those supporting garvey recall her tenure with nostalgia in the role of smalltown mayor she popped up at pot lucks neighborhood meetings and ribbon cuttings commissions on which she served built branch libraries approved new bridge to clearwater beach instituted strict sign code and planted flowers around town however commissions on which garvey served also created the costly harborview center approved new city office buildings that were too small and whose construction was bungled and ignored the decline of clearwater beach until the tourist area became dilapidated hibbard on the other hand is determined to preserve high quality of life for clearwater residents determination reflected in the successes of his first term and he has several issues he wants to continue working on in second term he is still trying to find developer who will build movie theater in the city he and other officials are meeting with landowners as they continue the difficult task of finding affordable land for parking garage on clearwater beach while there may be fewer city projects in the years ahead hibbard believes his financial background will be useful as the city tries to find creative ways to finance qualityoflife projects in taxcutting era hibbard has worked hard and accomplished much and done it with

florida should join in the drugs in question are known as atypical antipsychotics and include risperdal abilify geodon and seroquel originally intended to treat major mental illnesses like schizophrenia and bipolar mania they have become increasingly widely prescribed for children with autism and attentiondeficit disorder with tics yet the us food and drug administration has approved few of these drugs for use with children especially in conjunction with many of the conditions for which the powerful drugs are prescribed theres littleresearch on the effects of the drugs and growing number of reports suggest that the medication could be responsible for deaths or serious side effects including tardive dyskenisa involuntary jerking of the limbs and grimacing state medicaid programs across the country have found themselves paying for increasing quantities of these drugs in florida the number of child medicaid recipients taking atypical antipsychotics has doubled since 1999

to brief you on the truth about what actually happened in germany while the website with the vote on it iis still in place since december and it was frontloaded with 70000 votes against scientology you should know the following once year the secretaries of the interior of all the different states of germany meet together with the federal minister of interior this happened not too long ago at that conference the interior minister of the city state of hamburg introduced the motion to put on the meeting agenda the possibility of banning scientology in germany this was completely rejected as there is legal reason for it and there exists legal procedure for doing something like this in germany so this motion never made it onto the agenda and was never taken up or further discussed in any way now the merchants of chaos in their efforts to enturbulate had one of the major boulevard newspapers in germany publish complete falsehood of an article claiming that the secretary of the interior demands the ban of scientology in germany this article was picked up by other newspapers in germany and is now making its rounds but please realize its complete falsehood best regards gerhard b schwandtps i have the official statement of the dsa germany in german on this and can forward that to you if you are interested _____from mike kaplan mkaplantampabayrrcom to undisclosedrecipient

review antipsychotic drug policy for kids news front page by mc moewe january 31 2008 the florida agency for health care administration plans to create subcommittee to review its guidelines on payments for medications after questions were raised about antipsychotics being prescribed for children in the states insurance program for the poor medicaid will pay for drug only if it is medically necessary and prescribed for medically accepted indications according to the agencys current guidelines the daytona beach newsjournal reported earlier this month that the number of florida medicaid children prescribed antipsychotics had nearly doubled from 9364 seven years ago to 18137 in 2006 among those children the most common primary diagnosis was attention deficit hyperactivity disorder an ailment not approved for treatment with antipsychotics by the food and drug administration the science of pharmacology has seen significant advances and we are revisiting this rule to see if it needs to be updated said fernando senrapress secretary for the agency federal law provides each state with the authority to cover medications that doctors prescribe for offlabel purposes david stallard an assistant attorney general in utah said he believes the federal medicaid statute is clear that drug not used for medically accepted indications is excluded from coverage if states want matching federal funds he has broached the subject with the agency that runs utahs medicaid program but has met strong opposition i get the impression that they are under so much pressure from the doctors that they basically cave stallard said they say this is our most vulnerable population and we should protect access i turn that around and say this is our most vulnerable population and we should not experiment on them currently utah is suing eli lilly after preliminary results indicate about quarter of the states medicaid adults taking the antipsychotic zyprexa developed diabetes he said florida agency for health care secretary dr andrew agwunobi requested creating work group under the medical care advisory committee that will bring together experts in the field to determine whether changes to our current policies are appropriate senra said the groups findings will be presented to the pharmaceutical and therapeutic committee in march for review and recommendations the committee includes physicians medicaid recipients and government department heads senra said in 2005 the agency for health care paid 3 million for study on the use of antipsychotics among medicaid children the contract with dr robert constantine with the medicaid drug therapy management program for behavioral health at the university of south florida also called for panel of experts that developed guidelines for prescribing antipsychotics to children agency officials reviewed and accepted those prescribing guidelines which included the recommendation that antipsychotics should not be used primarily to target adhd constantine said nor should antipsychotics be given to children under age 6 except under the most extraordinary circumstances that the agency is now looking at updating the guidelines on paying for medications after accepting the new prescribing guidelines seemsappropriate constantine said for example they might consider under what circumstances should there be special prior authorization constantine said they would really be looking at how their internal policies deal with prescribers constantines organization also monitors florida medicaid doctors prescribing antipsychotics he said

is disturbing other states are already pushing hard for answers and florida should join in the drugs in question are known as atypical antipsychotics and include risperdal abilify geodon and seroquel originally intended to treat major mental illnesses like schizophrenia and bipolar mania they have become increasingly widely prescribed for children with autism and attentiondeficit disorder with tics yet the us food and drug administration has approved few of these drugs for use with children especially in conjunction with many of the conditions for which the powerful drugs are prescribed

these drugs but florida owes more important duty to the thousands of children across the state who are taking powerful medications immediately discontinuing medicaid reimbursement for the medications

be stopped as there should be parity of insurance coverage when there is parity of diagnoses the fact is unlike real medical conditions which can be verified by scientificmedical procedure there are blood tests brain scans chemical imbalance tests xrays etc that can prove any psychiatric disorder is disease or illness yet millions are needlessly drugged due to this junk science with commonly prescribed psychiatric drugs now acknowledged by international drug regulators as causing suicide mania homicidal ideation psychosis diabetes heart attack stroke and sudden death 20 warnings this year

1992 chadd received 50000 from pharmaceutical interests by 1994 this had reached 400000 and by 2001 700000 09 per chadds annual report for 20042005 total pharmaceutical donation support of chadd through unrestricted educational grants comprised 22 of the total revenuethis is 1019448 for that year alone 09 in 1995 the dea issued methylphenidate ritalin background paper stating the dea has concerns that the depth of the financial relationship with the manufacturer was not well known to the public including chadd members that have relied upon chadd for guidance as it pertains to the diagnosis and treatment of their children on september 26 2002 the ceo of chadd clarke ross testified before congress that the groups financial relationship to adhd drug manufacturers is on our website its in our irs returns this information is not obvious on the national resource website it is in chadds annual report unless someone knew where to look it would not be easily found 09 09 chadd claims that adhd is neurobiological disorder despite the fact that there is sciencebased evidence to support this chadds website fails to inform people of the considerable difference in medical opinion regarding the validity of adhd 09 pediatric neurologist fred baughman who has discovered real physical diseases says that by claiming adhd is disease or neurobiological it makes it so real and terrible that the parent who dares not to believe init or allow its treatment is likely to be deemed negligent and longer deserving of custody of their child he adds this is perversion of science and medicine and is lie chadd defers to the 1999 surgeon generals report on mental health when citing adhd as neurobiological disorder yet the surgeon generals report the dsmiv the national institutes of health and the american academy of pediatrics clinical practice guideline for adhd do not confirm or state that adhd is neurobiological disorder in fact the surgeon general provided conclusive evidence to support this theory97a fact chadd neglects to mention on its website20 09 when pressed recently by insight magazine on the scientific validity of adhd clarke ross finally responded it really is matter of belief 09 the dea warned that most of the material prepared for public consumption by groups like chadd does not address the potential or actual abuse or ritalin it is portrayed as benign mild substance thats not associated with abuse or any serious side effects in fact ritalin and several other adhd drugs are schedule ii drugs in the same category as cocaine and morphine 09 in token gesture to balanced coverage chadd devotes about four pages to negating alternative interventions while using 10 pages to espouse the virtues of psychotropic drugs the known and documented side effects of these drugs are downplayed as mild and typically shortterm contradicting medical and scientific reports showing serious side effects including death 09 under the frequently asked questions section of chadds website alternatives are referred to as controversial interventions it states that many people turn to treatments which claim to be useful but which have not been shown to be truly effective in accord with standards held by the scientific community here again chadd does what it accuses others of using tactic designed to startle and scare the american public and one motivated by pharmaceutical vested interests09 to counter its critics chadd forwards the views of at least one convicted felon with bent for kidnapping and who happens to also support psychotropic drug treatment of children his long history of criminality includes convictions for breaking and entering conspiracy theft the use of stolen credit cards and threatening to detonate bomb in jewelry shop unless 100000 in jewels was handed to him according to one psychiatric report this criminal does not seem to profit from his past experiences and85does not realize he has responsibility to society to control his behavior such is the caliber of opinion that chadd promotes on its government and pharmaceuticalfunded website in its efforts to silence alternative views about treatment and care of children said to have adhdfrom mike kaplan mkaplantampabayrrcom to undisclosedrecipient subject fw major cchr victory date fri 28 sep 2007 144638 0400 major cchr victory after months of work by cchr int and others

international office of the president cchr international 20 23 september 2007 20 thank you i am so proud of all of you for supporting cchr helping it and its allies achieve what the media are heralding as the 93most significant drug safety legislation in more than 40 years94 20 20 in july i said that your financial contributions towards marla vp cchr int going to dc were vital for the future of our kids well the reform of the fda legislation that congress passed thursday is your exchange for it is the biggest victory ever in the battle against the incestuous collusion between and corruption of the psychiatrypharmaceuticalfda cartel they are behind the drugs getting approved that have killed tens of thousands and driven just as many to suicide they hid the side effects they covered up the deaths and damage and they got away with it because they held themselves above the law well that will very shortly be over once the president signs the bill 20 overcoming unbelievable obstacles and working with many consumer and parents groups and whistleblowers in nutshell the following is some of what was achieved 20 a7 drug ads will now carry conspicuous notice 93you are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the fda visit wwwfdagovmedwatch or call 1800fda108894 until now over 90 of americans didn92t know that they could bypass their psych or md to report adverse drug reactions adrs to the fda because psychsdoctors only report 110 percent of drug side effects empower people with the ability to report side effects themselves and the adr reports could increase 100x and 225 million is to be allocated to ensure that the fda does oversee the adverse reactions and acts on them20 20 a7 drug companies must now publicly post all results97the good bad and the ugly97of their drug clinical trials on the internet they can longer selectively choose what they want you to know the posting will include glossary for the lay people explaining technical terms to ensure that such information is not misleading or misunderstood20 20 a7 if any drug maker submits false information on clinical trial the fda will post notice stating 93the entry for this clinical trial was found to be false or misleading and therefore not in compliance with the law9420 20 a7 the fda must now monitor drug advertisements and if they are false or misleading can fine drug makers up to to 10 million20 20 some of you may remember that in the late 80s cchr exposed how prozac caused violence and suicide in 1991 we obtained an fda hearing where the evidence irrefutably supported this but psychs negated it the backlash on us for exposing the dangers of antidepressants was telling behind the scenes was the chief of the fdas psychiatric drug division dismissing the evidence and as pharma executive later admitted 93the simplest thing for the fda to do would have been to pull prozac off the market 97and they didnt this same executive commenting on cchr92s relentless exposure of the drug92s lethal effects said that it was 93demoralizing94 to be 93shouted down in 20second sound bites by scientologists94 well 93battered to pieces94 would better describe what happens when marla launches her assault on this suppressive alliance that has denied people the right to be fully informed and protect themselves against harmful drugs 20 20 the most effective thing you did97and should continue to do especially as the bill right now has to be signed into law97is support her and her 93militia94 of parents and whistleblowers returning to dc this isn92t the time to rest on our laurels there are two other federal bills that must get passed or eliminated one vital bill that flanks the fda bill is something that i can92t brief you on now the mothers act however is one that has togoit is the psychs92 attempt to recoup losing markets they want to be given legislative power to screen motherstobe and new moms for 93mental illness94 and ultimately drug them and their fetuses or newborns97get the future generation hooked on drugs before they even get started in life 20 this is the campaign that i am commending anyone who contributes to you can see your donations are getting dynamic results please work with on this we must strengthen the actions that caused this latest victory but there are more to be gotten with which you can

unscientific teenscreen program whose advisory board has major pharmaceutical ties google teenscreen folks teenscreen admits percentage of kids screened will wind up on psychiatric drugs that can increase suicide risk the tax records of the backers of another suicide prevention program called signs of suicide reveal millions in pharmaceutical funding the national alliance for mental illness
