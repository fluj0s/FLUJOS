resources science and industry division november 25 2008 abstract in 2001 epa issued new arsenic rule that set the legal limit for arsenic in tap water at 10 parts per billion ppb replacing 50 ppb standard set in 1975 before arsenic was classiﬁed as carcinogen the arsenic rule was to enter into eﬀect on march 23 2001 and water systems were given until january 2006 to comply epa concluded that the rule would provide health beneﬁts but projected that compliance would be costly for some small systems many water utilities and communities expressed concern that epa had underestimated the rules costs signiﬁcantly consequently epa postponed the rules eﬀective date to february 22 2002 to review the science and cost and beneﬁt analyses supporting the rule after completing the review in october 2001 epa aﬃrmed the 10 ppb standard the new standard became enforceable for water systems in january 2006 since the rule was completed congress and epa have focused on how to help communities comply with the new standard in the past several congresses numerous bills have been oﬀered to provide more ﬁnancial and technical assistance andor compliance ﬂexibility to small systems however none of the bills has been enactedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20672 order code rs20672 updated november 25 2008 arsenic in drinking water regulatory developments and issues mary tiemann specialist in environmental policy resources science and industry division summary the safe drinking water act amendmen ts of 1996 directed the environmental protection agency epa to update the standa rd for arsenic in drinking water in 2001 epa issued new arsenic rule that set the legal limit for arsenic in tap water at 10 parts per billion ppb replacing 50 ppb standard set in 1975 before arsenic was classified as carcinogen the arsenic rule was to enter into effect on march 23 2001 and water systems were given until january 2006 to comp ly epa concluded that the rule would provide health benefits but projected that compliance would be costly for some small systems many water utilities and communities expressed concern that epa had underestimated the rules costs significantly consequently epa postponed the rules effective date to february 22 2002 to review the science and cost and benefit analyses supporting the rule after completing the re view in october 2001 epa affirmed the 10 ppb standard the new standard became enfo rceable for water systems in january 2006 since the rule was completed congress and epa have focused on how to help communities comply with the new standard in the past several congresses numerous bills have been offered to provide more financial and technical assistance andor compliance flexibility to small systems how ever none of the bills has been enacted background sources of arsenic in water include natura l sources particularly rocks and soils and also releases from its use as wood preservative in semi conductors and paints and from mining and agricultural operations elevated levels of arsenic ar found more frequently in ground water than in surface water becau small communities ty pically rely on wells for drinking water while larger cities often use surf acewater sources arsenic tends to occur in higher concentrations more frequently in water used by small communities in the united states the average arsenic level measured in groundwater samples is less than or equal to 1 part per billion ppb or micrograms per liter µgl however higher levels are not uncommon compared w ith the rest of the united states western states have more water system s with levels exceeding 10 ppb levels in some locations inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20672crs2 1 food is significant source of arsenic the national research council estimates that in the united states arsenic intake from food is comparab to drinking water containing 5 ppb arsenicthe west exceed 50 ppb parts of the midwes t and new england also have some water systems with arsenic levels exceeding 10 ppb but most systems meet the new standard when issuing the rule epa estimated that roughly 4000 55 of regulated water systems serving total of 13 million people were likely to exceed the 10 ppb standard the previous drinking water standard for arsenic 50 ppb was set by the us public health service in 1942 epa adopted that vel and issued an in terim drinking water regulation for arsenic in 1975 this standard was based on estimated total dietary intake1 and noncancer health effects in 1986 cong ress amended the safe drinking water act sdwa converted all inte rim standards to national primary drinking water regulations and included arsenic on list of 83 contaminants for which epa was required to issue new standards by 1989 ep as extensive review of arsenic risk assessment issues caused the agency to miss the 1989 deadline as result of citizen suit epa entered into consent decree with new deadline for the rule of november 1995 epa tinued work on risk assessment water treatment analytical methods implementation and occurrence issues but in 1995 decided to delay the rule in order to better characterize health eff ects and assess costeffective re moval technologies for small utilities arsenic and the 1996 sdwa amendments in the 1996 sdwa amendments pl 104 182 congress directed epa to propose new drinking water standard for arsenic by january 1 2000 and to promulgate final standard by january 1 2001 congress also dir ected epa to develop research plan for arsenic to support the rulemaking effort and to reduce the uncertainty in assessing health risks associated with lowlevel exposures to arsenic epa was required to conduct the study in consultation with the national cademy of sciences in 1996 epa requested the national research council n rc to review the available arsenic toxicity data base and to evaluate the scientific validity of epas risk assessments for arsenic the nrc issued its report in 1999 and reco mmended that the standard be reduced but it did not recommend particular level the nrc affirmed that the available data provided ample evidence for epas classification of inorganic arsenic as human carcinogen but that epas doseresponse assessment which wa s based on taiwan study deserved greater scrutiny the nrc explained that the data in the study lacked the level of detail needed for use in doserespons assessment the council also reported that research suggested that arsenic intake in f ood is higher in taiwan than in the united states further complicating efforts to use the data for arsenic risk assessment based on findings from three countries wh ere individuals were exposed to very high levels of arsenic several hundreds of parts per billion or more the nrc c oncluded that the data were sufficient to add lung and bladder cancer s to the types of cancers caused by ingestion of inorganic arsenic however the nrc noted th at few data addressed the risk of ingested arsenic at lower concentrations which woul d be more representa tive of levels found inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20672crs3 2 national research council arsenic in drinking water national academy of sciences national academy press washington dc 1999 pp 7 22 3 see epas technical fact sheet final rule for arsenic in drinking water available online at httpwwwepagovsafewaterarsenicregulationshtml 4 for more detailed discussion of these nd other sdwa provisi ons see crs report rl31243 safe drinking water act summary of the act and its major requirements by mary tiemann 5 sdwa does not discuss how epa should consider cost in determining feasibility thus epa has relied on legislative history for guidance the senate report for the 1996 amendments states that feasible means the level that can be r eached by large regional drinking water systems applying best available treatment technology this approach to standard setting is used because 80 of the population receives its drinking water from large systems and safe water can be provided to this portion of the population at very affordable costs us senate safe drinking water amendments act of 1995 srept 104169 november 7 1995 p 14 systems serving 10000 or more people serve about 80 of the popul ation served by community water systemsthe united states the nrc concluded that key studies for improving the scientific validity of risk assessment were neede d and recommended specific studies to epa2 epas final arsenic rule in june 2000 epa published its proposal to revise the arsenic standard from 50 ppb to 5 ppb and requested comment on options of 3 ppb 10 ppb and 20 ppb epa stated that the proposal relied primarily on the nrc anal ysis and some recently published research and that it would further assess arsenics cancer risks before issuing the final rule as proposed the standard would have applied only to comm unity water systems non transient noncommunity water systems eg schools with their own wells would have been required only to monitor and then report if arsenic levels exceeded the standard in the final rule publishe d on january 22 2001 66 fr 6976 epa set the standard at 10 ppb and applied it to nontransient noncommun ity water systems as well as community water systems the agency gave the water utilities five years to comply the maximum amount of time allowed unde r sdwa epa estimated that 3000 55 of the 54000 community water systems and 1100 55 of the 20000 nontransient noncommunity water systems would need to take measures to meet the standard3 standardsetting process in developing standards under the safe drinking water act epa is required to set maximum contaminant level goal mclg at level at which known or anticipated adverse health effects occur and that allows an adequate margin of safety epa sets the mclg at zero for carcinogens as it did for arsenic unless level exists below which adverse health effects occur epa must then set an enforceable standard the mcl as close to the mclg as is feasible using the best technology treatment or other means ava ilable taking costs into consideration4 epas determination of whether sta ndard is feasible typically s been based on costs to large water systems serving more than 50000 pe ople less than 2 of community water systems roughly 750 of 54000 systems are this large but they serve roughly 56 of all people served by community systems5 variances and exemptions congress has long recognized that the technical and cost considerations associ ated with technologies selected for large cities often are not applicable to small systems in th 1996 amendments congress expanded sdwa variance and exemption provisions to addr ess small system compliance concernshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20672crs4 the small system variance provisions require that for each rule establishing an mcl epa must list technologies that comply with the mcl and are affordable for three size categories of small systems if epa does not list affordable compliance technologies for small systems then it must list variance t echnologies variance technology need not meet the mcl but must be protective of public health if epa lists variance technology state then may grant variance to small system allowing the system to use variance technology to comply with regulation epa has not identified variance technologies for arsenic or any other standa rds because based on its current affordability criteria epa has determined that affordable compliance technologies are available for all standards thus small system variances are not available congress took issue with epas assessment that small system variance technologies were not merited for the arseni c standard and in 2002 directed epa to review the criteria it uses to determine whether compliance tr eatment technology is affordable for small systems in march 2006 epa proposed three op tions for revising its affordability criteria 71 fr 10671 under the current affordability criteria epa considers treatment technology affordable unless the average compliance cost exceeds 25 of the areas median household income based on this m easure epa determined that affordable technologies are available for all sdwa standards the proposed options under consideration are well below the current level 025 050 and 075 of an areas median household income epa also stated that it expects to address in the revised criteria the issue of how to ensure that variance technology would be protective of public health according to epa the final criteria would apply only to the new stage 2 disinfectantsdisinfection byproduc ts rule and future rules and not to the arsenic rule exemptions potentially offer source of compliance flexibility for small systems states may grant temporary exemptions from standard if for certain reasons including cost system cannot comply on time the arsenic rule gives systems five years to comply with the new standard an exemption allows another three years for qualified systems systems serving 3300 or fewer pe rsons may receive up to three additional twoyear extensions for total exemption dur ation of nine years total of 14 years to achieve compliance in the final rule epa noted that exemptions will be an important tool to help states address the number of systems needing financial assistance to comply with this rule and other sdwa rules 66 fr 6988 however to grant an exemption the law requires state to hold public hearing and make finding that the extension will not result in an unreasonable risk to health because the exemption process is complex states have seldom granted them state offi cials have noted that unreasonable risk to health has never been defined and that states must make separate finding for each system many states have granted few or exemptions for the arsenic rule balancing costs and benefits when proposing rule under sdwa epa must publish determination as to whether or not the benefits of the standard justify the costs if epa determines that costs are not justified then it may set the standard at the level that maximizes health risk reduction benefits at cost that is justified by the benefits epa determined that the feasibl arsenic level for large systems was 3 ppb but that the benefits of that level did not justify the costs thus epa proposed standard of 5 ppb also epa proposed to require non transient noncommunity water systems eg schools only to monitor and report as opposed to treatin g largely because of cost benefit considerations in setting the standard at 10 ppb epa cited sdwa stating that this level maximizes health risk reduction benefits at cost that is justified by the benefits the final rule applies to schools and similar noncommunity water systemshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20672crs5 6 science advisory board arsenic proposed drinking water regulation science advisory board review of certain elements of the proposal epasabdwc01001 december 2000 p 4 7 awwa january 17 2001 see httpwwwawwaorg 8 national research council arsenic in drinking water 2001 update nas p 14anticipated bene fits and costs in the final rule epa estimated that reducing the standard to 10 ppb could prevent roughl 19 to 31 bladder cancer cases and 5 to 8 bladder cancer deaths each ear the agency further timated that the new standard could prevent 19 to 25 lung cancer cases and 16 to 22 lung cancer deaths each year and provide other cancer and noncancer health benefits that were not quantifiable regarding the cost of meeting the 10 ppb standard epa estimated that for systems that serve fewer than 10000 people the aver age cost per household could range from 38 to 327 per year roughly 97 of the systems that were expected to exceed the standard are in this category and most of these sy stems serve fewer than 500 people for larger systems projected water cost increas range from 086 to 32 per household the estimated national annualized cost of the rule is approximately 181 million epas science advisory board sab had ra ised concerns about the rules economic and engineering assessment nd concluded that several cost assumptions were likely to be unrealistic and other costs seemed to be excluded the sab also suggested that epa give further thought to the concept of ffordability as applied to this standard6 many municipalities and water system representatives also disagreed with the agencys cost estimates the american water works asso ciation awwa while supporting stricter standard estimated that the new rule w ould cost 600 million annually and require 5 billion in capital outlays the awwa attributed differences in cost estimates partly to the costs of handling arseniccontaminated treatment residuals and the estimated number of wells affected the awwa projected th at the rule could cost individual households in the southwest midwest and ne w england as much as 2000 per year7 arsenic rule review epa issued the final rule on january 22 2001 in march 2001 the admin istrator delayed the rule for 60 days citing concerns about the science supporting the rule and its estimated cost to communities on may 22 2001 epa delayed the rules effectiv date until february 22 2002 but did not change the 2006 compliance date for water systems 66 fr 28342 at epas request the nrc undertook an expedited review of epas arsenic risk anal ysis and subsequent health effects research the national drinking water advisory counc il ndwac reassessed the rules cost and the sab reviewed its benefits epa also requested public comment on whether the data and analyses for the rule support settin g the standard at 3 5 10 or 20 ppb 66 fr 37617 the nrc determined that recent studies and analyses enhance the confidence in risk estimates that suggest chronic arsenic exposure is associated with an increased incidence of bladder and lung cancer at arsenic levels in drinking water below the current mcl of 50 µgl8 the ndwac concluded that epa had produced credible cost estimate given constraints and uncertainties and suggested ways to improve estimates the sab offered ways to improve the benefits anal ysis in october 2001 epa affirmed that 10 ppb was the appropriate standa rd and announced plans to provide 20 million for research on affordable arsenic removal technolog ies to help small systems complyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20672crs6 legislative action since the arsenic standard was revised c ongress repeatedly has expressed concern over the cost of this regulation especia lly to small rural communities the 107th congress directed epa to review its affordability criteria and how the small system variance and exemption programs should be implemented for arsenic pl 10773 hrept 107272 p 175 the conferees directed the agency to report on its affordability criteria administrative actions funding mech anisms for small system compliance and possible legislative actions in 2002 epa submitted its report to congress small systems arsenic implementation issues on actions epa was taking to address these directives major activities included developing and implementing small community assistance plan to improve access to financial and technical assistance improve compliance capacity and simplify the use of exemptions epa also has sponsored research on lowcost arsenic treatment technologies and s issued guidance to help states grant exemptions the 108th congress again expressed concern over the economic impact that the revised standard coul d have in many communities in the conference report for the omnibus appropriations act for fy2005 pl 108447 congress provided 82 million for arsenic removal research the conferees expressed concern that the new requirements could pose huge financial hardship for many rural communities congress directed epa to report on the extent to which communities were being affected by the rule and to propose compliance alternativ and make recommendations to minimize costs this report is pending in the 110th congress as in the 109th congress legislative efforts focused on helping economically struggling communities comply with the arsenic rule and other drinking water standards various bills were offered to promote small system compliance by providing technical assistance financial assistance andor compliance flexibility the senate environment and public works committee reported several bills that would have authorized new funding for drinking wate r infrastructure the water infrastructure financing act s 3617 sre pt 110509 which parallele d the committee bill from the 109th congress proposed to increase funding au thority for the drinking water and clean water state revolving fund dwsrf program and to create grant program at epa for small or economically disadvantaged communities for critical drinking water and water quality projects s 1933 srept 110475 w ould have authorized new grant program for small water systems and s 1429 s rept 110242 and hr 6313 would have reauthorized funding authority for small sy stem technical assist ance under sdwa other bills included s 2509 which proposed to requi re epa to promote the use of affordable technologies eg pointofuse technologies and bottled wate r revise its affordability criteria and provide more co mpliance assistance for highpriority rules including the arsenic rule s 2509 also woul d have required epa or stat to ensure that funds have been made available to small systems be fore taking enforcement actions hr 2141 would have required states to grant exemptions to eligible small systems for rules covering naturally occurring contaminants s uch as arsenic and radium none of these bills was enacted sdwa compliance and more broadly drinking water infrastructure issues are likely to remain on the congressional agenda however severe competition for federal resources and uncertainty in the policy agenda make the prospects for new funding legislation unclear for more information on this and other issues see crs report rl34201 safe drinking water act
