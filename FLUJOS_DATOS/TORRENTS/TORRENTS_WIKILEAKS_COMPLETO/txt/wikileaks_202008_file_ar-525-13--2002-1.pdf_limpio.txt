protection conditions and threat levels b1 the force protection conditions system the force protection conditions fpcon system discussed here is mandated in dod directive 200012 and dod instruction 200016 they describe progressive levels of security measures for implementation in response to threats to us army personnel information and critical resources the fpcon system is the foundation of all at plans and orders at plans and orders must be constructed to address the threat assessment and implement the measures described in this appendix the measures listed below are based on the dod measures located in dod 0200012h with additional armycommon implementing guidance when producing plans local commanders must further refine this guidance into more specific instructions in order to meet the unique requirements of the specific location there are five fpcons 1 fpcon normal applies when there is discernible terrorist activity under these conditions only routine security posture designed to defeat the routine criminal threat is warranted the minimum fpcon for us army commands is normal 2 fpcon alpha applies when there is general threat of possible threat activity against personnel andor installations the nature and extent of which is unpredictable and circumstances do not justify full implementation of fpcon bravo measures commands must be capable of maintaining fpcon alpha measures for extended periods with only limited impact on normal operations 3 fpcon bravo applies when an increased or more predictable threat exists commanders must be capable of maintaining the measures of this fpcon for several weeks without causing undue hardship to personnel substantially affecting operational capabilities or aggravating relations with local authorities and members of the local civilian or host nation community 4 fpcon charlie applies when an incident occurs or intelligence is received indicating imminent terrorist action implementation of fpcon charlie measures for more than short period probably will create hardships for personnel and affect the peacetime activities of units and personnel 5 fpcon delta applies when terrorist attack has occurred or intelligence indicates likely terrorist action against specific location normally declared as localized warning and requires implementation of mandatory security measures commanders are authorized and encouraged to supplement these measures implementation of fpcon delta cannot be sustained by commands for extended periods without causing significant hardships for personnel and affect the peacetime activities of units and personnel b it may be necessary to implement certain measures from higher fpcons levels resulting from intelligence received or as deterrent at fpcon alpha through charlie commanders will implement selected measures from higher fpcons as part of ramp at any fpcon commanders may implement any measures they deem appropriate from any higher fpcon c an at plan with complete listing of site specific at security measures linked to fpcon will be classified at minimum as confidential when separated from the at plan sitespecific at security measures and fpcons should be handled as for official use only fouo b2 fpcon normal credible threat of terrorist activity routine security measures are implemented with an installation physical security plan and in accordance with

in the vicinity of military installations facilities and activities that might facilitate execution of terrorist attack k measure 51 spare for macom or installation use b7 threat levels the decision to implement particular fpcon is command decision which should be based on an assessment of the threat vulnerability of personnel or facilities criticality of personnel or facilities availability of security resources impact on operations and morale damage control considerations international relations and the potential for us government actions to trigger threat response frequently information concerning threat groups is limited to general descriptions of their capabilities and intentions often specific tactics and targets are not identified until it is too late to implement deterrent measures or until after an attack has taken place for this reason the absence of specific information concerning the immediate threat should not preclude implementing higher fpcon andor additional security measures when general information indicates an increased vulnerability or heightened risk to personnel andor facilities b threat levels are developed by intelligence staff officers and should be used as one source of information in determining the appropriate fpcon for command installation facility area or unit such assessments will be based on the standardized jointservice criteria promulgated by dod and jcs 1 threat levels are determined by assessing the situation using the following four threat factors operational capability the acquired assessed or demonstrated level of capability of terrorist group to conduct terrorist attacks b intentions the stated desire or history of terrorist attacks against us interests by terrorist group c activity the actions terrorist group is conducting and whether that activity is focused on serious preparations for an attack d operating environment the overall environment and how it influences the ability opportunity and motivation of terrorist group to attack dod interests in given location 2 the following terminology shall be used to describe the various threat levels to ensure uniformity throughout dod high antius terrorists are operationally active and use large casualty producing attacks as their preferred method of operation the operating environment favors the terrorist b significant antius terrorists are present and attack personnel as their preferred method of operation or group uses large casualty producing attacks as their preferred method but has limited operational activity the operating environment is neutral c moderate terrorists are present but there are indications of antius activity the operating environment favors the host nationus d low group is detected or the group activity is nonthreatening 3 there is automatic link between threat level and fpcon although implementation of fpcon delta suggests receipt of targeting information intelligence that terrorist action against specific location is likely however commanders should consider the threat level as key element in determining the appropriate fpcon for their organizations 4 dod analytic agencies often differ in assigning threat levels to the same countries or areas this occurs because analysts occasionally disagree concerning conclusions that could be drawn from available intelligence different threat levels may also be possible due to differing perspectives among organizations for example the navy is concerned about ships port areas and areas frequented by their personnel these areas may be quite different from areas of concern to army commanders even in the same country c explanation of differences between dod and dos threat level classification systems 24 ar 52513 4 january 20021 the dod and dos threat systems are two entirely different systems they differ in purpose and use different methodologies to determine threat levels the dod analysis focuses strictly on the terrorism threat level whereas the dos covers larger array of four broad threat categories only one of which political violence deals with the terrorism threat 2 the dod terrorism threat level assessment considers only those indicators and warnings pertaining to terrorism threats the dod terrorism threat level assessment is intended to declare terrorism threat level for particular country or area dod terrorism threat level assessments are event driven and include information regarding the terrorist threat to dod personnel facilities and materiel the dod terrorism threat level assessment is used to inform dod personnel and dependents under the at program of combatant commander through the combatant commander s information channels the dod terrorism threat level assessment methodology uses all source analysis the system is flexible and threat levels are revised as terrorism indicators warnings and activities occur or change b dod uses four factors in analyzing the terrorist threat level operational capability intentions activity and operational environment c dod uses 4step scale to describe the severity of the terrorist threat the four steps from lowest to highest are low moderate significant and high d dod through the defense intelligence agency dia and the combatant commanders can issue terrorism threat level assessments the dod terrorism threat level assessment is not used to indicate the potential of specific terrorist attack formal specific terrorism warnings are issued separately by dia the services or the combatant commanders 3 the dos threat assessment process evaluates all source information relative to four broad threat categories and then develops the composite threat list ctl for all active foreign service posts staffed by direct hire us personnel and dod elements either permanent or tdy personnel to include accompanying dependents and facilities which operate under the authority of chief of mission com one of the primary purposes of the ctl is to aid in prioritizing posts for receipt of security resources that is equipment tdy personnel funding etc the higher the threat level the higher the priority for the implementation of standard set of security enhancements higher threat level immediately justifies the use of additional resources to attain the assigned standards for protection at that particular level of threat the four ctl threat categories are political violence includes terrorist threatsincidents war coups civil disorders insurgencies and narcoterrorism ci the threat posed to us intelligence by foreign intelligence service fis technical the threat posed by antius technical intelligence and crime the residential crime environment affecting the official us community b each of the four categories is assigned threat level for specific post but the only one dealing with terrorism is the first category political violence ctl threat levels from lowest to highest are data low medium high and critical c dos disseminates its post specific threat categories and threat levels in the ctl which is published semiannual ly the ctl is designed to aid dosdiplomatic security in prioritizing overseas security programs and ensuring that limited resources are effectively used and applied to overseas security policy board coordinated interagency standards d the ctl reflects an evaluation of threat levels for particular period of time and these levels may be raised or lowered during scheduled reviews april and october as situations change the list does not attempt to reflect the day today security environment of given locality but rather is intended to provide longerterm picture for planning and resource allocation purposes dos has the capability to immediately warn personnel under com authority to specific terrorist threats in those instances when threat information is considered sufficiently credible by dosdiplomatic security to warrant an immediate response security resources will be committed as necessary to deal with the particular situation regardless of the assigned ctl threat levels f dos threat levels are the result of post inputs and coordination within diplomatic security dos and other us government agencies at the national level exactly which agencies are consulted varies according to the threat category however as the ctl is intended to assist dosdiplomatic security for planning and operational purposes the final arbiter for disputed threat levels is the director of diplomatic security 4 all commanders shall ensure the dod assessment is addressed as dod terrorism threat assessment refer to the dos assessment as dos composite threat list 5 per dod policy when the combatant commander declares or changes terrorism threat level assessment for particular country the combatant commander will ensure that all dod personnel and their dependents in the country for whom he has at responsibility are informed of this assessment this includes informing the us defense representative usdr in locations where combatant commander forces are present in significant numbers and there is difference between the dod terrorism threat level assessment and the dos ctl threat level for the political violence category dod has directed that the following procedure be used to provide clarification dod through dia will publish message in coordination with dos diplomatic security noting the difference and providing an explanation for the 25 ar 52513 4 january 2002difference the message will be disseminated to the services combatant commanders and to the appropriate usdr the combatant commander through the usdr will have the responsibility to inform all dod personnel under com authority of the information contained in the message higher dod threat assessment will not require action by dos to increase at measures but is intended only to inform dod personnel under com authority of dod s assessment of the threat b there is also possibility of differences in terrorism threat level assessments between dod dia and the combatant commanders for particular country dia as the dod lead agent is responsible to clarify or resolve the differences if there is valid reason for the difference dia will inform dos 26 ar 52513 4 january 2002appendix c management control evaluation checklist c1 function the function covered by this checklist is the management of unit
