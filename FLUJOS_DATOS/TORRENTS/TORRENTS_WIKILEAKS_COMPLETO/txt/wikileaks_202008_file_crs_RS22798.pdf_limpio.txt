that the tuareg rebellion in mali and niger could merge with the ongoing conflict in chad th car and sudan to create much wider regional war18 under president déby chad has made limited progress toward democracy human rights cond itions remain notably poor in part due to the actions of state security forces freedom of expression is ofte n curtailed and many critics and observers see the

zones some suggest that prospective increases in state oil revenues and multifaceted international assistance to bolster political and economic reform could engender more participatory governance and economic growth in chad but international donor frustration as evidenced by the world banks withdrawal from the pipeline project ma affect future assistance and investment if the déby government does not embr ace political and economic reforms popular resentment against those in power may perpetuate the current instability
