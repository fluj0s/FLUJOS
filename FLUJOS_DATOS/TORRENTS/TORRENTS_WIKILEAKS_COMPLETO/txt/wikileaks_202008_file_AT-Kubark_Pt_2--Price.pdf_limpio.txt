anthropology today vol 23 5 october 2007 17back in 1994 my curiosity concerning interactions between anthropologists and the human ecology fund hef was raised when i found published announcements of anthropologists receiving hef funds in old newsletters of the american anthropological association aaa1 one article listed nine hef grant recipients preston s abbott william k carr janet hartle alan howard barnaby c keeney raymond prince robert scott leon stover and robert c suggs fn 19662 i tried to contact each scholar and howard scott and stover replied to my initial inquiries about their hefsponsored research2 in late 1994 i wrote to alan howard and robert scott asking what they remembered about the fund their research and if they knew of the funds connection to the cia when i emailed howard at the university of hawaii asking him what he knew about the cias covert funding of their research howard expressed anguished surprise replying agh i had idea ah to dhp 11294 howard had remained in contact with robert scott to whom he had forwarded my correspondence scott later wrote letter detailing how he came to receive the funds i had absolutely idea that the human ecology fund was front for anything least of all the cia as far as i knew it was small fund that was controlled by harold wolff and used to support projects of various types concerning the study of stress and illness in humans its connection with the cia only came to my attention some years later when jay schulman wrote an article exposing the connection3 obviously if i had known of such connection at the time i would never have accepted money from them i should also explain that the money we got from them was used to support library research i was doing at the cornell medical school on studies of stress and that the final product was theoretical model for the study of stress in humans i will explain how i came to know about the fund in the first place the period of time would have been roughly from 1961 1963 i finished my doctorate in sociology at stanford university in 1960 and then received twoyear postdoctoral fellowship in medical sociology from the russell sage foundation i spent the first year at stanford medical school and then moved on to the cornell medical school for second year of work i was interested in studying stress and illness and the work of harold wolff his colleague larry hinkle and others was far closer to the mark i therefore arranged to transfer my postdoc to unit headed by hinkle and with which harold wolff had an affili ation the name of that unit was the human ecology studies program at the time i was there larry hinkle was completing study of stress among telephone operators working for new jersey or was it new york bell telephone company and he was also beginning study of stress and heart disease among group of executives for the new jersey bell company he invited to participate in the analysis for the first study and to advise him about the design of several of the instruments used in connection with that project at the same time i was also working with alan howard on an article about stress and it was in connection with this work that i received sup port from the fund or at least i think that is the reason why i acknowledged the fund in our paper i do remember that either hinkle or wolff or both suggested that i write letter to the fund requesting modest level of support for our work i cant remember the amount but i am reasonably certain it came to more than few thousand dollars it will be obvious to you from reading this that i knew harold wolff for brief period of time during this period as i recall wolff died either in 1962 or 1963 from the manner in which the matter was handled i gained the impression that he had available to him small fund of money that could be used to support research and writing of the sort i was doing and he gave some for my work at that time there were lots of small pots of money sitting around medical school and there was reason to be suspicious about this one moreover wolff was figure of great distinction in neurology and was well known outside of his field as well for all of these reasons i simply assumed that everything was completely legitimate and was astounded when the connection between the fund and the cia was disclosed i should also mention that during the course of our col laboration alan howard and i coauthored second paper on cultural variations in conceptions of death and dying which was also published and in which there is an acknowledgment to the fund4 my association with the human ecology studies program came to an end early in 1964 in september of 1963 i left the program to become research associate on the staff of russell sage foundation in order to conduct study they had just funded as i recall for short while during the fall of 1963 i spent small amount of time at the human ecology study program advising project members about various issues involving their research on heart disease but this eventually fell by the way side as i became more deeply drawn into the new project ras to dhp 11294 at the time both howard and scott were unaware that the research funds they received came from the cia their accounts of their interactions with hef make sense given this paper benefited from comments by alexander cockburn alan howard robert lawless steve niva eric ross robert scott jeffrey st clair and three anonymous at reviewers 1 one fellow newsletter article announced that william carr had joined the staff of the human ecology fund in march and that the fund contributed to the financing of raymond prince and francis speeds film were he is madman which documented the treatment of yoruba mental disorders fn 19645 6 the may 1962

in response to anthropologists concerns around this issue editor mkultra headed by dr sidney gottlieb the cia s mkultra project was set up in the early 1950s largely in response to alleged soviet chinese and north korean use of mind control techniques on us prisoners of war in korea the project involved covert research at an estimated 30 universities and institutions in an extensive programme of experimentation that included chemical biological and radiological tests often on unwitting citizens it was not until the 1970s that this programme was exposed but by that time many scholars from wide range of disciplines had been implicated18 anthropology today vol 23 5 october 2007how wolff and hinkle shielded participants from any knowl edge of cia involvement or of the mkultra project in 1998 i published an article briefly describing mk ultras use of the hef to channel cia funds to anthro pologists and other social scientists but as the kubark counterintelligence interrogation manual had not yet been declassified i did not mention or connect scott and howards research with mkultras objective of researching effective models of interrogation price 1998 for more on mkultra see part 1 of this article it was not until i read alfred mccoys book question of tor ture 2006 that i noticed the relevance of their research on stress for kubark until then i had assumed that their work was funded to reinforce an air of false legitimacy for the hef much as i interpreted the funding of anthropolo gist janet hartels study of the smithsonians mongolian skull collection however mccoy clarifies that research on stress was vital to mkultra eg mccoy 2006 and hefsponsored research projects selectively harvested research that went into design of effective coercive inter rogation techniques5 the cia distilled its findings in its seminal kubark counterinsurgency interrogation handbook for the next forty years the kubark manual would define the agencys interroga tion methods and training program throughout the third world synthesizing the behavioral research done by contract aca demics the manual spelled out revolutionary twophase form of torture that relied on sensory deprivation and selfinflicted pain for an effect that for the first time in the two millennia of their cruel science was more psychological than physical mccoy 2006 50 wolff hinkle hef mkultra and kubark the us senates 1977 hearings investigating mkultras cooptation of academic research did not identify the indi vidual academics who coordinated hefs research for the cia senator edward kennedy interrupted cia psycholo gist john gittingers testimony as he was about to identify hef staff cognizant of cia secret sponsorship of academic research kennedy told gittinger that the committee was not interested in names or institutions so we prefer that you do not that has to be worked out in arrangements between director of central intelligence admiral turner and the individuals and the institutions us senate 1977 596 john marks first documented how cardiologist lawrence hinkle jr and neurologist harold g wolff became the heart and mind of human ecologys cia enquiries hinkle and wolff were both professors at cornell universitys medical school and after cia director allen dulles asked wolff to review what was known of brainwashing tech niques partnership developed in which hinkle handled the administrative part of the study and shared in the sub stance of research marks 1979 135 respected neurologist who specialized in migraines and other forms of headache pain blau 2004 wolff had experimentally induced and measured headaches in research subjects at cornell since as far back as 1935 sn 1935 hinkle conducted research at cornell from the 1950s until his retirement amws 2005 vol 3 his early career focused on environmental impacts on cardio vascular health together hinkle and wolff studied the mechanisms by which the individual man adapts to his particular environment and the effect of these adaptations upon his disease hinkle 1965 wolff died in 1962 year before the cia produced its kubark manual hinkle remained at cornell for decades later retiring to the com forts of suburban connecticut hinkle and wolff pioneered studies of workplace stress effects of stress on cardiovascular health and migraines that brought legitimacy and helped make hef grant recip ients keen to collaborate hinkle and wolff 1957 by the mid1950s hinkle and wolff also studied the role of trolled stress in breaking and brainwashing prisoners of war and communist enemies of state they became experts on coercive interrogation and published their study on communist interrogation and indoctrination of enemies of the state in communist countries 1956 but they also produced classified secret version of this paper for cia dci allen dulles r√©v 2002 whilst passing secret reports along to the cia wolff produced heffunded public research publications studying interrogation such as his 1960 publication every man has his breaking point the conduct of prisoners of war see also hef 1963 mkultra funds encouraged scholars to contribute to their study of brainwashing and coercive interrogation supposedly benefiting military and intelligence branches by helping them to train spies and troops to better resist interrogation techniques later this research was secretly used in the production of the kubark manual which became less guide to resisting interrogation than an interroga tion manual to be used against enemies with some forms of coercion that violated the geneva convention7 such dual purpose became recurrent practice in the work of scholars operating within mkultras shrouded network while studies by wolff and hinkle and other hef funded scholars had medical implications their work also had practical relevance for cia interrogation techniques wolff and hinkle established research of interest to kubark by establishing research milieu at hef whilst keeping their connections to the mkultra programme well hidden in the early 1960s independent scholars undertook their own work and shared ideas with others working in similar areas resulting in crosspollination of ideas though it remains unclear exactly how independent academic models of stress were worked into mkultras objectives continuities are evident between howard and scotts 1965 stress article and kubark s guiding digms8 john marks claims that the hef put money into projects whose covert application was so unlikely that only an expert could see the possibilities marks 1979 170 my italics9 mccoy argues that the cia funded hef projects to gather information encouraged by wolff or by cia officers involved in the kubark manual declassified 1963 internal cia memo stated that substantial portion of the mkultra record appears to rest in the memories of the principal officers cia 1963a 23 so it seems hef findings were mostly incorporated informally because the cia destroyed most of its mkultra records in 1972 marks 1979 we do not know who drafted for the fund but after i sent him further documentation on the cias role in funding his research he did not respond ls to dp 112894 3 sociologist jay schulman was part of human ecologys programme studying hungarian refugees greenfield 1977 stephenson 1978 us senate 1977 4 another hefsponsored research project undertaken by howard funded the organization of data collected while conducting fieldwork on rotuman sexuality howard howard 1964 howard later coauthored paper with connection to hef examining symbolic and functional features of torture traditionally practised by the huron on prisonersof war and other cultural groups bilmes howard 1980 5 mccoy speculates that stanley milgrams research was covertly cia funded under such programmes but milgrams biographer disputes even the possibility that milgram was unwittingly funded cf mccoy 2006 blass 2006 6 dci stansfield turner mistakenly testified that the privacy act prevented the identification of scholars working on mkultra projects at human ecology us senate 1977 harold wolff was dead and thus had rights under the privacy act 7 history repeats itself as us interrogators recently drew on their torture resistance training to develop abusive techniques with data from the sere programme dod 2006 soldz 2007b 8 kleinmans consideration of kubark s fundamental philosophical approach to interrogation summarized kubark s paradigms as relying on psychological assessment screening the creation and release of controlled stress isolation and regression which are all used by interrogators to help the interrogation subject concede kleinman 2006 9 marks described 1958 hef grant studying inner city youth gang members in which sociologist muzafer sherif had idea that the cia funded the project to model how to manage kgb defectors an mk ultra source told marks the cia learned that getting juvenile delinquent gang defector was

psychological torture as bad as physical torture new scientist 5 march 2007 new scientistanthropology today vol 23 5 october 2007 19kubark or the details of how hef research made its way into the manual however kubark s reliance on citations from heffunded research and testimony at the 1977 senate hearings stating that mkultra research was used to develop interrogation and resistance methods demonstrate that hef research was incorporated us senate 1977 the 1977 senate hearings on mkultra programmes detailed the cias failures to find esoteric means of using hypnosis psychedelics truth serums sensory depriva tion tanks or electroshock to interrogate uncooperative subjects john gittinger testified that by 1963 after years of experimentation the cia realized that brainwashing was largely process of isolating human being keeping him out of contact putting him under long stress in rela tionship to interviewing and interrogation and that they could produce any change that way without having to resort to any kind of esoteric means us senate 1977 62 with isolation and stress having become the magic bullets for effective coercive interrogation it was in the context of this shift away from drugs and equipment that human ecology sponsored howard and scotts stress research the coercive interrogation techniques kubark described shade into torture by the application of intense stress or isolation in order to induce confessions because kubark was an instruction manual not an aca demic treatise authors are identified although few academic sources are cited most sources remain unac knowledged hefsponsored work cited included martin ornes hypnosis research biderman and zimmers work on nonvoluntary behaviour hinkles work on pain and the physiological state of interrogation subjects john lillys sensory deprivation research and karla romans graphology research cia 1963b kubark discussed the importance of interrogators learning to read the body language of interrogation sub jects which the heffunded anthropologist edward hall pursued several pages of kubark describe how to read subjects body language with tips such as it is also helpful to watch the subjects mouth which is as rule much more revealing than his eyes gestures and postures also tell story if subject normally gesticulates broadly at times and is at other times physically relaxed but at some point sits stiffly motionless his posture is likely to be the physical image of his mental tension the interrogator should make mental note of the topic that caused such reaction cia 1963b 55 in 1977 after public revelations of the cias role in directing hef research projects edward hall discussed his unwitting receipt of cia funds through the hef to sup port his writing of the hidden dimension hall 1966 hall conceded that his studies of body language would have been useful for the cias goals because the whole thing is designed to begin to teach people to understand to read other peoples behavior what little i know about the cia i wouldnt want to have much to do with it greenfield 1977 1110 but halls work like that of others entered human ecologys knowledge base which was selectively drawn upon for kubark the hef provided travel grants for anthropologist marvin opler and an american delegation attending the 1964 first international congress of social psychiatry in london the wennergren foundation also provided funds for project in the crosscultural study of psychoactive drugs which was presented at the congress where opler presented paper under that title opler 1965 though not known to be funded by hef mark zborowksi established position at cornell with wolffs assistance where he conducted research for his book examining the cultural mitigation of pain people in pain zborowski 1969 encandela 1993 kubark s approach to pain referenced hinkle and wolff and incorporated many of zborowskis ideas anthropologist rhoda m√©traux assisted wolff and hinkles research into the impact of stress among chinese individuals unable to return to china hinkle et 1957 when wolff learned that rhoda m√©traux would not be granted research clearance by the cia he lied to her about the nature of their work marks 1979 hinkle later admitted that this hef projects secret goal was to recruit skilled cia intelligence operatives who could return to china as spies m√©trauxs unwitting participation helped collect information later used by the cia to train agents to resist chinese forms of interrogation marks 1979 it is not clear why the hef sponsored anthropological research on grieving perhaps they recognized in bereave ment universal experience of intense stress and isolation mitigated by culture or perhaps the cia was interested in studying the impact of mourning on pows coping with the loss of fellow soldiers medical anthropologist barbara anderson received hef funds to write an article on bereavement as subject of crosscultural inquiry see anderson 196511 though hef only funded the writeup of their stress article alan howard and robert scott also not all that much different from getting soviet one marks 1959 159 cf hef 1963 10 halls

cultural values and attitudes toward death howard and scott 196566 although the authors acknowledge hef for making their collaboration possible they stress that they did not notify the hef of this paper like the stress article this paper was chiefly based on howards research into bereavement in rotuma which was sponsored by the national institute of mental health nimh see howard and scott rejoinder below this focus on the way grief produces isolation and alienation aligned with hefs broader interests and fit into kubark s interest in regression and psychic collapse howard and scott investigated the impact of encultura tion on the grieving process they recognized that cultural norms and behavioural practices shaped experiences of iso lation which in turn created different conditions of stress for grieving individuals the first half of their article examined american ways of death grieving and alienation drawing on scotts sociological perspective while the second half used howards ethnographic knowledge to examine rotuman polynesian attitudes to death how they are socialized to experience isolation differently and how these differences translated to different cultural reactions to death the article cited environmental factors in stress from wolff hinkle and the hef research and drew upon kubzanskys chapter on the effects of reduced envi ronmental stimulation on human behavior in biderman and zimmers hef volume the manipulation of human behavior the source most heavily cited in kubark howard and scott 196566 out of the vast universe of writings on death and bereavement howard and scotts selection of this prison study illustrates how human ecologys envi ronment influenced its sponsored studies there is nothing sinister or improper in their citation of these studies but their selection shows how hefs network of scholars informed the production of knowledge some of howard and scotts views of isolation reflected hefs focus on the isolation and vulnerability of prisoners while fear of death may stem from anxieties about social isolation it seems equally true that the process of becoming socially isolated stimulates concern about deathwhen social isolation is involuntary the individual experiencing separating from others may become obsessed with the idea of death howard and scott 196566 164 for cia sponsors looking over these academics shoul ders death and bereavement formed part of broader the matic focus on isolation and vulnerability stress models and the culture of kubark research howard and scotts hef grant supported their library research and their writingup scott was based at cornell where he had contact with hinkle wolff and other hef per sonnel while howard wrote in california and never visited cornell prior to 1961 they submitted copy of their hef sponsored paper developing proposed framework for the analysis of stress in the human organism to the journal behavioral science and following normal procedures copy of the paper was submitted to their funders rs to dp 61107 howard and scott 196512 in his 1977 senate testimony gettinger described how cia funding of human ecology allowed it to be run exactly like any other founda tion which included having access to any of the reports that they had put out but there were strings attached to anybody there wasnt any reason they couldnt publish any thing that they put out us senate 1977 59 beyond what ever normal conversations or friendly suggestions there might be this was the principal way that the hef research findings were channelled to the cia who then selectively harvested what they wanted for their own ends scott and howards work fit wolffs larger public pro gramme of studying stress and health as well as wolffs both public and secret programme studying the dynamics determining the success of techniques of coercive inter rogation the two authors worked together on this model even before they heard of the hef and both claim they would have undertaken the work even without hefs funding rs to dp 61107 the hefs halfyearly report described howard and scotts research as developing an equilibrium model based upon view of man as problem solving organism continually confronted with situations requiring resolution to avoid stress and to pre serve wellbeing hef 1963 24 in the world of aca demic scholarship this was innovative research but from the perspective of the cia avoiding stress took on dif ferent meanings howard and scotts 1965 article on stress was reverse engineered for information on how to weaken subjects efforts to adapt to the stresses of interrogation thus when they wrote that stress occurs if the individual does not have available to him the tools and knowledge to either suc cessfully deal with or avert challenges which arise in par ticular situations they were simultaneously scientifically describing the factors mitigating the experience of stress their purpose while also unwittingly outlining what envi ronmental factors should be manipulated if one wanted to keep an individual under stressful conditions their hidden cia patron s purpose howard and scott 1965 143 their 1965 article reviewed literature on how stress interfered with gastric functions and could cause or increase frequency or severity of disease they described how individuals cope with stressful situations through efforts to maintain equilibrium in the face of difficult and in some cases almost intolerable circumstances ibid 142 the research cited in their work included studies of human reactions to stressful situations such as bombing raids impending surgery and student examinations howard and scotts innovative problemsolving model for conceptualizing stress began with the recognition that individuals under stress act to try and reduce their stress and return to state of equilibrium the model posited that disequilibrium motivates the organism to attempt to solve the problems which produce the imbalance and hence to engage in problemsolving activity ibid 145 under coercive interrogation subjects would be expected to try and reduce the imbalance of discomfort or pain and return to state of equilibrium by providing the interrogator with the requested information their model could be adapted to view cooperation and question answering as the solution to the stressful problem faced by interrogation subjects so that rational subjects would cooperate in order to return to their noncoercive state of equilibrium this philosophy aligned with basic kubark paradigm that the effectiveness of most of the noncoercive techniques depends upon their unsettling effect the aim is to enhance this effect to disrupt radically the familiar emotional and psychological associations of the subject when this aim is achieved resistance is seriously impaired there is an interval which may be extremely brief of suspended animation kind of psychological shock or paralysis it is caused by trau matic or subtraumatic experience which explodes as it were the world that is familiar to the subject as well as his image of himself within that world experienced interrogators recognize this effect when it appears and know that at this moment the source is far more open to suggestion far likelier to comply than he was just before he experienced the shock cia 1963b 6566 thus skilled interrogator helps subjects move towards compliance after which subjects may return to desired state of equilibrium howard and scott found that individuals under stress had only three response options they could mount an assertive response in which they confronted the problem directly and enacted solution by mobilizing whatever cockburn alexander and st clair jeffrey 1998 whiteout london verso democracy now 2007 the task force

23 5 october 2007 21resources were available they could have divergent response in which they diverted energies and resources away from the confronting problem often in the form of withdrawal or they could have an inert response in which they react with paralysis and refuse to respond 1965 147 they concluded that the assertive response was the only viable option for an organism responding to externally induced stress if these findings are transposed onto an environment of coercive interrogation this would mean that cooperation was the only viable option for interrogation subjects in the context of mkultras interest in developing effective interrogation methods these three responses took on other meanings interrogation subjects producing an assertive response would cooperate with interrogators and provide them with the desired information subjects producing divergent response might react to interroga tion by mentally drifting away from the present dilemma or by fruitless efforts to redirect enquiries subjects pro ducing an inert response would freeze like the torture machines victims in kafkas penal colony kubark described how interrogators use manipulated techniques that are still keyed to the individual but brought to bear on himself creating stresses for the individual and pushing him towards state of regression of the person ality to whatever earlier and weaker level is required for the dissolution of resistance and the inculcation of depend ence cia 1963b 41 in kubark successful interrogators get interrogation subjects to view them as liberators who will help them find way to return to the desired state of release as regression proceeds almost all resisters feel the growing internal stress that results from wanting simultaneously to conceal and to divulge it is the busi ness of the interrogator to provide the right rationalization at the right time ibid 4041 kubark recognized that the stress created in an interrogation environment was useful tool for interrogators who understood their role as helping subjects find release from this stress the interrogator can benefit from the subjects anxiety as the interrogator becomes linked in the subjects mind with the reward of lessened anxiety human contact and meaningful activity and thus with providing relief for growing discomfort the questioner assumes benevolent role ibid 90 under howard and scotts learning model the inter rogators role becomes not that of the person delivering discomfort but that of an individual acting as the gateway to obtaining mastery of problem howard and scott found that once an individual quers stress through an assertive response then the state of the organism will be superior to its state prior to the time it was confronted with the problem and that should the same problem arise again after the organism has had an opportunity to replenish its resources it will be dealt with more efficiently than before 1965 149 when applied to coercive interrogations these findings suggest that sub jects will learn to produce the desired information more efficiently than before but as kubark warned this could also mean that an individual who endured coercive inter rogation but did not produce information on the first try might well learn that he can survive without giving infor mation cia 1963b cia 1983 one of kubark s techniques called spinoza and mortimer snerd described how interrogators could ensure cooperation by interrogating subjects for prolonged periods about lofty topics that the source knows nothing about cia 1963b 75 the subject is forced to say hon estly she does not know the answers to these questions and some measure of stress is generated and maintained when the interrogator switches to known topics the sub ject is given small rewards and feelings of relief emerge as these conditions are changed howard and scotts model was well suited to being adapted to such interrogation methods as release from stress was kubark s hallmark of effective interrogation techniques kubark described how prisoners come to be helplessly dependent on their captors for the satisfaction of their many basic needs and release of stress the manual taught that once true confession is obtained the classic cautions apply the pressures are lifted at least enough so that the subject can provide counterintelligence information as accurately as possible in fact the relief granted the subject at this time fits neatly into the interrogation plan he is told that the changed treatment is reward for truthfulness and as evidence that friendly handling will continue as long as he cooperates cia ibid 84 translated into howard and scotts stress model this subject mastered the environment by using an assertive response that allowed himher to return to the desired state of equilibrium there remain basic problems of knowing when true confession is actually false confession offered simply in order to return to the desired state of equilibrium this research on stress gave the cia access to an ele gant crosscultural analytical model explaining human responses to stress it did not matter that the model was not produced by scholars for such ends the cia had its own private uses for the work they funded as alan howard clarifies the abuse of their work was facilitated by the cias secrecy i could liken our situation to the discovery of the potential of splitting atoms for the release of massive amounts of energy that knowledge can be used to create energy sources to sup port the finest human endeavors or to make atomic bombs unfortunately such is the potential of most forms of human knowledge it can be used for good or evil while there is simple solution to this dilemma it is imperative that scientists of every ilk demand transparency in the funding of research and open access to information the bad guys will of course opt for deception whenever it suits their purposes and we cannot control that but exposing such deceptions as you have so ably done is vitally important ah to dp 6707 unwitting past but witless present use of cia funds to commission research covertly was common the human ecology fund was one of many cia funding fronts among the most significant exposed fronts from this period are the beacon fund the borden trust the edsel fund gotham foundation the andrew hamilton fund the kentfield fund the michigan fund and the price fund but number of academic presses including praeger press also served as cia conduits roelofs 2003 saunders 1999 given the church committee finding that between 1963 and 1966 cia funding was involved in nearly half the grants of the nonbig three foundations rockefeller ford carnegie in the field of international activities perhaps the most remarkable feature of this hef research is only that we can connect its cia funding with the project it was used for not that it was financed by cia funds us senate 1976182 however it does not take cia funding for anthropologists to produce research consumed by military and intelligence agencies during the 1993 american military actions in somalia i read news article mentioning an ethnographic map issued by the

should not have been surprised obviously nothing we publish is safe from being abused by others for purposes we may not intend howard and scott strove to understand the role of stress in disease that hidden sponsors had other uses for their work was not their fault but if anthropologists today pro ceed as if such things do not happen sooner or later we shall find ourselves in position where we can longer convincingly claim disciplinary ignorance of malign use of our research we need to come to terms with how such agencies covertly set our research agendas and selectively harvest the resulting research sometimes we may need to follow delmos jones vietnam warera example of with holding materials from publication when there is risk of abuse by military and intelligence agencies jones 1971 anthropologists and other social scientists reluctance to contribute knowingly to interrogation research would have hampered cia progress in these areas of enquiry the understanding that such research was ethically improper presented obstacles to cia efforts to design effective inter rogation and torture methods and these obstacles limited the direct knowledge that the cia acquired through the necessarily circuitous means they then had to operate by thus in some limited sense open ethical research practices inhibited the development of even more unethical interro gation methods that could have been developed by witting social scientists operating under conditions of secrecy in post911 america anthropologists increasingly work for military and intelligence agencies in various capaci ties not all of this work is ethically problematic but with the removal of prohibitions13 on cia domestic operations under the patriot act academics in the us are today even more likely to be targeted for their expertise by members of the intelligence community than they were back in the days of mkultra new programmes like prisp and icsp bring covert intelligence agencies onto our campuses along

described in kubark fair 2007 gordon and fleisher 2006 mackey and miller 2004 new concerns are emerging about the use of social sci ence in torture the american psychological association apa grapples with the ethics of psychologists partici pating in interrogations the apas antitorture policy now specifies 19 specific acts as constituting torture and states that they should not be used in interrogation yet it permits psychologists to be present during interrogations suppos edly to help curtail abuse apa 2007 however psycholo gists working in such settings can as easily be drawn into interrogations that involve torture as other personnel with the bush administration and cia leadership on record as claiming that waterboarding is not torture where does that leave psychologists members of the aaa have recently adopted resolu tion declaring that the aaa condemns the use of torture and the use of anthropological knowledge in torture aaa 2007 critics of this resolution eg mcnamara 2007 reject the suggestion that anthropological research has been involved in developing torture techniques of course as martha huggins 2004 notes in her classification of the ten conditions for statesanctioned torture even torturers typically do not call what they are doing torture those who torture also prefer anonymity and would deny any relationships they may have to such practices this sug gests it is unlikely anyone would admit to having involve ment in torture but this should not hold us back from revealing past and present relationships of our discipline to torture as huggins also argues torture becomes systemic unless revealed and marked off as such and as i have argued here new information has become available that shows how anthropological knowledge has been applied to devising coercive interrogation techniques in the past also we now know that tony lagouranis who joined abu ghraib as an interrogator after the torture scandal broke has described how patais the arab mind was abused by military personnel attempting to help interrogators dehu manize arab enemies lagouranis and mikaelian 2007 we must take this backdrop to the involvement of our dis cipline into account if we are not to become complicit given the abuse of power we have already witnessed and the uncertain future we face in relation to the security state that perpetrated this how far should we permit our professional involvement to go in this matter we need more awareness of the political nature and uses of our work as long as we publish in the public arena anyone can use our findings for ends we may not approve but we also analyse and advocate on the basis of data we col lect and have degree of control over our own interpreta tions though secrecy may limit our knowledge of how our research is deployed by the security state we must continue to expose and publicize known instances of abuse or neglect of our work those who lead calls for social scientists to design improved interrogation methods see isb gross 2007 claim to do so in order to move away from torture towards more humane interrogation but they fail to acknowledge the irony that those they hail as pioneers of scientific inter rogation were key cia mkultrafunded scientists who unethically commissioned and mined research for this pur pose shane 2007 as discipline we cannot afford to done torture

in his article we were deeply dismayed to learn that the human ecology fund which provided summer stipend to write our article on stress was front for the cia and that the paper might have been used to generate torture procedures we are firmly opposed to any actions that are degrading to human dignity under any circumstances including warfare all of our contributions to the health and wel fare literature have been written with the goal of alleviating human suffering not using it to gain hegemonic advantage there is one point in prices article we would like to clarify although we acknowledged hef in our paper on cultural attitudes toward death for making our collaboration possible they had nothing to do with sponsoring it in fact we did not inform them we were writing on the topic nor did we provide them copy of the article if the cia became aware of it they did so by scouring the academic literature just as they must have for other articles relevant to the deg radation of prisoners for the purpose of eliciting information
