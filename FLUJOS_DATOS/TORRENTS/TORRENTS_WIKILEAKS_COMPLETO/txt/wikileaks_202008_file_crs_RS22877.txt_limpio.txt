sources to use this primer provides basic guidance in that direction the primer also provides the most recent data available from each source on enrollment premiums and deductibes for hsas hsas and hras combined and hdhps individuals were first able to establish health savings accounts hsas in 2004 these accounts allow people to pay for outofpocket medical expenses on tax advantaged basis individuals must have qualifying highdeductible health plan hdhp to establish an hsa after establishing an hsa individuals or employers can contribute money to the account up to an annual maximum1 although commonly discussed in combination hsas should not be confused with health reimbursement accounts hras although hras are also used to pay for unreimbursed medical expenses on taxadvantaged basis only employers may establish 1 for selfonly coverage the annual deductible in 2008 for an hdhp must be at least 1100 with the plans annual outofpocket limit not exceeding 5600 the annual hsa contribution limit in 2008 for individuals with selfonly coverage is 2900 an explanation of the rules governing hsas can be found in crs report rl33257 health savings accounts overview of rules for 2008 by bob lyke crs2 and contribute to an hra in addition employees usually forfeit any remaining hra funds at the termination of employment2 data covering enrollment andor cost sharing during the first few years of hdhps and their associated hsas are now available from at least six separate sources two sources provide data on hsas two sources provide data on hsas and hras combined and two sources provide data on hsaeligible hdhps before analysts can evaluate the effects of hsas they must decide which data sources to use this primer provides basic guidance in that direction the primer also provides the most recent data available from each source on enrollment premiums and deductibles for hsas hsas and hras combined and hdhps data sources table 1 identifies the six data sources with data on hsas hsas and hras combined and hsaqualified hdhps the various data sources include survey of large firms survey of individuals data on all policies reported to an association data from those who purchase individual policies online and sample of irs tax returns the data httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22877 sources are listed in alphabetical order which data source to use depends primarily on the question being asked if the policy question truly requires information on hsas that is the actual accounts rather than the associated hdhps then only the irs and kaiserhret sources are suitable3 the irs data which are broken down by tax reporting units provide the total number of tax deductions taken and the aggregate value of the deductions the kaiserhret data include the number of working adults with hsas premiums and costsharing features of the insurance plans and various characteristics of the employer two disadvantages of the irs data are total lack of information on the associated hdhps and that the data are released well after the other data sources two sources combine data on hsas and hras these data can be used if separate analyses of hsas or hras are not necessary ebri provides enrollment estimates for privately insured individuals aged 21 to 64 while mercer provides enrollment estimates for adults working in firms with at least 10 employees the ebri data are based on survey of individuals and contain information on the workers ages incomes health status and opinions of their health plan options the mercer survey is of firms and contains information on firm size and whether the firm predicts it will offer an hsa or hra in the coming year choosing between these two data sources comes down to choice between an individuallevel analysis ebri or firmlevel analysis mercer finally two additional data sources provide information on hsaqualified hdhps the ahip data are obtained from insurance plans and measure all covered lives in the 2 for additional information on the differences between hras and hsas see crs report rs21573 taxadvantaged accounts for health care expenses sidebyside comparison by bob lyke and chris l peterson 3 approximately onethird of the insurers that provided hdhp information to ahip also reported information on enrollees hsa accounts however because this information was provided on voluntary basis the sample is nonrandom and not necessarily representative crs3 plans both individual and group plans are analyzed the data form virtually census of such policies among ahip member companies thus the ahip data are based on large number of enrollees in highdeductible health plans along with the average premiums and deductibles information on enrollees age and state of residence is also available compared with the ahip data the ehealthinsurance data are less comprehensive because only individual policies purchased through the companys website are included however like the ahip data information on premiums and deductibles is available of course individuals who purchase insurance online through ehealthinsurance may differ greatly from individuals who purchase insurance from agents enrollment table 2 presents the most recent available data on enrollment premiums and deductibles for the six sources four of the sources contain data on enrollment as shown in table 2 the enrollment estimates differ greatly these differences occur because each source measures unique concept kaiserhret estimates that 1900000 working adults in firms with at least three employees were enrolled in an hsa in 2007 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22877 the irs data do not measure enrollment but report that 215781 returns claimed an hsa deduction in 2005 these populations enrollment definitions and years are too dissimilar to provide meaningful comparisons ebri reports that 2300000 individuals between 21 and 64 were enrolled in either an hsa or hra in 2006 mercer reports that 5 of all covered employees in firms with at least 10 employees have either an hsa or hra also in 2006 although none of these numbers is directly comparable it is reassuring that the number of hsas from kaiserhret is smaller than the number of hsas plus hras from ebri the number of individuals who claim deductions for hsa contributions in 2005 is the smallest of all as would be expected for two reasons 1 the number of hsas has been growing over the 2005 to 2007 period and 2 not all individuals contribute money to the hsa and of those who do not all claim an hsa deduction the ahip enrollment numbers are the largest because they show enrollment in an hsaqualified hdhp regardless of whether an hsa account was actually established from group coverage as well as individual coverage premiums and deductibles ahip provides the most complete information on premiums and deductibles the average values are available for the small group and large group markets and for three age groups in the individual market other data source provides breakdowns for more than one of these markets in all cases values for individual and not family insurance plans are reported in general individuals in small group markets are more costly to insure because the risk of major illness is spread across fewer individuals and because there are fewer economies of scale small group market deductibles should therefore be higher than large group market deductibles assuming benefits and other policy characteristics are comparable across group size the ahip data display the expected pattern for hsa eligible hdhps the average deductible for small group policies is 2244 and the crs4 average deducible for large group policy is 2046 on the other hand the premium values are virtually identical between groups the data from ehealthinsurance provides information only from individual policies sold through its website the ehealthinsurance results show higher average deductibles and lower premiums than the comparable ahip data however this may reflect the characteristics of individuals enrolling in health insurance through website like ehealthinsurance in addition the ahip premium and deductible information were based on reports of each insurers bestselling hdhp products which may not equate to the average of all hdhp premiums and deductibles conclusion hsas have been available since 2004 and at least six data sources can be used to uncover some basic facts about the recent experience nevertheless the data sources differ in the insurance markets analyzed whether the information covers hsas hsas and hras combined or hsaeligible hdhps and whether the information is provided by employers insurance companies or individuals information from different sources httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22877 therefore should be combined with extreme care more fruitful strategy would be to decide on specific question and use only the source which best answers that question crs5 table 1 characteristics of data covering hsas hsas and hras
