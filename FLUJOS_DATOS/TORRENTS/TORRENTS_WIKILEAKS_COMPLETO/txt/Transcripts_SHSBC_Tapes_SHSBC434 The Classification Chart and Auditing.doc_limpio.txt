the classification chart and auditing lecture given on 26 july 1966 thank you this is the 26th of july ad 16 auditing means to listen and compute it also means to get result on pc and its done in subject called scientology and one sits down usually except in one series of processes known as the cchs and he has preclear that is somebody who isnt clear now in view of the fact that this person isnt clear he has to be handled rather gently because he has aberrations and difficulties and it requires auditing done in technical and professional manner which has not departed from standard procedure you see they have always had offbeat processing of one kind or another it has existed since the earliest days of wogdom there is reason to perpetuate it the psychoanalysti beg your pardon its rather obvious pronunciationhe sits down and does something with person too but there is similarity between what hes doing and what scientologist is doing now scientologist is trying to make the person better and that is new idea in the whole field of the human mind it is so new and novel they think we are terrible because we do not electric shock and execute people our situation does not compare with earlier activities laughingly called psychotherapy or pure duress medieval torture police action and other things which have passed for mental therapy down through the ages were not even in the field of mental therapy were trying to make somebody clear clear of what clear of his reactive bank now freud said that man had an unconscious or reconscious or something of the sort which was subconscious under the underconscious he thought there was something there and it was inhabited by beast known as the censor who kept the fellows from pulling social faux pas and when the censor was asleep or nulled or something of the sort by drugs why the fellow would do antisocial acts and that was the whole explanation of the human mind except it was all caused by sex i hope youre following closely but anyhow we arewe are actually indebted to papa freud because he did say out loud that there was some kind of mind that was kicking back on somebody he didnt really discover the reactive mind we did now clearing somebody is erasing his reactive mind all that is horrible bestial and antisocial about person is actually contained in his reactive mind but we are also not interested in man whether hes horrible antisocial or bestial this again has nothing to do with auditing auditing is not social criticism if youll notice nearly all psychotherapies are involved in social criticism the psychiatrist exists for the quote good of the society unquote and to hell with the patient that is the way he operates now therefore were into new field and we know the answers to the way preclear behavesnot human beings behave we know the answers to those too but who cares the difference between goodbehaving wog and badbehaving wog is so slight as to be undetectable ive seen dear old ladies ruining their families and driving them straight to suicide and so forth and being patted on the back on mothers day ive seen some of the wildest social mishmashes its all by definition if you kill man why that isnt bad or good its by definition bad or good you kill him in war or you kill him because he deserves it or you kill him because hes criminal orand youre judgeor something like thatwhy that thats good see but if you kill him one inch of type outside the statute and so forth thats bad see so there are good things and bad things but they both are the same thing so if you want to get into this morass of social behavior by all means do so but dont mix it up with scientology now you can tell why person conducts himself as he doeswhy person conducts himself as he does good im glad we can but we dont care because there is certain road out scientology is way it is the road outaway from reactivity away from aberration away from identification of aaa and it increases persons ability and it increases his general performance in existence to very marked and fantastic degree and that road out has certain little milestones that you have to pass to get out and we call these for want of better definition we call these grades but there are things called levels and now if we look at the classification gradation and awareness chart of levels and certificates first one issued and the modern one which is about to be issuedsince the interim issue of early 1966 dropped several points off this chart that were vital to it and made it relatively unworkable and which wont be dropped again i came back home in time now the point here is that there are certain points on this that person goes up toward clear and those points have certain definite abilities regained but these grades are not really composed of single pointssomething that you might not have noticed even you working with gradesthey are not composed of single points now this is the rough public renditionpublic renditionand this is not likely to change this is the public rendition is level 0 communications level ior i should say gradegrade 0 communications grade i problems grade ii overts and withholds grade iii arc breaks grade im service facsimiles grade v is in actual fact whole track grade but it is the more innocent end of it it gets fellow up to where he can confront whole track and then weve got grade vi which is unburdening the reactive mind which really is whole trackexcept you dont have to address it at either point which is quite interesting and mysterious about it all it sort of drops between v and vi and gets ignored these days but every once in while piece of whole track bangs somebody right in the snoot and he doesnt quite know what hit him and he says what was that i seem to be sitting here in space car and we seem to be shooting up toward some planet of some kind or another and we seem to be delivering an atom bomb or something im not sure what and ooh oh yeah well i get it now it exploded yeah wonder what thats all about i guess ive been reading too much science fiction and people should ask why does science fiction have the command on its audience that it does they never looked at that side of it and then we get level vii which contains the materials necessary to totally erase the reactive mind now i want to point out to you that it is really not possiblepeople will try this and as we go up the line the only wreckage we will find is people who have tried to enter this whole problem up in the upper grades ignoring the lower grades and that youll find is the main part of the catastrophes the other part of the catastrophe is simply not following standard technology what is standard technology standard technology is contained in hcobs it actually isnt contained in any of the books of dianetics and scientology did you ever realize that modern technology is not contained in any of the hardcover books or any of the other books its contained in hcobs hubbard communications office bulletins and they just run off one after the other and one of these fine days i suppose we will roll up our sleeves and publish them all in consecutive order all corrected so that nothing ever corrects anything in the bulletins and make it very very easy but we will have to put them probably in about seven or eight or ten different volumes because there are quite few of them but thats standard technology theyre on white paper printed with red ink if i havent signed it it isnt true and thats standard technology now because we developed something later we didnt lose the standard technology of something earlier the main bugbear of the person studying scientology was that hethe bugbear was his not minewas that he conceived every time he read something new that that wiped out all the old and this concept was brought about on just this one point that he didnt understand the old that he had read so he didnt realize that it integrated with the new which had just been issued and at time really in hcobs has the new wiped out the old there are very very few corrections i remember trying to correct whole series of processes one time called the r2sr212 there was r210 r212 and i corrected all these because they seemed to be just producing havoc they seemed to be terribly ruinous and there was only one thing wrong with them is they made release at their grade so fast that the auditor never noticed hed start his list practically and he had release sitting in front of him but of course he wanted to earn his payand that was before we knew about overrunsso he would go on and run it and run it and run it and for quite while itd produce quite phenomenal results even being overrun but suddenly clank the person would go straight into the bank with it and that was very upsetting so the idea of overrun and how flat is flat process and so forth does require correction in hcobs but there is nothing in an hcobnothing in any hcobthat tells you you mustnt audit the pc you look there in vain and you wont find anyplace in there ive got the saint hill course on running engrams as practice action and i think you must be having ball i think possibly much to your consternation youve made grade of release here or there that you didnt know existed in the lower bands and thats probably very upsetting and that was probably what upset dianetics modern science of mental health auditors they were probably making lower levels of release which they would overrun but i assure you that you can have release per chain so dont go dashing off sideways and trying to get out of facing the engram by going release he is secondary about mamas release thats the grade of release it is or the level of release this fellow is light engram release on the subject of cutting his finger hes released on cutting finger i speak quite seriously its just by chains now i in the first place would be the last one to plow anybody inunless hes student now pcs are people and theyre entitled to break and theyre entitled to rapid gains and theyre entitled to soar and go right straight on up to clear and all that this we know but that doesnt apply to student you know in opera they always say that the individual the opera singer really never has tonal quality or feeling in her voice until she has suffered and after some great suffering in life why she becomes great artist have you ever heard that well after youve had it few times youll become great auditor i wouldnt give anything for an auditor who hadnt occasionally been wrapped around telegraph polebut good like pretzel i wouldnt give anything for an auditor who hadnt had an arc break while being audited for the next ten or fifteen hours and going into sad effect then hed know what it was you know i know this is brutal and even sadistic but it isnt it isnt in actual fact its complete fact the fellow whos never been overrun on anythinghe certainly is never going to be shy of being overrun its out of sight of his zone of experience well i dont know what the pcs all upset about of course i missed free needle but whats the pc upset about should appreciate it i gave him an additional fifteen hours of auditing an auditor isnt worth much unless sometime or another hes audited over the top of ptp you actually owe it to yourself professionally and to wogs and what its all about to sit down someday as the pc and just dont announce the fact that you re worried as punch about ptp and of course youll get gains youll feel terrible and so forth being audited on that now im not advocating bad auditing for the sake of experience but i am saying that if you do very much auditing you cant help but get some bad auditing now and then and its not necessarily disastrous i have had some of the lousiest auditing anybody ever heard 0 ive been audited by dianetic auditors who were trained in an academy which taught only the bubble theory i used to get away with it by saying well i just would do exactly what the auditor said and this got through many many years but in 19581 found an auditor who gave four auditing commands simultaneously didnt let answer any one of them and so forth and then wouldnt tell which one i was supposed to answer its quite dogfight so even that stable datum vanished on ive had some very good auditing and i have had some championship bad auditing and im moving right on up be checked out here in few days clear now whats all this about it is command of the thing called the mind now maybe after youre clear and maybe after you go ot and so forth you wont then really care to understand anything about man and just regard him as sort of an oddity that sometimes gets under your feet but in actual fact thats rather dangerous attitude you should rather savvy what this character is all about there isnt anythingnow believe methere isnt anything going to help him education psychotherapy with electrodes brainectomiesthats the new psychiatric operation they take out the whole brain there isnt anything going to help an aberrated being i assure you there is nothing going to help an aberrated being but processing they can sweat it out educationally and so forth now im talking about his state of case his behavior and so forth really youre not going to get anyplace short of processing so you better know that processing is very narrow little tracka very very narrow little trackbounded on both sides and above and below by complete mass of improper things that can be done it would be impossible to list the number of wrong things that could be done in auditing it would be an infinite list every time id think i had it all straightened out and nobody could possibly make any additional errors of any kind whatsoever one would so this track called standard technology is very very narrow path and its very easy to stray off of its edges and one of the ways of straying off of its edges is to forget to handle pcs while auditing them and i see what has happened here and why we have fallen into not handling pcs anymore because obviously all the ways you handle pcs are contained in the grades of release arent they so of course you cant handle pcs overts if youre running communication process naturally itd be beyond his grade and of course you cant handle an arc break while auditing communication process because arc breaks and so forth are up here at iii and iv and i think thats how youve gotten into it but you sure have gotten into it you can always run an advanced process on pc as rudiment as something to straighten the case out in hurry he isnt about to go release on it but the day you sit down to audit grade 0to make and attain grade 0the day you sit down to audit that person and do not detect or note that he has present time problem is day you will have lose as case that guy isnt going anyplace youre auditing over the top of heavy ptp that present time problem has got him parked right therebang bang you say is there anything youd be willing to talk to about well i have some problems well im sorry cant talk to you about the problems because problems are up herethe problems are up here atatatat grade i and youre only at grade 0 so you have to shut up about that finally youre running problems and youre grinding on and on and on about problems and the pc is getting sadder and sadder and sadder and sadder and he says but youre not answering my communications and youre not acknowledging andumpffive been feeling terrible for the last thirtyeight days and you say well yes but we cant do anything about that because you see grades iii and iv is where we handle arc breaks and so youll just have to hakeep your arc break until we get up to the grade that its supposed to be handled at and of course the answer to that silliness is the guy is not about to ever get up in grades now let tell you something about this chart that maybe didnt come home too completely is howd i find this chart theres one for you howd i find this chart why is this chart so dead on this gradation chart so forthits quite trick its made up only of those things which you cant audit in the face of and that is the genus of the chart and that is the real reason i found the grades and why i found the grades and i isolated them just as crudely as that i said all right there are certain things that if you dont pay attention to them prevent all progress in auditing so therefore they must be the keys to aberration and thats where we got the gradation chart clever of wasnt it people think its gradation chart so people will take it by gradient well theyre arranged crudely by gradient but youd be surprised how long i argued was 01w an upper grade from problems or lower grade and i finally found out that it must be an upper grade because fellow could confront having problems when he couldnt confront having overts so therefore that was an upper grade this was the way the thing had to be rationalized but there it was in all those years of experienceand believe there have been lot of years of experience on this subject lot of themin all these years only these factors have presented themselves factors that each one separately much less in combination can totally prevent case gain unless given attention by definition this is the superbarrier these are the superbarriers to the track these are the girders across the bridge that have fallen down sideways and what are these things well its elementary the things that person cannot possibly audit up against if these things are out the auditor has had it he cant go any further and these things are communication problems overts arc break and service facsimiles when youve moved the fellow up that far he can confront something of his own life and background and so starts moving out onto whole track and moving into the reactive bank itself but the things that you cannot audit in the presence of without handling are the grades on that gradation chart do you see this so of course if they are the things which absolutely stop any pcs progress then they must be themselves things which desperately require releasing and when then addressed i didnt even havewhen i finally figured this out and worked this down and split the process and i knew already about overrun we found overrun in doing power processes but when those things were audited on big basis with the pcsuch thing as his overtswhen they were audited on grand scale i knew youd get release so i knew you could have communications release and i knew you could have problems release and i knew you could have an overt release and i knew you could have an arc break release see dead easy nothing to it naturally the thing had to be that way because these things were the powerful points in the human mind that debarred all further progress on the part of case well all fellow had to do was be worried about his wife all he had to do was be worried about his wife not meeting him that afternoon which gave him problem of what is my wife doing afternoons he comes into session his tone arm fails to produce actionnothing is as ising he isnt coming out of anythingand even starts climbing bit he cant answer the auditing commands he can concentrate on nothing thats what problem will do now this fellow who is in overts of course the fellow cant talk to youhe cant talk i wonder if you ever realized though that talk goes down to the fact that patient in hospital gives you trouble as an auditor if the patient is unconscious an unconscious patient is out of communication its just communication trouble but also id like to call to your attention that dogs and horses are out of communication and i dont know how youre going to solve that but thats your problem today im not worried about it anymore but this fellow has committed an overt against the auditor or against scientology or the organization or hes trying to get away with somethinghes got withhold you going to make progress with him nuuh mmmm mmmm hes just going to get natterier and natterier and choppier and choppier and nastier and nastier and meaner and meaner hes not going to make any progress not one scrap ill tell you joke you might not think its joke but do you know that one of the differences of technical accomplishment between saint hill and central organization is that central organization very often gets pc who doesnt intend to completely pay for his service that much withhold parks the case right therejust stops it now you take an arc breakthis is the most deadly thing that anybody ever had anything to do with what essentially is it its affinity reality and communication break in what is break bust snapped people get to thinking its because they werent acknowledged please you see there is term in the english language or in latin to describe this adequately so the individuals affinity has been cut and thats desireenforceinhibit the old cdei scale curiosity desire enforce inhibit can be on and any one of those actions can cause an arc break andonly it would be called an break and rit would be overand underreality somebodys busted his reality where did you put the staircase pal i havent any staircase i never saw the staircase oh yes you did pal i saw you build it with your own little hatchet reality break again cdeicuriousity desire enforce inhibiton reality enforced reality and so forth what is laughingly called modern education is mostly enforced reality hoohoohoo because boy that reality can be in quotes too boy can it be in quotes if you want to really arc break somebody with one of the natural sciences turn him loose in physics laboratory as student with the equipment which is commonly furnished and try to get him to get an experiment to come out you know they seldom come out you normally take the best student who is the best student because he has an answer book and then the rest of the students sort of copy it off and fudge it one way or the other so the amount of paper burned and the amount ofthe weight of the paper equals the weight of the ash plus the weight of the smoke you see showing that nothing is ever destroyed and so on you get into corny equipment and so forth and you get reality break education quite customarily and routinely breaks somebodys reality and it breaks their reality sufficiently as to make them bad students or they dont want to study or something like that and then we get into communication break and of course thats the most visible guy talked too much or didnt talk at all the guy would not answer the communication at all or the guy answered the communication perpetually so that it couldnt be communicated any of those things will cause an arc break all right look at that your first level 0 is communication level iii is arc breaks how many pcs are you going to handle at level 0 without ever colliding with an error at level iii if c is one of the commonest sources of arc breaks you mean to tell that youre going to handle the subject of communication without ever bringing about or finding an arc break in the student that has to be handled huh well like cat youre not you never will in gods green earth really theres always got to be somebody around in review or some senior student or something like that to be alert on level 0 students of course i know it goes like hot butter and ityou dont run into trouble very much but its that very little trouble that you must also be interested in because itll barrier your results now i know you could go on the basis well after all there are getting to be three billion human beings and thats an awful lot of human beings thats an awful lot of wogs and theres reason why we shouldnt expend few you see in the process of salvaging them well now im conservationist well now as far as service facsimile is concerned this fellow isall this fellow is thinking about at the problems level is his lumbosis boy this lumbosis you cant ever get every time you turn around hes got lumbosis on the brain his lumbosis is causing him trouble man he is just getting lots of trouble from his lumbosis and then we finally find at level iv its service facsimile its what explains all of his failures he keeps telling you he wants to get rid of his lumbosis but really he never said it in that many words he merely complains about having lumbosis now we begin to understand why we had such hard time getting problems release on this bird we managed to achieve it finally and we did get free needle and so forth but we were never very happy about it well at grade iv we find out that he has service facsimile well i dont say there is any short method of finding anybodys service facsimile that could be used in general because were getting too high in the grades but fortunately were passing above the levels of reality which are real to somebody at the lower grades and it normally turns up in due course this merely turns out to be pc we have always had trouble with his rudiments were always out or something like this and then we finally get him up to level iv and handle the service facsimile and there we go now at level v were straightening him out on the subjects of reality and several other subjects which are taken up in package but what were really doing is sort of getting the track straightened out and were looking for the points on the track where he is terribly stuck where hes really mired in and it takes very fancy processing to do that now were getting into very artistic processing but i assure you that if this processing again neglects these various barriers that can lie across the track of the individual the guy will be stymied you say well yes hes up to grade ivhes complete grade iv release so therefore he should never again have any service facsimiles arc breaks overts withholds problems or communication trouble oh youman you got the wrong definition of release i wouldnt be bit surprisedi just wouldnt be bit surprised but what you couldnt find whole new series of banks to unrelease person into youre dealing with gross product here called release this is just gross product and this is hopeful product this is the sort of product thatsolid gold is awfully nice but all weve got is this gilt and this gilt very often turns green and sometimes we have good gilt and it lasts for weeks or months or even years got some beryllium in it you know its really goodshape giltand sometimes it turns green an hour later and its not gold at all it gets verdigris and i dont know how long release will stay stable becauand i would never say how long release would stay stable at any line because i have had relive had releases before this you see the one thing that boobytrapped the whole of research in the field of the mind is that one could produce temporary state of clear temporary just like nearly all of life is composed of lowerscale mockeries yeah yeah you look around at somebodys exaggerated abilitiesexaggerated and fixated and become just one thing that he can do dont you see hes insane but actually the thing he is doing is an ability who was this old bird jung i think it was jung now thetans can move objects or bust up objects i mean when theyre way upscale see all he had to do was sit down near one and it broke up i think that was jung and this worried him sothis worried the guy so that it was really what he wanted out of his studies and researches was not to have bookcases fall down plaster crack wide open armchairs go out splat every time he came near them and he never achieved that well actually that would be thetan ability gone mad poltergeist or some such thing so you get these upperscale abilities that any thetan would have theyre out of control and unexplained to the individual and when they occur why he thinks hes crazy so these lowerscale harmonics include the fact that one can make something that looks just like something but aint and thats the big booby trap now listen it wasnt just booby trap in 1950it was also booby trap in 523 bc on this same subject in this same line of research thetan exterior produced all the symptoms of total sanitygreat whee marvelous and so forth itd last two minutes two hours two days two years but the one thing that was certain about it it wouldnt go on and the buddhists called it bodhi and bodhi has the same stability as any thetan exterior would have that you made today you can walk up to somebody pop him out of his head with the magic words and he will be stable for two seconds two minutes two hours two daysyour guess is as good as anybody elses but one thing is certain about it he will key in again now release the way were doing it nowand you mustnt just downgrade the idea of release and say its all that unstable because it has this benefit accompanied with it has been the experience of overcoming it and that experience stands one in good stead because it has improved his ability to confront now that goes further than that bit of erasure occurs modern auditing is sufficiently good that bit of erasure occurs along with it and the condition is desensitized so he is more apt to be stable as release on this grade than he was stable to make quote clear unquote 1950 book style do you see nowi now know the difference between and people that were being taught to audit in 1950 my auditing differed it differed considerably and the difference was that when the pc looked like he was finished why i quit i wasnt trying to prove something i was willing to give the pc win let state it that way although thats critical i was so willing to give the pc win that when the pc would say whee gee you know and light up like roman candles and so forth i would say thats it good fine thanks goodbye and they had tendency to remain stable for some time some of those people from back in the late 40s were stable three years afterwards i know of now whats interesting here is that were approaching release on gradient here and we know what grade of release were making and when we were quote clearing them in the 50s we never knew what grade of release we were making clear at do you see but this is the thing which boobytrapped the line was thethe facts of stability stabilityhow long would it last well being very thorough fellow and being very very thorough research man and having been at it for very very long time now i got the idea finally that it must be totality if we were going to have something that was near absolute in the way of clear then we were going to have to do near totality of erasure and for three years i worked very very hard to find out what you totally erased and so today we get clean now weve known for long time that thetan made up his own bank but telling him so didnt get him over it and weve just found out again that telling him so didnt get him over it too even when hes almost clean we say hey youre mocking it up and hed say hey am i mocking it up yeah i am mocking it up and hell go clearpshewand he goes off that bottom step that isnt there you know and hes got to go back on and finish it up the way he should its got to be his cognition so once more the making of release and so on is very very worthwhileman man manbecause its on plotted line and the fellow has raised his confront hes releasedbeing released in proper sequence hes getting accustomed to things that have been ruining his life and would ruin anybodys life because let assure youonce more i repeatanything that will stop auditing would ruin somebodys life because auditing is pretty hard to stop our process drills and that sort of thing are themselves intensely valuable therapeutically i know some people every time they felt bad theyd go out and do their trs but this achievement was bringing it up to the top of totality of erasure and being very thorough sort of chap why i said all right then the answer to it is total erasure and of course you can make total erasure of the reactive bank only nobody had ever done it before from the beginning of the universe on so there are few little tricks involved in it it takes little while but thats headon collision with the thing that isnt just backing out of desensitized area and being free of that desensitized area man you could plunge into nonexistent bank all you wanted to and you wouldnt find anything there to get stuck in so that is clean so clear is stable state but clearsclears follow the rules of life until they themselves have changed their minds concerning the rules of life and when they do that of course theyre ots probably very very advanced to tell you thing like this but ive been of course researching ot processes and i find out oddly enough that the ot processes are the harupper harmonics of just those processesexcept theyre not processes thats another story now wherever an auditor is auditing there are only certain things that are going to prevent his achievement of success there arent 8965 of them theres only this little handfulthis very very small handful and you better not go multiplying the number of things that can get in your road because then youre putting you in your road and you know the hardest thing in the world for thetan to get around is himself now the things that you cannot neglect or ignore in auditing regardless of the grade of the individual are communication factors problems particularly ptps notably overts arc breaks the fact the guy is getting paid some fashion or another for his aberration or service facsimiles and those things will always get in your road and he might have gone somewhere else on the track than where he is supposed to be at and the upper harmonic of that in ot is the guy is longer in the room hes gotten bored but here are elementary things and of those the first four are the most vital that is communication problems overts and arc breaks now are you going to neglect those youre not going to audit what are the symptoms that person with these things displays well im not going to stand here and give you some long authoritative list because they are numerous the indicators of these things are numerous its something like my explaining to youand theyre obvioussomething like my explaining to you that that sign up there that is one mile long and halfmile high painted glaring white and lit with the totality of atomic fission and power from half the worlds searchlights with the red letters on it cat spells cat thats the way i feel after while you know i feel like im just beating dead horse you know its wild if i say look you cannot process somebody unless youre in communication with him an auditor half an hour later realizes the pc hasnt answered any of the auditing questions and goes and sees somebody case supervisor or somebody and says i dont think the process is working process be damned the auditor isnt the carrier wave of all processing is communication so if your pc doesnt feel like talking to you youre not going to get anyplace i mean how elementary can you get now lets say were doing service facsimile at grade iv and the pc isnt talking well we say he cant possibly be not talking because he is grade 0 release well lets just say he wasnt released on you it just so happens he isnt talking that day and until you get him talking youre not going to get any auditing done now you see what i mean about the milelong sign half mile high withpainted white with the letters cat on it in red i mean thats so obvious how could i possibly ever have to tell anybody that and yet time and time again i go through and i see bunch of sessions happening and i see this pc isnt talking and that pc isnt and that one and that one and i find about third of the pcs in the room arent talking to their auditor its not my hypersensitive supertrained brain at work my brain doesnt work as matter of fact thats probably why we got someplace youll see the pc and the pche should be sitting here you see talking to the auditor you see and you see the pc like this and you hear the cheery voice of the auditor you see saying all right ah let have the next item and the pc cats he dont hear this auditor say thing you know you never hear the auditor say whats up you know whats cookin mate of course the auditor would probably ask what are the proper words to use in state like that see my answer im afraid would be effective words and similarly were trying to list somethingfind thesd or something like thatand the fellow says well iillill give you few more items but ive got to meet mazie you know and so forth were having bit of domestic problems you know weve got to go up and see the lawyer and so forth ill give you few more items for this sd and so forth but really youve got to warn when it gets to be whumph thirty and the auditor say all right and take the next few items on it whaw the pc has got ptp of such magnitude that his attention isnt in on the bank so of course if his attention isnt in on the bank how can his attention do anything because its the pcs attention not the auditor that does things through the bank and this pc is saying well i dont want to be critical but i have had better auditors what the auditor doesnt realize is that pcs dont object to auditors unless they have overts on themno matter howhow lousy their auditing is do you know that and if you sit and look at critical or nattery pc and so forth and dont find the overt youve just got rocks in your head thats all why sit there and beat yourself up youre beating yourself up it had nothing to do with the state of his mind its the state of your technology critical pcs have overts and the longer you audit them without pulling the overt why the more youre going to get chopped up so why chop yourself up thats the way you commit suicide you just keep this up the pc eventually will shoot you or something and as far as arc breaks are concerned those arc breaks that are not handled worsen you cannot audit in the presence of an arc break you notice its fairly well up the grades there and its pretty rugged auditing somebody over the top of an arc break at first hell protest and then hes liable to scream and then he raises fuss and then he does this and he finally finds out that isnt getting him anyplace and hehe gets sort of tired and he begins to feel little bit sad and then he gets sadder and sadder and sadder and youll see him walking around after session and he looks like ophelia or whatever his name was in that comic section that was written up the avon some years ago you know she looked very sadalthough she was singing i will say this that these things have not been pointed out since the gradation chart came out but they are what they are and they can occur and person who is released at one of these grades is normally much less apt to have this happen but get thatits much less apt to have this happen you could key him back in so itll happen you can throw somebody out of communication kick him in the teeth few times and he wont talk to you i guarantee it i dont care what grade of release he is id hate to do it to clear and ot probably something horrible would happen to you but the point is that these things occuruntil somebody changes his agreements on life clear up at the level of ot now i hope ive taught you something about gradation chart and i hope ive taught you something about the road out you are very rich in having processes which on broad general basis handle these various conditions and make grade releases with some thoroughness youre very rich in this but that doesnt mean that you wont get arc broke with yourself as the auditor doing grade vii its interesting that the bulk of if not all the clears to date are good auditors arent they all saint hill course there isnt one single fastroute clear yet which is very interesting so if you want good auditor at grade vi and vii why become one an interesting commentary on this but you are dealing with the primary things which barred living and when i found out that if they were barring auditing they were also barring living and therefore were the route for auditing and then when plotted out did make rapid releases youve got the genus of thisthis gradation chart possibly you hadnt realized that before quite remarkable piece of stuff there frankly isnt anything else that can happen to anybody that would bar the road out you say well he could get killed well not necessarily that wouldnt bar the road out because hed pick up another body and youd get him sooner or later but as far as auditing is concerned those are the things that happen to people and so therefore they are the grades of release now there are interim release points on this chart that you probably are neglecting and youre saying because person goes free needle at grade 0 he has then gone grade 0 release see now were getting into dicey and dangerous stuff but hes run some communication processes at grade 0 and has gone floppy needle and you say straightaway were all finished and now hes grade 0 and we dont have to do anything else with grade 0 i want to call to your attention that theres thing over here called valence processes what the hell were they well theyre covered in hcobsvery legitimate address thatd make very thorough grade 0 release right now youre skipping it these were the elementary communication processes well there were some more complex communication processes for grade imuch more complex communication processes all of which have been noted downfollowed by locational processes to make grade of release here was the original plot now when we did ii we had the cchs how the devil you could overrun the cchs so easily that people aretend to just pull off that one and just drop it right out of the lineup and not have any more to do with it thank you because of course person is off meter while doing the cchs so therefore you cannot tell when he goes free needle but here also were arc processes and there were lots of those and then there was case remedies fitted in there that whole book of case remedies fitted in there you could go release on lot of those too now here was auditing by list and overjustifications and so forth at iii here were solutions on physical problems and here was dating on meter that just dropped out of the lineup complete i know it has and then we had cause and effect processes which are quite remarkable and r4h and effort processing and rising scale processes now here was where whole track engrams and secondaries and so forth fit but those were the power processesare the best and fastest way to get into that sort of lineup and then we had the r6 processes solo and we had the powerthis is processes usedthe power processes belong here and then we had above that clear and above that the ot processes which i am now developing now that gave whole list now the processes which you are doing and the last hcobs which you have these are perfectly all right for you to use and clear is somebody at grade 0 who has gone free needle on communication processes and who at grade i has gone free needle on problems processes and at grade ii has gone free needle on overts and withholds and at level iii has gone free needle on arc breaks of one kind or another and at level w has gone free needle while finding service facsimile and level v and va of course are going free needle or the proper end phenomena on the power processes and grade vi is the unburdening of the reactive mind by the processes prescribed at that level to free needlevery easily overrun fellow is doing it himself and they usually overrun and have to be brought back and then at grade vii is the total erasure of the reactive bank and also the unreactive bank and also any bank that had anything to do with it and if you do those things i will grant the fact that person is released at all those grades i want to point out there is whole bunch of other things that can be done at those grades to release people now i dont say you have to do those but i am saying this in this lecture if you think youre going to run one pc for as much as two or three days of auditing without having to use technology from another grade than that from whichon which youre auditing him either done by senior or done by yourself you are very much mistaken itd be very hard to audit some pc without sooner or later running into communication breakdown problems without running into an overt without running into an arc break be almost impossible the smoothest auditor in the world could not fail but to run into one or more of those phenomena in the process of auditing and if youre going to neglect them youre just going to boobytrap the whole road as far as the pc is concerned hes not going to make it on up the line thats all he will drop out and i dare say any failures youre having with cases is because you are ignoring the grade definitions used as rudimentsthe definitions and names of those grades for instance problems arc breaks and so forth these are used now how long do you sit and run arc breaks on level 0 pca grade 0 pc how long do you run arc breaks you run it until you have handled the arc break which was barring your road to auditing you dont now try to make him aan arc break release do you get the idea you understand more about this gradation chart audience yes mmhm well i do hope in spite of the catastrophic method in which this lecture began i havent mentioned any names i havent even looked pointedly at anybody and i havent set up any examples that are actual examplesand this is truei havent set up any actual examples of anybody having goofed on this recently i only discovered it on the basis ofjust noticed that one auditor in handling case neglected all of the points and as he was an oldtime auditor i realized that he thought that was all yesterdays auditing and we didnt handle arc breaks anymore we just plowed through somehow but auditing is done in highly standard way it is very narrow narrow track it is not wide track on both sides of the road it is highly beneficial it has very definite goals aims and gains and when it is barriered youll find the only things barriering it are the things which i have talked about today now therefore the things ive talked about today and going non standard are the things which would bar people from becoming clear and thats all thats all your own personality added up to the technology and moving on through does the rest of the job you being are also part of the lineup and i count on that and count on your cooperation as aa thetan in pushing it through on standard line straight on through to clear for everybody thank you thank you thank you
