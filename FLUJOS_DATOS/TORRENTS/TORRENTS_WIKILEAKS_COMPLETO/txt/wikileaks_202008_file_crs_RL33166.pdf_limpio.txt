summary muslims are the largest religious minority in europe and islam is the fastest growing religion europes muslim popul ation is ethnically and linguistically diverse and muslim immigrants in europe hail from variety of middle eastern african and asian countries as well as turk ey over the last few years european countries have stepped up fforts to integrate more fully their expanding muslim populations recent terrorist acts in europe such as the july 2005 london bombings that were carried out by young muslims born andor bred in europe have given further impetus to these initiatives the widescale riots and violence that broke out in late october 2005 throughout france in reaction to the deaths of two young muslims also highlight the alienati on and discrimination that some european muslims feel and the need for european governments to address such societal tensions this report examines the integration of muslims into the united kingdom france germany and spain it also anal yzes policies at the european union eu level that affect muslim populations howe ver key policies rela ting to integrating muslims into society including citizensh ip laws education tr eatment of religious institutions and antidiscrimination measures largely lie with individual governments the countries discussed in this repor t have historically pursued somewhat different policies with respect to managi ng their immigrant and minority populations however none has been completely succe ssful britain most fully embraced the notion of multiculturalism integration while maintaining identity but some believe that the uk has put too much empha sis on promoting diversity at the expense of building common society france has long adhered to policy that encourages assimilation but many french muslims liv in impoverished almost exclusively muslim neighborhoods until recently germ any and spain made few efforts to integrate their muslim minorities and in some cases parallel societies developed none of the four countries examined in this report has government that believes that large parts of its muslim populations are engaged in radical or terrorist activities however there is growing awareness that social deprivation discrimination and sense of cultural alienation may ma ke some european muslims especially those of the second or third generation more vulne rable to extremist ideologies at the eu level there is also new momentum to encourage better integration and tackle the root causes of islamist extremism given the eus largely open borders and the recognition that halting or severely restricting immigration to the eu is not an option in light of europe s aging population and declining birthrates this report may be updated as events warrant for

defense and trade divisionmuslims in europe integration in selected countries introduction1 european states are stepping up efforts to integrate more fully their muslim populations into national communities r ecent terrorist acts in europe carried out by european muslims have driven these initiatives the widescale riots and violence that broke out in late oct ober 2005 throughout france in reaction to the deaths of two young muslims also highlight the alienati on and discrimination that some european muslims feel and the need for european governments to further address such societal tensions and divisions at the same time many europeans are confident that france has unique problems that triggered these riots and that the unrest will not spread to other countries the presence of muslims in europe often relates to the era of colonial rule by continental governments britain and france experienced large muslim immigrations after the collapse of their empires many other muslims came in the 1950s and 1960s to britain france and germany to f ill labor shortages while spain has close historical relationship with muslims from north africa migration appeared on large scale only after the fall of franco in the 1970s several ot her factors have led to an increase in the muslim population in many european countries high birth rate among muslims need for immigrant wo rkers as european populations age and flight from impoverished and unstable hom countries over the past two decades this report examines the integration of muslims into the united kingdom france germany and spain it also exa mines policies at the european union eu level that affect muslim populations howe ver key policies rela ting to integrating muslims into society largely lie with individual governments the countries examined in this repor t have held deba tes on spectrum of policies from accepting multiculturalism to requiring full assimilation britain has most fully embraced multiculturalism until recently the terrorist bombings in london of july 2005 have triggered vigor ous debate on policies to encourage more rapid integration until recently germany and spain did little to integrate their muslim minorities in germany gaining citizenship was ba sed solely on ethnic background before 2000 citizenship law in tandem with new immigrati on law that permitted migration based primar ily on skills and opened the door to citizenship for muslimshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33166crs2 france in contrast for many years has offered citizenship to muslims but has sharply discouraged multiculturalism france requires that its citizens and its residents embrace the french language and french norms guided by the strong hand of the government in paris education plays central role in the pr ocess of integration some states such as germany and spain offer classes on islam in an effort to meet the needs of muslims who wish to preserve and nouris h aspects of their culture and religion france in contrast insists upon secular ideal and forbids religious activity and religious dress in public schools state treatment of religious institutions is also part of the process of integration all four countries have d mosques and islamic school s with imams and teachers who came from abroad usually with minima l knowledge of the language and culture of the country that they were entering the imams objective was often to teach the strain of islam known in their country of origin as governments became aware that some of the teachings were radicalizing elements of their muslim populations some stepped in to require that imams not come from abroad and that services be conducted in the vernacular of the europ ean country france has required such practice since the 1990s and german may implement such policy while each of the four governments views integration as social need beyond combating terrorism it is clear that terrorist acts have spurred further action by state authorities to encourage integration subway bombing in paris in 1995 awakened the french government to the need to att une itself more closely to developments in its muslim community curb activities viewed as undermining the state and require acceptance of frances longheld political and secular norms other governments began to move down the road of greater state involvement in and observation of muslim life in their societies after sept ember 11 2001 or after terrorist activity on their own soil none of the four countries analyzed he re has government that believes that large parts of its muslim population are enga ged in radical activities it may well be that the diversity within each muslim population impedes development of any tendency towards such activitie s muslim populations in each country differ widely with preponderance of south asians in br itain north africans in france and turks in germany but each country also has range of ethnic groups and languages represented in its overall muslim popula tion these populations have different historical and cultural backgrounds may follo w different strains of islam or as in germany may be largely secular while there is sharply developed tendency towards radicalism it is likely that young muslims above all ve in recent years grown alienated from the european societies in which they live the european union plays more distant role in the integration of muslims into european societies national governme nts normally retain the key responsibilities for shaping the laws regulations and practices that determine the nature of the process of assimilation of immigrants into an existing european population nonetheless the eus role is far from negligible increasingly asylum policy is debated and decided at the eu level the schengen agreement is an eu planhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33166crs3 2 prepared by kristin archick specialist in eu ropean affairs foreign affairs defense and

those entering the union to travel freely once inside its borders recent ag reements on law enforcement cooperation the sharing of intelligence information nd the reach of arrest warrants across national borders play role in tracking and capturing terrorists the eu also actively supports range of antidiscrimina tion policies notable generalization can comfortably be made about the effects on civil liberties of increased observation and manage ment by european governments of their muslim populations in france the acceptan ce of the need for public order has led to political support across most of the spect rum for close government supervision of muslim groups britain has passed laws that provide for greater restrictions on some civil liberties after the london bombings of summer 2005 germany after the nazi era has for decades carefully protected civil liberties but new attention for example to activities in the countrys mosques has triggered greater discussion of government supervision of religious and political life spains tendency since the end of the franco era has also been to protect civil liberties assiduous ly but the terrorist activity there in recent years has deepened the discussion over striking balance between radical speech and po litical activity on the one nd and curbs on free expression and assembly on the other the european union2 europes muslim communities and islamist extremism estimates of the total number of muslim s in the 25 countries of the eu vary widely depending on the methodology and definitions used researchers estimate that as many as 15 to 20 million muslims live in the eu muslims are the largest religious minority in europe and islam is the fastest growing religion given continued immigration and high muslim fertility rates the us national intelligence council projects that europes muslim population will double by 2025 substantial muslim populations exist in france german the united kingdom spain italy the netherlands and belgium most nordic and central european countries have smaller muslim communities3 europes muslim population is ethnically and linguistically diverse and muslim immigrants in europe

regions and countries including the balkans iraq so malia and the west bank and gaza strip eu countries have struggled to inte grate their growing muslim populations disproportionately large number of mus lims in europe are poor unemployed or imprisoned and many feel sense of cu ltural alienation and discrimination for decades countries such as germany and austria viewed muslim immigrants as temporary guest workers as result little effort was made at integration and parallel societies developed britain and the netherlands embraced the notion of multiculturalism integration while maintaining identity as the way to manage their immigrant populations in practice how ever this concept also helped entrench discrete muslim communities functioning in many cases apart from the culture of the host country and while france prof esses that it has long adhered to an integrationist policy towa rd immigrants that encourages assimilation many french muslims live in impoverished almost exclusively muslim neighborhoods and are more likely to be unemplo yed or face discrimination4 the recent riots that erupted in france in october 2005 highlight the alie nation and anger that many young french muslims feel although the vast majority of muslims in europe are not involved in radical activities islamist extremis ts and vocal fringe commun ities that advocate terrorism exist and reportedly have provi ded cover for terrorist cells it should be noted that nationals aligning their beliefs with qaeda or radical islam are not unique to europe the united states has captured or identified several us citizens with similar views in the course of the fight against terrorism however some assert that the failure of european governments to fully integrate muslim communities into mainstream society leaves some european muslims more vulnerable to extremist ideologies many experts say that some european muslim youth many of whom are second or third generation europeans feel disenfranchised in society that does not fully accept them and appear to turn to is lam as badge of identity sometimes they are then radicalized by extremist mus lim clerics or fundamentalist youth groups some experts also believe that the recent wars in afghanistan and iraq have radicalized more european muslims and strengthened terrorist recruitment efforts many young muslims view the war on

islam since the killing wide range of european officials and social comme ntators have procla imed that european experiments with multiculturalism have failed and are urging greater integration of muslims and other immigrants into mainstream european society the july 2005 london bombings and the revelation that several of those responsible were britishborn andor bred has reinforced the imperative in many european countries and at eu level to encourage be tter integration and t ackle the root causes of islamist extremism concerns among eu member states about integration are also

integration and preventing radicalization although the eu has sought since the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks to strengthen its law enforcement and security capabilities against terrorism the union is in the early stages of grappling with the broader issue of islamist extremism6 integration policy is primar ily the responsibility of indi vidual member states rather than that of the eu as whole given di fferent national histor ies legal frameworks and preferences for managing immigration th ere is legal basis in the eu treaties for the union to act on or direct integration policy and

one member to adequately address integration challenges and prevent social exclusion that could lead to extremism or criminal activity could have severe negative implications for other eu members eu policymakers stress that efforts in the area of integration are intended to apply to all legal immigrants from countries outside of the eu member states known as third countries in eu termi nology and are not aimed specifically at muslims the eu is also eager to keep its integration policies separate from those developed to combat terrorist recruitme nt and radicalizati on maintaining that

one furtherm ore many eu officials and member states worry that targeting muslims in its initiatives aimed at either promoting integration or combating extremism coul d be counterproductive if th ey further feelings among some muslims of exclusion and discrimination critics argue however that the eu is essentially avoiding the specific issue of muslim integration out of concern for political correctness in doing so the eu is failing to address the difficulties with integration that some muslims in europe experience that may relate to their religious affiliation in addition they contend that the eus focus on integration of lega l thirdcountry nationals may not account sufficiently for the identity and social ex clusion problems faced by second or third generation european muslims7 integrating third country nationals as the issue of integration has gained increasing importance on the eu agenda the eu has been working to develop framework that seeks to balance respect for multiculturalism and tolerance with the definition of clear expectations and rule s for immigrants to eu countries some eu efforts to promote the successful integration of immigrants and minorities predates the van gogh murder in 2004 and the london bombings in july 2005 but eulevel initiatives in this field are relatively ne w in october 2002 eu leaders decided to establish national contact points on integration to facilitate information exchange on challenges and best practices among member states in july 2004 the eu issued its first annual report on migrati on and integration which ex amines trends in member states integration policies nd identifies main barriers to integration in november 2004 the eu published handbook on integrati on for policymakers developed by the national contact points that sets out best practices with partic ular focus on language learning and participation in european civic political social and cultural life also in november 2004 eu leaders dopted 11 co mmon basic principles for immigrant integration policy these common basic principles emphasize that integration is twoway process of mutual accommodation by all immigrants and residents of member states and implies respect for the basic values of the eu one european official commented integration means wanting to take part in the society in which you live but it also means be ing able to take part among other measures the common principles identify the following as crucial to successful integration access to employment educa tion and public services protection against discrimination basic knowledge of the host societys language history and institutions and immigrant participation in member states democratic processes and political decisionmaking8 the eu already has

suggest s efforts to be taken at both national and eu level and calls for measures such as boosting participation of immigrant women in the work place promoting interfaith dialogue and increasing the participation of noneu nationals in local elections eu leaders stress however that both the common principles on integration and the newly proposed agenda for implementing them represent suggestions and guidelines for eu members they are neither binding nor exhaustive and work on their development will continue9 in addition the eu plans to establish european integration forum where relevant stakeholders can consult one anot her and widely accessible eu integration website to support the exchange of ex pertise and information the european commission has also proposed an eu inte gration fund to suppor t national and eu level integration projects in accordance with the common basic principles the eu has been funding some pilot projects on integration since 2002 with budget of roughly 5 million annually for the new eu integration fund the commission is proposing funding level of 18 billion for the 20072013 eu budget period but it must still be approved by member states some eu leaders have also suggested possibly requiring immigrants to make declaration in which they pledge to respect national laws and the eu charter of f undamental rights viewed by many as representing the basic values of the eu and its member states10 preventing terrorist recruitment and radicalization in november 2004 the eu set the end of 2005 as deadlin for developing longterm strategy to address the factors that contribute to radicalization and recruitment for terrorist activities in september 2005 the european commission issued document on terrorist recruitment addressing the factors contributing to violent radicalization to be considered by eu leaders in formulating their strategy by december 2005 although the commission ac knowledges that the main terrorist threat currently stems from an abusive interpretation of islam it stresses that its proposals also seek to addre ss other extremist threats such as those posed by right wing skinheads or indigenous violent groups such as the basque terrorist organization eta that has been active in spain and france for decades the commissions policy paper sets out ways in which the problem of radicalization and terrorist recruitment could be addressed through various fields including stemming the spread of terro rist propaganda through the media and internet promoting education youth enga gement interfaith dialogue

sex religio n or nationality in broadcast and the commerce directive which contains provisions allowing member states to take action against violent radicalization and terrorist recruitment occurring on the internet the commission also calls for more extensive research and analysis of the causes of violent radicalization11 one of the most controversial aspect s of the commissions proposal will likely be its treatment of the media and intern et the commission appears concerned that the media may be acting inadvertently as messengers for terrorists and urges journalists to avoid conveyi ng an oversimplified view of the world where inequity and oppression are dominant the commissi on is also worried about the use of internet websites and chatrooms as tools for terrorist propaganda and recruitment and calls on internet service providers to do more to end incitement the commission suggests that selfregulation of the industry or c ode of conduct may be beneficial some eu members and civil liberty advocates may object to these proposals because of concerns that they could impede freedom of speech some observers had expected the commi ssions policy paper to address whether the lack of integration by some foreign preachers and their poor local language skills have contributed to radica lization some eu member states such as the uk germany and the netherlands have been introducing or considering new requirements that foreign ministers of re ligion demonstrate basic command of the local language and customs the nether lands has reportedly created an imam buddy system that links foreign imams with dutch volunteers to promote better understanding among these imams of dutch culture and society however the commission appears to have shied away from the role of foreign clerics because some eu officials were concerned that such measures could be perceived by muslims as discriminatory and heighten feelings of alienation so in an attempt to ensure that the vast majority of peaceful muslims are not portrayed as rrorist sympathizers the commission asserted that there is such thing as islamic terrorism nor catholic nor red terrorismthe fact th at some individuals unscrupulously attempt to justify their crimes in the name of re ligion or an ideology cannot be allowedto cast shadow upon such religion or ideology12 challenges ahead the eu recognizes that any

preferences for example some experts suggest that european countries s hould institute usstyle affirmative action plans for european muslims as way to combat discrimination improve muslim social and economic standing and further integration however it is unlikely that the eu would be able to forge agreement among all 25 member states on common affirmativeaction or positive discrimination program in light of members varying legal frameworks for instance ethnic groups are not recognized in french law under which all are considered equal so such pos itive discrimination policy would be difficult to implement some policymakers in france and elsewhere in the eu also contend that such policy could lead to further segregation of immigrants or ethnic minorities rather than less furthermore some initiatives urged by the eu in its common basic principles or agenda for integration such as encouraging more immigrants to become citizens or promoting greater political participation can only be accomplished at the national regiona l or local level given that citizenship and electoral laws remain in the national competencies of member states13 as with attempts to institute new eu law enforcement and security measures against terrorism the eu will likely struggle to balance combating islamist extremism and terrorist recruitment against european democratic ideals civil liberty protections and human rights concerns for example the extent to which liberal societies should tolerate those who preach intolerance in the name of free speech is key challenge for many european govern ments different member states have traditionally had different vels of tolerance the uk for example has been criticized by french officials for years for not clamping dow n on radical preachers who espouse violence in the name of is lam following the july 2005 l ondon bombings the british government appears ready to take harder line it has announced plans to make justifying or glor ifying terrorism crime and is moving to ban extremist muslim groups such as hizb uttahrir and the successor organizations to the radical muhajiroun youth moveme nt however it is unclear how much convergence on this question of the appropr iate balance between tolerance and risk will be possible among 25 different states including the new central and eastern european members of the eu for whom memories of state repression of free speech and other basic rights remain fresh some suggest that the effectiveness of eu efforts to address and prevent islamist radicalization and r ecruitment may also partly depend on the eus success in improving immigration and asylum controls so that those deemed threats to public security are either excluded or removed from eu territory but asylum and immigration issues remain difficult areas to reach agreement among eu member states because of different national sensitivities nd concerns about safeguarding the human rights of asylumseekers migrants and illegal immigrants for example france spain belgium and sweden have consistently opposed various proposals to establish asylum centers outside the eu in north africa or elsewhere on europes periphery

forbids returning individuals to countries wher they could face torture execution or inhumane treatment and could slow member states plans to expel some foreign nationals who advocate violence or

integration while allowing immigrants and ethnic groups to maintain cultural id entities and customs multiculturalism has been embraced in the uk since the 1960s as way to deal with britains growing diversity as result of immigration from outside of europe experts point out that multiculturalism was natural choice for the united kingdom given that it was already an assembly of nations english scottish welsh plus the communities of northern ireland however critics charge that in practice multiculturalism has helped entrench discrete muslim communities in the uk functioning apart in some cases from mainstream british society the debate over multicu lturalism in the uk predates the july 2005 london bombings but the attacks and especially the revelation that several of those responsible were british born andor bred have brought the issue to the forefront of british political debate some analysts assert that until r ecently british policymakers had laissezfaire attitude toward integration that essentially consisted of not worrying about it to the ex tent that government was concerned with the issue the focus was largely on promoting tolerance and discouraging discrimination for example the practice of veiling by some muslim women has been generally accepted in the uk although the issue of islamic dress has generated controversies in few british schools uk leaders view it as problem for school officials and not politicians to resolve this contrasts sharply with france which has banned headscarves for muslim school girls as way to promote integration and secularism20 critics claim that britains laissezfaire multiculturalism has resulted in too much emphasis placed on maintaining indi vidual or community identity at the expense of building common british identity

years have in cluded ministerial outreach to muslim leaders community organizations and youth and student groups to discuss issues of concern such as the uks policy toward iraq and new antiterrorist

to intensify contacts with the muslim community the home office established seven working groups of muslim leaders and expert s to provide advice on an informal basis to the government on ways to

and the role of mosques security policing and is lamophobia and educat ion although many muslim leaders have been receptive to this initiative some also insist that the government needs to examine the

to improve their community leadership and management skills muslim groups caution however that any effort by the government to regulate imams through licensing scheme would likely be considered discriminatory and face considerable resistance30 several analysts are skeptical however that the blair governments efforts to encourage dialogue with muslim leaders will have much effect on preventing or reducing extremism they argue that the muslim community in the uk is divided over who speaks for muslims in britain some young muslims view the leaders involved in the government discussions as coopted careerists or sellouts other muslim leaders considered moderate by many in the muslim community have not been invited to cooperate with the govern ment because of positi ons they have taken in support of terrorist groups like hamas that are engaged in the israelipalestinian conflict other critics of the british governments initiative to work with muslim groups to foster

salman rushdie has called the blair governments reliance on faithbas ed groups to fight extremism very bad mistake and argues that more religion is not going to solve the problem rather he contends that greater attention shoul d be focused on moving beyond tradition and bringing the core concepts of islam into the modern age31 tackling disadvantage and discrimination many experts assert that

include new race equa lity grants for minority community projects one recipient for example is the muslim welfare house in london that offers english lessons and job advice among other services in march 2005 the blair government announced that it would set up new centers for vocational excellence and entrepreneurship in areas of high ethnic minority unemployment the governme nt has also sought to improve muslim housing access by removing tax disadvantag for mortgages that comply with islamic law which forbids paying or receiving interest the majority of muslim children in the uk attend british community public schools in 1999 the british government tablished an ethnic minority achievement grant which provides total of r oughly 300 million annually to local school districts to

they have better understanding of islam they also argue that muslim childre n in community schools are more likely to feel isolated and confused about who they are which could lead to disaffection and make them more vulne rable to radicalism34 the uk does not use quotas or us ffirmative action style programs to promote diversity in employment or high er education rath er it has traditionally relied on strong laws against discrimination however ma ny argue that muslims and other multiethnic faith groups remain at disadvantage in terms of the legal resources available to them with which to fight discrimination because the uk race relations act only prohibits discrimination on the grounds of race or ethnic origin and not on religion new uk regulations came into force in december 2003 banning discrimination in employment on grounds of religion or belief but do not apply to the other areas of the race relations ac t education training housing and the provision of goods facilities nd services thus some british officials and muslim leaders suggest that the race relations act should be extended to prohibit discrimination on religious grounds in all fields covered by the act35 since the september 11 2001 terrorist ttacks many muslims in the uk also report feeling under siege one survey by ukbased islamic human rights group found that 80 of muslims polled felt rassed or

bill in july 2005 but it still faces some resistance in the house of lords37 law enforcement and security measures since september 2001 the uk has also sought to contain islamist extr emists and counter terrorists by tightening security measures and reforming immigration and asylum laws38 like the united states however the uk has been struggling to balance such law enforcement efforts against its civil liberty traditions and democratic ideals for example the evidentiary bar for convictions in the uk remains t high although nearly 800 people have been arrested since the september 11 attacks under antiterrorism laws only 121 have been charged with terroristrelate d crimes and only 21 of those have been convicted39 the uk is also mindful of its experience in northern ireland and is seeking to avoid policies against islamist extremists that would risk alienating the quiet majority of muslims many in the uk believe that l ondons attempts in the 1970s and 1980s to curb the threat posed by groups like the irish republican army ira with harsh and repressive w enforcement measures were both counterproductive and costly in liv resources and basic freedoms in some cases civil liberty and human rights advocates have successfully challenged the governments counterterrori st policies the most notable instance relates to the policy postseptember 11 to detain indefinitely foreign terrorist

other c ountries say that such uk measures to clamp down on islamist extremists and mu slim clerics who espouse terrorism are long overdue some argue that britains traditional watchful tolerance

authorities counter that britains emphasis on extended surveillance and monitoring has provided useful intelligence information in way that protected freedom of speech and assembly rights41 the

established france as firmly secular state the revolution gave birth to republican ideal that guaranteed religious freedom but built firm wall between religion and the state equality of rights for all citizens was the essence of civic creed that for example abolished the social hierarchy of the ancien régime gave citizenship to jews and by the late nineteenth century provided free public education to all45 the state in return expected inhabitants of france to live within the republican ideal of equal rights while the french government accepts multiculturalism as phenomenon that enriches societal life paris at the same time puts the highest premium on public order and assimilation the government chooses not to provide special consideration in public life for diffe rent religions or political groups france for example rejects quota system or any form of affirmative action for minorities in every aspect of public life in this view equality of rights theoretically brings equality

service was another factor that promoted assimilation with key mome nt of success coming in the first world war until 1914 segments of french society spoke regional languages nd followed regional customs rather than fully embracing the french language and cultural norms clearly evident in paris many inhabitant s of provence for example spoke provençal and many inhabitants of brittany continued to speak breton in the late nineteenth century there were also large migrations from italy and spain bringing to france often radical political traditions such as anarchism the first world war threw these groups together into the ranks where di scipline instilled knowledge of the french language and acceptance of the capitals po litical creed of republicanism french leaders sought to build closelyknit fren ch nation by asserting the superiority of french history language and culture47 third driver of assimilation in france has traditionally been employment public education and equality of rights have been factors at least theoretically in limiting discrimination in the workplace ag ainst ethnic and religious minorities overlaying the role that public edu cation military service and employment have played in assimilation has been the states approach to management of religious practices 1905 law reaffirmed the french ideal of separation of church and state the law designated catholicism protestantism and judaism as recognized religions and laid out means for them to develop re presentative bodies that might discuss with the french government matters of importance such as recognition of religious holidays and construction of places of wors hip it was not until the 1980s that france gave measure of official recognition to the muslim faith in 2002 muslims followed other

french muslims sent imams to france to lead the different mosques many of these imams had knowledge of france and did not know the french language the messages they brought to france normally underscored traditiona l sentiments found in their country of origin and as such worked against any fren ch ideal of assimilation in recent years some brought more radical message including islamic fundamentalism that french officials viewed as hostile to french interests in addition some imams caused divisions among muslims by fomenting rivalries between mosques based on different muslim traditions emanating from the countries of or igin for many years for example the french government viewed the grande mos paris representing much of the algerian population as the principal voice of muslims in france as saudi arabia gained prominence from the 1970s due to its petroleum resources and as moroccans became more organized during the last two decades of the twentieth century it became clear that there were other sometimes rival voices to the algerian muslim community50 there is widely held view in france that its muslim community has not been wellassimilated education levels are lowest among muslims and there is discrimination against some muslims in employment in recent years the governments refusal to grant special privileges in public institutions has led to clashes with small percentage of the muslim population that minority has demanded for example that public schools llow muslim girls to wear head scarf to class or that only female doctors treat girls in public hospitals in the french governments view there are limits to multiculturalism and belief that immigrants must assimilate themselves fully into the expected norms of french society muslims living in

french they do not identify with their parents country of origin such as algeria or morocco nor accept their parents insistence that they marry within the muslim community another group see themselves as good muslims and good citizens and value cultural link to their or their parents country of orig in these two groups also value voting and other forms of civic participation in french life third group is comprised of young north africans often very secular who are generation removed from the immigrant arrivals of the 1950s and 1960s and who speak berber arabic or an arabic dialect at home this group also considers the vot and other forms of civic participation in french life important51 fourth group considers itself as being more apart from france this group does not view itself as french but rather muslim in cultural sense muslims in this category are not likely to vote and are alienated from french culture and society many in this group do not see it as possi ble to consider oneself both muslim and french in part the conflict between being muslim and french is grounded in the traditions of islam and the traditions of the french republic traditional muslims believe in hierarchical society with women in position that leaves them submissive to the leadership of men th republic in contrast not only recognizes but requires that women be treated as the equals of men this means that muslim women must renounce their own cultural traditions to integrate fully into french society52 some observers believe that there remain lingering notions of inferiority in the french muslim population that grew out of the relationship between france as colonial power and the subj ect colonial populations in north africa and elsewhere in this view some native french believe that they imparted valuable parts of french civilization such as language nd culture to elements of the colonial population while the colonial population nd its heirs came to accept parts of the argument that their society was improved by the contributions of the advanced european society of their colonial masters53 acceptance by muslims of the republi can ideal does not necessarily lead to their assimilation into french society some studies find widespread discrimination against north africans and other muslims who seek employment in france few muslims are visible in the top levels of french politics media the judiciary business and the civil service there are muslims in the french parliament the percentage of muslims who fail to finish secondary school appear s to be considerably

and other cities for the most part these are working class suburbs populated by north africans where unemplo yment levels are high and educational levels are low in many ways these suburbs are society apart their inhabitants cut off from most of the opportunities afforded french youth who are not muslim the rioting has largely taken the form of vi olence against property the government declared state of emergenc and responded with curfews and with police who cut off the neighborhoods from the nearby cities some muslims criticize the french government as too passive in its approach to encouraging assimilation and insensitive to central aspects of muslim culture they describe the french approach wh ich as already noted abjures quotas and requires secular dress and be havior in the public school system as telling muslims to assimilate themselves to france the governments decision to ban the head scarf discussed in more detail below was in part an effort to emancipate muslim women but to accept north african as completely french is to accept him without his religion in this view procl aiming equality of rights is not sufficient to accomplish equality of opportunity pr oponents of this perspective contend that france is not granting its muslim population true equality of rights when paris demands that some elements of muslim traditional life and cu lture be abandoned in order for muslims to enjoy full participation in french life55 at the same time by some measures assimilation has increased in french algeria in 1955 only 1 percent of europeans married muslim but by the 1990s 20 of muslim men who had come to france by the age of 15 were married to french women defined as woman born in france of parents born in france among muslim men born in france 50 percent were married to french woman56 factors shaping new fren ch policy towards muslims for several reasons the french government has taken more assertive role over the past 25 years in addressing its mu slim population the iranian revolution of 1979 alerted the french government to th political development of more radical and potentially violent organized strain of islam in 1995 an

key assimilative tools the public schools the military and employment longer seemed to be having the desired effects discip linary problems were troubling the schools conscription was phased out in the 1990s and unemployment among muslim youth remained excessively high particularly troubling to many french officials have been tensions in the public school system through the secondary leve l

demand the submission of women and they have rrived in one that re quires equal treatment of all french officials view the demands of some muslims for special treatment of muslim girls in the school

rise in antisemitic violence is another trend that is troubling france by most accounts the violence has been committed by young muslims such acts have increased noticeably since 2000 in 2003 approximately twothirds of the acts of racist violence were committed against jews most of the rest were against muslims the acts have occurred mainly in the subur bs around paris and in southern

in the past several years the french government has adopted new measures to assimilate and contro l its muslim community these measures place high value on preserving the ideals of republicanism and reflect an institutional approach in keeping with long tradition of using highly centralized government apparatus to ensure public order french officials and most observers be lieve that only small minority of the muslim population is engaged in violence nd other disruptive behavior even with the riots of late 2005 the french governme nt continues to reject measures that intimate that mu slims will be given special consideration and treatment such as development of quota system in schools and employment in an effort to encourage assimilation rather the emphasis is on velopment of structures for dialogue between representatives of islam and the government and on enforcement of the law to ensure public safety president chirac rejected any dramatic change of policy as result of the autumn

culte musulman or cfcm cfcm represents the muslim religion but is not meant to represent all muslims in france rather it is forum for discussion with government officials about construc tion of mosques observance of religious holidays and ensuring for example appropriate food for muslims in the french prison system neither the government nor muslims view cfcm as an avenue for integration of muslims into french society as it does not address issues for example in the educational system or the activities of youth groups64 french muslims elect twothirds of the officials of cfcm and local muslim organizations and mosques appoint the rest nicolas sarkozy the french minister of the interior led the negotiations that created the cfcm as well as 25 regional muslim councils in france he

families object to elements of coeducation for example they do not want their female children to take physical education nor do they want them to take biology classes where reproduction is discussed the french government believes that such families ar causing disruption in the public school system especially in period of increased tensions between muslims and jews in france and period of political tension with the muslim world over the issue of terrorism after an extended debate the government presented bill to parliament to ban conspicuous religious symbols in pub lic schools through the secondaryschool level the law prohibits the wearing of head scarves it also bans religious symbols such as large crosses and the yarmulke in the parliamentary debate over the bill then prime

imams and the governments response the presence of radical imams promoting funda mentalism and in some cases violence led the french government in the 1980s to establish more direct contact with muslim communities in france the government began to discourage foreign governments from sending imams to france if those individuals di d not speak french knew little about french society or had extremist ndencies when the step di d not yield adequate results the government began to demand that mo sques appoint imams who had been born or at least educated in france france wished to secure

centuries france has been one of the most centralized of european states the revolution established funda mental tenets of secularism and egalitarianism and strong state power to enforce them the french media is filled with plaintive stories that the french identity is being diluted by immigrants whether muslim east european or asian and strong consensus remains that the republics central ideals must be preserved multiculturalism is not policy that is broadly advocated by french leaders there is however broad gap between the extremists and racists of the national front who frequently test government limits on hate speech and more traditi onal french views that see the republic as tolerant but protective of public order the suburban riots of autumn 2005 do not seem to have shaken the french governments faith in its policies when president chirac first spoke to the french people after nearly ten days of street violence he again em phasized the republican ideal of opportunity and the requirement for public order he added that some government measures that would open the door to more of the countrys poor would eventually be forthcoming tolerance for violent speech in france has waned over the past century this change is in part the result of sharp divisions caused by the algerian war for independence and more recently islamic terrorist attacks in france and the attacks of september 11 2001 on the united states enforcement of legislation restricting certain forms of political action remains route to ensure stability preferable to an active government policy of assimilation the latter remains in rudimentary stage at most in france today the burden remains on muslims who have immigrated to france and on their descendants to embrace the norms of republican ideals that the government believes it must nur ture and preserve to ba lance this equation in the view of some critics of government policy paris must act more assertively to integrate an alienated

postwar german governments conscious of the countrys nazi past have had strong record of openness to foreigners seeking asylum or wishing to reside and work in germany they have been much less successful in integrating or assimilating outsiders who chose to stay in germany permanently especially the growing number of muslim immigrants from third world countries historically germany has not seen its elf as nation of immigration though in fact there always has been some migration into germany including large groups such as the huguenots from france in the 17th century or the polish miners who settled in the ruhr basin in the 19th century76 since world war ii millions of ethnic germans from russia and eastern europe have been repatriated to germany as full citizens with generous benefits eligibility for german citizenship pr ior to 2000 was based solely on german ancestry and not country of birth foreigne rs residing in germany even second and third generation residents born in germany had little prosp ect of naturalization the government sought to compensate by gran ting foreigners extensive civil and social rights as well as social benefits as noncitizens under the new c itizenship law passed in 2000 second generation foreigners born in germany became eligible to apply for citizenship assuming their parents had legal residency however even after the law went into effect the old notions of who is really german persisted among ethnic germans to this day many germans identify their nationality in ethnic and cultural terms and do not cons ider those without german ancestry as german at the same time very large number of foreigners reside in germany in recent years some 800000 people have m oved to germany annually while some 700000 have left each year in all over 7 million foreigners live in germany or about 9 percent of the population77 postwar germany assumed special responsibility for those seeking asylum from political persecution the basic law of 1949 established as firm principle the right of political asylum in the early ears of the federal re public refugees mainly from communist eastern europe sought asyl um in germany however in the mid 1970s germany began to receive an influx of asylum seekers from other countries in 1992 record 440000 applications for asylum were submitted while only small percentage 425 were granted asylum the rest were able to take advantage of the drawn out process to stay in germ any and receive housing and social benefits for many years while their cases were adjudicated with german reunification and

process for adjudication of asylum cases78 the largest influx of foreigners re sulted from germanys policies in the 1950s and 1960s to address an acute labor s hortage during period of rapid economic development by inviting in guest worker s from less developed countries to perform the jobs for which germans were not ava ilable under agreements with foreign governments these workers were expected to stay in the country for fixed term and to leave the country once thei r services were longer needed many of the original guest workers italians greeks and other southern europeans did return to their native countries however subsequent groups of guest workers mostly muslim yugoslavs turks and north africans stayed and eventually brought their families to join them they and their children remained largely segregated from german society living in their own communities and sometimes having little contact with the host society in later years many germans came to accept this as form of multiculturalism in that these groups we re allowed to live in germany as they chose and to maintain their own cultural identity and communities germany was reluctant to forcibly expel people but the government tried various packages of financial incentives to encourage them to repatriate to their native countries such measures had limited success and the majority of these foreigners chose to stay despite their isolation status of muslims in germany today some 33 million muslims live in germany making up about 35 percent of germanys population turkish muslims are by far the largest group followed by muslims from the former yugoslavia arabs and muslims from southeast asia muslims now form the third largest re ligious group after roman catholics and lutherans the muslim birth rate is 3 times higher than for nonmuslims and the muslim population is expected to roughly double by 201579 the new german immigration law which we nt into effect in january 2005 is likely to influence the further immigration of muslims to germany for certain professionals scientists and highly skilled workers it means easier entry and an opportun ity to gain immediate permanent residency there is an annual quota for immigrants to be selected on point system the new law also favors selfemployed entrepreneurs who agree to invest minimum of one million euro and create 10 new jobs the law will also make it easier for certain refugees who are the victims of nonstate and gender specific persecution to claim asylum for the less skilled and educated the law makes immigration virtually impossible80

terrorism the attacks in the united states on september 11 2001 and other r ecent terrorist incidents have heightened german public suspicions of muslims residing in the country and have led to an escalation of antimuslim incidents especially in the eastern part of germany the terror threat has also caused german authorities to give far greater attention and scrutiny to the muslim communities in germany after the attacks of september 11 2001 it became apparent that germany faced serious threat of radical islamic terrorists on its own soil three of the 911 hijackers in the united states had lived and plotted in hamburg and other parts of germany for several years87 other terrorist incidents ar also believed to have had german connection indicating that the rrorists saw germany as one of the easier places in europe from which to operate they were able to take advantage of germanys liberal asylum laws as well as strong privacy protections and rights of religious expression which had shielded activities taking place in islamic mosques from surveillance by authorities significantly germany now sees radical is lamic terrorism as its primary security threat and itself as potential target of attack88 since september 11 2001 more german citizens have died as victims of is lamic terrorist attacks than in the entire history of domestic violence by the red army faction raf german terrorist group that operated for over thirty years89 after 911 germany dopted new an titerrorism laws that limited the protection accorded to muslim extremists legisl ation approved in n ovember 2001 targeted loopholes in german law that permitted terrorists to live and raise money in germany the immunity of religious groups and charities from investigation or surveillance by authorities was

the german justice ministry was involved in so 80 preliminary proceedings92 authorities have placed about 300 suspects who are thought to have links to international terror networks under surveillance93 new german immigration law went into effect in january 2005 making it easier to depor t suspected foreign extremists although the ease of entry of terrorists into germany and their movement within the country have been significantly curtailed suspects already living in germany may be able to take advantag of apparent loopholes in german law for instance muslim extremists have been able to obtain extended residency permits by enrolling in academic and job training programs others have been able to gain political asylum94 some extremists may have gained permanent residence through marriage to german citizens sec ond and third generation mu slims who have gained citizenship under the 2000 citizenship law but remain isolated and disgruntled may be more susceptible to islamic radicalism and could serve as potential recruitment pool for terrorists prospects there is growing awareness in germany that the integration of its muslim population is one of the greatest challenges the country faces several factors are at play first is the reality that germanys muslims are there to stay demographic trends seem to ensure that muslims will become growing segment of german society even without further immigration gi ven the continuing decline in the ethnic german population and the high birth rate s among germanys muslims in addition in order to take care of its aging population germany may need to expand its younger work force substantially which at this point seems possible only through immigration large portion of those wan ting to immigrate to germany are likely to be muslims from developing nations another factor for pressing muslim assimilation is that given the growing secu rity threat of terrorism germany cannothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33166crs38 95 prepared by steven woehrel specialist in european affairs foreign affairs defense and trade divisionafford to have in its midst an incr easingly hostile and lienated population among whom few might be susceptible to terrorist recruitment the muslim riots which broke out in france in october 2005 may have focused greater attention on the problem of muslim integration in germany however germans are quick to stress that the conditions that produced unrest in france do not exist in germany where muslims live among the german population and not in segregated ghettos the german government has taken some enormous stri des to resolve the formal status of muslims in germany through its adoption of the 2000 citizenship law and the immigration law that allows people into the country for the first time based on skills and competence rather than place of origin these bold moves amount to sea change in terms of official german thi nking about the future makeup of german society however germany has made much less progress in trying to eliminate the facto isolation of muslims whether german citizens or not from the rest of german society mindsets may need to be ch anged radically both among ethnic germans and the muslim minority to end the existing divisions efforts and programs until now have generally focused on trying to make germanys muslims more german rather than on making ethnic germans more accepting of multicultural german identity such efforts have not born much fruit to date and it is not clear how far german policymakers are prepared to go to challenge longengrained societal attitudes progress might be easier to achieve if germanys economy starts to grow and unemployment goes down this would rem ove one of the major sources of social tension many economists be lieve that after years of stagnation germanys economic outlook is improving though not dramatically as result of global economic trends and as economic reforms that the previous government instituted begin to take effect spain95 the march 11 2004 terrorist attacks in madr id threw into sharp relief the issue of the integration of muslims into spanish society before the attacks spain had made limited progress in this area due in part to the relative recentness of the immigration in contrast to countries like fr ance as well as spanish social attitudes both historical and contemporary bout immigrants in general and muslims in particular spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero has bolstered resources devoted to fighting islamist terrorism but has put more stress on assimilating muslims into spanish society rather than viewing them as possible security threats during the morning rush hour of march 11 2004 bombs exploded on four trains on madrid commuter rail

socialist party won the elec tion although preelecti on polls taken before the attack gave the thenruling popular party narrow majority prime minister zapatero has been careful to note that he does not see military solution to the problem of terrorism preferring to fo cus on law enforcement cooperation and by pursuing an alliance of civilizations with the muslim world zapatero has also worked to improve bilateral relations w ith morocco in hopes of boosting cooperation with that country in fighting terrorism and stemming the flow of illegal immigration background on muslims in spain the origins of the muslim population in spain go back to the conquest of the region by muslims in the 8th century the seven centuries of muslim rule of spain named alandalus by the conquerors were distinguished by flowering of art architecture and learning as well as degree of religious tolerance that was notable for its time starting in the 11th century christian rulers in northern spain gradually gained control over the entire peninsula capped by the fall of grenada to king ferdinand and queen isabella in 1492 ov er the course of little more than century muslims in spain suffered forced conversions persecution by the spanish inquisition and finally expulsion from their homes many settling in what is now morocco and tunisia these historical memories have colore d contemporary events the reconquista reconquest of spain from the moors has had central importance in spaniards understanding of their history in cont rast at least until recently spaniards have generally not celebrated the achievements of alandalus in contrast to scholars in western countries other than spain public statements by bin laden and other qaeda figures have referred to the reconquist as the tragedy of alandalus the terrorists who committed the march 11 attacks said they had acted in the name of tarik ben ziyad the 8th century conqueror of spain and called themselves the brigade situated in alandalus bin laden and his supporters do not mourn andalus for its tolerance of other faiths but rather as symbol of the powerful muslim empire that it represented at least in its early history96 in the modern period spains muslim popul ation has been very small in the tens of thousands until the 1980s in part this was due to the strongly procatholic nature of the franco dictatorship which ended with francos death in 1975 however perhaps most important was an increasing demand for labor in the post franco period due to rapid economic growth and spains low birth rate immigrants found jobs in such areas as constructi on tourism and agriculture growth in immigration to spain including from muslim north africa has been particularly rapid in the past decade at the same time the population of nort h african muslim states has increased rapidly and the wealth disparity across the mediterranean sea has grown morocco has population of over 30 million and 30 ar under 15 years old

north african coast ceuta and melilla ceuta and melilla are the eus only land border with africa and as such form the southern limit of the eus schengen zone within which persons can move without border controls the exact number of muslims in spain today is unknown in part due to substantial but hardtodoc ument illegal immigration in 2002 the spanish ministry of the interior said that there we re about 600000 legal immigrants from muslim countries in spain of wh ich about 3 70000 were moro ccans98 one of the higher estimates by the federation of spanish islamic entities estimates that there are about 1 million muslims in spain which w ould represent about 24 of total spanish population of 427 million other estima tes of muslims in spain are as low as 700000 muslims are concentrated in dist ricts of madrid and barcelona as well as other cities and towns especially in southern spain islamic terrorists and their active supporte rs represent only tiny fraction of the muslim population in spain in may 2004 spanish authorities estimated their number at about 300 persons99 an advisor to spains interior minister estimated that the total could be as high as 1000100 according to experts who have studied islamic terrorist networks in spain including thos that carried out the 311 attacks most terrorists were firstgeneration immigrants and many but not all had belonged to jihadist groups well before coming to sp ain few were welleducated but most were not and were employed in construc tion small business and other occupations typical of immigrants in spain some had jobs and obtained money through petty theft and other criminal activities in keeping with the profile of persons long dedicated to jihadist causes many we re over 30 years old and were married101 spains efforts to integrate muslims and counter extremism in part due to the rapidity of the growth of the muslim population in spain spain undertook few efforts to integrate mu slims in its society until

march 11 attacks did not lead to major backlash against muslims in spain moreover there have been reports of widespread police abuse of muslims after march 11102 prime minister zapateros government has stressed the need to integrate the muslim population in spain far from rest ricting immigration the government has moved to legalize nearly 700000 illegal immigra nts working in spain including over 85000 moroccans persons who have been in spain for at least six months and have work contract are eligible they will r eceive one year residence and work permits the government defended the new policy saying that it will enhance spains security by bringing these workers out into the open the policy marked break from the policy of the previous popular party g overnment which had moved to crack down on illegal immigrants and presse d the eu to dopt common policy to restrict immigration now in opposition the pp has cr iticized the governments move saying that it has encouraged more people to try to reach spanish territory103 in october 2005 waves of immigrants most fro m subsaharan afri ca stormed border fences around ceuta and mellila resulting in the deaths of 14 immigrants some of them shot dead reportedly by moroccan police the spanish government has worked with spains two major islamic organizations in spain to help integrate muslims in 1992 the federation of spanish islamic entities and the union of islamic communities in spain united as the islamic commission of spain signed an agreement with the spanish government that among other provisions recognized muslim holidays and provides at least in principle for islamic instruction in public schools some observers have pointed out that as the muslim population in spain s expanded particularly rapidly since 1992 the islamic commission represents only portion of registered muslim organizations in the country not to mention those that are not registered part of the problem in fighting islamic extremism in spain is the relatively small number of mosques in the country when co mpared to the rapidly expanding muslim population indeed muslims in spain ve complained about the difficulty of securing permits to build mosques many muslims in spain worship in informal often unmarked prayer rooms expert s estimate that there are hundreds of such garage mosques headed by imams whose professional qualifications and political ideologies are unknown sarhane ben abdelmajid farkhet known as the tunisian key figure in the march 11 attacks led prayers at one of these informal prayer rooms these characteristics

spanish muslim leaders strongly objected to the idea and the governme nt dropped the proposal the government maintains voluntary registry of places of worship and is encouraging muslims to found proper mosques with modera imams with be tter professional qualifications even some established mo sques have had problems with extremism for example large mosque in madrid has been criticized for preaching an intolerant version of islam the imam of the mosque was one of the spiritual teachers of sarhane ben abdelmajid farkhe t although the two had fallingout well before the attacks104 this and other mosques in spain have been funded by foreign countries such as libya and saudi arabia it should be noted that the muslim community in spain is not unified whole althoug h moroccans form the preponderance of the muslim population other countries of origin are represented as are small number of spanish converts to islam however most muslim leaders in spain resent saudi efforts to promote its ultraconservativ wahhabi islam and have urged the government for funds to train spanish born imams claiming 90 of spains muslim population comes from morocco not saudi arabia the head of an association of moroccan immigrants said that we need to teach moderate form of islam that reflects that105 however although it is concerned about the threat from the introduction of ultraconservative forms of islam to spain the government is reluctant to fund mosques itself this reluctance is in part due to the socialist partys goal of promoting greater secularism in spanish institutions the policy is aimed at breaking with longstanding government support for and funding of the catholic church but may affect other religious groups as we ll in october 2004 the spanish government created foundation to help minority religi ons integrate into spanish society with modest initial budget of 35 million106 the foundation among other initiatives may fund spanish language instruction for imams spain has been faced with the challenge of integrating large numbers of muslim and other immigrants into its education system spanish law requires autonomous communities units in spains federal system similar in some ways to us states to take into account the needs of the children of immigrants in their education systems and to promote their social inte gration problems facing muslim and other students of immigrant background include lack of knowledge of spanish and poor education received in thei r former homelands autonomous communities deal with these problems in various ways including

such classes moderate spanish muslims are concerned that if more teachers are not found muslim children will conti nue to receive most of their islamic teachings from the informal unregulated prayer rooms or mosques associated with foreign regimes that support an intolerant form of islam108 under the previous spanish government muslim girl was brie fly forbidden in 2002 to wear headscarf to

in public schools in contrast to france spains security policies due to its decadeslong struggle with bas terrorists spain has substantial body of law and institutional capacity to fight terrorism however after the september 11 2001 nd march 11 2004 attacks analysts criticized spanish authorities for focusing too heavily on the basque threat and not enough on islamist terrorism for example spanish officials have admitted that police threw away wiretapping transcripts on march 11 terrorist suspects because they lacked sufficient numbers of arabic translators more over the march 11 attacks exposed serious coordination problems among spanish law enforcement and intelligence agencies109 the zapatero government has not proposed dramatic changes to spains security policies in part this has been due to the socialists desire to focus on integration of muslims in spain rather than security measures aimed at small minority of the muslim population in addition the socialists and many other spaniards are leery of draconian security polices due to the countrys experience with francos authoritarian rule nevertheless the governme nt has sharply increased resources for antiterrorist agencies spain has 450 interior minist ry officials working fulltime on islamic terrorism issues triple the number before the madrid attacks110 in order to improve coordination it has

monitoring of jihadist activity in spanish prisons which have proved to be recruitment centers for islamic extremists and the dispersal of such prisoners among spanish prisons to prevent them from working together the government has since taken steps to disper jihadists among spanish prisons the commission rejected proposals to loosen c ontrols on police wiretapping of suspects and to permit the cni greater access to public databases112 spains security policies have achieved some successes spanish authorities said that they arrested more than 130 pe rsons associated with islamic terrorism in 2004 half of them suspected of involvement in the 311 attacks in addition to 311 suspects spain is also holding suspects related to the 911 attacks in the united states and in planned attack on
