states committed nearly 1300 troops to the philippines to assist philippine armed forces fp in operations against the abu sayyaf terrorist group in the southern philippines on the island of basilan southwest of mindanao from 2005 into 2007 the us committed up to 450 military personnel to western mindanao and jolo island south of basilan these us noncombat support operations were in response to philippine president arroyos strong support of the united states following the september 11 qaeda attack on the united states historic muslim resistance to nonmuslim rulers in the philippines broke out into massive rebellion in the 1970s two large resistance groups moro national liberation front mnlf and moro islamic li beration front milf fought the philippine government into the 1990s and entered into tenuous truces in 1996 and 2001 respectively abu sayyaf emerged in 1990 as splinter group composed of former mnlf fighters and filipinos who had fought in afghanistan abu sayyaf resorted to terrorist tactics including executions of civilians bombings and increasingly kidnapings for ransom abu sayyaf had links with osamu bin ladens qaeda organization in the early 1990s but these links reportedly dwindled in the late 1990s after the 2002 balikatan operation the remaining abu sayyaf leadership established links with jeemah islamiah ji an qaedaaffiliated group in southeast asia that had begun to use mindanao for training and organizing terrorist strikes abu sayyaf also established links with rajah solaiman radical muslim group made up of filipinos from the northern philippines who had converted to islam together these groups carried out major bombings after 2003 including bombings in metropolitan manila philippine government policy has been to apply military pressure on abu sayyaf operations have been constrained by several factors including difficult terrain inadequate philippine military equipment avoiding clashing with the milf and mnlf and reportedly high level of corruption in the philippine military us military support however did achieve successes afp operations against abu sayyaf became more aggressive and effective against abu sayyaf on basilan in 2002 and on jolo island in 20062007 abu sayyaf strength was seriously eroded to an estimated 200 300 and key commanders have been killed afp commanders praised us equipment us intelligence gathering and us assistance in planning afp operations the us militarys civic action projects on basilan and jolo appeared to weaken support for abu sayyaf on the islands in 2005 us forces began direct support missions for the philippine military in western mindanao against abu sayyaf and us military personnel began joint training exercises with the afp in milf areas of mindanao us officials expressed concern over the presence of ji on mindanao and links among ji abu sayyaf and the milf the bush administration supported the ongoing peace talks between the philippine government and the milf as the best means of eroding the milfji linkage however coordination among abu sayyaf ji and elements of the milf present the threat of wider terrorist war in the philippines and could confront the bush administration with decisions for greater us involvement httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31265g3g139g158g561g21g138g162g162 g138g143g497g561g22g138g155 g144g142g157g561g152g143g561g18g145g146g149g146

effect since 2001 became jeopardized by military clash between force of 50 philippine marines and force of an estimated 400 including milf fighters on basilan island on july 10 2007 basilan is just west of the large philippine southern island of mindanao the marines were ambushed by force that philippine military afp spokesmen described as consisting of milf and abu sayyaf fighters fourteen marines were killed and ten were beheaded the beheadings especially raised the level of tensions the marines entered an milf area on basilan designated under the 2001 ceasefire in search of an italian priest who had been kidnapped in response to intelligence reports that he was being held there milf spokesman stressed that th afp did not notify the milf that the marines would enter the milf area under the ceasefire joint governmentmilf committee on cessation of hostilities is responsible for implementing the truce philippine government officials stated that the milf knew of the marines rescue operations on basilan and that the lack of official notification was not legitimate reason for attacking the marines afp officials asserted that abu sayyaf cadre likely did the beheadings since beheadings are trademark of the organization the milf acknowledged that its forces had participated in the attack on the marines but it denied that milf cadre engaged in beheadings beheadings it said violate islamic law 1 the milf was ambivalent on whether abu sayyaf cadre participated in the ambush the situation escalated when the philippine government demanded that the milf turn over milf cadre involved in the ambush and set deadline of sunday july 22 2007 philippine national security adviser norberto gonzales stated that the government had submitted names to the milf of milf cadre involved in the ambush the milf declared that it would not surrender its cadre the deadline passed and the government and the afp threatened to open major military operations against the milf on basilan and said that the afp would hunt down the ambushers2 the milf countered that its forces on basilan would defend themselves to the death and that an afp offensive on basilan would jeopardize philippine governmentmilf peace talks and that renewed fighting on basilan could spread to mindanao 3 the outcome of this confrontation has potential implications for the us policy of providing military support to the afp for operations against abu sayyaf in the southwest philippines the bush administration has sought to keep its military support role confined to operations against abu sayyaf it has supported the ceasefire and peace talks between the philippine government and the milf however breakdown of the negotiations and the ceasefire likely would confront the bush administration with policy

of december 3 2001 quoted admiral denis blair commanderinchief of the us pacific command that were seeing increasing evidence that there are potential current links between abu sayyaf and osama bin ladens qaeda terrorist organization it is accepted that abu sayyaf received funding and support from qaeda in the early 1990s money came from mohammed jamal khalifa saudi and brotherinlaw of bin laden who operated number of islamic charities in the southern philippines ramzi yoesef an qaeda operative came to the philippines in 1994 he and other qaeda operatives reportedly trained abu sayyaf fighters 14 yoesef established an qaeda cell in manila yoesuf used the cell to plan an assassination of pope john paul ii the planting of bombs aboard 12 us airliners flying trans pacific routes and the crashing of an airplane into the central intelligence agencys headquarters in langley virginia filipino police uncovered the cell in 1995 and provided information on the plot to the cia and fbi yoesef later was arrested in pakistan and extradited to the united states for trial over his complicity in the 1993 bombing of the world trade center 15 filipino officials close to president arroyo contended that the relationship declined after 1995 when the ramzi yoesuf plot was uncovered and khalifa left the philippines and other experts concurred with this assessment they cited the decline in foreign financial support as key reason for abu sayyafs expanded kidnapings for ransom however ties strengthened beginning in 20002001 apparently for several reasons first in the wake of the september 11 2001 terrorist attack on the united states qaeda apparently decided to reconsider abu sayyaf as an ally against the united states second in the late 1990s jeemah islamiah and qaeda cadre began to use milf bases on mindanao for training and planning operations which brought ji into direct contact with abu sayyaf 16 third as stated previously khaddafy janjalani reoriented abu sayyaf towards operations that were more in line with qaedaji operations and thus established stronger basis for cooperation secret afp intelligence report of early 2000 reportedly asserted that abu sayyaf received training arms and other support from qaeda and other middle east terrorist groups17 afp officers subsequently reported that foreign muslims were training abu sayyaf on mindanao to conduct urban

december 2001 for plotting to bomb us and other foreign targets in singapore 25 subsequent reports in 2002 particularly of singapores investigation of jeemah islamiah substantiated that the milf provided key training and other assistance in recent years to members of jeemah islamiah26 jeemah islamiah also was believed responsible for the bombing in bali indonesia in october 2002 one of the

eight milf base commands as sites of active milf cooperation with abu sayyaf and ji he also has identified the milfs special operations group as facilitating joint training and joint operations with abu sayyaf khadaffy janjalani and other abu sayyaf leaders reportedly have received sanctuary in at least one milf base camp28 the july 2007 ambush of the philippine marines on basilan may be another case of cooperation between local milf command and abu sayyaf given the longstanding ties between the two groups on basilan and the reported abu sayyaf attempt to reestablish significant presence on basilan after the setbacks suffered in 2002 as result of the philippine military operations supported by the united states another element in abu sayyafmilf collaborati on reportedly is their relationship with the rajah solaiman movement rsm unlike muslims of the southern philippines the rsm appears to be composed primarily of filipinos from the northern philippines including the manila area it has emerged from the estimated 200000 filipinos who have converted to islam since the 1970s many of these are filipinos who worked in the middle east where they converted the rsms manpower strength is unknown but philippine intelligence reports indicate that it has cells throughout the main island of luzon including metropolitan manila 29 abu sayyaf apparently moved to collaborate with the rsm in order to extend its reach to manila and other parts of the northern philippines manila bombing plot uncovered in march 2005 involved the rsm and abu sayyaf according to ph ilippine intelligence officials the rsm has cooperated with abu sayyaf in several bomb plots including the february 2004 manila ferry bombing the rsm also has received financial support and training from elements within the milf the rsm leader ahmed islam santos underwent training in bombing in the milfs camp bushra on mindanao in december 2001 30 this collaboration also suggests that key milf commanders may not support any agreement between the milf and the philippine government coming out of the postceasefire negotiations that would not include outright independence for the muslim areas of the southern philippines in that scenario the milf could split with hardline elements joining even more closely with ji and abu sayyaf which would maintain high level of terrorist operations

strength on jolo reached 7000 in 2006 afp operations have been limited by several factors one is the mountainous jungle terrain of the two islands pockmarked by underground caves second is the support civilians on jolo and basilan reportedly give abu sayyaf although surveys of muslims on basilan suggested that many are disillusioned by abu sayyafs violence third has been the limited military equipment of the afp including an absence of night vision and other surveillance equipment and shortages of helicopters mortars naval patrol craft surveillance aircraft and even basic necessities like military boots 31 us military aid has made up for some of these shortfalls of equipment in january 2007 major success came when the afp killed abu sayyaf leader abu solaiman and identified the body of khadafi janjalani the top abu sayyaf leader whom the afp apparently killed in battle on jolo in september 2006 32 fourth limitation appears to have been the uneve nness in the quality of the afp the apparent attrition of abu sayyaf strength in 2002 and afterwards reflected afp successes however the fighting on jolo from 2002 through 2005 appears to have been stalemate there also have been reports of corruption within the afp which have produced failed operations the most controversial was the failed encirclement of the abu sayyaf unit holding the burnhams and filipino hostages in church in the town of lamitan in june 2001 several afp units pulled out of their positions without explanation allowing the abu sayyaf unit to break out of the encirclement catholic priest and other witnesses charged that abu sayyaf had bribed afp commanders to pull units from their positions and filipino catholic bishops called for an inquiry 33 philippine senate committee prepared report in august 2002 citing strong circumstantial evidence that afp commanders at lamitan had colluded with abu sayyaf in her book about her captivity gracia burnham described abu sayaf bribery of filipino military officials and abu sayyaf payoffs to afp personnel in return for military supplies 34 fifth limitation was the hostage situations in 2000 european governments reportedly pressured the philippine government to refrain from excessive military operations while abu sayyaf held the european hostages in 2002 there reportedly was similar us pressure regarding the burnhams arroyo administration officials and afp commanders said they were restrained from air bombing and using artillery and mortars out of concern for the safety of the hostages sixth limitation was the afp deployment of most of its forces in the southern philippines in the broader areas of mindanao dominated by the milf and mnlf only small percentage of filipino troops was committed against abu sayyaf final constraint was the danger of afp operations producing large numbers of civilian casualties or displaced civilians the estrada administration came under criticism in 2000 over reports that the afp offensive on jolo caused civilian casualties and displacement among the islands 600000 residents the collaboration of abu sayyaf with the milf and ji also appears to be placing limitations on philippine operations

links with the milf and ji and gain access to milf base camps for training and sanctuary this probably was factor in the ambush of philippine marines on basilan in july 2007 by an apparent combined milfabu sayyaf force the ceasefire has resulted in substantial reduction in violence and armed clashes however the truce apparently has not reduced the movement of ji terrorist personnel and materials between mindanao and the indonesian island of sulawesi under the direction of ji nor has it prevented jis growing collaboration with abu sayyaf negotiations between the philippine government and the milf have been protracted and inconclusive government predictions of an agreement in 2006 were not realized substantial issues and disagreements between the two sides remain to be resolved one is the issue of ancestral domain the size and geographical configuration of an autonomous muslim entity the milf has proposed unified area geographically it is traditionally muslim but includes locales where christians are the majority the government has proposed smaller leopard spot configuration with geographical unity that is more supportive of christian populations and powerful christian political families the milf has rejected government proposal for census and plebiscite in locales to determine whether they would be included in the muslim autonomous entity another issue is the constitutionalpolitical system in an autonomous muslim entity whether an electoral democracy or traditional system led by muslim religious and tribal leaders the issue of elections is particularly important given the history of extensive vote fraud in the muslim areas of mindanao often with the connivance of national filipino political parties and leaders the nature of security forces remain to be resolved including the jurisdiction of the afp and the philippine national police pnp in the muslim entity the milf also seeks agreement on referendum to be held at some point to determine the final political status of the muslim entity such plebiscite could include an option for full independence the future role of the mnlf and other nonmilf groups also is point in dispute between the milf and the mnlf 35 the mnlf still has political influence in parts of muslim mindanao and the sulu islands an autonomous region for muslim mindanao negotiated between the philippine government and the mnlf in 1976 remains in existence although the government of the autonomous region is considered weak and ineffective powerful muslim political families remain independent of the milf and mnlf and have connections with th manila government and filipino political leaders 36 g22g145g142g561g344g342g342g344g561g4g138g149g146g148g138g157g138g151g561g17g153g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g561 beginning

special forces teams could accompany afp companies in the field on basilan island us military officials in the philippines reportedly favored an early implementation of this plan but some bush

andor seem apparent command arrangements were difficult issue in philippineus negotiations over rules of engagement the americans refused to plac us personnel under filipino command but agreed that us personnel would take operatio nal instructions from filipino commanders in the field rumsfeld and other officials however may have had continued doubts about this kind of arrangement relatedly the uneven and sometimes poor quality of afp units may have added to these doubts in midjune 2002 the filipinos and americans finalized arrangements for us special forces in the field us special forces personnel would accompany only selected afp companies that had reached certain specified combat skills and on only closely defined missions moreover this arrangement would end on july 31 2002 the official termination date of the balikatan operation any extension would have to be renegotiated 41 in reality the arrangements were not implemented before the july 31 deadline us policy toward the

reportedly was made by private parties probably through intermediaries that had contacts with abu sayyaf us fbi officials reportedly helped to deliver the money in april 2002 abu sayyaf did not release the burnhams the money reportedly did not go to the abu sayyaf group under abu sabaya which held the hostages instead it went to the jolobased abu sayyaf faction under khaddafy janjalani who reportedly refused to turn it over to abu sabaya43 the bush administration has not disclosed what went wrong with the ransom attempt following the failed ransom attempt us officials reportedly shifted from their prorestraint position and advised the afp to adopt more aggressive tactics to rescue the burnhams the us military provided the afp with intelligence in formation that abu sayyaf moved the burnhams from basilan to the zamboanga peninsula in april 2002 and with key intelligence in the afps assault on the abu sayyaf team holding the hostages on june 7 2002 martin burnham and filipino hostage deborah yap were killed duri ng the fighting gracia burnham was rescued despite these changes in the us military role and in us policies and the less than successful attempt to rescue the burnhams the balikatan exercise appears to have accomplished several us goals philippineus security cooperation was advanced afp commanders viewed the us role in balikatan positively and president arroyo continued to advocate this kind of cooperation most reports indicate that us support enhanced the capabilities of afp units on basilan the period after february 2002 saw more assertive afp patrolling on basilan more encounters with abu sayyaf and an erosion of abu sayyaf strength which apparently led to the abu sayyaf decision to leave basilan with the burnhams in march 2003 philippine officials estimated abu sayyaf strength at about 470 with about 380 on jolo island as stated previously later estimates placed abu sayyaf strength between 200 and 400 fighters filipino officials voiced praise for the modern equipment us forces pr ovided the afp us intelligence information provided by us aircraft and sophisticate d communications and tracking equipment and american assistance in planning operations 44 us equipment and surveillance were important in the afps successful operation later in june 2002 in intercepting abu sabaya and other abu sayyaf leaders at sea in which abu sabaya was killed45 the bush administrations initiative in offering 350 us personnel to conduct civic action projects on basilan reportedly proved popular with the people on the island and probably helped to neutralize public support for abu sayyaf on the island46 the civic action projects road building medical care and welldigging may have influenced less negative reaction of filipino muslims elsewhere to the us military role and the favorable filipino media coverage appears to have helped president arroyo contain the critics of the united states within the manila political elite 43 lerner

key decision for postjuly 31 cooperation was whether to extend the us support and assistance role southward from basilan to jolo pronounced holo and other islands in the sulu group where abu sayyaf continued to operate there was evidence of tough philippineus negotiations on this issue and possible division within the american side president arroyo and secretary of defense angelo reyes voiced support for us assistance role in the sulus47 the continued abu sayyaf bombings in autumn 2002 led the us defense department to give increased attention to jolo an island in the lu chain south of basilan with population of 620000 and 648 square miles of rugged mountains and jungle us officials also cited stronger evidence of connections between abu sayyaf and international terrorist groups planning and discussions with the philippine government were underway by december 2002 in february 2003 pentagon officials described plan under which the united states would commit 350 special operations forces sof to jolo to oper ate with afp army and marine units down to the platoon level of 2030 troops another 400 us s upport troops would be at zamboanga on the mindanao mainland positioned offshore of jolo would be navy task force of 1000 us marines and 1300 navy personnel equipped with cobra attack helicopters and harrier jets 48 according to the pentagon description of the plan us troops would be in combat role this and subsequent statements indicated that the so f on jolo would participate in afp offensive operations against abu sayyaf and that the sof wo uld not be limited to using their weapons for selfdefense the us marines were described as quick reaction force undoubtedly meaning that they could be sent on to jolo to reinforce afp units the cobra helicopters and harrier jets would give afp commanders the option of requesting us air strikes in support of afp operations these rules of engagement went beyond the us role on basilan in 2002 president arroyo and afp commanders reportedly had agreed to the plan in meeting of february 4 200349 the announcement of the plan caused immediate controversy in the philippines filipino politicians and media organs criticized the plan as violating the constitutional prohibition of foreign troops engaging in combat on philippine soil50 filipino muslim leaders warned of muslim backlash on mindanao filipino experts and civic leaders on jolo warned that the people of jolo would not support us combat role partly because of the history of us military involvement on the island during the philippine wars following the us annexation of the philippines in 1898 us forces commanded by generals leonard wood and john j pershing conducted extensive combat operations against muslim forces on jolo inflicting thousands of civilian casualties president arroyo reacted to these criticisms and warnings by asserting that the us role on jolo would be to train and advise under afp jurisdiction but would not involve combat the bush and arroyo administrations decided to put the plan on hold and renegotiate the rules of engagement of us forces 47 vuillanueva mirichu and pareno roel arroyo scolds us general philippine star

implemented another phase of us training and support of the afp the training of afp light infantry companies for use against both muslim insurgents and the communist new peoples army in 2004 the two sides began to negotiate alternative schemes for military cooperation against abu sayyaf the result was two operations that began in 2005 and continue to the present one has focused on abu sayyaf on western mindanao undoubtedly in response to khadafi janjalanis shift of abu sayyaf operations to the mindanao mainland the second focused on jolo but with reduced us military role as compared to the plan of 2003 the total us m ilitary component in the southern philippines involved in the operations is normally about 450 the operations apparently have had three objectives 1 neutralize abu sayyafjeemah islamiah training 2 kill or capture khadafi janjalani and other abu sayyaf leaders and 3 root out the abu sayyaf forces and organization on jolo in similar fashion to the success on basilan in 2002 the us military role in western mindanao reportedly has involved intelligence and communications support of the afp including the employment of us p3 surveillance aircraft deployment of navy seal and special operati ons personnel with afp ground units and rules of engagement restricting us personnel to noncombat role although such rules normally would allow us personnel to defend themselves if attacked 51 us and filipino military personnel also have conducted several military and training exercises in milfdominated areas of mindanao since 2005 us troops landed on jolo in 2005 the number of us troops on the island has ranged between 180 and 250 their mission has been to support 7000 filipino troops ten battalions on the island against abu sayyaf their role is noncombat similar to the us role on basilan in 2002 us military personnel live within philippine military camps and always operate with afp units they can use their weapons only when fired upon 52 us military support on jolo has the following main components training of afp battalions in conducting operations this has emphasized training for night combat as of mid2007 two filipino special forces battalions and one scout ranger battalion were considered fully trained and the remaining philippine army and marine battalions were undergoing training providing equipment to the philippine battalions including communications equipment and night vision goggles providing intelligence technology to the afp assistance to the afp in planning operations providing aerial intelligence reconnaissance to locate abu sayyaf units and personnel in jolos jungles 51 bonner raymond and conde carlos h us and philippines join forces to pursue terrorist leader new york times july 23 2005 p a4 52 james hookway terror

successes for the afp operation on jolo backed by the united states since 2005 but abu sayyaf has not been eliminated abu sayyaf strength on jolo is down to an estimated 200300 it has been pushed back to remote areas on the island senior leaders have been killed including khadafi janjalani and abu solaiman however ji leaders umar patek and dulmatin remain at large security has improved in many parts of the island as the afp has established permanent presence in many of the areas cleared of abu sayyaf new businesses have emerged in the main towns and people venture out at night the incidence of bombings and ambushes has declined the attitude of the people of jolo toward the us military generally has been positive as on basilan in 2002 us conducted and supported civic action projects have been well received by the people 53 g11g150g153g149g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g156g561g152g143g561g23g495g21g495g561g15g146g149g146g157g138g155g162g561g11g151g159g152g149g159g142g150g142g151g157g561 philippineus military cooperation against abu sayyaf has rebuilt philippineus alliance that had weakened considerably after the philippines ended us rights to military bases in the philippines in 1993 during president arroyos state visit to washington in may 2003 the bush administration designated the philippines as major nonnato ally status that could make the philippines eligible to receive more sophisticated us arms and military training us support appears to have increased the effectiveness of the afp in counterinsurgency operations it also appears to have increased the awareness and commitment of afp commanders in the southern philippines to the noncombat components of counterinsurgency strategy 54 the joint operations and exercises appear to have strong support from the filipino populace they served to limit the potential rift between manila and washington in 2004 when president arroyo withdrew the small afp contingent from iraq in response to the taking of filipino contract worker hostage by insurgents in iraq however the enlarged us military role also carries the risk of political backlashes influential filipino nationalist and leftist groups criticized the us military role in basilan even though polls indicated overwhel ming filipino public support for it and the influential catholic bishops conference endorsed it they charged that the us military role violated the philippine constitution and that the united states was plotting to secure permanent military bases again this kind of controversy likely will emerge again if the new us military role in the southern philippines expands into combat role or if the united states becomes involved in new philippinemilf war moreover incidents involving us military personnel and filipino civilians have the potential to turn filipino opinion negative toward the united states at the end of 2005 four us marines stationed on okinawa were charged formally with raping filipino woman while they were in 53 ibid paul

convicted in philippine court the case drew much publicity in the philippines particularly over the application of the 1998 philippine us visiting forces agreement to the case and especially to the issue of who would hold custody of the marines until their trial was held and where the convicted marine would be imprisoned the us military undoubtedly will be influenced by the increasingly complex muslim terrorist and insurgency situation that has developed since 2002 as stated previously abu sayyafs armed strength has dwindled to few hundred the ceas efire between the milf and the philippine government has held however there are other developments of negative nature that could worsen the overall situation in the southern philippines and even the philippines as whole philippine governmentmilf negotiations for political settlement have stalemated continued stalemate could weaken the commitments on both sides to maintain the ceasefire and embolden hard liners who favor renewing armed struggle another negative is the cooperation among abu sayyaf several major milf commands and elements of jeemah islamiah on mindanao ji appears to use mindanao as primary base for building up its cadre of terrorists this cooperation among the three groups appears to be transforming mindanao into significant base of operations rather than just site for training and these operations appear to target the philippines for terrorist attacks rather than just neighboring coun tries the result was the increase in terrorist bombings since 2002 both in number and destructiveness and an increase in the number of bombings and bomb plots in the northern philippines including manila the bush administration has expressed growing concern over milf links with ji and abu sayyaf and jis use of the mindanaosulawesi corridor to move terrorists and bombing materials between the philippines and indonesia in april 2005 the us charge daffaires in manila joseph mussomeli caused an uproar among filipino officials when he stated that parts of muslim mindanao with its poverty lawlessness porous borders and links to ji could development into an afghanistanstyle situation in may 2005 us ambassador francis ricciardone announced the cancellation of usaided road project in cotabato province in southern mindanao describing cotabato as doormat for muslim terrorists 55 these statements indicated us dissatisfaction with the situation on mindanao and doubts about the philippine governments ability to end muslim terrorism the bush administration has considered placing the milf on the us list of terrorist organizations however the arroyo administration has opposed such move as potentially jeopardizing the peace negotiations 56 as of the beginning of 2006 the bush administration has voiced support for the philippinemilf peace negotiations as the best means of delinking the milf from ji and abu sayyaf 57 this support boosts the arroyo administration against the afps advocacy of militarilyaggressive strategy toward the milf nevertheless the new us military role in western mindanao increases the risk of clash involving us military personnel with the milf since january 2006 us military personnel have conducted several training missions for afp personnel in the heart of milf territory the us contingents have carried out civic action projects medical dental

official over the increasing presence of us military forces in the muslim areas of mindanao58 however milf leaders have said they will accept such us role as long as it is peaceful moreover breakdown of the negotiations and the ceasefire likely would confront the bush administration with policy decisions regarding us role in wider war this is the danger posed by incidents like the july 2007 milf ambush of the philippine marines on basilan the afp could be expected to propose increased supplies of us arms and military equipment and it likely would argue for more direct us military role the philippine government might change its previous policy of opposition to us military role against the milf and encourage us actions against the milf at least in role similar to that in the joint operations against abu sayyaf if significant elements of the milf opposed peace agreement and moved closer to ji and abu sayyaf and if they were able to continue or expand terrorist operations the bush administration would be faced with different kind of challenge but one that could include similar pressures for greater us military involvement that too would be the case if peace agreement were not followed by effective measures against ji on mindanao there also would be the challenge of proceeding with implementing projects financed by 260 million in us aid to mindanao since 2001 including 25 million in fy2006 this commitment too could confront the administration with policy decision of whether or not to employ us pressure on the philippine government to implement faithfully its obligations under peace agreement this scenario is plausible given the reputed poor performance of philippine governments in implementing the 1977 and 1996 agreements with the mnlf
