general eric nelson for reasons 14 b and d summary 1 sbu the bavarian christian social union csu dangerously weakened is attempting to sharpen its profile among bavarian and national voters by pursuing an aggressive economic campaign that diverges from that of its sister party chancellor merkels christian democrats the csu is finding plenty of opportunities to profile itself locally and nationally in addressing the challenges presented by the financial crisis for one bavarian minister president seehofer has threatened to boycott the january 5 coalition summit if chancellor merkel does not bend to the csus recipe for responding to germanys economic downturn through tax reform proposal merkel needs strong csu showing in bavaria to achieve her goal of cducsufdp coalition after the 2009 national elections but the csus strategy could build tensions between the sister parties how the cducsu divisions play out could influence national economic policy as well as how the upcoming campaign will shape up in the months to come end summary csu salting the cdus soup 2 sbu the csu still holds chancellor merkel partly responsible for the csus poor outcome in the september 2008 state elections merkel failed to support the csu for example on the tax deductibility of commuting costs one of the csus key issues that the cdu had rejected until the latest ruling by the federal constitutional court that agreed with the position of the csu erwin huber former head of the csu said the cdu should have listened to us instead of finance minister steinbrueck spd on this sensitive issue 3 c karltheodor zu guttenberg secretary general of the csu protect told the consul general on december 17 that the csu is heating up the debate and will meet on january 4 to map out strategy for the 2009 election campaign adding we want to be more like the party was under edmund stoiber and franz josef straus both legendary former minister presidents or as hartmut kotschyk csu party whip in the bundestag put it to the pe chief recently we want to be the salt in their soup 4 c zu guttenberg and koschyk reviewed possible approaches the csu would take with its platform for 2009 taking hard line against eu membership not only for turkey but also for ukraine the csu could lump turkey and ukraine together so neither country could feel singled out for bad treatment the csus new foreign policy spokeswoman in the bundestag dorothee baer told berlin polmc that this would be focus of the csus campaign for european parliament elections in june 2009 b insisting on more eu subsidiarity the csu wants more respect for national and regional and local prerogatives in governance and administrative control such as allowing restrictions on bioengineered seeds c strengthening and refocusing the economy the csu wants renewed commitment to human over financial capital as way to address what koschyk called believability problem among the rank and file germans for the market economy zu guttenberg complained that merkel was not being assertive enough on the economy echoing recent statements by horst seehofer bavarian minister president csu however he also admitted that he could understand her approach since he found her to be personally conservative and not one to be in the front on bold initiatives he expected she was trying to maintain her options in 2009 as well as trying to stay close to the coalition social democratic party spd bavarias president cutting mean figure 5 sbu finally mp seehofer has criticized the cdu in public around bavaria in berlin and in the media which reported that cdu leaders viewed his actions as unpredictable because he made proposals that strayed from munich 00000423 002 of 002 the coalitions party line he criticized the chancellors economic course for example arguing that germany needed larger and more meaningful program than the chancellor had supported seehofer preserved the independence of bavarian control over the bayerische landesbank bayernlb by rejecting the federal rescue package in an attempt to use only bavarian resources and he pushed for immediate tax deductions not just some time after the election comment creating individuality without killing each other 6 c chancellor merkel and the cdu need strong and cooperative bavarian csu partner in order to win the 2009 bundestag election down in bavaria the csu must get stronger too and is fighting for its uniqueness as regional party with national and international credentials although the ultimate goals are compatible the csu necessarily must set itself apart from the cdu to prove itself to skeptical locals who knocked the csu off its high horse in the last election the challenge for both parties is to allow the csu to profile itself without killing the relationship and each others chances with an overly aggressive factional campaign 7 u track munich reporting at xxxxx nelson
