to terrorism that may or may not be triable by military commission military commissions trying enemy belligerents for war crimes directly apply the international law of war without recourse to domes

congressional authority for hamdans trial under the dods rule s for military commissions hamdan he ruled was not an offender triable by milita ry tribunal under the law of war within the meaning of ucmj art 2131 further he found the rules established by dod to be fatally inconsistent with the ucmj contrary to ucmj art 3632 because they give military author ities the power to exclude the accused from hearings and deny him access to evidence presented against him33 the government appealed arguing that the district court should not have interfered in the military commission prior to its completion that hamdan is not entitled to protection from th geneva conventions and that the president has inherent authority to establish military commissions which need not conform to statutes regulating military courtsmartial34 the dc circuit court of appeals rejected the governments argument that the federal courts had jurisdiction to interfere in ongoing commission proceedings but otherwise agreed with the government writing for unanimous cour t judge randolph reversed the lower courts finding ruling that the geneva c onventions are not judicially enforceable35 that even if they were hamdan is not entitled to their protections and that in any event the military commission would qua lify as competent tribunal where hamdan may challenge his nonpow status within the meaning

by us military commissions in china because the writ of habeas corpus was not available to enemy aliens who at relevant time and in stage of their captivity have been within the courts jurisdiction the supreme court in rasul v bush declined to apply eisentrager to deny guantánamo detainees the right to petition for habeas corpus see rasul at 2698 finding authority for federal c ourt jurisdiction in 28 usc 2241 which grants courts the authority to hear applicati ons for habeas corpus within their respective jurisdictions by any person who claims to be held in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states 40 339 us at 789 n14aumf37 read together with ucmj arts 21 and 3638 the court interpreted art 36 to mean that military commission rules have only to be consistent with those articles of the ucmj that refer specifically to military commissions and not that congress meant to incorporate procedural rules fo r courtsmartial into those applicable to military commissions however because the procedural rules to be used by the military commissions did not in its view affect jurisdiction the court found it unnecessary to resolve the issue at the interlocutory stage of the case with respect to the geneva conventions the dc circuit cited to footnote from the world war ii eisentrager39 opinion that expresses doubt that the court could grant relief based direc tly on the 1929 geneva convention we are not holding that these prisoners have right which the military authorities are bound to respect the united states by the geneva convention

argument that the petitioner had rights conferred by the geneva conventions th at could be adjudicated in federal court likewise did not persuade the court to dismiss the cas regardless of whether the geneva conventions provide rights that are enforceable in article iii courts the court f ound that congress by incorporating the law of war into ucmj art 2143 brought the geneva conventions within th

stat 224 2001 49 hamdan slip op at 30common article 3 obviously tolerates great degree of flexibility in trying individuals captured during ar med conflict and that its requirements are general ones crafted to accommodate wide variet of legal systems the court found that the military commissions under mco 1 do not meet these criteria in particular the litary commissions are not r egularly constituted b ecause they deviate too far in the courts view from the rules that apply to courtsmartial without satisfactory explanation of the need for such deviation46 with respect to the authority to create the military commissions the court held that any power to create them must flow from the constitution and must be among those powers granted jointly to the president and congress in time of war47 it disagreed with the governments position that congress had authorized the commissions either when it passed the authorization to use military force aumf48 or the dta although the court assumed that the aumf activated the presidents war powers it did not view the aumf as expanding the presidents powers beyond the authorization set forth in the ucmj the court also noted that the dta while recognizing the existence of military commissions does not specifically authorize them at most these statutes acknowledge general presidential authority to convene military commissions in circumstances where justified under the constitution and ws including the law of war49 in addition to limiting military commissions to trials of offenders and offenses that are by statute or by the law of war consigned to such tribunals the ucmj provides limitations with respect to the procedural rules that may be employed article 36 10 usc 836 authorizes the president to prescribe rules for pretrial trial and posttrial procedures including modes of proof for cases arising under this chapter triable in courts martial military commissions and other military tribunals such rules are to apply the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the united states district courts insofar as the president considers practicable but that may not be contrary to or inconsistent with the ucmj in additi on rules made pursuant to this authority shall be uniform insofar as practicable the president had determined with respect to the military commissions that it is impracticable to apply the rules and principleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31600crs10 50 the government took the position that the contrary to or consistent with language applies only with respect to parts of the ucmj that make specific reference to military commissions 51 the term military tribunal in the ucmj should be interpreted to cover all forms of military courts encompassing courtsmartial as well as military commissions 52 hamdan slip op at 59 53 id at 61 regarding the defendants right to be present during trial the court stated whether or not that departure technically is contrary to or inconsistent with the terms of the ucmj 10 u s c 836a the jettisoni ng of so basic right cannot lightly be excused as practicableof law that govern the trial of criminal cases in the united states district courts but made determination with respect to the practicability of applying rules different from those that apply in courtsmartial50 the court interpreted article 36 to provide the president discretion to determine which federal court rules need not be applied by various military tribunals51 due to their impracticability however the court read the uniformity requirement as according less discretion to the president to determine what is practicable when providing different rules for courtsmartial military commissions and other military tribunals52 unlike the requirement for rules to track closely with federal court rules which the president need follow only insofar as he deems practicable the court reasoned the uniformity requirement applies unless its application is demonstrably impracticable thus less ference was found owing nd the court found that the government had failed to monstrate that circumstances make any courtsmartial rules impracticable for use in military co mmissions further the court found that some of the rules provided in the defense department rules set forth in military commission order 1 mco

of the law of war triable before military tribunal need not be stated with the pr ecision of common w indictment 74 mci 2 618 one of the elements of the crime of terrorism is that the accused did not enjoy combatant immunity or an object of the attack was not military objective another element required that the killing or dest ruction was an attack or part of an attack designed to intimidate or coerce civilian populati on to influence the policy of government by intimidation or coercion or to affect the conduct of government the final version of the mci omits the reference to affecting the conduct of governmentdefined wit hout reference to the statutory definition in title 18 us code72 although the supreme court long ago stated that charges of violations of the law of war tried before military commissions need not be as exact as those brought before regular courts73 it appears that the current c ourt will look more favorably on prosecutions where charges are fully supported by precedent it appears that offenses triable by military commissions in both the mo and mco 1 could cover ordinary belligerent acts carried out by unlawful combatants regardless of whether they are technically war crimes the draft version of mci 2 made explicit that even an attack against military objective that normally would be permitted under the law of armed conflict could serve as the basis for the offense of terrorism if the attack itself constituted an unlawful belligerency that is if the attack was committed by an accused who did not enjoy combatant immunity thus under the earlier draft nguage it appeared that taliban fighter who attacked us or coalition soldier or perhaps even soldier of the northern alliance prior to the arrival of us forces for example could be charged with terrorism and tried by military tribunal74 however the final version of mci no2 substituted the following language the requirement that the conduct be wrongfu l for this crime necessitates that the conduct establishing the offense not constitute an attack against lawful military objective undertaken by military forces of state in the exercise of their official duties the change appears to have eliminated the possibility that taliban fighters could be charged with terrorism in connection with combat activities however under the dod rules such fighter could still be charged with murder or

continuedproperty by an unprivileged belligerent75 for participating in combat as long as the commission finds that the accused did not enjoy combatant immunity which according the to the instruction is enjoyed only by lawful combatants76 lawful combatant is not further defi ned inasmuch as the president had declared that all of the detainees incarcerated at guantánamo bay whether members of the taliban or members of qaeda are unlawful combatants it appears unlikely that the defense of combat immunity would be available77 it is unclear whet her other defenses such as selfdefense or duress

precedent or explicit statutory definition common element among the crimes enumer ated in mci no2 is that the conduct took place in the context of and wa s associated with armed conflict the instruction explains that the phrase requires nexus between the conduct and armed hostilities82 which has traditionally been necessary element of any war crime however the definition of armed hostilities is broader than the customary definition of war or armed conflict armed hostilities need not be declared war or ongoing mutual hostilities83 instead any hostile act or attempted hostile act might have sufficient nexus if its severity rises to the level of an armed attack or if it is intended to contribute to such acts some commentators have argued that the expansion of armed c onflict beyond its custom ary bounds improperly expands the jurisdiction of military commissions beyond those that by statute or under the law of war are triable by military commissions84 the supreme

of the listed crimes are new for example plurality of the supreme court in hamdan agreed that conspiracy is not war crime under the traditional law of war183 the crime of murder in viol ation of the law of war which punishes persons who as unprivileged be lligerents commit hostile acts that result in the death of any persons including lawf ul combatants may also be new while it appears to be wellestablished that civilian who kills lawful combatant is triable for murder and cannot invoke the defense of combatant immunity it is not clear that the same principle applies in armed conflicts of non international nature where combatant immunity does not apply the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia icty has found th at war crimes in the context of non international armed conflict include murder of civilians but that the killing of combatant is not war crime184 evidentiary rules all of the bills provide for the admission of evidence under rules that are more permissive than the military rules of evidence httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31600crs35 hearsay s 3901 would provide for the admission of hearsay evidence that would not be permitted under the manual for courtsmartial the hearsay evidence is admissible only if the proponent of the evidence notifies the adverse party sufficiently in advance of the intention to offer the evidence as well as the particulars of the evidence including information on the general circumstances under which the evidence was obtained and the military judge finds that the totality of the circumstances render the evidence more probative on the point for which it is offered than other evidence which the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts taking into considera tion the unique circumstances of the conduct of military and intelligence operations during hostilities s 3901 pr oposed 10 usc 949ab3 s 3930 eliminates th latter considerati on but provides that the evidence is inadmissible if the part opposing its admission clearly demonstrates that the evidence is unreliable or lacking in probative value hr 6054 s 3886 and s 3861 are similar to s 3930 providing that hearsay evidence is admissible unless the military judge finds that the circumstances render the evidence unreliable or lacking in proba tive value however such evidence may be admitted only if the proponent of the evidence makes the evidence known to the adverse party in advance of trial or hearing the lang uage does not indicate whether the any information about the source of the evidence must be provided coerced testimony all five bills prohibit the use of statements obtained through torture as evidence in trial ex cept as proof of torture against person accused of committing torture s 3901 also provides for the exclusion of statements elicited through cruel i nhuman or degrading treatment and the exclusion of statements elicited through co ercive methods not rising to the level of cruel inhuman or degrading treatment as defined in the detainee treatment act dta only if the military judge finds that the totality of circumstances render it reliable and probative and the interests of justice would best be served by allowing the commission members to hear the evidence s 3930 provides different standard for the admissib ility of statements obtained through coercion that does not amount to to rture depending on wh ether the statement was obtained prior to or after the enactment of the dta statements elicited through such methods prior to the dta would be admissible if the military judge finds the totality of circumstances under which the statement was made re nders it reliable and possessing sufficient probative value and t he interests of justice would best be served by admission of the statement statements taken after passage of the dta would be admissible if in addition to th two criteria above the military judge finds that the interrogation methods used to obt ain the statement do not violate the cruel unusual or inhumane treatment or punishme nt prohibited by the fifth eighth and fourteenth amendments to the us constitution hr 6054 s 3881 and s 3861 provide that an otherwise admissible statement including statement allegedl obtained by coercion shall not be admitted in evidence in military commission under this chapter if the military judge finds that the circumstances

courtmartial the deletion of specified items of classified information from documents made available to the accused the substitution of portion or summary of the information or the substitution of

exclusion of the accuse d only for disruptive behavior s 3930 retains these provisions and so includes new subsection to provide for the use of classified evidence at trial to replace the provisions for classified information under proposed 949c in s 3901 under the procedures outlined the government would be permitted to claim privilege with respect to information if the head of an executive or military department or agency asserts the information is properly classi fied and disclosure would be detrimental to the national security without requiring certification th at such information had been declassified to the maximum extent possible when the government claims such privilege the military judge may authorize to the extent practicable the deletion of specified items of classified

his trial in order to allow classi fied information to be presented to panel members but not disclosed to the accuse d under these bills the military judge would have authority to prevent the accused from attending portion of the trial only after specifically finding that the exclusion of the accuse d is necessary to prevent identifiable damage to the national security including by disclosing intelligence or law enforcement sources methods or ac tivities or is necessary to ensure the physical safety of individuals or is necessary to prevent disruption of the proceedings by the accused and that the exclusion of the accused is broader than necessary and will not deprive the accused of full and fair trial proposed 10 usc 949de discovery and mandatory provisi on of exculpatory information each of the bills provides that defense counsel is to be afforded reasonable opportunity to obtain witnesses and other evidence including evidence in the possession of the united states as specified

with rules prescribed by the s ecretary of defense to redact classified information or to provide an unclassified summary or statement describing the evidence proposed 10 usc 949j under hr 6054 s 3861 and s 3886 the tria l counsel is obligated to disclose exculpatory evidence of which he is aware to the defense but such information if classified is available to the accused only in redacted or summary form and only if making the information available is possible without compromising intelligence sources methods or activities or other national security interests classified information is to be provided to military defense counsel but civilian counsel is to have access only if he or she has the appr opriate security clearance and such access is consistent with any procedures the secretary of defense implements for the protection of classified info rmation defense counsel woul d not be able to share such information with the accused which many observers assert could impair the defenses ability to refute any such evidence s 3901 requires trial counsel to make available to the defense not only exculpatory information but also any that would tend to reduce the degree of guilt of the accused it further provides that the military judge may authorize substitutions for classified information pursuant to rules similar to the rules that apply in courtsmartial to the extent practicable
