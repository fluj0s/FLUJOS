session senate treaty document 10549 hearings have not been held according to the state department the preamble to this treaty makes clear that the convention is intended to address the problem of transnational trafficking in firearms and is not meant to regulate the internal firearms trade of the states parties the preamble expressly recognizes for example that the convention does not commit states parties to enact legislation or regulations pertaining to firearms ownership possession or trade of wholly domestic character 6 arms control and disarmament conflict control second venue for united nations discussion of firearms and guns as early as 1994 was provided by the disarmament commission which set up special panel of governmental experts on small arms the general assembly in december 1998 decided to convene the united nations conference on the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects which was held in new york july 9 to 20 2001 this conference produced program of action to prevent combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects but not treaty on july 9 2001 then us under secretary of state for arms control and international security affairs john r bolton in statement to the conference noted that small arms and light weapons in our understanding are the strictly military arms automatic rifles machine guns shoulderfired missile and rocket systems light mortars that are contributing to continued violence and suffering in regions of conflict around the world we separate these military arms from firearms such as hunting rifles and pistols which are commonly owned and used by citizens in many countries as us attorney general john ashcroft has said just as the first and 6 105th congress 2d session senate treaty doc 10549 p v crs5 fourth amendments secure individual rights of speech and security respectively the second amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms the united states believes that the responsible use of firearms is legitimate aspect of national life like many countries the united states has cultural tradition of hunting and sport shooting we therefore do not begin with the presumption that all small arms and light weapons are the same or that they are all problematic it is the illicit trade in military small arms and light weapons that we are gathered here to address and that should properly concern us7 under way in early 2005 are negotiations by an openended working group on tracing illicit small arms and light weapons aimed at draft international instrument treaty for the timely and reliable identification and tracing of illicit small arms and light weapons the second meeting was held january 24 to february 4 2005 with third

finally review conference for the 2001 program of action is scheduled for 20069 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22108 in related development the security council has also discussed the issue of small arms and light weapons the proliferation of which contributes to and exacerbates conflict hinders economic and social development fuels crime and terrorism and contributes to the continued destabilization of wartorn societies10 in its latest statement the council recognized that the dissemination of illicit small arms and light weapons has hampered the peaceful settlement of disputes fuelled such disputes into armed conflicts and contributed to the prolongation of such armed conflicts the council encouraged international and regional cooperation in identifying the origin and transfer of small arms and light weapons in order to prevent their diversion in particular to qaeda and other terrorist groups it welcomed the ongoing efforts by the open ended working groupto negotiate an international instrument to enable states to identify and trace in timely and reliable manner illicit small arms and light weapons the council also called on all member states to enforce all security council resolutions on sanctions including those imposing arms embargoesand to bring their own domestic implementation into compliance with the councils measures on sanctions11 7 statement to the

resolutions and firearms protocol these efforts have focused on the availability of firearms manufactured and obtained illegally and on the use or misuse of these firearms in the criminal arena including for organized crime andor to facilitate the spread of or prolongation of conflict during meetings and negotiations in bodies us representatives have focused on the need to combat organized crime and to reduce outofcontrol violence and conflict by limiting the availability of firearms light weapons and small arms that contribute to and aggravate these situations they have made it clear that the reduction of crime and conflict is primary goal of the united states they have supported us second amendment rights of citizens to firearms as the experience with the oas convention and the protocol illustrates any international treaties in this area would not bind the united states unless these documents were acted on favorably by the us senate if the president decided to transmit the treaty to the senate for its consideration httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22108
