from edward cook drdendroldeocolumbiaedu to art johnson ahjsasupennedu subject re seminar date sat 17 jan 2004 075524 0500 cc druidldeocolumbiaedu druidrdldeocolumbiaedu kbriffaueaacuk xflowed hi art sorry for the lack of response to your emails been over the top as usual on things i go off to tasmania and new zealand on jan 20 and return on feb 15 bhutan was bit strange this time i was sick most of the time but we did get some useful stuff done nonetheless hi ed i hope your trip to bhutan went well we did ok in chile but encountered some glitches i am emailing about three things to see if you are interested 1 what does gordon know about the big white spruce in the mackenzie r basin of the northern nwt i am going to be in alberta this summer and it is one plane ride and few hundred from those big spruce if i can get the cores are you interested in collaborating on their measurement and analysis if i can track down the person that told us that some of the trees were 600 old we might be able to find some of them there are many spruce pilings in town that were probably cut in the 50s70s and some of those might have been pretty old trees given their size what is the availability of climate data inuvik probably has records back into the 50s when they rebuilt the town dick jagels is interested in those trees too as we are led to believe that they need 24 hr photoperiods when they are seedlings could this be race of trees that respond to differences in growingseason sunlight i am ccing this email to gordon and rosanne i think that they would be interested in what you describe they also know what climate data are available i recall that aklavik has older record that was discontinued few years back it may be possible to merge aklavik with inuvik temperature records to cover most of the 20th century 2 the forest service has an rfp out for projects in the northern forest i think this is defined as mostly vermont and new hampshire since it is senatefunded program sponsored by senators from those states the threat their term of global warming to forest health is one of the themes that chris eagar is in charge of we have been working with vermont northern hardwood data collected by post and curtis in the 1950s and redone by us in the early 90s there is very nice multiple regression model that shows clearly that temperature altitudelatitude and soil moisture are very good predictors of site index height at 75 yrs eg productivity potential nutrients do not explain any additional variance this model would suggest that warming would improve productivity not decrease it i am wondering if dendroclimatological analysis of maple beech and ash and yellow birch would show response of growth to summer temperatures i think we have all the cores from our 1990 study and it would be an easy matter to get more i stll owe the forest service couple of papers from the 9091 work which they funded but i am actually working on them now and could have them done by the march 30 deadline for the full proposal if not for the feb 13 preproposal deadline im sure i could talk to chris to see if our ideas are viable and if we would be penalized for not publishing the vermont stuff in timely manner this sounds interesting are you measuring up all of the tree cores i wouldnt have the resources to do that without some technician support but i could participate in some dendroclimatic analyses of the data with you 3 we are running cellulose reasonably well at this time and are still interested in seeing if cellulose is useful in determining whether the temperature signal in mideval wood is similar to that of the past century and if there is an isotopic signature in the little ice age wood that indicates it was cold what do you think about the availability of wood samples from dated rings from those periods is any of the esper wood available when we talked after your seminar it seemed to that the scandanavian wood collection might be useful i did ask keith briffa about this stuff he is tied in closely with much of the work that has been done in fennoscandia and even over to the polar urals he also said that there has been some isotopic work done on wood but he wasnt sure about results i suggest that you contact keith directly kbriffaueaacuk and maybe he can direct you to sources of wood for your proposed study it is interesting if bit chancy in my estimation cheers ed what do you think art original message from edward cook mailtodrdendroldeocolumbiaedu sent saturday october 11 2003 228 pm to art johnson subject re seminar hi art i will be driving down to your digs on friday oct 17 to give the seminar i promised when is it scheduled so i know how early i definitely have to leave i need directions to get there as well as i have never been to penn before also it would be useful to have place to stay friday night i suppose my wife is off to ct to celebrate 50th birthday with friend that weekend so there is point in zipping back in any case cheers ed dr edward r cook doherty senior scholar and director treering laboratory lamontdoherty earth observatory palisades new york 10964 usa email drdendroldeocolumbiaedu phone 8453658618
