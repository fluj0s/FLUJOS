legislative attorney american law divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33159influenza antiviral drugs and patent law issues summary the potential for worldwide influenz pandemic caused by bird flu has generated public interest in the availability and affordability of influenza antiviral medications such as the prescription drug tamiflu the possibility of pandemic flu outbreak has contributed to surge in or ders for tamiflu as countries attempt to stockpile sufficient countermeasures in 2005 there was considerable concern that the owner of the exclusive right to manufacture the patented drug the swiss pharmaceutical company roche inc lack ed the production capacity to meet the needs of these governments worldwide in response to the heightened demand for the drug as well as faced with threatened abrogation of its patent rights by us politicians and government officials in ot her countries roche significantly boosted tamiflu production in 2006 and 2007 by vol untarily signing licensing agreements with 19 external contractors in 9 different countries to manufacture the drug this expansion in manufacturing capacity has in creased production of the drug to over 400 million treatments annually an amount that according to the company is sufficient to fulfill its existing orde rs as of april 2007 for tamiflu from governments and corporations in ddition roche has donated rapid response supplies of tamiflu more than 5 million tr eatment courses to the world health organization for establishing regional stockp iles to help contain or slow the spread of pandemic finally roche has agreed to arrange for special pricing for government orders and to reduce the pri ce of tamiflu for low income countries this report examines the role that intellectual property rights play in affecting the availability of patented drug such as tamiflu during public health crises the report also explains one legal mechanism for increasing patented drugs production without the patent holders consent g overnments may abrogate pharmaceutical companys patent rights by issuing compulsory licenses to other drug companies to manufacture generic versions of the drug such option is available to countries under the traderelated aspects of intellectua l property trips agreement component of the treaties that created the world trade organization wto in 1995 the us governments authority to declare compulso ry licenses is section 1498a of title 28 of the us code other legal avenues to increase the supply of and lower the price for patented drug include voluntary licen sing agreements between the drugs patent holder and other companies for manufacturing or distributing the drug in the case of tamiflu and the avian influenza antiv iral drug supply roches willingness to sublicense its patent rights to several manufacturing partners has helped to lessen the concern over intellectual prope rty rights hindering effort s to prepare for and respond to an influenza

by the swiss pharmaceutical company roche inc tamiflu is not vaccine but is perhaps the most efficient antiviral treatment for influenza16 the drug eases flu symptoms by preventing the influenza virus from spreading inside the human body some re search studies have shown that tamiflu is effective against the h5n1 avian and human virus strains17 however it is unknown how well tamiflu would work to control pandemic18 also the drug must be ingested within 48 hours of the onset of flu symptoms for maximum efficacy19 this requirement raises cerns about the utility of tamiflu because it is often difficult for patients to realize within such short amount of time whether their symptoms are caused by the flu or the common cold20 in addition because tamiflu has shelf life of five years21 pandemic may not strike during that time period raising the possibility that stoc kpiles of the medicine may go unused and become useless prior to 2006 roche was the exclus ive manufacturer of tamiflu and

the raw materials have been sourced23 in november 2005 the world health organization estimated that at roches thenpresent manufacturing capacity it will take decade to produce enough oseltamivir tamiflu to treat 20 of the worlds population24 the tamiflu production shortage in 2005 prompted both international and domestic pressures on roche to ease its pa tent monopoly and per mit other companies to manufacture generic versions of the drug25 it was believed that such action would help to increase supplies of the flu treatment to meet the backlog of orders as well as make the drug more affordable howe ver one of the challenges of producing large quantities of tamiflu is obtaining nough supplies of its key active ingredient shikimic acid this acid may be extracted from the pods of chinese cooking spice called star anise26 yet there may not be enough star anise in china or elsewhere to produce tamiflu on massive scale27 to address this shortage roche began experimenting with fermentation process using genetically altered coli bacteria to make the shikimic acid28 roche has since declared that the fermentation process is more effective in producing the acid than processing star anise and that the majority of shikimic acid is now derived from this process29 counterfeit tamiflu counterfeit drugs pose public health and safety concerns because they may closely resemble

business proposition would be willing to pay as royalty and yet be able to make use or sell the patented article in the market at reasonable profit78 the pharmaceutical industry warns that imposing compulsory licenses on avian flu drugs pursuant to 1498a would tak away incentives for other companies to undertake the difficult and costly work of searching for new antivirals and vaccines for this possible health crisis79 because drug products are timeconsuming and expensive to develop but relatively eas to copy the pharmaceutical industry is particularly depende nt upon the patent system pponents of compulsory licensing argue that patent protection permits drug companies to benefit from their investment in research and development and encourages them to continue to engage in such efforts some observers assert that breaking the patent through compulsory license would actively discourage roche fro m either producing the drug or lending its expertise which would be directly counterproductive80 at congressional hearing on november 4 2005 us depar tment of health and human services secretary michael leavitt stated that he did not intend to issue compulsory license for tamiflu because he was concerned that violating the patent would remove incentives for fu ture drug research and development81 i n another congressional hearing several days later secretary leavitt stated that compulsory license would probably not be needed in light of roches clear intent not to let intellectual property issues to become barrier to generic manufacturing of tamiflu and roches

health emergencies wto members with insufficient or manufacturing capacitie s in the pharmaceutical sector may be unable to make effective use of compul sory licensing under the trips agreement89 the wtos proposed solution to this problem was announced on august 30 2003 when the wto general council issued decision that allows member states meeting certain strict conditions to impor t generic versions of drugs produced under compulsory licenses issued by other count ries specifically this paragraph 6 agreement permits waiv er of article 31f of the trips agreement which specifies that compulsory li censes are to be used predominantly for the supply of the domestic market90 thus countries that produce generic drugs under compulsory license may export them to other wto members that are unable to manufacture the medicine to meet their urgent needs as many nations attempt to stockpile antiviral drugs to prepare for the possible bird flu pandemic the trips nationa l emergency provision for compulsory licenses has garnered public interest as possible way to increase the production and supply of tamiflu91 however at the time of the paragraph 6 agreement the united states and 22 other developed countries decided to opt out of using the compulsory license system as importers under any and all circumstances92 some observers have speculated that the reason for this decision is to discourage compulsory licensing and put pressure on developing countries not to use it93 an official in the office of the us trade representative has explained however in the negotiations

agreements are contracts between the patent owner or patent licensee and third parties that may be used to permit third parties to exercise one of the rights of the patent owner or patent licensee in the case of patent licensee the contract is known as subli censing agreement for ex ample roche licensee of the patent owner gilead may permit other companies to manufacture and market tamiflu in exchange for the companies paying licensing fees to roche and agreeing to certain conditions such conditions in the sublicensing agreement may restrict the sale of tamiflu to emergency government st ockpiles prevent reexports of the drug and timelimit the sublicense101 an advantage of sublicensing scheme is that the other pharmaceutical companies can seek and obtain roches manufacturing expertise to ensure quality production102 in addition sublicensing allows for coordination of obtaining the active ingredient in the antiviral drug shikimic acid103 however some critics have asserted that these voluntary sublicensing agreementsmight only help rich countries to stoc kpile tamiflu and do little to improve the treatments availability for poorer countries 104 they maintain that under such agreements roche would likely still retain the right to control pricing and could reap large profits on generic tamiflu as of april 2007 roche has signed sublicensing agreements with 19 contractors to manufacture tamiflu in nine di fferent countries around the world105 in addition roche has donated rapid response supp lies of tamiflu more than 5 million treatment courses to the world health organization for establishing regional stockpiles to help contain or slow the spread of pandemic finally roche has agreed to arrange for special pricing for government orders and to reduce the price of tamiflu for low income countries106 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33159crs17 conclusion should the h5n1 virus or some othe r avian influenza strain cause human pandemic antiviral drugs will likely play cr itical role to help prevent infection and to relieve the flu symptoms of those inf ected the tamiflu supply shortage in 2005 had sparked public debate concerning the practicality and morality of protecting intellectual property rights during possible health crisis which can directly affect the availability and affordab ility of medicine for populati ons in dire need of it however because roche has since reached sublicensing agreements with several manufacturing partners that have signif icantly increased production of tamiflu to satisfy global demand for the drug the c oncern about intellectual property rights hindering preparations for pandemic influenza has largely subsided
