contain various fillers to include explosive chemical biological or hazardous materials improvised explosive devices may range in size from cigarette pack or carton to large vehicle the only limitations an enemy bomber faces are availability of resources personal ingenuity and the degree or extent of know how required to facilitate construction and in some cases application of an improvised explosive device improvised explosive devices arenonstandard andusually fabricated from common materials the mass quantities of cached captured enemy ammunition cea andstockpiled munitions within the iraq and afghanistan theaters of operation provide the explosive materials towould be enemy bombers general mitigation measures in relation to the ied threat 1trust your instincts if something does not seem right it probably isnt be aware of your surroundings situational awareness 2watch the locals in your area of operation are the familiar locals in the area are people moving away from you or your element acting or appearing nervous most bombers dont blow up their own neighborhoods 3be aware of news crews in the area for apparent reason most bombers like their work filmed but do not like pictures of themselves 4before each and every convoy or patrol brief your personnel on thelatest ied threat intelligence brief your personnel each and every time ascertain what types
