scan eagle issue resolved issues with the china lake cohost unabl to retrieve post imagerysee comments imagery products products collected five scan eagle imagery products posted to csd additional comments cohost the problem was that the ja ric and digo were unable to retrieve and post imagery to the china lake cohost after discussions with steve etheridge jaric cohost support engineer we came to the conclusion that somehow the china lake cohost became somehow corrupted offline or something to that effect steve remotely logged into the china lake cohost and rebooted it and at that point we were able to retrieve imagery however could not look at the thumbnails and unable to fully look at the imagery steve successfully loaded an image and we both were able to look at the thumbnail and download the imagery successfully therefore the global hawk imagery somehow became corrupted while being played back into the cohost refimagery collected on 23 july posted on 29 july not sure how will relook at it again tomorrow canadian army task force victory location ecr pocs major keith laughton personnel 45 personnel with issues to report activities summary of planned activities all sensors
