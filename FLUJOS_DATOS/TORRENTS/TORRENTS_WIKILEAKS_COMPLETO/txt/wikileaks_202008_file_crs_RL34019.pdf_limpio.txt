of removing the fruit and vegetable planting restrictions these studies indicate that lifting the planting restriction could have an economic eﬀect on certain crops within certain producing areas however diﬀerences in approach and scope eg regional versus national plantings of permanent perennial crops versus easily rotated annual crops complicate direct comparison across all ﬁve studies and make it diﬃcult to generalize about the possible economic eﬀects of lifting the planting restriction only two of the studies provide estimates of revenue losses to existing fruit and vegetable growers ranging from about 17 billion to 40 billion in the ﬁrst year of lifting the current restriction the other three studies do not make quantitative estimates of the impacts but indicate that adverse eﬀects of removing the restriction likely would be small relative to the overall industry although there could be larger impacts on individual producers commodities and

in agricultural policy resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34019eliminating the planting restrictions on fruit and vegetables in the farm commodity programs summary owners of cropland with history of growing program crops receive federal subsidy payments without regard to what crops are currently being produced on these base acres in other words these direct payments are decoupled from crop planting decisions while the direct payments program is characterized as giving producers the flexibility to make planting choices ba sed on actual market conditions instead of subsidy rules there are restrictions there is prohibition on planting fruits vegetables and wild rice on program crop base acres this planting restrictions policy is now under challenge as congress debates 2007 farm bill the purpose of the fruit and vegetable plan ting restriction is to protect growers of unsubsidized fruits and vegetables from competing production on subsidized cropland as reasonable as this justifica tion may appear there have been problems with the policy first producers primarily of processing vegetables canned and frozen in the midwest sharply curtaile d production after soybeans became program crop in the 2002 farm bill second in hi ghprofile case by brazil against the us cotton program the world trade organization wto determined that the prohibition on planting fruits and vegetables was not consistent with the rules required of minimally distorting subsidy this determination jeopardizes the green box classification of direct payments for all program crops largely to meet wto obligations the administration proposes that the 2007 farm bill eliminate the fruit and vegetable planting restriction companion bills have been introduced in the house and senate that would allow any producer to use base acres to gr ow fruits and vegetables for canning and freezing as long as they give up progra m payments on those acres for one year but without additi onal penalties farming flexibility act of 2007 hr 1371 baldwin and s 1188 lugar this partia l approach likely would not satisfy wto concerns other options include retainin g the status quo eliminating the restrictions entirely or eliminating the underlying direct payment most fresh fruit and vegetable growers oppose eliminating the restriction without some type of compensation this report summarizes and examines fi ve academic and industry studies on the economic effects of removing the fruit and vegetable planting restrictions these studies indicate that lifting the planting rest riction could have an economic effect on certain crops within certain producing areas however differences in approach and scope eg regional versus national plantings of perman ent perennial crops versus easily rotated annual crops complicate di rect comparison across all five studies and make it difficult to gene ralize about the possible econo mic effects of lifting the planting restriction only two of the st udies provide estimates of revenue losses to existing fruit and vegetable growers ra nging from about 17 billion to 40 billion in the first year of lifting the current rest riction

restrictions on fruits and vegetables in the farm commodity programs the issue of restricting plantings of fruits vegetables and wild rice on base acres in the farm commodity programs is topic of debate in the 2007 farm b ill following brief background discussion of the legislative history and policy options for dealing with the planting restrictions on fruits vegetables and wild rice this report provides sidebyside comparison of five acade mic and industry studies on the effects of removing these restrictions the five studies reviewed in this report include analyses by 1 the us depar tment of agricultures usdas economic research service 2 michigan state univ ersity 3 arizona state university 4 texas am university and 5 inform economics private consulting group for the purposes of this discussion program crops or crops grown on base acres refers to commodities that receive direct payments authorized in title i of the 2002 farm bill those eligible for direct and countercyclical payments these commodities include corn and other feed grains soybeans and other oilseeds wheat cotton rice and peanuts also the phrase s pecialty crops is used to mean fruits vegetables and wild rice background restrictions on planting fruits vegetables and wild rice are constraint within broader policy that allows planting flexibility on program crop base acreage planting flexibility allows program crop fa rmers to respond to market signals when making planting decisions rather than be ing required to grow particular crop to receive subsidies the purpose of the targeted restriction is to protect growers of unsubsidized fruits and vegetables from competing production on subsidized land as reasonable as this justification may ppear there have been problems with the policy see below planting flexibility is viewed positively from an economic theory and world trade agreement perspective because it helps separate production decisions from government subsidies and makes dec oupled subsidies minimally distorting to commodity markets restrictions on pl anting fruits and vegetables are viewed positively by fresh fruit and vegetable growers mostly negatively by growers of processing fruits and vegetabl and negatively in the context of world trade rules officials are concerned that continua tion of planting restrictions could undermine the us position at the world tr ade organization wto that the annual direct payments of roughly 5 billion are minimally tradedistorting green box the united states wants direct payments to qualify as green box expenditure whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34019crs2 1 for background on these payments see crs report rl21999 farm commodity policy programs and issues for congress and crs report rl33271 farm commodity programs direct payments countercyclic payments and marketing loans is not subject to the annual wto cap of 191 billion for amber box subsidy payments legislative history planting flex ibility was first initiated in the 1990 farm bill which designated 25 of base acres as flex acres meanin g producers could grow certain crops other than the base crops on those acres pl 101624 sec 1101 the 1990 farm bill also created the restriction on planting fruits and vegetables on program crop base acreage the 1996 farm bill expanded planting flexibility to all of farms base acres 7 usc 7218 pl 104127 sec 118 and the 2002 farm bill continued this policy 7 usc 7916 pl 107171 sec 1106 specifically planting flexibility refers to the ability to r eceive direct and countercyclical payments1 for base crop such as corn and simultaneously grow different program crop on those ba acres such as soybeans but not fruits and vegetables farmers who vi olate the planting restricti on on fruits and vegetables do not receive direct and counte rcyclical payments on acres in violation and they must pay an additional fi nancial penalty based on the market value of the fruits and vegetables planted 7 cfr 1412601 excep tions in statute allow certain farmers with history of planting fruits and vegeta bles to continue to plant such crops by giving up subsidies on base acres that are planted to fruits and vegetables but without additional pena lties 7 usc 7916c the specific fruits vegetables and wild rice that are included in the restri ction are itemized in 7 cfr 1412407h policy issues two policy issues have arisen about planting flexibility and the related restrictions on planting fruits and vegetables first some midwestern producers who grew primarily vegetabl for processing canned and frozen have reduced their plantings since soybeans became program crop in 2002 prior to 2002 these producer s sometimes grew fruits and vegetables instead of soybeans in crop rotations with corn landowners typically now stipulate that fruits and vegetables can be grown on base acres either to maximize soybean planting history in case base acres are ev er again updated or to receive the soybean direct payments processors for canning and freezing have re ported short supplies and difficulty contracting new growers co mpanion bills have been introduced in the house and senate of the 110th congress that would allow any producer to use base acres to grow fruits and vegetables for canni ng and freezing as long as they give up program payments on those acres for one year but without additional penalties farming flexibility act of 2007 hr 1371 baldwin and s 1188 lugar similar bills were introduced in the 108th and 109th congresseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34019crs3 2 this case and its implications are described in crs report rl22187 us agricultural policy response to wto cotton decision and crs report rl33697 potential challenges to us farm subsidies in the wto second in highprofile case brought to the wto by brazil against the united states regarding its cotton program settlement pane l found that the current restriction on planting specialty crops makes direct payments ineligible for treatment as nondistorting green box subsidy paym ent for international trade purposes if this finding is enforced it could affect the united states ability to meet wto subsidy payment limit commitments during years when other farm commodity payments are high2 the administration proposes that th 2007 farm bill eliminate the fruit and vegetable planting restriction largely to meet wto obligations while hr 1371s 1188 could satisfy processors and growers of fruits and vegetables for processing it likely would not go far enough to satisfy the wto rules since it would only relax the restriction for processing and not for fresh fruits and vegetables if the restriction is lifted fruit and vegetable growers may seek some type of compensation in return possibly in the fo rm of direct payments but more likely through support for research trade promo tion and use of fruits and vegetables in nutrition programs possible policy options for congress several policy options exist for handling the issue of planting restrictions on fruit and vegetables retain the current restrictions status quo this option would not satisfy concerns in the wto cotton case and could subject the direct payments program to expenditure limits applied to highly distorting amber box subsidies nor does it address the concerns of midwestern fruit and vegetable grow ers for processing it could however satisfy fresh fruit and ve getable growers who prefer to keep the restriction as compared with simply lifting the restriction allow fruits and vegetables for processing on base acres without additional penalty if growers give up government payments when they plant such crops this option likely would not satisfy wto rules because it basically keeps the current planting restriction while creating smaller penalty for lect group of fruits and vegetables those for processing legislation such as hr 1371s 1188 could appease midwestern grower s for processing but likely not fresh produce growers eliminate the restriction on pl anting fruits and vegetables this option could remedy violations identified in the wto cotton case and it would exceed what is proposed by midwestern growers ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34019crs4 fruits and vegetables for processing farmers would not have to give up their government payments nor face additional penalties as they do now should they grow fruits and vegetables on base acres however this action by itself lik ely would not satisfy fresh growers who may want some other form of protection or compensation because of new competition from subsidized growers transition out of direct payments i f d i r c t p m n t s r eliminated the planting restriction issue is irrelevant some are calling for an end to direct paymen ts in the 2007 farm bill either to score budget savings for other farm b ill priorities or to recognize the inconsistency of making payments to farmers even when farm income is high direct payments were intended to be decoupled and eligible for green box treatment planting restrictions have become barrier to this goal thus the fruit and vegetable planting restriction is seen by some as nother reason to reconsider the future of direct payments if the planting restriction is eliminated and direct payments are retained in the second or third bullets above several add itional options exist to respond to the concerns of existing fruit and vegetable growers who may per ceive additional and unfair competition from new growers who w ould continue to receive direct and countercyclical payments on base acres direct compensation provide some type of direct payment to existing fruit and vegetable grower s who do not have base acres on which they plant their fruits and vegetables the amount of the payment could be based on the leve l of direct payments received by program crop growers research assistance increase federal funding for university and government research on growing processing and distributing fruits and vegetables implementation of research findings could lower production costs increas quality or out put andor increase demand increase demand for fruits and vegetables to the extent that eliminating the planting restriction increases fruit and vegetable production which coul d depress prices nd revenue as some existing growers fear federal efforts to increase demand could offset potential revenue shortfa lls increasing demand could be accomplished in several ways market promotion including healthy diet standards and farmers markets foreign trade assistance negotiating trade agreements to export us produce and government purchases of produce for feeding and nutrition assistance programs such as sec tion 32 school lunch programs and fresh fruit and vegetable snacks for childrenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34019crs5 summary of academic and industry studies following is sidebyside comparis on of five academic and industry studies on the effects of removing the

detailed review of these studies is provided in appendixes ae approach and scope of the five studies three are national in scope usda arizona state and informa while the other two address potential regional impacts only michigan state and texas am the texas am nd arizona state studies use economic modeling approaches to determine potential ffects the usda michigan state and informa studies use mostly descriptive approach with objective judgements to evaluate potential effects but using very different methodologies both the usda and michigan state studies take narrowl focused approach using detailed county level data in an ttempt to precisely identify the producing counties and crops thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34019crs6 may be affected proceeding through series of analytical steps and data review the informa study also proceeds in step wise construction but instead builds upon limited statelevel data and aggregates the potential results to the national level as result these studies provide very different conclusions the studies differ in terms of their availa ble input data most use either state or countylevel production and acreage da ta michigan stat supplem ented its published data with survey or interv iew information the economic modeling approaches used by texas am allowed it to directly examine the role of expected costs and returns as well as risk and uncer tainty in planting decisions the arizona state study provided detailed informa tion about its underlying model which makes it difficult to evaluate the xas am and arizona state studies also examined simultaneous market interactions across range of crops in contrast the approach used in the usda and michigan state studies only indirectly considered the role of expected costs and net returns as part of its analysis the informa study did not take into account net returns or cost information general conclusions as indicated by these studies eliminating the current planting restriction could have an economic effect on certain crops within certain producing areas however differences in research approach and sc ope eg regional vers us national plantings of permanent perennial cr ops versus easily rotated nnual crops complicate direct comparison across all five studies such differences also make it difficult to generalize about the possible economic eff ects of lifting the current restriction the studies also vary in that not ll take into account certain production and market factors in the us fruit and vegetable sectors as part of their analysis in particular the importance of barriers to entry when examining the mobility of production between crops especially for fru its and vegetables see next section production and market factors for more detailed information as result the studies differ in whether they consider the possibility that permanent perennial crops would be planted or whether only easily rotated annual crops would be planted most of the studies did not attempt to quantify the potential price revenue and market impacts making strict comparison of the potential impacts difficult only the informa and arizona state studies attempted to quantify the potential market effects on existing fruit and vegetable growers they reported estimated revenue losses to existing fruit and vegetable gr owers ranging from about 17 billion to 40 billion respec tively in the first year of lifting the restriction the arizona state study went step further and considered effects on all growers including new entrants and multiyear effects that account for adjustments beyond the first year the informa studys highend estimated effects however are questionable since the study did not account for barriers to entr for fruit and vegetable production also questionable is the likelihood of planting ba acres to longmaturing tree crops and plantings by producers without histor of growing fruits and vegetables the other three studies did not provide quantitative estimates of the market impacts however both the usda and michigan state studies indicate that the effects of removing the cu rrent restriction likely would be limited to individualhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34019crs7 producers commodities and regions and that the total industry effects of removing the restriction would be low the us da and michigan state studies largely conclude that industry impacts would ge nerally be focused on narrow range of crops with greater likelihood of conve rsion from program crops to fruits and vegetables below the texas am study also indicates that the effect of lifting the restriction would be limited to certain crops below nevertheless these studies do indicate that lifting the planting restriction could have sometimes substa ntial adverse effect on certain crops within select producing areas the usda and arizona state studi which are more national in scope indicate that the potential economic effects could be greatest for producers of potatoes and processed vege tables the usda study suggests particular impacts in certain areas including dry beans in nort h dakota the arizona state study shows greater economic impacts and eventual new entrants in some fruit and vegetable sectors the michigan state and texas am studies which are more regional in scope note possible adverse effects to produ cers of dry beans squash and processed tomatoes in parts of michigan and to watermelon and cabbage in parts of texas given that even small acreage shifts in fruit and vegetable plantings can have large pricedepressing effects especially if concentrated within certain growing regions the localized effect to specialty crop producers in some areas could be great production and market factors most of the studies take into account specific production and market factors in the us fruit and vegetable sectors as part of their analysis except for the informa study in particular both the usda and michigan state studies emphasize the importance of barriers to entry when ex amining the mobility of production between crops especially for fruits and vegetables the michigan state study summarizes the types of barriers to entry that could infl uence an expansion of specialty crop acres from program acres as 1 capital inve stment eg equipment and machinery purchases cultivati on irrigation needs etc 2 rotational requirements eg growing patterns and pest pressures 3 market accessibility eg difference between fresh and processed crops marke ting channels contr actual arrangements etc and 4 labor and management re quirements eg labo rintensive versus capitalintensive production as already noted the informa study did not take into account the possible role of entry barriers to fruit and vegetable pr oduction it also considered the possibility that program crops may be switched to permanent crops such as orchard and tree crops that often require high planting expe nditures and longer establishment periods consequently the study reports sizeable economic effects to sp ecialty crop producers from lifting the current planting restric tion however the studys underlying approach and assumptions potentially raise some question about the reliability of its reported estimated quantitative effects the fact that fruit and vegetable production differs substantially from commodity crop production also might influence the likelihood of conversion compared to program crops fruit and ve getable production often has different machinery and technology needs typically hi gher costs but also higher returns additional labor and manageme nt requirements and diffe rent types of purchasinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34019crs8 arrangements and marketing ch annels in addition substan tial differences often exist within the fruit and vegetable sectors depe nding on whether crops are grown for the fresh market versus grown for processi ng most fresh produce is sold under arrangements with packers distributors nd retailers most fruits and vegetables for processing are grown under contract current market trends also might influence the likelihood of conversion for example in forma arizona state and usda predict large increases in potato production despite recent declines in planted acreage due to lower market prices given these production and market fact ors making assumptions about the potential likelihood to convert from pr ogram crop to specialty crop is not straightforward for this reason most of th studies reviewed in this report except for the informa study assume greater likelihood of conversion to specialty crops that can be easily rotated year to year eg vegetables beans these studies examine only crops that may be planted and harves ted in single year thereby excluding permanent crops such as nut and tree fru it crops grapes and perennial vegetables such as asparagus these studies assume it will be unlikely that program crop producers would convert to crops that re quire lengthy cultivation before becoming commercially viable eg orchard crops berries also to varying degree each of the studies uses historical data for farms that grow bot h program crops and specialty crops and assumes that the areas that may be potentially affected by lifting the planting restrictions will be on cropland owned by farmers that historically have grown both program and specialty crops other comments and considerations because the informa study does not take into account the full range of market based factors that may influence planting decisions of specialty crops the market effects reported by the analysis may likely be overstated in particular the analysis likely overstates the number of new entran ts into specialty crop production since it predicts large acreage increases in speci alty crops on farms producing program crops only with history of specialty crops based simply on weighted percentage increase the other four studies however could be understating the potential market effects of eliminating the plan ting restrictions since they each exclude consideration that program crop acres would be convert ed to permanent or perennial crops finally none of the studies specifically addresses current market demand and trends that may limit marketability of the specialty crops converted from program crops only the arizona state university study projected its analysis over an eight year period in order to capture market ad justment over time in response to changing market prices and supply it found that the ffects diminish greatly after the first year none of the studies explicitly differentiated between fresh and processed fruits and vegetables and so they do not directly address the potential effects of partially lifting the planting restrictions as pr oposed under hr 1371s 1188 as proposed under these bills relaxing the planting rest riction would only apply to producers that grow for canning and freezing and would not apply to plantings of fresh market fruits and vegetableshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34019 crs9 table 1 comparison of studies of removing planting restrictions for fruits and vegetables usda economic research servicemichigan

considerationscomments potential strengths estimates price and quantity changes and revenue loss potential shortcomings crosssubsidization effects effects are likely overstated since the analysis assumes weighted average combined dcp benefit 7604acre across all us fruit nut and vegetable acres in 2002 106 million acres although many of these operations may already be growing both specialty and program crops and already may be receiving dcp benefits in add ition countercyclical payments are based on 20022004 data and not on lower baseline estimates applicable to the 2007 farm bill overall this analysis does not cons ider other marketbased factors that may influence planting decisions market impact effects this analysis likely overstates the number of new entrants since it concludes large acreage increases in specialty crops at farms producing program crops only with history of sp ecialty crops ie new entrants based simply on weighted percentage increase without consideration of other market based factors that influence planting decisions including 1 barriers to entry such as differing machinery and technology needs typically higher production costs and more intensiv labor and management requirements for specialty crops and differing marketing arrangementsaccess to market channels 2 likelihood for conversion specifically it applies same level of likelihood to converting to crops that can be easily rotated yeartoyear eg vegetables beans and crops that often require lengthy cultivation for development before becoming commercially viable eg orchard crops berries 3 differences between fresh market versus for processing given that most fresh produce is sold under arrangements with pa ckers distributors and retailers most crops for processing are grown under contract and 4 consideration of current market trends specifically it predicts large increases in potato production despite recent dec lines in planted acreage but does not consider potential effects on dry beans wh ich could be most affected without the restriction
