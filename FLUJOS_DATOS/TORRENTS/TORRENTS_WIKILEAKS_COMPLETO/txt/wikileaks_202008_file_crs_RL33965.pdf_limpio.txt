recently considered whether diversity is constitutionally permissible goal in the elementary and secondary education setting2 to resolve this question the supreme court agreed to review two cases that involved the use of race to maintain racially diverse public schools the cases were meredith v jefferson county board of education formerly macfarland v jefferson county public schools and parents involved in community schools v seattle school district 1 3 in parents involved in community schools v seattle school district 1 consolidated ruling that resolved both cases the court ultimately

discussion of its implications for future educational efforts to promote racial diversity g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 the two cases that the court reviewed involved challenges to school assignment and transfer plans in louisville and seattle in macfarland v jefferson county public schools5 issued on the first anniversary of the university of michigan decisions and the 50th anniversary of brown v board of education federal district court in kentucky upheld louisville districts voluntary consideration of race in making student assignments to achieve racial integration in the public schools jefferson county public schools jcps we re ordered by judicial decree to desegregate in 1975 under the desegregation plan each school was to have between 15 and 50 african american enrollment and students were bused if necessary to ensure racial diversity twenty five years later in 2000 the federal courts ended their supervision of the desegregation plan but the jcps voluntarily opted to maintain its integrated schools through managed choice plan that involved consideration of geographic boundaries special programs and school choice as well as race the plan was challenged in lawsuit in 2000 by black parents whose children were denied admission to central high school which was already at the upper percentage limit for minority enrollment the district court upheld the school plan finding that the managed choice plan served numerous compelling state interests many of which were similar to interests upheld by the supreme court in grutter and that the student assignment plan was narrowly tailored in 1 539 us 306 2003 539 us 244 2003 2 for more information on affirmative action and diversity in higher education see crs report rl30410 affirmative action and

reasons articulated in the wellreasoned opinion of the district court the sixth circuit summarily affirmed the district courts decree without issuing detailed written opinion7 meanwhile in parents involved in community schools v seattle school district 1 8 the ninth circuit applied grutter and gratz to approve school districts plan to maintain racially diverse schools under seattles controlled choice high school student assignment plan students were given the option to attend high schools across the district but if the demand for seats exceeded the supply at particular school students race was considered as tiebreaker in determining admittance to the oversubscribed school the racial tiebreaker applied only to schools whose student bodies deviated by more than 15 percentage points from the overall racial makeup of the district then approximately 40 white and 60 nonwhite the seattle plan was voluntarily adopted to achieve diversity and limit racial isolation in the schools not as part of desegregation remedy in an banc decision the ninth circuit ruled that the school district had compelling interest in the educational and social benefits of racial diversity and in avoiding racially concentrated or isolated schools further the court held that the districts plan was sufficiently narrowly tailored to pass constitutional muster the ruling reversed an earlier threejudge appellate panels contrary decision that the school districts plan to maintain racially diverse schools was not sufficiently narrowly tailored 9 as noted above the supreme court granted review in macfarland v jefferson county public schools now meredith v jefferson county board of education and parents involved in community schools v seattle school district 1 to consider the question of what steps public school district may take to maintain racial diversity in elementary and secondary schools in consolidated ruling that resolved both cases the court ultimately struck down the school plans holding that they violated the equal protection guarantee of the fourteenth amendment 10

g561g6g142g140g146g156g146g152g151g561 the bakke ruling in 1978 launched the contemporary constitutional debate over statesponsored affirmative action the notion that diversity could rise to the level of compelling constitutional interest in the educational setting sprang more than quarter century ago from justice powells opinion in the case while concluding that state medical school could not setaside certain number of seats for minority applicants justice powell opined that diverse student body may serve educators legitimate interest in promotin g the robust exchange of ideas he cautioned however that the diversity that furthers compelling state interest encompasses far broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which ethnic origin is but single though important element12 notable lack of unanimity was evident from the six separate opinions filed in bakke justice powell split the difference between two fourjustice pluralities in the case one camp led by justice stevens struck down the admissions quota on statutory civil rights grounds another led by justice brennan would have upheld the medical schools policy as remedy for societal discrimination justice powell held the dual admissions procedure to be unconstitutional and ordered bakkes admission but he concluded that the states interest in educational diversity could warrant consideration of students race in certain circumstances for justice powell diverse student body fostered the robust exchange of ideas and academic freedom deserving of constitutional protection justice powells theory of diversity as compelling governmental interest did not turn on race alone he pointed with approval to the harvard plan which defined diversity in terms of broad array of factors and characteristics thus an applicants race could be deemed plus factor it was considered on par with personal talents leadership qualities family background or any other factor contributing to diverse stude nt body however the race of candidate could not be the sole or determinative factor other justice joined in the powell opinion although justice powells opinion announced the judgment of the court other bakke justices joined him on that point justice powell ruled the dual admission program at issue to be unconstitutional and the white male plaintiff entitled to admission while four other justices reached the same result on statutory rather than constitutional grounds another four justice plurality concluded that the challenged policy was lawful but agreed with justice powell that the state court had erred by holding that an applicants race could never be taken into account only justice powell therefore expressed the view that the attainment of diverse student body could be compelling state interest for nearly two decades colleges and universities relied on the powell opinion in bakke to support raceconscious student diversity policies although there was some disagreement among federal appeals courts regarding the meaning and application of the ruling the judicial divide over bakke s legacy was vividly underscored by pair of separate trial court decisions one upholding for diversity reasons the racebased undergraduate admissions policy of the university of michigan 13 the other voiding special minority law school admissions program at the same institution14 12 id at 315 13 gratz v bollinger

200203 term with rulings in the michigan cases in grutter v bollinger 15 5 to 4 majority of the justices held that the university of michigan law school had compelling interest in the educational benefits that flow from diverse student body which justified its consideration of race in admissions to assemble critical mass of underrepresented minority students but in companion decision gratz v bollinger 16 six justices decided that the university of michigans policy of awarding racial bonus points to minority applicants was not narrowly tailored enough to pass constitutional scrutiny

lsat score and undergraduate gpa 1992 policy statement however made an explicit commitment to racial and ethnic diversity seeking to enroll critical mass of black mexicanamerican and native american students the objective was to enroll minority students in sufficient numbers to enable their participation in classroom discussions without feeling isolated or like spokesmen for their race to foster distinctive perspectives and experiences admission officers consider range of soft variableseg talents interests experiences and underrepresented minority statusin their admissions decisions in the course of each years admissions process the record showed minority admission rates were regularly reported to track the racial composition of the developing class the 1992 policy replaced an earlier special admissions program which set written goal of 1012 minority enrollment and lower academic requirements for those groups notable aspect of the grutter majority opinion was the degree to which it echoed the powell rationale from bakke indeed the majority quoted extensively from justice powells opinion finding it to be the touchstone for constitutional analysis of raceconscious admissions policies overarching much of the courts reasoning we re two paramount themes both of which drew considerable criticism from the dissent first in applying strict scrutiny to the racial aspects of the law school admissions program the court stressed the situational nature of constitutional interpretation taking relevant differences into account thus the majority opined context matters when reviewing racebased governmental action for equal protection purposes and not every decision influenced by race is equally objectionable but may depend upon the importance and the sincerity of the reasons advanced by the governmental decisionmaker for that particular use of race second and equally significant was the deference accorded to the judgment of educational decisionmakers in defini ng the scope of their academic mission even in regard to matters of racial and ethnic diversity universities occupy special niche in our constitutional tradition the court stated such that the law schools educational judgment that diversity is essential to its educational mission is one to which we defer institutional good faith would be presumed in the absence of contrary evidence one group of dissenters took particular exception to what it viewed as the fundamentally flawed proposition that racial discrimination can be contextualizeddeemed compelling for one purpose but not another or that strict scrutiny permits any sort of deference to the law schools conclusion that its continued proposition that universitys desire to assemble racial ly diverse student body is compelling state interest 15 539 us 306 2003 16 539 us 244 2003 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33965g22g145g142g561g5g152g151g156g157g146g157g158g157g146g152g151g561g138g151 g141g561g20g138g140g146g138g149g561

dissenters found such deference to be antithetical to the level of searching review demanded by strict scrutiny satisfied that the law school had compelling reasons for pursuing racially diverse student body the court moved to the second phase of strict scrutiny analysis narrow tailoring as noted requires close fit between means and end when the state draws any distinction based on race in grutter the concept of critical mass won the majoritys approval as necessary to further its compelling interest in securing the educational benefits of diverse student body according to the court we find that the law schools admissions program bears the hallmarks of narrowly tailored plan as justice powell made clear in bakke truly individualized consideration demands that race be used in flexible nonmechanical way it follows from this mandate that universities cannot establish quotas for members of certain racial groups or put members of those groups on separate admissions tracks nor can universities insulate applicants who belong to certain racial or ethnic groups from the competition for admission universities can however consider race or ethnicity more fl exibly as plus factor in the context of individualized consideration of each and every applicant the court drew key distinction between forbidden quotas and permitted goals exonerating the law schools admission program from constitutional jeopardy the majority observed that both approaches pay some attention to numbers but while the former are fixed and reserved exclusively for certain minority groups the opinion continues the law schools goal of attaining critical mass of minority students required only good faith effort by the institution in addition minority law school enrollment between 1993 and 2000 varied from 135 to 201 percent range inconsistent with quota in separate dissent the chief justice objected that the notion of critical mass was sham or subterfuge for racial balancing since it did not explain disparities in the proportion of the three minority groups admitted under its auspices other factors further persuaded the court that the law school admissions process was narrowly tailored by avoiding racial or ethnic bonuses the policy permitted consideration of all pertinent elements of diversity racial and nonracial in highly individualized holistic review of each applicants file the court also found that race neutral alternatives had been sufficiently considered by the law school although few specific examples are provided importantly however the opinion makes plain that exhaustion of every conceivable alternative is not constitutionally required only serious good faith consideration of workable raceneutral alternatives that will achieve the diversity the university seeks consequently the law school was not required to consider lottery or lowering of traditional academic benchmarksgpa and lsat scoresfor all applicants since these alternatives would require dramatic sacrifice of diversity the academic quality of all admitted students or both and because the admissions program was based on individual assessment of all pertinent elements of diversity it did not unduly burden nonminority applicants nonetheless the court emphasized the need for reasonable durational provisions and periodic reviews by institutions conducting such programs to drive home the point the majority concluded with general admonition we expect that 25 years from now the use of racial preferences will longer be necessary to further the interest approved today

for one but only one of the following membership in an underrepresented minority group socioeconomic disadvantage or athletics applican ts could receive one to four points for legacy or alumni relationships three points for personal essay and five points for community leadership and service six points for instate residency etc in practice students at the extremes of academic performance were typically admitted or rejected on that basis alone but for the middle range of qualified applicants these other factors were often determinative finally counselors could flag applications for review by the admissions review committee where any factor important to the freshman class compositionrace includedwas not adequately reflected in the selection index score the four grutter dissenters were joined by two justices in striking down the racial bonus system for undergraduate admissions in gratz basically the same factors that saved the law school policy by their absence conspired to condemn the undergraduate program in the eyes of the majority since the universitys compelling interest in racial student diversity was settled in grutter the companion case focused on the reasons why the automatic award of 20 admission points to minority applicants failed the narrow tailoring aspect of strict scrutiny analysis relying again on the powell rationale in bakke the policy was deemed more than plus factor as it denied each applicant individualized consideration by making race decisive for virtually every minimally qualified underrepresented minority applicant nor did the procedure for flagging individual applications for additional review rescue the policy since such consideration is the exception and not the rule occurringif at allonly after the bulk of admission decisions are made based on the point system the court rejected the universitys argument based on administrative convenience that the volume of freshman applications makes it impractical to apply more individualized review the fact that the implementation of program capable of providing individualized consideration might present administrative challenges does not render constitutional an otherwise problematic system finally the majority made plain that its constitutional holding in gratz is fully applicable to private colleges and universities pursuant to the federal civil rights laws we have

constitutionality of the voluntary use of race as factor in achieving diversity in elementary and secondary education all three of the federal appeals courts to consider the issue since grutter and

with five different justices filing opinions in the case announcing the judgment of the court was chief justice roberts who led plurality of four justices in concluding that the school plans were unconstitutional because they did not serve compelling governmental interest although justice kennedy who concurred in the courts judgment striking down the plans disagreed with the pluralitys conclusion that the diversity plans did not serve compelling governmental interest he found that the school plans were unconstitutional because they were not narrowly tailored in addition justice thomas filed concurring opinion and justices stevens and breyer filed separate dissenting opinions in the portion of his opinion that was joined by justice kennedy and that therefore announced the

classifications must be reviewed under strict scrutiny as result the court examined whether the school districts had demonstrated that their assignment and transfer plans were narrowly tailored to achieve compelling governmental interest in assessing the compelling interest prong of the strict scrutiny test chief justice roberts noted that the court has recognized two interests that qualify as compelling where the use of racial classifications in the school context is concerned remedying the effects of past intentional discrimination and promoting diversity in higher education however the chief justice found that neither of these interests was advanced by the school plans at issue according to the chief justice because seattle schools were never intentionally segregated and because the lifting of its desegregation order demonstrated that louisville schools had successfully remediated past discrimination in its schools neither school district could assert compelling interest in remedying past intentional discrimination 25 likewise the court argued that the grutter precedent which recognized diversity in higher education as compelling governmental interest did not govern the current cases according to chief justice roberts the compelling interest recognized in grutter was in broadly defined diversity that encompassed more than just racial diversity and that focused on each applicant as an individual because race was the only factor considered by the school districts rather than other factors that reflected broader spectrum of diverse qualifications and characteristics and because the plans did not provide individualized review of applicants the plurality opinion found that the school districts articulated interest in diversity was not compelling added the chief justice even when it comes to race the plans here employ only limited notion of diversity viewing race exclusively in whitenonwhite terms in seattle and blackother terms in jefferson county 26 in rejecting grutter as applicable precedent the court also noted that the decision had rested in part on the unique considerations of higher education and that those considerations were absent in the elementary and secondary education context even if the school districts had met the first prong of the strict scrutiny test by establishing compelling governmental interest in the use of racial classifications to make school assignments the court found the school plans would still have failed the second prong of the test because they were not sufficiently narrowly tailored to meet their stated goals according to chief justice roberts in both seattle and louisville only few students were assigned to nonpreferred school based on race as result the minimal impact of the districts racial classifications on school enrollment casts doubt on the necessity of using racial classifications 27 especially in light of the fact that such racial classifications are permissible in only the most extreme circumstances additionally the court was concerned that the school districts had failed to consider methods other than racial classifications to achieve their goals despite requirement that narrowly tailored programs consider raceneutral alternatives although justice kennedy joined the above portions of the plurality opinion thereby forming majority in favor of striking down the school plans he did not join the remainder of the plurality opinion which concluded for additional reasons that the school plans were unconstitutional in these portions of his opinion chief justice roberts faulted the school plans for tying their 25 id at 3637 26 id at 41 27 id at 60 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33965g22g145g142g561g5g152g151g156g157g146g157g158g157g146g152g151g561g138g151

than to any pedagogical concept of the level of diversity needed to obtain the asserted educational benefits28 in other words each district tried to establish schools with racial diversity that mirrored the percentages of racial groups in their respective overall populations this effort according to the chief justice amounted to unconstitutional racial balancing because the plans were not in fact narrowly tailored to the goal of achieving the educational and social benefits that allegedly flow from racial diversity but rather were tailored to racial demographics instead indeed chief justice roberts wrote accepting racial balancing as compelling state interest would justify the imposition of racial proportionality throughout american society contrary to our repeated recognition that at the heart of the constitutions guarantee of equal protection lies the simple command that the government must treat citizens as individuals not as simply components of racial religious sexual or national class 29 such racial balancing could not in the chief justices view amount to compelling governmental interest even if pursu ed in the name of racial diversity or racial integration in another portion of the plurality opinion not joined by justice kennedy chief justice roberts criticized justice breyers dissent for misapplying precedents that recognized compelling interest in remedying past discrimination according to the chief justice the court has recognized compelling interest in remedying past discrimination when that discrimination is caused by governmental action but not when caused by other factors such as social or economic pressures noting that the seattle school district was never segregated due to state action and the louisville school district had eliminated all vestiges of state segregation the chief justice therefore argued that the cases cited by justice breyer as precedents for raceconscious school integration efforts were inapplicable to the current case30 the plurality opinion concluded with discussion of brown v board of education 31 in which the court held that the deliberate segregation of schoolchildren by race was unconstitutional according to the plurality before brown schoolchildren were told where they could and could not go to school based on the color of their skin the school distri cts in these cases have not carried the heavy burden of demonstrating that we should allow this once againeven for very different reasons the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race 32 although he joined the court in striking down the school plans justice kennedy wrote separate concurring opinion that provides additional insight into how the justices might handle future cases involving the consideration of race in the educational context as noted above justice kennedy declined to sign on to the plurality opinion in full in part because he disagreed with its implication that diversity in elementary and secondary education at least as properly defined does not serve compelling governmental interest according to justice kennedy diversity depending on its meaning and definition is compelling educational goal school district may pursue 33 but neither seattle nor louisville had shown that its plans served compelling interest in promoting diversity or that the plans were narrowly tailored to achieve that goal 28 id at 46 29 id at 52 30 id at 6264 31 347 us 483 1954 32 parents involved in cmty schs v seattle sch dist 1 2007 us lexis 8670 8384 33 id at 150

implying an alltoo unyielding insistence that race cannot be factor in instances when in my view it may be taken into account in the administration of public schools by the state and local authorities it is permissible to consider the racial makeup of schools and to adopt general policies to encourage diverse student body one aspect of which is its racial composition34 justice kennedy identified several ways in which schools in his view could constitutionally pursue racial diversity or avoid racial isolation including strategic site selection of new schools altering attendance zones providing resources for special programs and recruiting students and faculty according to justice kennedy such measures would be constitutional because while raceconscious they are not based on classifications that treat individuals differently based on race however justice kennedy would not limit schools to facially neutral methods of achieving diversity saying that racial classifications might be permissible if ba sed on more nuanced individual evaluation of school needs and student characteristics similar to the plan approved in grutter 35 although other justice joined his concurrence justice kennedys unique role in providing the pivotal swing vote in the case makes his concurring opinion significant to any future legal developments regarding the use of racial classifications in the education context although justice thomas joined the plurality opinion written by chief justice roberts in full he also wrote separate concurring opinion that took issue with certain aspects of justice breyers dissent among other things justice thomas disagreed with the dissents assertion that the school plans were necessary to combat school resegregation arguing that neither seattle nor louisville faced the type of intentional state action to separate the races that the school districts in brown had36 in addition justice thomas contested the dissents argument that less strict standard of review should apply when racial classifications are used for benign purposes in part because justice thomas disagreed that the school planswhich he wrote inevitably exclude some individuals based on race and therefore may exacerbate racial tensionare as benign as the dissent asserted more importantly justice thomas argued that the perception of what constitutes benign use of raceconscious measures is nothing more than reflection of current social practice that relies too heavily on the good intentions of current public officials according to justice thomas if our history has taught us anythi ng it has taught us to beware of elites bearing racial theories adding in footnote justi ce breyers good intentions which i do not doubt have the shelf life of justice breyers tenure 37 as noted above both justices stevens and breyer dissented from the courts decision to strike down the school plans in his brief dissent just ice stevens who also joined justice breyers dissent described the courts reliance on brown as cruel irony because it ignored the historical context in which brown was decided and the ways in which subsequent precedents applied the landmark decision to uphold school integration efforts38 meanwhile in lengthy and passionate dissent nearly twice as long as chief justice robertss opinion justice breyer argued that the courts holding distorts precedent misapplies the relevant constitutional principles announces legal rules that will obstruct efforts by state and local governments to deal effectively with the growing resegregation of public schools threatens to substitute for present calm 34 id at 15859 35 id at 162 36 id at 9296 37 id at 146 38 id at 17784
