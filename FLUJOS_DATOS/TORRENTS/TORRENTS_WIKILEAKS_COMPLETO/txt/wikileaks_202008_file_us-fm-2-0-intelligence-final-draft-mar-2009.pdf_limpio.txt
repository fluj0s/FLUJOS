all levels of governance 14 political structures and processe s enjoy varying degrees of leg itimacy with populations from the local through international levels formally constitute d authorities and informal or covert political powers strongly influence events political leaders can use ideas beliefs acti ons and violence to enhance their power and control over people territory and resources many sources of political motivation exist these may include charismatic leadership indigenous security institutions and religious ethnic or economic communities political opposition groups or parties also aff ect the situation each ma deal differently with us or multinational forces understanding the political circumstances helps commanders and staffs recognize key organizations and dete rmine their aims and capabilities 15 understanding political implications requires analyzing all relevant partnershipspolitical economic military religious and cultural this analys is captures the presence nd significance of external organizations and other groups these include groups united by common cause examples are private security organizations transnational corporati ons and nongovernmental organizations ngos that provide humanitarian assistance 16 political analysis also addresses the effect of will will is the primary intangible factor it motivates participants to sacrifi ce to persevere against obstacles understanding the motivations of key groups for example political military and insurgent helps cl arify their goals and willingness to sacrifice to achieve their ends 17 the political variable includes the us domestic political environment therefore mission analysis and monitoring the situation includes an awareness of national policy and strategy military 18 the military variable includes the military capabilities of all armed forces in given operational environment for many states an army is the military force primarily responsible for maintaining internal and external security paramilitary organizations and guerrilla forces may influence friendly and hostile military forces militaries of other stat not directly involved in conflic t may also affect them therefore analysis should include the relations hip of regional land forces to the other variables military analysis examines the capabilities of enemy adversary host nation hn and multinational military organizations such capabilities include z equipment z manpower z doctrine z training levels z resource constraints z leadership z organizational culture z history z nature of civilmilitary relations 19 understanding these factors helps commanders estim ate the actual capabilities of each armed force analysis should focus on each organizations ability to field capabilities and use them

producing distributing and consuming resources specific factors may include the influence of z industrial organizations z trade z development including foreign aid z finance z monetary policy and conditions z institutional capabilities z geography z legal constraints or the lack of them on the economy 111 while the world economy is becoming interdependent local economies differ these differences significantly influence political choi ces including individuals decisions to support or subvert the existing order many factors create incentives or disincentives for individuals and groups to change the economic status quo these may include z technical knowledge z decentralized capital flows z investment z price fluctuations z debt z financial instruments z protection of property rights z existence of black market or underground economies 112 thus indicators measuring potentia l benefits or costs of changing the politicaleconomic order may enhance understanding the social and behavioral dynamics of friendly adversary and neutral entities social 113 the social variable describes societies within an operational environment society is population whose members are subject to the same political authority occupy common territory have common culture and share sense of identity societies are not monolithic they include diverse social structures social structure refers to the relations among groups of persons within system of groups it includes institutions organizations networks and similar groups fm 324 discusse s sociocultural factors analysis and social network analysis 114 culture comprises shared beliefs values customs behaviors and artifacts that society members use to cope with their world and with one another so cieties usually have dominant culture but may have many secondary cultures different societies may share similar cultures but societal attributes change over time changes may occur in any of the following areas z demographics z religion z

area whose actions opinions or political influence can affect the mission 116 people base their actions on perceptions assumptions customs and values cultural awareness helps identify points of friction within populations helps build rapport and reduces misunderstandings it can improve forces ability to accomplish its mission and pr ovide insight into indivi dual and group intentions however cultural awareness requires training before deploying to an unfamiliar operational environment and continuous updating while deployed commanders velop their knowledge of the societal aspects within their areas of operations ao to higher level of cultural astuteness one that allows them to understand the impact of their opera tions on the population and prepares them to meet local leaders face toface information 117 joint doctrine defines the information environment as the aggregate of individuals organizations and systems that collect process disseminate or act on information jp 313 the environment shaped by information includes leaders decision makers indi viduals and organizations the global communitys access and use of data media and know ledge systems occurs in the info rmation shaped by the operational environment commanders use information engagement to shape the operational environment as part of their operations 118 media representatives significantly influence the information that shapes the operational environment broadcast and internet media sources can rapidly disseminate competing views of military operations worldwide adversaries often seek to fu rther their aims by controlling and manipulating how audiences at all levels perceive situations content and context media coverage influences us political decision making popular opinion and multinational sensitivities 119 complex telecommunications networks now provide much of the globe with vast web of communications capabilities observers and adversarie s have unprecedented access to multiple information sources they often attempt to influence opinion by providing their own interpretation of events televised news and propaganda reach many peopl however in devel oping countries informa tion still may flow by less sophisticated means such as messengers nd graffiti understanding the various means of communications is important observers and adversarie s control information flow and influence audiences at all levels infrastructure 120 infrastructure comprises the basic facilities serv ices and installations needed for societys functioning degrading infrastructure affects the entire operational environment infrastructure also includes technological sophisticati onthe ability to conduct research and development and apply the results to civil and military purposes 121 not all segments of society view infrastructure in the same way improvements viewed by some as beneficial may not be perceived as such by all one community may perceive certain improvements as favoring other communities at its expense effective in formation engagement is n ecessary to address such concerns actions affecting infrastructure require thorough analysis of possible effects physical environment 122 the physical environment includes the geography and manmade structures in the operational area the following factors affect the physical environment z manmade structures particularly

other environmental conditions 123 the enemy understands that less complex and open rrain often exposes their military weaknesses therefore they may try to counter act us military advantages by ope rating in urban or other complex terrain and during adverse weather conditions time 124 time is significant consideration in military operations analyzing it as an operational variable focuses on how an operations durati on might help or hinder each side this has implications at every planning level an enemy with limited military capability usually views protracted conflict as advantageous to them they avoi d battles and only engage when cond itions are overwhelmingly in their favor this is strategy of exhaustion such strategy dominated the american revolution and remains effective today the enemy concentrates on surviving and inflicting friendly and civilian casualties over time although the military balance may not change th is creates opportunities to affect the way domestic and international audiences view th conflict conversely hostile power may attempt to mass effects and achieve decisive results in short period 125 while the operational variables are directly relevant to campaign planning they may be too broad to be applied directly to tactical planning that does not mean they are not of value at all levels they are fundamental to developing the understanding of the operational envi ronment necessary to conduct planning at any level in any situation 126 when identifying threats based on the systems pproach to pmesii th ere are three primary components of the operational envir onment for which the intelligence wa rfighting function is responsible threat terrain to include the weat her and civil considerations 127 the degree to which each operational variable provi des useful information depends on the situation and echelon once the g2s2 has completed their overall analysis they must go back and factor in small unit leaders intelligence requirement s for example social and econom ic variables often receive close analysis as part of enemy and civil considerations at brigade and higher levels they may affect the training and preparation of small units however they may not be relevant to smallunit leaders mission analysis that leader may only be concerned with questions such as who is the tribal leader for this village is the electrical generator working does the enemy have antitank missiles mission variables 128 upon receipt of warning order warno or ssion army leaders narrow their focus to six mission variables mission variables are those aspects of the operational environment that directly affect mission they outline the situation as it applies to specific army unit the mission variables are mission enemy terrain and weather troops and support ava ilable time available and civil considerations metttc these are the categories of relevant info rmation used for mission analysis army leaders use the mission variables to synthesize operational variables and tacticallevel information with local knowledge about conditions re levant to their mission the intelligen ce warfighting function is

develop the situation the intelligence warfighting function includes the following tasks z support to force generation z support to situational understanding z perform isr z support to targeting and information superiority 131 the intelligence warfighting function is one of six warfighting functions movement and maneuver intelligence fires sustainment command and control c2 and protection warfighting function is group of tasks and systems people organizations information and processes united by common purpose that commanders use to accomplish missions and training objectives fm 30 see

paragraph 33 133 planning and executing military operations will require intelligence regarding the threat traditional irregular catastrophic nd disruptive and the ao the inte lligence warfighting function generates intelligence and intelligence products that portray the enemy and asp ects of the environment these intelligence products enable the co mmander to identify potential coas plan operations employ forces effectively employ effective tactics and techniques and implement protection 134 the intelligence warfighting function is always ngaged in supporting the commander in offensive defensive stability and when di rected civil support operations intelligence provides products that are timely relevant accurate predictive and tailore d hard training thorough planning meticulous preparation and aggressive execution posture the army for success in the current environment we must maintain intelligence readiness to support operations this suppor t reaches across full spectrum operations and levels of war to produce the intelligence required to successfully accomplish the mission through combination of space aerial seaborne and groundba sed systems to provide the most comprehensive intelligence possible during force projection operations the intelligen ce warfighting function supports the commander with accurate and responsive intelligen ce from predeployment through redeployment 135 the intelligence warfighting function architecture provides specific intelligence and communications structures at each echelon from the national level thr ough the tactical level in recent years brigade combat team bct intellig ence capabilities and access have been signi ficantly increased these structures include intelligence organizations systems and procedures for generating intelligence knowledge planning preparing collecting nd producing intelligence and other critical information in useable form to those who need it when they need it effective communications connectivity and automation are essential components of this architecture purpose of intelligence 136 the purpose of intelligence is to provide commanders and their staffs with timely relevant accurate predictive and tailored in telligence about the enemy and the envir onment in timely manner intelligence supports the planning preparing execution and assessment of missions the most important role of intelligence is to support the comma nders decision making to drive operations intelligence must be timely relevant accurate predictive and tailored role of intelligence 137 intelligence drives the conduct of ope rations therefore the g2s2 is responsible for ensuring that the intelligence warfighting function operates smoothly and efficiently so that the commander receives timely relevant accurate predictive and tailored in formation in timely manner the g2s2 is not simply manager but is the primary advisor to th commander on how to utilize isr assets supports the commander with analysis and production and drives isr collection 138 the commander requires intelligence about the enem and the environment prior to engaging in operations in order to effectively execute battles engagements and other missions within full spectrum operations intelligence assists the commander in visualizing the environment organizing the forces and controlling operations to achieve th desired objectives or endstate intelligence supports protection by alerting the commander to threats and assisting in preserving and protecting the force 139 the unit may need to d eal with

systems are comprised of five integrated components z collection device hardware found on biometric device that converts biometric input into digital signal and conveys this information to the processing device z algorithms sequence of instructions that tells biometric system how to solve particular problem an algorithm will have finite number of steps and is typically used by the biometric engine to compute whether match exists between biometric sample and biometric template z database used to store the information collected that will be used later to do matching against z decision process automated or humanassisted process or analysis that results in decision by matching components and specific search criteria z dissemination process gets the data collected to whomever and wherever it needs to be in timely manner 1137 the implementation of these five components leads to personal identification pi or the identification of an individual with certitude this can be summarized into three stages z the sensor collects biometric feature to include fingerprints iris or photographic image of face or dna z the system stores that feature in mathematical template in database z the processing device runs search on the template against matching algorithm that compares it to templates already stored in the database 1138 military commanders require the ability to link identity information to given individual biometric systems are employed to deny threat forces freedom of movement within the populace and positively identify known threats these systems gather biometric data ch as iris scans fingerprints and photographic images and combine them with contextual data to produce an electronic dossier on the individual 1139 pi includes positively indentifying friendly dversarial nonadversarial forces intelligence related functions that biometrics can support or enhance are z intelligence analysis z foreign national and local employee hires screening z counterintelligence and force protection fp z interrogation and detention operations z hvt confirmation including highvalue individuals hvis and killed in action z base access and local security z population control or census screeni ng enrolling and badging operations 1140 the capability to positively indentify an individual and to place that individual within relevant context adds level of certitude that significantly nhances the overall effectiveness of the mission pi enabled by biometric technology can help to identify and locate specific individuals in support of targeting this capability is necessary not only for fp and security missions but also when an operational capability is required to achieve an advantage over an enemy in conventional warfare combating terrorism forcible entry strikes raids and operations with multinational partners 1141 affixing an individuals identification using the persons unique physical features and linking this identity to the individuals past ac tivities and previously used identities such as friendly forces accesses permissions clearance status medical information and unique biometrically based identifiers in addition to adversary or unknown persons ensuring access to all av ailable information on an individual is critical to such functions as screening persons for access to vesse ls position of trust and the

commanders and g2s2s must ensure communications support to intelligence has th appropriate priority z commanders and g2s2s cannot expect that higher echelons will automatically send them everything they need while in telligence reach is valuable tool the push of intelligence products from higher echelons does not relieve subordinate staffs from conducting detailed analysis and focusing the efforts of higher headquarters nor can they expect products pushed to them to be always at the level of detail they require utilizing the dcgsa enterprise commanders and g2s2s must focus higher echelons by clearly articulating and actively pursuing intelligence requirements by providing higher echelons with clear picture of the required intelligence products commanders can also narrow the flow of intelligence and information and preclude being overwhelmed by too much information 410 commanders should be aware that intelligence collection is enab led by and subject to laws regulations and policies to ensure proper conduct of intelligence operations while there are too many to list here specifically categories of these legal considerations include united states codes executive orders national security council intelligence dir ectives army regulations united states signal intelligence directives sofas roe and other international laws and directives red teaming 411 whenever possible commanders employ red teams to examine plans from threats perspective red team is special staff section whose members prim arily participate in planning in the future operations and plans cells unless integrated into another cell red team members anticip ate cultural perception of partners enemies adversaries nd others and conducts i ndependent critical review s and analysis the red

assumptions assisting in defining the problem and endstate identifying friendly and enemy vulnerabilities and identifying assessment measures these alternative perspectives not only account for the threat and environment in plans concepts organizations and capabilities but also address the standpoint of our multinational partners enemies and adversaries and other perspectives isr planning considerations 413 isr planning consists of two significant staff pro cesses isr synchronization and isr integration isr synchronization is the responsibility of the intellig ence officer and the g2s 2 staff the operations officer is responsible for isr integration with th support of the intelligence officer isr synchronization involves the entire staff and all of the warfighting func tions all staff sections within command post have the responsibility to satisfy information requirement s satisfying information requirements through staff element coordination facilitates isr planning by elimin ating the necessity to ta sk an asset to collect information that another unit or asset already obser ved in the course of operations the commander may designate an isr working group however the prim ary staffs responsibilities cannot be delegated 414 when planning preparing c onducting and assessing isr operati ons the intelligence staff must strive to achieve maximum efficiency and effectiveness the intelligence staff considers six essential criteria in conducting isr synchronization for the following z anticipate the intelligence officer must recognize wh and where to shift collection or identify new intelligence requirements the intent of this principle is to identify new or adjust an existing requirement and present it to the commander before the commander or other staff members identify the need by participating in the decision making planning and operations processes intelligence officers can best anticipate requirements intelligence process in full spectrum

sections and with both higher headquarters s ubordinate and adjacent units in order for isr operations to be continuously synchronized the intelligence staff must be engaged in the units planning and orders production activities to ensure early id entification of intelligence requirements the intelligence staff must also be integrated into the combat information reporting and battle tracking of

intelligence officers prioritize each validated intelligence requirement based upon its importance in supporting the commanders intent and decisions and the current situation so that lowdensity and

complement each other bala nce is simply achieving maximum efficiency using an appropriate mix of disciplines isr asse ts and resources to satisfy as many competing intelligence requirements as possible redundancy is achieved using several sametype isr assets to cover the same named area of interest nai mix means planning for complementary coverage by combination of assets from multiple units and intelligence disciplines designed to increase the probability of collection success and reduce the chances of ccessful threat deception cueing involves the use of one or more sensors to provide data that result in another system to conducting collection balance also mean s that the intelligence staff should resist favoring or becoming too reliant on one particular unit discipline or system z control units should first use organic and allocated isr assets to ensure timely and effective collection as well as overall synchronization these assets are more responsive to the commanders needs and can be balanced with ot her resources isr assets belonging other units agencies or organizations may have limited av ailability and are likely to receive differing priorities from their respective commanders information gathered by other isr resources is harder to verify and correlate with information collected by organic assets z reach units can use intelligence reach and rfis to answer initial information requirements without having to use the echelons isr assets intelligence which is confirmed by more than one intelligence discipline is generally preferred over singlesource reporting therefore unit should not depend solely on intelligence reach to satisfy pir 415 the staff must not only carefully focus isr plans on answering the ccirs pirs and ffirs but also enable the quick retasking of units and assets as the situation changes isr synchronization includes continually identifying new and partially filled intelligence gaps this ensures that the developing threat situation not just our oplan drives isr operations specifically intelligence officers z evaluate isr assets for suitability availability capability vulnerability and performance history to execute isr tasks and make appropriate recommendations on asset tasking to the operations officer z assess isr collection against ccirs pirs and ffirs to determine the effectiveness of the isr plan they maintain

examples of processing include enhancing imager translating document from foreign language converting electronic data into standardized report that can be analyzed by system operator and correlating dissimilar or jumbled information by assembling like elements before the information is forwarded for analysis 439 often collection assets must collect and process their data prior to disseminating it systems have their own reporting and processing systems the details of which are in the appropriate system manuals and technical manuals some collection assets par ticularly air reconnaissance and ground scouts can report relevant information that is immediately us able by the tactical commander for example for targeting purposes however the personnel in the re porting chain still process these reports by evaluating their relevancy and accuracy in many cases the output of collection sset is data or information of limited immediate use to commander 440 the intelligence staff processes info

must understand how the enemy is organized and equipped what the enemys capabilities are and how the enemy has employed forces in the past an understanding of threat characteristics and detailed organizational charts assist in this analysis this also helps identify what signatures the enemy gives off that can be collected by friendly isr assets maintaining accura threat characteristics is also essential in conducting combat assessment this applies to regular and irregular forces as well as insurgent and terrorist organizations threat characteristics for conventional forces are generally available within the intelligence community the analyst will generally have to develop threat characteristics for emerging threats like terrorists and insurgents this is done by using information gained from national and theater intelligence organizations as well as from the publications of these types of threat groups z develop enemy situation templates ensitemp depending on the mission there are three types of ensitemps generally required for pla nning the first two are used in conventional operations showing the enemy conducting offensiv and defensive operations against friendly forces the third is used in unconventiona l operations showing nonconventional forces conducting operations against friendly forces in comp lex terrain such as an urban area each of these

employment of ci teams includes varying degrees of contact with the local population as the degree of contact with the population increases both th quantity and quality of ci collection increases in many instances however there is risk to the ci team inherent with increased exposure to the local population the decision at wh at level to employ ci team is m etttc dependent the risk to the ci assets must be balanced with the n eed to collect on pirs and to protect the force as whole roe sofa direction from higher headquarters and the overall threat level may also restrict the deployment and use of ci teams 669 risks are minimized through the situational awareness of ci team members they plan and rehearse to readily react to any s ituation and carry the necessary firepower to disengage from difficult situations if it becomes necessary to call for ssistance adequate and redundant co mmunications equipment is critical these scenarios and actions should be trained prior to deployment into contingency area and rehearsed continuously throughout the deployment 670 supported unit commander is often tempted to keep the ci team within friendly bases when the threat condition level increases the supported commander must weigh the risk versus potential information gain when establishi ng operational parameters of supporti ng ci teams this is necessary especially during high threat condition threatcon levels when the supported unit commander needs as complete picture as possible of the threat arrayed against us and multinational forces 671 when it is not expedient to deploy the ci team independently due to threatcon levels or other restrictions the team can be integrated into other ongoing operations the ci team may be employed as part of combat isr or mp patrol or used to support ca psyop engineer or other operations this method reduces the risk to the team while allowing lim ited ability to collect inform ation it also has the advantage of placing the team in contact with the local population and allowing it to spot assess and interact with potential sources of information however this deployment method restricts collection by subordinating the teams

operations 79 screening is the process of evaluating an d selecting human sources and documents for the prioritized collection of information based on the collection requirements and mission of the unit conducting the screening or its high er headquarters screening categorizes and prioritizes sources based on the probability of particular source having priority information and the level of cooperation of the source scr eening is also used to determine if source matches certain criteria that indicate that the source should be referred to another agency screening is conducted at all echelons of command and in all operational environments there are two general categories of screening human source screening and document and media screening 710 media is screened for content which answers pirs or other information of intelligence interest screening operations also assist to determine which intelligence discip line or agency could best conduct the exploitation of given source screening operations include but are not limited to z tactical screening in support of combat or contingency operations z checkpoint screening mobile or static of local populations as they transit

during all operations in which there are detainees detention facilities where interrogation operations occur are normally located only at theater or jtf level debriefing operations 714 debriefing is the systematic questioning of coopera ting human sources to satisfy intelligence requirements consistent with applicable law the source is usually not in custody and is usually willing to cooperate debriefing may be conducted at all echelons and in all operational environments the primary categories of sources for debriefing are refugees émig rés displaced persons cal civilians and friendly forces friendly force debriefing operations 715 every member of the friendly force is poten tial source for humint collection friendly force personnel frequently have contact with the threat ci vilian population or the nvironment although many individuals report their information in the form of combat information many do not report the information do not realize its significance or do not know how to report key information frequently systematic questioning by trained humint collector will identify key information that can contribute to the intelligence picture and help an indi vidual recall

frequently utilized incorrectly and assigned missions that belong to ca mp ci interpreters translators or other operational specialties for which they are not trained or certified to conduct or supervise employing humint collectors in any capacity other than humint collection missions severely impacts their ability to answer intelligence requirements z humint collection capability humint collection capability is limited when commanders do not provide support specifically to the hct for the conduct of humint collection missions often hcts are required to travel with patrols in order to have mobility within the ao while this does get the hct off the base or camp it does not allow them the time or flexibility to conduct humint collection mission the nature of patrol missions requires them to keep on the move most of the time humint collection missions often require the hct to remain at location for extended periods in order for humint collection missions to be successful commanders must provide dedicated mission support to allow for this requirement z humint risk management maneuver commanders in weighing the risks associated with employing hcts should consider the potential loss of wealth of information such as enemy activities locations of highvalue personnel and thr eats to the force that th ey may incur if they restrict hct collection activities z humint legal obligations applicable us law and regulati ons and international law govern humint collection operations humint operations may be further restri cted by sofas and other agreements execution

imagery systems for profit in times of crises license agreements with the us government obligate us commercial satellite imaging systems to provide data only to the us government at the market value this protects information concerning us operations from threat exploitation from commercial systems such as the google earth however the us government could never afford to buy all the commercial

for imint is determining the need for imint products based on the pirs and the initial ipb the staff must clearly articulate their intelligence requirements to include communicating what the mission is and how the re quested product will aid in mission accomplishment the g2s2 should submit the imagery exploitation and collection requirements in the requirements management system using established procedures such as those in the units sop or as established by the combatant command 915 the g2s2 must also determine the specific imagery requirements to avoid burdening the system with unnecessary requests the desire for imagery products often exceeds the capabilities of the imaging system therefore it is imperative th at the g2s2 consider what type of analysis is needed and request only that which they require the specifications of the request for imint products often affect the timeliness of the response for example determining if vehicles are tanks takes less time and requires less resolution than determining the make model and capabilities of the tank 916 imint products to be considered for requirements by the g2s2 include z imagery to detect andor iden tify and locate for example sp ecific unit types equipment obstacles and potential field fortifications from which intelligence analysts are able to analyze enemy capabilities and develop possible coas z imagery to update maps and enhance the interpretation of information from maps detailed mission planning uses imagery to include stereo images for threedimensional viewing of the terrain and many other geospatial uses z moving target indicator mti and fullmotion video displays or products that provide an nrt picture of an objects movement by indicating its speed location and direction of travel mti

reporting it is difficult to separate imint reporting from imagery analysis in this discussion this is demonstrated by the three phases of imint reporting presented below all are dependent upon the timeliness requirements each phase represents different degree of analysis and period available to accomplish the exploitation of the imagery z first phase imagery analysis is the rapid exploitation of newly acquired imagery and reporting of imageryderived information within specified time from recei pt of imagery this phase satisfies pirs andor identifies changes or activity of immediate significance first phase imagery analysis results in an initial phase imagery report and is usually completed within 45 minutes after receipt of the imagery z second phase imagery analysis is the detailed exploitation of newly acquired imagery and the reporting of imageryderived intelligence and information while meeting the production and timeliness requirements other intelligence disc ipline source material may support second phase imagery as appropriate second phase imagery analysis results in supplemental imagery report z third phase imagery analysis is the detailed analysis of all available imagery pertinent to sir and the subsequent produc tion and reporting resulting from this an alysis within specified time this phase provides an organized detailed analysis of an imagery target or topic using imagery as the primary data source but incorporating data from other sources as appropriate 922 the two types of imagery exploitation are national and direct support z national exploitation is imagery exploitation that supports presidential requirements national security council requirements congressional requirements or requirements of common concern to the intelligence

when it is necessary to fulfill an assigned function there must also be link between the collection of the us person information and the army intelligence organizations assigned mission army intelligence components must xhaust the least intrusive collection means before requesting more intrusive collection means the following are additional considerations for internet collection z army intelligence components must use government computers to access the internet for official government business unless otherwise authorized z internet protocol addresses uniform resource cators urls and email addresses that are not selfevidently associated with us person may be acquired retained and processed by army intelligence components without making an effort to determine whether they are associated with us person as long as the component does not engage in analysis focused upon specific addresses once such analysis is initiated the army intelligence component must make reasonable and diligent inquiry to determine whether the data are associated with us person limitations 1110 intelligence personnel and organizations must comp ly with applicable dod directives and army regulations that govern contact with and collecti on of information from open sources for example dod directive 510020 prohibits sigint organizations from collecting and processing information from public broadcasts with exception of processing encrypted or hidden meaning passages ar 38013 prohibits the assignment of army personnel military or civilian to attend public or private meetings demonstrations or other similar activities held offpost to acquire ci i nvestigative information w ithout specific approval by the secretary or the unde r secretary of the army operations security 1111 more than any other intelligence discipline the osint discipline could unintentionally provide indicators of us military operations information generally available to the public as well as certain detectable activities such as opensource research and collection can reveal the existence of and sometimes details about classified or sensitiv information or undertakings such indicators may assist those seeking to neutralize or exploit us military operations purchasing documents searching an internet site or asking questions at public events are examples of detectab opensource research and collection techniques that could provide indicators of us plans and operations 1112 taking opsec into consideration organizations mu st determine what level of contact with open sources and which collection techniques might provide indicat ors that an enemy could piece together in time to affect us military operations in osint operations countermeasures range from limiting the frequency or duration of contact with source to prohibiting all contact with source if opsec so requires such as to protect government computer from hacker retaliation direct reporting unit commander may approve nonattributable internet access classification 1113 ar 3805 states that intelligence producers must be wary of applying so much security that they are unable to provide useful product to their consumers this is an appropriate warning for osint operations where concern for opsec can undermine th ability to disseminate inherently unclassified information as shown in table 111 the classification of source metadata collector metadata collected information and derivative intelligence differs based on the means of collection and the degree of damage to national security that disclosure of this information could reasonably be expected to cause since it is already in the public domain publicly available information and the source metadata are unclassified ar 3805 chapter 4

each of these situations could lead to the loss of access to the open source and information of intelligence value deception and bias 1117 deception and bias are of particular concern in osint operations unlike other disciplines osint operations do not normally coll ect information by direct obser vation of activities and conditions within the ao osint operations rely on secondary sour ces to collect and distribute information that the sources may not have observed themselves seconda ry sources such as government press offices commercial news organizations ngo s pokespersons and other information providers can intentionally or unintentionally add delete modify or otherwise filter the information they make available to the general public these sources may also convey one message in english for us or international consumption and different nonenglish message for local or regional c onsumption it is important to know the background of open sources and the purpose of the public information in order to distinguish objective factual information from information that lacks merit contains bias or is part of an effort to deceive the reader 1118 in addition to determining the reliability and validity of the information obtained during osint operations intelligence analysts must consider the biases and cultural b ackgrounds of civilian interpreters who may be used to translate or even search for relevant none nglish information these civilian interpreters may be local hires when deployed overseas and many civilian interpreters do not have security clearances

by exploiting foreign communications systems and noncommunications emitters jp 20 sigint provides unique intelligence information complements intelligence derived from other sources and is often used for cueing other sensors to potential targets of interest for example sigint which identifies activity of interest may be used to cue geoint to confirm that activity conversely changes detected by geoint can cue sigint collection against new targets the discipline is subdivided into three subcategor ies communications intellig ence comint electronic intelligence elint and foreign instrumentation signals intelligence fisint z comint is intelligence and technical information derived from collecting and processing intercepted foreign communications passed by ra dio wire or other electromagnetic means comint includes computer network exploitation which is gathering data from target or adversary automated information systems or networks comint also may include imagery when pictures or diagrams are encoded by computer network or radio frequency method for storage andor transmission the imag ery can be static or streaming z elint is intelligence derived from the interception and analysis of noncommunications emitters for example radar elint consists of two subcategories operational elint opelint and technical elint techelint opelint is concerned with operationally relevant information such as the location movement employment tactics and activity of foreign noncommunications emitters and their associated weapon systems techelint is concerned with the technical aspects of foreign noncommunications emitters such as signal characteristics modes functions associations capabilities limitations vulnerabilities and technology levels z fisint involves the technical analysis of data intercepted from foreign equipment and control systems such as telemetry electronic interrogators tracking fusing arming firing command systems and video datalinks role 122 sigint provides intelligence on threat capabilities disposition composition and intentions in addition sigint provides targeting information for the delivery of leth and nonlethal fires ultimately the role of sigint is to collect process and di sseminate sigint information in support of operations fundamentals 123 it is important that the g2s2 understand how sigint assets are organized not only within the army but also throughout dod the majority of sigint assets from all the armed services combined with national sigint assets work together to support commanders from the tactical to the

and materiel for the purposes of preventing technological surprise assessing foreign scien tific and technical capabilities and d eveloping countermeas ures designed to neutralize any adversarys technological advantages jp 20 role 132 strength of the us military is the diversity and extent of its technology base while the us is one of the world leaders in integrating technology the threat can achieve temporary technological advantage in certain areas by acquiring modern systems or by improvising new weapons the world arms market is willing to provide advanced systems to countries or individuals with the resources to pay for them concerted techint enterprise is vital to provi ding precise direction nd purpose to dod rd and exploitation process to ensure quick and efficient ne utralization of threat technological advantages and networks 133 the role of techint is to ensure that the warfighter understa nds the full technological capabilities of the threat with this understanding the us for ces can adopt appropriate countermeasures operations and tactics 134 techint has three goals within its role z to ensure the us armed forces maintain technological advantage against any threat z to provide timely relevant accurate pred ictive and tailored techint support to the warfighter throughout the full spectrum of milita ry operations this includes providing us forces intelligence information and training on foreign weapons systems to an extent that allows their use of cee z to provide analysis of certain design traits of foreign weapons systems as indicators of threat intent 135 techint includes the subset weapons technical intelligence wti which combines forensic science with techint for applicati on against irregular and nontraditional threats as such wti has four goals to forensically examine events andor vices or weapons to better understand linkages between technical design and tactical use to guide efforts of the protection warfighting function to enable targeting by identifying selecting prioritizing and tracking individuals and matching them with groups weapons materiel financiers suppliers insurgent leaders and other

5986 5987 fundamentals 136 the fundamentals of techint consist of techintwti application in the full spectrum of operations and the importance of chain of custody see fm 2224 for more information techintwti application in full spectrum operations 137 techint assets are capable of responding to threats throughout the full spectrum of operations traditional techint capabilities are best suited to meet the needs of commanders in general war for example the equipment used in general war consists of traditional threat weapons systems for example tanks missiles atgms as such techint is capable of quickly identifying the visible and other indications of new weapons improve d munitions or modifications th at could potentially defeat us equipment 138 the knowledge gained through techint exploitati on and analysis also provides the necessary intelligence reach cap ability for operations that include lower vels of violence unlike general warfare threat forces are not easily identified and often nontrad itional andor irregular thr eats take refuge in plain sight though the combination of forensic science and techint wit provides commanders the ability to identify threat networks and their members this is accomplished by li nking individuals with events and materials that are intended to do harm to us forces indisputably wti assumes primacy in operations related to stable peace through insurgency 139 techint and wti can be used simultaneously when commanders anticipate or encounter mix set of threats also the unique capabilities of wti can be scaled to complete missions related to high priority objectives in general war for example the detainme nt of government officials political party leaders military commanders scientists and engineers these detainments can significantly shape the operations by informing commanders on threat equipment capabilities and can affect planning in persistent conflicts when level of violence decreases chain of custody 1310 the proper documentation of captured enemy equipment cee and captured enemy materiel cem is key factor in producing accurate and rele vant techint for the commander for example the capture location or the employment of material and associated material can link significant point of interest that can yield exploitable information 1311 specifically the proliferation of weapons from nation states and nonstate actors can reveal third party influences properly recorded weapons empl acement can identify the ffectiveness of weapons against us forces and docex can identify new tactics of weapon employment thus increasing effectiveness additionally proper chain of custody is necessary in linking individuals and threat networks with weapons and material andor events the inform ation gained through exploitation may eventually be used in us or hn legal proceedings the techint enterprise 1312 the techint enterprise consists of multiple entities within the army working in concert with

intelligence on the threat this does not only concern weapons the threat may possess but also other equipment such as frequency hopping and spread spectrum communications or sonarelusive minisubmarines regardless of the technology our forces must understand techint characteristics and how the threat will employ technology in the ao long before they deploy into it only then can forces

the framework and process to access prioritize and employ the armys limited organic linguist resources linguistic support categories b2 foreign language support requirements of us armed forces typically fall into one of four broad categories z intelligence and information collection this category includes the traditional sigint and humint disciplines as well as foreign language support to protection and exploitation of opensource information z operations and multinational liaison this category includes the coordination of military operations and liaison with multinational partners previously unaffiliated nations and at times adversary or former adversary nations multinational operations are becoming more common and increasingly important z civil affairs activities ca activities enhance the relationship between civil authorities in areas with military forces they involve applying ca functional specialty skills to areas normally under the responsibility of civil government these operations involve estab lishing maintaining influencing or exploiting rela tions between military forces and all levels of hn government agencies these activities are fundamental to executing stability tasks ca personnel other army forces other government agencies or combination of all three perform these tasks foreign language support is critical to ca in areas such as government liaison legal agreements medical support and operations law enforcement engineering projects public safety security and population control and psyop z sustainment this category consists of foreign language support to sustainment functions these functions include logistical contracting port railhead airhead or transshipment operations and convoy operations determining linguist requirements b3 to identify linguist requirements the staff conducts mission analysis and identifies specified or implied tasks requiring foreign langua ge support other critical factors are the organization or echelon of command and the location of the mission the staff us these criteria to determine the allocation of linguists such as one linguist team per echelon of command one linguist per piece of equipment or one

the military system are not subject to deployment restrictions limiting factor with civilian linguists have security clearance and as us personnel support the commands interests the major disadvantage

advantage of being trained soldiers and are therefore readily deployable throughout the ao b19 these soldiers may have the specific vocabular and military skill knowledge for certain linguist support missions for example supply sergeant who speaks the local language would be an invaluable asset to the g4 there are disadvant ages in that they already have nother job and units are reluctant to give

their language ability is important because in many cases they use old fashioned terms or interject us idioms if the linguists are recent émigrés the use of the language in their country of origin could be dangerous to them or their loyalty may reside with their own country religious group tribal affiliations or other close connec tions when at odds with us interests multinational linguists b22 multinational linguists have their own set of advantages and disa dvantages these linguists may be unfamiliar with the us military system unless they have previously participated in multinational operation with us forces they may have security clearance but clearances are not necessarily equal or reciprocal automatically guaranteei ng access to classified or sensitive information between nations they support the commands interest but may have differing priorities or responsibilitie s within their assigned aos these linguists also are already fulfilling specific duties for their ow n nation which may also have shortage of linguists the major di sadvantage to acquiring and maintain ing multinational linguist support is that they are outside the military authority of us fo rces and not under us military contract these linguists will be valuable in multinational operations centers and activities local national contract linguists b23 ln hires will provide the bulk of linguist support they are usually less expensive to hire than us civilians and will know the local dialect idioms and cu lture the expertise of these linguists in particular areas or subject matters can be an asset however th ere are several potential problems with using ln hires to include limited english skills and loyalty considera tions therefore screening interview or test is necessary to determine their proficiency in english these individuals also must be carefully selected and screened by ci personnel with us linguist s upport initially and periodically throughout their employment their loyalty is always questionable local prejudices may influence them and they may place their own interests above those of the us evaluating linguist proficiency b24 commanders and staffs must

modes speech to text and text to text devices can be used to monitor foreign broadcast media b45 oneway devices can be loaded with series of relevant questions andor commands or instructions based on

to prayer can later be analyzed for its content limitations b47 all translation devices are limited to the content of their programs oneway devices depend on the intended recipient acknowledging the preprogrammed phrases with simple yes or responses or an indication that the recipient understands by their actions b48 sophisticated twoway devices interpret cultural nd linguistic nuances as well as simple word for word translation regardless of th accuracy of the device machines can still only transl ate words they cannot include the unspoken social and cultural subtexts that are also component of any conversation additionally local dialects may dictate the meanings of specific words or phrases which may not be taken into account by the device users must always be aware of the possibility of
