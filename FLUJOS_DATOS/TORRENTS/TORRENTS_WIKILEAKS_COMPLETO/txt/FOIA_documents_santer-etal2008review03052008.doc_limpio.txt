national climatic data center manuscript review to author thomas r karl from reviewer imke durre date 030508 manuscript title consistency of modelled and observed temperature trends in the tropical troposphere authors b d santer et publication medium proposed international journal of climatology recommendation submission after minor revisions this is comprehensive treatment of the statistical considerations necessary when comparing observed and simulated trends and sheds new light on the nature of the differences between modelled and observed trends in the tropics most of my below comments are minor 1 my only somewhat major comment is that i am wondering whether the results based on radiosonde data could not be integrated more into the paper both in the abstract and in the paper itself they currently appear more as an appendage leaving wondering why not all analyses were extended to these data sets as well i recognize the limitations of spatial coverage inherent in radiosonde data yet including them in the discussion of section 5 would also be consistent with the introduction and help to put into context the results of section 7 if there is specific reason why most of the paper emphasizes the satellitebased data sets it would be worth clarifying this reason in the abstract and early in the paper otherwise the radiosondebased results could be further integrated into the paper by doing some or all of the following adding entries for each of the radiosondebased datasets in tables 1 and 3 and perhaps tables 2 and 4 if feasible adding some statement to section 51 about the number of rejections of the null hypothesis that take place if the radiosondebased datasets are used to represent the observed record moving section 7 into new section 52 or reversing the order of sections 6 and 7 and if it makes sense viewing all the satellite and radiosondebased data sets as realizations of the observations developing joint confidence interval based on all of them and testing how many of the simulated trends fall within that confidence interval 2 it seems that sections 1 and 8 could be shortened considerably without compromising content since some of the material covered on pages 4 and 5 seems to be repeated later in this section in section 8 it does not seem necessary to review all the background regarding the discrepancies between trends in models and observations yet i found that the first few paragraphs of section 8 provided clearer introduction to the topic at hand and to the rationale for this paper than section 1 consequently it would be valuable to shorten the review in section 8 and instead incorporate these paragraphs into the introduction replacing much of the material on pages 46 3 page 8 appendix 2 should be mentioned when outlining the remainder of the paper at the end of section 1 5 page 13 in footnote 5 the acronym ghg should be defined 6 page 20 our subsequent discussion of paired trend test results section 5 deals exclusively with results computed with adjusted standard errors rather than with the naive and incorrect unadjusted standard errors suggest changing this to our subsequent discussion of paired trend test results section 5 deals exclusively with results computed with the statistically appropriate adjusted standard errors it seems more constructive to focus on the strength of your approach than to include negative statements about dcps07 in large part the rigor of your presentation speaks for itself and limiting negative statements to few strategic places avoids compromising that rigor 7 page 21 bottom there are however several reasons why the dcps07 test is illogical and inappropriate in the interest of being more constructive changed to there are however several reasons why the dcps07 test can erroneously lead to rejection of the null hypothesis 8 page 22 the adjusted 2a confidence interval on the rss t2lt trend includes 47 of the 49 simulated trends could the results for uah be mentioned here as well since both are shown in the figure 9 page 24 trends over 1979 over 2006 change to trends over 1979 through 2006 10 page 29 bottom smith and reynold 2005 change to smith and reynolds 2005 11 page 32 the paper generally seems to have preference for using the rss data as an example so it seems somewhat arbitrary to now use parameters corresponding to the uah data for the synthetic experiments it would be useful to indicate why the uah parameters were chosen eg for comparison with dcps07 and whether the results of your experiments are the same if the properties of the rss data are used instead 12page 47 the allen and sherwood paper is longer in press so its volume number and page numbers can be added 13 page 55 references the sherwood et 2008 citation that appears in section 8 seems to be missing here 14 page 5860 appendix 1 the terms relevant to the calculations based on observed time series should also be included in this appendix 15 page 61 appendix 2 given the large sample sizes nt 252 this choice has little impact on the naive unadjusted standard errors but does affect the adjusted standard errors delete naive 16 page 66 caption to figure 7 delete deep in the deep tropics since the same region is referred to as the tropics throughout the rest of the paper and figure captions 17 page 69 caption to table 4 delete deep before tropics 18tables 1 and 3 what is the value of showing the properties of the multi model standard deviation is this time series computed by calculating the standard deviation among all 49 realizations for each point in time if the entries for this time series are retained perhaps some explanation in the caption of table 1 would be helpful 19 table 3 in the lines referring to the multimodel means and standard deviations should it say t2lt rather than rsst2lt
