raja rogers meeting notes january 30 2007 raja rogers vaidya may be available for our area lexington jeff murphy yes but need to accommodate him around the raos hous ing jane b vero beach would have 10 people helen has an old cds on cardiovascular health and tm still current dr chris clark could give public lecture to stir up interest jeff murphy that is the one for cme credits for doctors so only pertinent to doctors stuart probably doesnt have last years study the longe vity study from may nor the jan 06 study from amer journal on hypertension nor the ama study from this year jane b all right to give out cd along with the three articles stuart yes good for doctors i have pdf files of all three articles june 06 archives of internal medicine ama study may 05 amer journal of card longe vity study jan 05 amer journal of hypertension jane b is it okay to especially invite doctors not to encourage now raja rogers thats right say more about what you would do hold off on that and let do some checking with international re doctors maharishi doesnt want to give the authority to allopathic medicine of course if we need it we use it but judiciously maharishi has pointed out that medicine can kill people literally they are currently working on setting up mav clinics in europe so far mention of bringing in allopathic doctors tendency is vedic approach we are our own authority in that dr stuart and dr chris are experts in pulse there has been some melting of the ice in the direction of having doctors participate more so to say jeff murphy vaidya does not need to have western md with them stuart depends on how they define the practice of medicine the lawyers need to express an opinion on this elaine last year when we were considering vaidya tour for our domain checked with mved they did not require an md in the consults let know if interested in vaidya tour alcine we would like to invite the vaidya to stay with us in gainesville as home base while in fl phone consultation raja rogers yes we can do that from the raj guideline for vaidyas on tour we dont diagnos and dont prescribe we have to go over that with the vaidya and train him we offer traditional av health assessment they just say this dosha is in or out of balance use form where the patient tells us the conditions that they are perceiving that way we can talk about their condition but we are not diagnos ing because they already told us about it more like health coaching when it comes to diagnos ing vaidya can just suggest changes in lifestyle to help their digestion or whatever they have vaidya can have the mapi catalog there and can point to something for condition that they told us they had disclaimer on bottles protects us if vaidya thinks something stronge r is needed then they can say theres this other herb combo called ma and you can choos if vaidya gives them the choice he is not really prescribing thats the way we have had to handle it when there is not doctor there this is the general guideline always good to double and triple check with lawyers to see if there is something that has come up stuart or chris could be there alcine what about drs who are interested but had av training in the past from the movement can they sit in and then the doctor and vaidya talk in another room and the doctor comes back and gives the instructions raja rogers yes that would be okay alcine we have another dr that had training in av from another system and one that has av training raja rogers the dr would need to be someone we know and need to be at least strong meditator so you are all set jane b if someone who is more involved in the movement has medical problem where is best to go where they can have medical prescription raja rogers lets address that when it arises we have vaidya manoha r here he works with dr robert schneider call if that comes up jane b movement people may be disappointed that vaidya does not diagnose raja rogers for everyone like that you could have dr clark there in vero and he could give the info needed how are initiations has anyone been called by the national call center jane b yes we had two calls it works beautifully raja rogers its only for the 888learntm number stuart we had 3 people referred to us from call center one came to intro last night and is scheduled to learn using citiassist one we havent been able to reach the other course fee was deterrent alcine we had one in gainesville very interested jeff moses weve had steady stream from new orleans baton rouge mobile call center coordinators are excellent we get back to them right away or at latest within 24 hrs 2 have started because of call center raja rogers stuart brough t up very good point we dont want to forget about the citiassist loan program jeff and ruth how is your situation ruth moses not stable yet will have to go back in march to ct jane b there is lady who is very interested in the school project in new orleans ruth new orleans and baton rouge are ripe and ready to learn someone younge r would be good for them to commit to year there or new recert raja rogers we have two areas that need fulltime teachers is one and atlanta is another dori and steve are moving to ff for year they have been teaching in atlanta long time if anyone has any ideas of people please let know jane b would ruth or sylvia be able to teach the lady in new orleans interested in school program ruth sylvia will be back only for week in march her dad needs her in ff today jeff got call from guy living in fema trailer who wants to learn so if we get 34 people interested we can go there last time teaching in baton rouge we spent 700800 for gas and hotel and meals so we will see if we can get more interested and then we will go raja rogers yes everyone should remain rested maharishi has talked about good food good rest and good program recently on jan 25 strong lecture initiation is important too as we get good cosmic boos t when we are rested we then go out and spend the energy judiciously its like the seasons we let nature organize jeff moses between atlanta and baton rouge atlanta seems like the priority if the movement would organize for something in new orleans there would be tremendous respons because of the need there raja rogers yes an ongoi ng issue is finances because so many things are being done now in the movement however we also need teachers i encourage people to come to ff to recharge their batteries like the atr courses however the work in the field is very important to achieve the goal of inv america we need to start people to meditate and bring them along to be sidhas we all have different dharma if i didnt have the respons ibilities now i would love to be out teaching teaching is wonde rful but need to be fully rested alcine psychologist called to say they were playing some of our programs on the university station do we have tapes or programs that we could offer them to play raja rogers yes once you are clear about what they are playing i can look into it elaine dr rao and lakshmi are back in lexington if you are interested in tour please notify center needs to have 56 for cic or 6 ats for them to travel there while at center they will be happy to do mvvt raja rogers jai guru dev
