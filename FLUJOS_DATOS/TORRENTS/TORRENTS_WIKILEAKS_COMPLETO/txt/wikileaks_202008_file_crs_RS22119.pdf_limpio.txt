chinese investment and trade will always be constrained by the economic advantages conferred by us geographic proximity to latin america furthermore they indicate that migration patterns to the united states from central and south american c ountries have given the united states greater cultural ties and longerterm economic importance to th region than china could ever have adherents of this view

is consistent with the long standing us policy of integrating china into the world system20 administration views in the hearing before the house western hemisphere subcommittee administration

pardo maurer testified that there is evidence that chinese military activities in the western hemisphere including arms sales pose direct conventional threat to the united states21 nevertheless

application in the region he maintained that the united states would encourage the nations in the hemisphere to take close look at how such activities could possibly be used against them or the united
