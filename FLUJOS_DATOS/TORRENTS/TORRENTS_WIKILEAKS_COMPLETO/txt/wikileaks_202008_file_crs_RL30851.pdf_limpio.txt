surpluses in the federal budget and on whether or not to use at least part of the surpluses to finance tax cuts in 1999 the budget situation was this there was an overall surplus in the federal budget for fy1999 but the surplus consisted exclusively of surpluses in the off budget accounts primarily that in the social security accou nts the onbudget accounts remain ed in deficit in fy1999 but were projected to move into surplus in fy2000 with its fy2000 budget proposal in february 1999 the clinton administration proposed to save the surpluses in the social security accounts by using them to pay down the federal debt at the same time the president proposed to use the projected onbudget surpluses to finance modest tax cut 327 billion over 10 years and to provide added funding for medicare defense spending and number of other programs congressional republicans likewise proposed to use the offbudget surpluses to pay down the federal debt but proposed using most of the projected onbudget surpluses to finance larger tax cut the congressional budget resolution for fy2000 called for tax cut of 792 billion over 10 years in august congress passed the taxpayer refund and relief act of 1999 trra hr 2488 which contained the tax cut proposed in the budget resolution president clinton vetoed the bill stating that the tax cut was too large and would have undesirable distributional effects the debate in 2000 the general terms of the debate over tax policy remained much the same in 2000 as in 1999 how much of the surplus should be used for federal debt reduction for spending programs and for tax cuts the budget resolution passed by congress on april 13 hconres 290 called for fiveyear tax cut of 175 billion the presidents fy2001 budget plan which has not been adopted called for smaller tax cut of 168 billion over 10 years while the terms of the 2000 debate carried over from 1999 the legislative approach in congress was different congress revisited many of the tax cuts contained in the trra but with more incremental approach passing various parts of the tax cut as standalone bills the most prominent of the congressional tax cut bills were phaseout of the estate and gift tax hr 8 passed by the house on june 9 and the senate on july 14 and tax cut for married couples hr 4810 passed byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30851crs2 the house on july 20 and by the senate on july 21 other prominent tax cut bills included tax cut for small businesses linked to minimum wage increase hr 3810 in the house passed on march 9 hr 833 in the senate passed on february 1 containing tax cuts for small business linked to minimum wage pension reform bill that included provisions that would increase over three years annual contribution limits on individual retirement accounts from current laws 2000 to 5000 hr 1102 passed by the house on july 19 later passed again by the house as part of hr 5173 and measure repealing of the 3 federal telecommunications excise tax included in hr 4516 an appropriations bill that was passed by the house on september 14 and the by the senate on october 12 the president vetoed the telephone excise tax repeal as well as both the estate tax bill and the tax cut for married couples in the case of the latter two bills he argued that an insufficient share of their benefits would accrue to middle and lower income persons the president also argued that the tax cut for couples was poorly targeted the legislative year drew to close with congress considering hr 2614 bill that repackaged number of measures that had been passed by the house or senate over the course of the year including tax cuts linked with small businesses and minimum wage increase numerous pension measures and tax benefits for economically distressed communities president clinton stated that he would veto hr 2614 and the senate did not consider the meas ure the 106th congress came to close with congress passing and the president signing two more narrow tax measures hr 4577 an appropriations bill included number of tax benefits designed to assist economically distressed communities hr 4986 contained provision replacing the foreign sales corporation fsc export tax benefit with new benefit similar in magnitude to fsc in respo nse to complaint by the european union world trade organization wto panel in 1999 ruled that fsc violated the agreements on which the wto is based and that prohibit export subsidies hr 4986s new benefit is designed to be wtocompliant although the eu remains skeptical and has asked the wto to rule on the new provisions we next step back from the legislative details and look at the economic context in which tax policy was debated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30851crs3 1authored by gregg esenwein specialist in public finance government and finance divisionthe economic context federal tax burden1 in 2000 many supporters of tax cut pointed to the relatively high aggregate level of taxes compared to the economy as percent of gross domestic product gdp federal taxes were at their highest level since the end of world war ii 200 in fiscal year 1999 and 206 in 2000 this was not however dramatic departure from past levels since the mid 1950s federal taxes as percentage of gdp have remained within range of between 17 and just below 20 of gdp growth in the economy combined with federal legislation to reduce the budget deficit tax increases in 1990 and 1993 produced slight increase in federal revenues as percentage of gdp over the last several years in fy1990 federal taxes accounted for only 180 of gdp while there were some fluctuations in the distribution of the federal tax burden over the last 20 years the fluctuations were concentrated at the ends of the income spectrum during the 1980s the federal tax burden increased for lowerincome families and decreased for upper income families this trend was reversed in the 1990s with tax reductions at the lower end of the income spectrum and tax increases at the upper end of the income spectrum families in the middle income brackets however experienced very little change in their federal tax burdens over this period despite legislated tax cuts some of the benefits of the tax changes contained in the 1997 act did not necessarily accrue to middleincome families the 500 child tax credi t has likely reduced federal taxes for middle income families but only those families with qualifying children the benefits of reductions in the tax on capital gains expanded iras and other savin gs and investment incentives have probably tended to accrue to families at the upper end of the income spectrum economic performance many of the tax proposals considered in 2000 were intended to boost longterm growth by increasing private saving and investment thereby expanding the nations capital stock the impact of these various proposals on saving is perhaps the most prominent economic performance issue the proposals present first can tax incentives for saving or tax benefits for investment actually boost the nations rate of private saving and investment second total national saving consists of private saving minus government borrowing thus is any expansion the proposals may cause in private saving larger than any increase they also cause in the federal budget deficit or decrease in the federal budget surplus if provisions actually cause an increase in total national saving the nations capital stock expands resulting in higher economic growth yet economic analysis is not clear on whether and by how much private savings responds to tax incentiveshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30851crs4 2bna daily tax report october 27 2000 p gg1a number of the tax provisions that were considered provided favorable tax treatment to particular types of economic activity extending special tax credits deductions or exclusions to certain activities economic theory suggests that favorable treatment for specified activities can distort the economys ordinary decision making and channel more resources into the favored activity than would otherwise occur since the economys resources are limited this also means that resources are simultaneously drawn away from activities that are not taxfavored the question that economic analysis pursues is whether specific intervention in resource allocation actually improves overall economic performance an important aspect of any tax proposal is its effect on federal revenues and the federal budget deficit or surplus deficit reduction has been primary focus of budget debates over the past several years the effects on federal revenue of several elements of the various tax proposals have been questioned for instance as noted earlier economic analysis does not provide clearcut answers about the extent to which economic activity might increase in response to tax incentives as result the ultimate revenue effects of broadba sed tax cuts or tax incentives for saving are unclear in addition several changes notably those involving iras depreciation and capital gains would likely register much larger revenue impact number of years in the future rather than in the near term thus revenue estimates confined to these proposals first few years do not show the potential longrun magnitude of their revenue loss their supporters however generally argue that the measures would stimulate economic growth that would shrink any revenue loss we next take closer look at the most prominent of the specific tax proposals major tax proposals the taxpayer relief act of 2000 part of hr 2614 the last major piece of tax legislation considered by the 106th congress was the taxpayer relief act of 2000 which was incorporated into hr 2614 nontax small business bill according to the joint committee on taxation the tax provisions would have reduced revenue by an estimated 739 billion over five years and 240 billion over 10 years its principal elements were in many cases provisions previously passed by the house andor senate as parts of other bills and fell into five groups proposal to replace current laws foreign sales corporation fsc tax benefit for exporting tax benefits for small business that were linked to legislation raising the minimum wage tax cuts related to health care pension tax provi sions and school construction provisions hr 2614 was passed by the house on october 26 however president clinton threatened to veto the bill stating that it was not bipar tisan product and ignored certain democratic concerns2 the senate never voted on the measurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30851crs5 the bill included an increase in the minimum wage and with it set of tax benefits for small business similar to those in previous house and senate minimum wage bills hr 2614 included an increase in the business meals tax deduction to 70 from current laws 50 an incre ase in the expensing tax benefit for investment to 35000 from current laws 20000 and an extension of the work opportunity tax credit through june 2004 the healt h care provisions related primarily to insurance they included an abovetheline deduction deduction that can be claimed by nonitemizers for health insurance in cases where individuals pay at least 50 of their insurance costs an abovetheline dedu ction for longterm care insurance the bill also moved up from 2003 to 2001 the effective date on which selfemployed persons can deduct 100 of their health insurance the bill also extended the deduction to persons choosing not to participate in an employersubsidized plan the bill contained numerous taxrelated retirement and pension provisions the most prominent however were those related to individual retirement accounts iras the bill provided phasedin increase of the annual contribution limit from current laws 2000 to 5000 the limit would be indexed hr 2614s school construction provisions generally relax certain rules that apply to taxexempt schoolconstruction bonds issued by state and local governments among the bills provisions are liberalized arbitrage provi sions that lengthen to four years from two years the period of time within which governments must spend bond proceeds the bill also creates new kind class of qualified zone academy bond that like other zone academy bonds provides federal tax credit to purchasers rather than interest payments the community revitalizatio n provisions contain number of tax benefits designed to assist economically distressed communities along with number of other provisions the bill would designate 40 new renewal communities and nine new empowerment zones within which employers would receive wage credits and businesses would receive an additional investment expensing allowance the bill would also increase current laws low income housing tax credit hr 2614 also contained provision that replaced current laws foreign sales corporation fsc with new export tax benefit the countries of the european union eu had charged that the fsc provisions constituted an export subsidy and therefore contravened the world trade organization wto agreements wto panel subsequently issued report that supported the eus charge and under wto procedures the united states was required to bring its tax provisions into compliance by october 1 2000 the eu agreed to extend the deadline to november 1 the administration supported the fscreplacement provisions in hr 2614 but as noted above threatened to veto the bill for other reasons accordingly the senate passed hr 4986 standalone set of fsc provisions the house passed the same version of hr 4986 on november 14 following the elections the president signed the measure into law on november 15 public law 106519httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30851crs6 the death tax elimination act hr 8 hr 8 proposed to phase down then completely repeal the federal estate and gift tax the phasedown would have gradually reduced the tax rates currently applicable to estates over the period 200109 full repeal was to be effective in 2010 in 2010 the bill also would have repealed current laws step up in basis available for inherited assets that have appreciated in value over decedents lifetime under current law when person inherits an asset and subsequently sells it the basis of the asset the amount that can be deducted from the sales price in calculating capital gains under the income tax is its value at the time of death with two exceptions hr 8 replaced this step up in basis with carryover basis that is when an inherited asset is sold its basis in the hands of the beneficiary is the basis it had in the hands of the decedent the step up in basis was retained for decedents property up to 13 million and to property transferred to spouse up to 3 million hr 8 was approved by the house on june 9 and by the senate on july 14 the president vetoed the measure on august 31 arguing that it was fiscally irresponsible and not fair the joint committee on taxation estimated the fiveyear revenue cost of the bill at 28 billion tax cuts for married couples hr 4810 the marriage tax penalty relief act hr 6 was initially approved by the full house on february 10 the same bill was again passed by the house on july 12 as hr 4810 the house bill took the same approach to taxes paid by married couples as did the trra in 1999 the proposal made four changes standard deduction for married couples expanded to twice that of singles increases in the beginning and end points of the earned income tax credits phaseout range and phasedin doubling for married couples of the width of the lowest 15 tax bracket the bill also repealed restrictions on refundable persona l tax credits under the alternative minimum tax according to joint tax committee estimates the proposal would result in revenue loss of 1823 billion over 10 years by comparison the total net revenue loss estimated for the trra was 792 billion over 10 years president clintons proposal for married couples would reduce revenues by an estimated 45 billion on march 30 the senate finance committee approved bill reducing the marriage penalty that was estimated to reduce revenues by 2478 billion over 10 years the bill contained the same basic provisions as hr 4810 but with two additions the bill doubled the width of the 28 tax bracket for couples not just the 15 bracket the bill also made permanent the full creditability of nonrefundable credits against the alternative minimum tax amt and provided that refund able credits would not be reduced by the amt the bill was approved by the full senate on july 17 as an amended version of hr 4810 conference committee version of the bill was approved by the house on july 20 and the senate on july 21 as with both the house and senate bills thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30851crs7 3bna daily tax report august 8 2000 p g2conference bill doubled the standard deduction for couples as in the house bill it increased the beginning and end points of the earned income tax credits phaseout by 2000 as with the house bill the conference measure doubled the width of the 15 rate bracket for couples but not that of the 28 bracket the widening was phased in over the period 200004 the bill also permitted nonrefundable credits to offset the amt and beginning in 2002 provided that the refundable child credit and earned income tax credit were not to be reduced by the amt on august 5 the president vetoed hr 4810 arguing that its revenue cost was excessive and that too large share of the tax cut would accrue to couples currently receiving marriage tax bonus rather than marriage tax penalty3 tax benefits for education hr 7 and s 1134 on march 2 the senate approved s 1134 bill containing number of tax benefits for education on march 22 the house committee on ways and means also approved an education bill hr 7 but the full house did not act on the measure before the end of the year prominent provisions of both bills were an expansion of education savings account contribution limits to 2000 from current laws 500 along with extension of qualified withdrawals to include primary and secondary school expenses in addition to current laws college costs both bills also expanded current laws qualified tax favored tuition programs to include private as well as state institutions and excluded distributions from gross income both the ways and means and senate bills repealed the 60month limit on student interest deductions the ways and means bill increased the related income thresholds for the provisions phaseout both bills provided new four year expendit ure schedule for school construction bonds under the tax codes arbitrage rebate rules this bond provision was subsequently included in hr 2614 passed by the house on october 26 the major difference between the two bills was the presence in the senate bill of permanent exclusion from gross income for employerprovided under graduate and graduate education assistance according to joint tax committee estimates the senate bill would reduce revenues by 77 billion over five years and 213 billion over 10 years the ways and means bill would reduce revenue by an estimated 38 billion over five years and 116 billion over 10 years taxes and minimum wage legislation hr 3081 s 625 and hr 833 the full senate and the house ways and means committee each passed bills on november 9 1999 that would increase the minimum hourly wage by 1 over three years both bills also contained tax provisions designed to reduce business taxes alonghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30851crs8 with the increase in the minimum wage on february 1 2000 the senate folded the minimum wage and associated tax provisions of s 625 into broad bill relating to bankruptcy hr 833 the senate subsequently approved the measure on march 9 the full house passed tax cut bill linked with other legislation increasing the minimum wage the bill was patterned after tax cuts approved in november 1999 by the ways and means committ ee and that were contained in an earlier version of the minimum wage bill the tax cuts were initially passed as part of hr 3832 but were then combined with housepassed minimum wage legislation as part of hr 3081 according to joint tax committee estimates the tax cuts would reduce revenues by 457 billion over five years it contains revenue raising offsets prominent provisions of the bill include reduction in estate and gift tax rates the largest tax cut in the bill see also however hr 8 which would gradually repeal the estate taxan increase in the expensing tax benefit for small business investment to 30000 permitting the immediate deduction of amounts that would otherwise be depreciated over number of years rescission of the repeal of the installment method of accounting that was enacted in 1999 as part of the extenders bill hr 1180 acceleration of the scheduled phasein of 100 deduction for the health insurance costs of self employed individuals an increase in the portion of business meals that can be deducted to 60 from current laws 50 an increase in contribution limits for qualified pension plans with other pension changes and tax benefits directed at economically distressed areas the provisions were similar to measures included in the small business and pension portions of the vetoed taxpayer refund and relief act of 1999 hr 2488 the senatepassed tax provisions associated with its minimum wage bill were quite similar to those of the ways and means bill but with few differences the senate bill contained the same acceleration of the full deductibility of health insurance for the self employed however it also provided for phasedin abovetheline dedu ction for health and longtermcare insurance for individuals not covered by employment related plans the senate bill also increased the investment expensing allowance to 30000 compared to 25000 under the ways and means committee bill and allowed 80 of business meals and entertainment expenses of small businesses to be deductible it made the work opportunity tax credit permanent the senate measure did not contain the estate tax provisions contained in hr 3081 when it was initially passed the senate bill contained several items that would increase revenues these items an increase related to installment sales and one for real estate investment trusts reits were later enacted with hr 1180 according to recent estimates by the joint committee on taxation the senatepassed tax provisions of hr 833 would reduce revenue by 257 billion over five yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30851crs9 4 bna daily tax report july 13 2000 p g7according to news reports procedural issues delayed consideration of the bill by conference committee4 the issues are related to the constitutions requirement that tax bills originate in the house rather than the senate the house version of the bankruptcy bill contains tax provisions the administration stated its opposition to the manner in which the congressional bills would implement their 1 increase in the minimum wage the 1 increase would occur over three years in three annual installments the administration favored implementing the 1 over two years in addition the administration and some congre ssional democrats have voiced opposition to the minimum wage bills tax cuts arguing they are risky and favor upperincome individuals on october 26 the house passed the taxpayer relief act of 2000 as part of hr 2614 nontax small business bill the bill included in slightly modified form the minimum wagerelated tax provisions initially passed as part of hr 3081 proposals in the presidents fy2001 budget on february 7 2000 the clinton administration published details of the tax and other budget proposals the president had previously outlined in his state of the union message in broad terms the president proposed gross tax cuts totaling 350 billion over 10 years according to administration estimates partly offset by revenueraising measures of 182 billion the proposed net tax cut was thus an estimated 168 billion over 10 years in substance the tax proposals were selective for the most part applying to variety of narrow areas rather than acrosstheboard in general the tax cuts were aimed at particular goals and activities favored by the administration prominent areas proposed for tax relief included married couples retirement saving child care education longterm care and persons covered by the minimum tax the largest revenueraising measure was an incre ase in tobacco taxes other revenue raising items were small narrow and varied and included variety of measures aimed at what the administration identified as unwarranted tax benefits and corporate tax shelters congress did not take action on the majority of the presidents proposals during 2000 the taxpayer refund and relief act of 1999 hr 2488 the fy2000 budget resolution congress passed in april 1999 called for tax cut of 792 billion over 10 years on july 22 the house approved plan hr 2488 to cut taxes by the 792 billion specified in the budget the full senate approved tax cut bill on july 30 like the house bill the senate plan proposed to cut taxes by 792 billion but differed in its details on august 4 conference committee version of the bill was completed and both the house and the senate approved the measure on august 5 however president clinton vetoed the bill on september 23 like the house and senate bills before it the conference version of hr 2488 contained tax cut estimated at 792 billion over its first 10 years prominent feature of the conference bill was that number of its largest provisions for example the rate reductions and marriage penalty relief expire sunset afterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30851crs10 2008 also in provision taken from the house bill the conference bills rate reductions were contingent on federal debt reduction the centerpi ece of hr 2488s tax cuts was an acrosstheboard reduction in individual tax rates it provided for each individual income tax rate to be reduced by one percen tage point on phasedin basis thus for example the 15 rate was reduced to 14 in 2003 and thereafter the remaining rates were scheduled to be reduced in 2005 and thereafter other prominent provisions of hr 2488 included addres sing the marriage tax penalty by making the standard deduction for coup twice that of singles and by increasing the new 14 bracket for couples to twice that of the singles bracket the bill also addressed the effect of marriage on the earned income credit by increasing the income range over which the credit is phased out for joint returns an increase in the rate of the dependent care tax credit phasedin abovetheline deduction for health insurance expenditures and longterm care insurance expansion of taxfavored education savings accounts including an increase in the contribution limit and their extension to primary and secondary education expenses reductions in capital gains tax rates the bill cut the current 20 and 10 rates to 18 and 8 respectively assets were to be indexed for inflation occurring after 1999 along with other ira expansi ons an increase in allowable annual ira contribution limits to 5000 from current laws 2000

the estate and gift tax permitting usbased multinationals to use socalled worldwide allocation of interest expense in calculating their foreign tax credits extending number of expiring tax benefits for varying periods of time in addition to its tax cuts the bill contained small number of revenueraising provisions the revenue raisers were generally narrow in scope and small in size while they were scattered throughout the tax code they generally would have applied to business and investment incomehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30851crs11 5authored by gregg esenw ein specialist in public finance government and finance division 6authored by sal lazzari specialist in public finance resources science and industry divisiona closer look at selected issues marriage tax penalties and bonuses5 defining the married couple as single tax unit as does the current federal individual income tax conflicts with the princi ple of marriage neutrality marriage neutrality means that the tax system should not influence the choice of individuals with regard to their marital status however under the current federal income tax system some married couples pay more income tax than they would as two unmarried singles marriage tax penalty while other married couples pay less income tax than they would as two unmarried singles marriage tax bonus marriageneutral income tax is an elusive goal marriage neutrality conflicts with two other concepts of equity progressivity and equal taxation of couples with equal incomes regardless of how these three concepts of equity are juggled an income tax can achieve any two of these goals but cannot simultaneously achieve all three as described above see the section entitled tax cuts for married couples legislation that would reduce taxes for married couples has had prominent place in 2000s tax policy debate the estate tax6 the estate tax was enacted in 1916 as revenue source for world war i as with wealth taxes before it and like most other taxes revenue was the primary rationale for the tax why the estate tax rather than other possible sources of revenue there were essentially two reasons first the estate tax was viewed as type of fee for the services by the government in protecting property during lifetime as well as fee to cover part of the cost of probating the estate at death also the estate tax was chosen over other taxes for reasons of equity and to reduce the concentration of wealth in 1997 when the exemption was 600000 only 39 of decedents 90006 of 23 million decedents left estates large enough to file tax return further less than half of those required to file return 42901 or 19 of all estates owed tax the federal estate tax is tax on wealth and as such it raises some of the same economic issues as annual wealth taxes which are economically equivalent to annual capital income taxes economic theory views the accumulation of wealth to be largely the result of an individual s decision to postpone consumption to save and accumulate capital during ones life of work and investment and to take risks as such the estate tax is tax on accumulated savings imposed at the end of ones life and the tax is paid out of the economys total supply of private savings reducing private sector savings and increasing government savings ie tax revenue but an important economic question is what is the effect if any on the lifetime savingshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30851crs12 7authored by gregg esenwein specialist in public finance government and finance divisionbehavior of individuals does the estate tax reduce savings rates does the tax reduce the incentives to accumulate capital or do individuals compensate for the tax by increasing their accumulation of pretax wealth such that enough aftertax wealth is accumulated to bequeath to their heirs such might be the case if individuals derive utility either from the wealth itself or from their heirs children welfare or both there is clear answer to these questions the estate tax is part of the overall cost of bequeathing wealth to ones heirs the existence of the estate tax is believed to reduce the level of planned bequests if so reducing the estate tax is likely to increase planned bequests but according to economic theory the effect on savings is uncertain the estate tax does create incentives for lifetime gift giving for estate planning for substantial charitable donations and for the establishment of trusts with federal marginal estate tax rates ranging as high as 55 significant resources and time may be expended at minimizing the estate tax burden and relatively large estate planning industry accountants lawyers and financial advisors is available to wealth holders to minimize any potential estate tax burden one economic effect the effect on farms and small businesses has dominated the recent debate over the estate tax and played key role in the estate tax cuts enacted as part of the taxpayer relief act of 1997 the estate tax is imposed on business capital and wealth land equipment stock buildings etc in addition to personal wealth it is argued that this takes capital out of farms and small businesses inhibiting their transfer to heirs and retention in the family that the tax can cause the breakup or dissolution of family farms and small business sale of the assets to or merger of the enterprise with large competitor could reduce market competition and inhibit economic efficiency these effects were principal reason for the 1981 estate tax reductions and have been key impetus for most of the recent proposals to reduce the estate tax however the estate tax is only one of many possible causes for the sale of farm or business assets outside the family at death and not always the principal cause further recent data suggest that few farms or small businesses are likely to encounter an estate tax liability for information on legislation relating to the estate tax see the section above entitled the death tax elimination act hr 8 the alternative minimum tax for individuals7 to make sure that every person with significant income pays at least minimum of taxes while still preserving the economic and socia l incentives in the tax code congress created in 1969 what is now known as the individual alternative minimum tax amt in essence the amt is tax on the use of tax incentives and preferences and was primarily targeted at upperincome taxpayers who were thought to overuse these preferences to reduce or eliminate their regular income tax liabilities however since its inception the value and effectiveness of the minimum tax has routinely been the subject of congressional debate recently many analysts have voiced concernhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30851crs13 over the expected increase in the number of uppermiddle income taxpayers who may be subject to amt coverage in the near future this increase will occur because of the combined effects of inflation and recent legislative changes to the regular income tax the structural components of the regular income tax are indexed for inflation while the structural components of the amt are not consequently the gap between tax liabilities under the regular income tax and the amt will shrink over time and many taxpayers could end up subject to the unindexed amt or experience reductions in their nonrefundable tax credits under the regular income tax solely as the result of inflation the potential problems of an indexed regular tax and an unindexed amt have long been recognized by tax analysts the joint committee on taxation jct released estimates showing that in 1997 approximately 605000 taxpayers were subject to the amt but that the number of taxpayers subject to the amt will increase to around 92 million by tax year 2007 these estimates however were made prior to the passage of the taxpayer relief act of 1997 when the effects of both inflation and the 1997 legislative changes are taken into account preliminary estimates indicate that by 2007 the number of taxpayers falling under either the amt or amt limits on their tax credits under the regular income tax will grow to almost 12 million in general nonrefundable personal tax credits under the regular income tax are limited to the amount by which taxpayers regular income tax liability exceeds his tentative minimum tax hence even if taxpayer owes amt the amt could reduce the value of his nonrefundable personal tax credits under the regular income tax the child tax credit and the hope tax credit are the two changes contained in the 1997 act that would have the largest impact in increasing the number of taxpayers subject to the amt either directly or indirectly many taxpayers in the uppermiddle income ranges likely will see the value of these two credits reduced or eliminated because of the amt the prospect that the amt is now going to affect many upper middle income taxpayers who were not subject to the tax in the past has prompted some calls in congress for action to remedy the situation congress did take limited action in 1998 by including provision in the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act pl 105277 that will mitigate part of the problems with the amt for tax year 1998 under this provision nonrefundable personal tax credits are fully allowed against taxpayers regular income tax liability for 1998 even if the credits are in excess of the amount by which the taxpayers regular income tax exceeds the amount of his tentative minimum tax in november 1999 congress passed and the president signed hr 1180 which included tempora ry extension of the existing provision that permits individuals to offset their regular income tax by the full amount of their nonrefundable tax credits regardless of the amount of their amt the provision was extended through 2001 and in 2000 congress included provision to make full creditability of the nonrefundable permanent in hr 4810 the bill providing tax cut for married couples as noted above however the president vetoed the bill httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30851crs14 8authored by gregg esenwein specialist in public finance government and finance divisioncapital gains8 since the enactment of the individual income tax in 1913 the appropriate taxation of capital gains income has been perennial topic of debate in congress capital gains income is often discussed as if it were somehow different from other forms of income yet in economic terms capital gains income is essentially different from any other form of income from capital such as interest or dividend income capital gain or loss is the result of sale or exchange of capital asset if the asset is sold for higher price than its acquisition price then the transaction produces capital gain if an asset is sold for lower price than its acquisition price then the transaction produces capital loss current laws treatment of capital gains differs from what would occur under theoretically pure income tax ideally tax consistent with theoretically correct measure of income would be assessed on real inflationadjusted income when that income accrues to the taxpayer conversely real losses should be deducted as they accrue to the taxpayer in addition economic theory indicates that any real appreciation in the value of capital assets given as gifts or bequests should be subject to tax at the time of transfer to the extent it was not taxed as it accrued under the current income tax however nominal noninflation adjusted capital gains income is taxed when it is realized sold or exchanged by the taxpayer capital losses within certain limits are also deducted on nominal basis when they are realized by the taxpayer currently the untaxed appreciation in the value of capital assets transferred at death is not subject to tax under current law capital assets are separated into four categories assets that have been held for 12 months or less are considered shortterm assets assets that have been held longer than 12 months are considered longterm assets collectibles art work antiques coins stamps etc are the third category of assets and the fourth category of capital gains assets includes the portion of gain attributable to previously taken depreciation dedu ctions on section 1250 property depreciable real estate shortterm capital gains are taxed at regular income tax rates longterm capital gains are taxed at maximum tax rate of 20 the tax rate is 10 for longterm gains that would have been taxed at 15 regular tax rate collectibles held longer than 12 months are taxed at 28 the unrecaptured section 1250 gain attributable to depreciation deductions is taxed at maximum tax rate of 25 effective for taxable years beginning in 2001 assets that have been held for at least five years and would have been taxed at 10 tax rate will be taxed at an 8 tax rate for assets which are held more than five years and whose holding period begins after december 31 2000 the maximum tax rate will be 18 rather than 20 net capital losses are deductible against up to 3000 of ordinary income that is noncapital gain income any portion of the net loss in excess of the 3000 limit can be carried forward and used to offset gains in succeeding tax years excess net losses can be carried forward indefinitely and without limit on the amount of losses that can be carried forwardhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30851crs15 under current law taxpayers are allowed to exclude from taxable income up to 500000 250000 in the case of single returns of the gain from the sale of their principal residences to qualify the taxpayer must have owned and occupied the residence for at least two of the previous five years prior to the date of sale under current law capital gains transferred at time of death are not subject to tax on transfer at death the basis of the asset original cost plus changes in the value due to improvements or depreciation is stepped up to the market value of the asset on the date of death tax treatment of savings the appropriate tax treatment of saving has been one of the most prominent tax policy debates in recent decades continuing into the 106th congress it subsumes such topics as individual retirement accounts iras capital gains taxes investment incentives and corporate income taxes to list just few of its particular incarnations the issue of savings has links to both economic performance and equity which has helped make it controversial an increased saving rate generally increases the countrys capital stock which in turn makes possible higher economic growth and higher standard of living in the future if tax incentives can boost saving targeted tax cuts may thus be able to boost economic growth on the other hand income from investments is higher proportion of income at higher income levels tax benefits for saving thus reduce the progressivity of the tax system economics suggests that the efficacy of tax incentives for saving depends heavily on how responsiv individuals savings rates are to changes in the rate of return to saving after taxes if individuals respond to tax incentives by increasing their saving tax benefits may be an effective tool for increasing economic growth on the other hand if saving is unresponsive to targeted tax cuts their efficacy is questionable unhelpfully economic theory provides clear answer and instead identifies two countervailing effects of tax incentives for saving one effect known as the substitution effect leads individuals to save more because the aftertax rate of return has increased second effect the income effect works in the opposite direction because tax cut enables an individual to reach given savings target with lower savings rate the ambiguity of economic theory in this case places an additional burden of proof on empirical evidence and there have indeed been plentitude of statistical studies but taken as group these studies too produce clear answer some find positive and significant relationship between tax incentives and saving that is they find that targeted tax cuts increase saving other studies find relationship and still others find negative relationship thus the impact of taxes on saving is unproved however even if individuals were to respond positively to savings incentiv that does not necessarily mean incentives are good economic policy first what matters for economic growth is not simply private saving but national saving that is the private saving rate minus any government dissaving by means of budget deficit thus the effect of tax cuts for saving in reducing government tax revenue may at least partly offset any positive effect they may have on private saving second even though increased saving produces higher standards of living in the future taxinduced distortion that increases saving may not actually increase economic welfare absent market failures economic theory suggests tax is morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30851crs16 9authored by jane g grav elle senior specialist in economic policy government and finance division 10authored by james m bickley specialist in public finance government and finance divisionefficient the less it changes behavior and if saving is unresponsive to tax changes it may be less damaging to economic welfare than alternative sources of tax revenue again however evidence on the responsiveness of saving is conflicting indeed this summarizes what economics has to say about tax incentives for saving theory and evidence on the efficacy of savings incentives is ambiguous and conflicting tax benefits for saving in the current tax code are numerous among the most prominent are individual retirement account iras 401k retirement savings plans and other qualified employersponsored retirement plans life insurance policies and annuities qualified state tuition programs and medical savings accounts msas in addition the favorabl tax treatment of owneroccupied housing can be thought of as saving incentive as can the reduced tax rates for capital gains under the individual income tax tobacco taxes9 the balanced budget act of 1997 the bba pl 10533 provided substantial increase in the federal excise tax on tobacco products beginning in 2000 the bba provided 10cent per pack increase in the federal excise tax on cigarettes thus raising the tax from prior laws 24 cents per pack to 34 cents the act increased taxes on other tobacco products for example cigars chewing tobacco snuff and pipe tobacco by the same proportion effective in 2002 the bba scheduled an increase in the tax by an additional 5 cents per pack and proportional increase in the other tobacco taxes tentative tobacco settlement plan negotiated between the states and the tobacco industry which would provide limits on future lawsuits in exchange for payments and other restrictions on the industry led to number of legislative proposals in the 105th congress including implementation of tobacco settlement under federal law with per pack fee similar to an excise tax the administration also proposed to raise 655 billion in revenue over five years without specifying the exact collection method amounting to about 54 cents per pack the tobacco bill was not adopted on november 17 1998 the tobacco companies reached an independent agreement with most states for payments that amount to about 35 cents per pack president clinton proposed substantial increase in the cigarette tax in both his fy2000 and fy2001 budgets the proposal has not been adopted fundamental tax reform proposals including flat tax plans10 the idea of replacing our current income tax system with flatrate tax continued to receive congressional interest in 2000 although often referred to as flatrate taxes many of the current proposals go much further than merely adoptinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30851crs17 flatrate tax structure some involve significant income tax basebroadening while others entail changing the tax base from income to consumption most of the recent tax reform proposals the armey shelby domenicinunn english specter lugar tauzin linder souder gramm faircloth and largenthutchinson plans would change the tax base from income to consumption others are not consumption tax proposals representative gephardt would keep income as the tax base but broaden the base and lower the tax rates representative cranes proposal would levy tax on the earned income of each individual as replacement for the curre nt individual income tax corporate income tax and estate and gift taxes former representative snowbargers proposal would permit each taxpayer to choose between the current individual income tax return and an alternative individual tax return with flat rate senator dorgans proposal would allow most taxpayers to choose between the current individual tax system and his shortcut tax plan under which taxes withheld would equal the employees tax liability the flat tax controversy has focused on shifting from the present system which is predominantly an income tax system to consumption tax system as way to raise the savings rate improve economic efficiency and simplify the tax system there is however conclusive empirical evidence that consumption tax will or will not increase the persona l savings rate and consequently the level of national savings highly stylized lifecycle models show that consumption tax would cause substantial increase in the savings rate but these models are controversial because of their idealized assumptions to raise the same amount of tax revenue consumptionbased tax would require higher marginal tax rates than would an income tax since consumption is smaller than income distortions caused by these higher marginal rates could offset or even exceed other advantages of the consumption tax hence whether an income tax system or consumption tax system is more efficient is unknown proponents of some flat tax proposals argue that integration of the current corporate and individual income taxes as well as simple returns would result from consumption tax the current income tax system is complex the federal tax code and the federal tax regulations are lengthy and continue to expand however in tax year 1997 approximately 70 of individual taxpayers took the standard deduction which made complexity less relevant finally some argue that it is unfair to compare the current income tax system with an uncomplicated pure consumption tax that could become complicated by the time it is enacted it has been argued that some flat tax proposals would reduce the balanceoftrade deficit since imports would be taxed but the tax would be rebatable on exports economic theory however suggests that border tax adjustments have effect on the balanceoftrade because the balanceoftra is function of international capital flows border tax adjustments would be offset by exchange rate adjustments the united states is the only developed coun try without broadbased consumption tax at the national level other developed nations have adopted broadbased consumption taxes but as adjuncts rather than as replacements for their income based taxes
