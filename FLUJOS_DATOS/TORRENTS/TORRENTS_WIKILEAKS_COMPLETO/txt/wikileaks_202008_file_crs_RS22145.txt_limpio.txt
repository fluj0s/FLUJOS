coast guard uscg fall within the services program for protection of natural resources and consist of maritime oil spill prevention marine debris and pollution response preparedness protection of living marine resources and fisheries also falls in this category but is not discussed here1 marine environmental protection is one of six nonhomeland security missions specified in the homeland security act of 20022 1 crs reports that discuss these issues include crs report rl33813 fishery aquaculture and marine mammal legislation in the 110th congress by eugene h buck crs report rl32154

budget request submissions maritime spill response and preventionpreparedness4 protecting the marine environment from accidental oil and chemical spills is an important mission of the coast guard along with representatives of 15 other federal departments and agencies the coast guard and the environmental protection agency epa comprise the national response team5 and 13 regional response teams epa serves as the chair and the coast guard is the vicechair of these teams the national contingency plan6 ncp provides the organizational structure and procedures for preparing for and responding to discharges of oil and hazardous substances on both water and land 3 us department of homeland security 2007 budgetinbrief fiscal year 2008 p 52 footnote 1 4 for more information see crs report rl33705 oil spills in us coastal waters background governance and issues for congress by jonathan l ramseur 5 the national response team coordinates program of preparedness planning and response to oil and hazardous materials incidents at the local regional and national levels facilitates research to improve response activities and provides assistance for responses to specific incidents as needed us dept of homeland security national response plan oil and hazardous materials annex p 3 6 40 cfr part 300 the full title of the ncp is the national oil and hazardous substances pollution contingency plan crs3 uscg responsibilities can be divided into two categories 1 spill response and cleanup and 2 spill preventionpreparedness as the primary response authority in maritime waters7 the coast guard has the ultimate authority to ensure that spill is effectively removed and that actions are taken to prevent further discharge from the source during response operations the coast guard coordinates the efforts of federal state and private parties preventing and preparing for spills is also coast guard responsibility and the coast guards jurisdiction covers vessels onshore transportationrelated facilities and deepwater ports8 the coast guards preventionpreparedness duties are based on international agreements and federal standards and regulations recent oil spills in san francisco bay november 2007 and the mississippi river july 2008 have generated further interest and debate concerning oil spill policy issues such as oil spill response and prevention the coast guard represents the united states at the international maritime organization imo which through treaties sets international environmental and safety standards for vessels important treaties cover the following topics httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22145 accidental and operational oil and chemical pollution9 the right of coastal state to take measures on the high seas to prevent mitigate or eliminate danger to its coastline from pollution by oil10 global cooperative framework for combating major incidents or threats of marine pollution from oil and hazardous and noxious substances11 and pollution from the dumping of wastes and other materials12 7 the epa has response authority for inland oil spills the terms inland and coastal are defined in the ncp 40 cfr section 3005 the coastal zone covers all waters subject to the tide the great lakes and all seaward waters extending 200 nautical miles beyond shore the inland zone covers all other us waters 8 other federal agencies oversee other potential sources of spills pipelines offshore facilities for more information see crs report rl33705 oil spills in us coastal waters background governance and issues for congress by jonathan l ramseur 9 the imo international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships 1973 as modified by the protocol of 1978 relating thereto marpol 7378 implemented in the united states by the act to prevent pollution from ships pl 96478 10 the international convention relating to intervention on the high seas in cases of oil pollution casualties 1969 implemented in the united states by the intervention on the high seas act pl 93248 1973 protocol extended the convention to cover substances other than oil and was implemented in the united states by pl 95302 amendments in 1991 1996 and 2002 added additional substances 11 the international convention on oil pollution preparedness response and cooperation oprc 1990 implemented in the united states by pl 102241 protocol to this convention hns protocol 2000 covers marine pollution by hazardous and noxious substances 12 convention on the prevention of marine pollution by dumping of wastes and other matter 1972 generally known as the london convention seven amendments from 1978 to 1996 addressed such things as incineration lowlevel radioactive wastes and industrial wastes crs4 the oil pollution act of 1990 opa and the international treaty marpol 7378 require the owners and operators of vessels that carry oil and designated hazardous substances to submit to the coast guard vessel response plans andor shipboard oil pollution emergency plans these vesselspecific plans address such matters as spill mitigation procedures training requirements for the crew and spill mitigation equipment required to be carried on board the uscg must approve the plans for ship to operate legally in us waters under these authorities vessel operators also must submit to regular inspections and the uscgs inspection program is key component of their oil spill prevention effort inspection of foreign ships port state control program the coast guard conducts certificate of compliance examinations both on random and targeted basis on foreign vessels that make port calls in the united states13 the inspection program emphasizes compliance with environmental and safety standards and particularly since september 2001 is concerned with port security as well the inspecting officers verify that the vessels and their crews are in substantial compliance with international conventions and applicable us laws the pollution prevention examination covers the various waste streams onboard and related record keeping which httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22145 vary for different types of ships and may include the following oil pollution prevention systems include the oily water separator and the sludge containment system the oily water separator is high maintenance device and ships sometimes alter their piping to bypass the system further pumping oily sludge ashore is expensive and ships have been known to take illegal steps to avoid it the black water system includes marine sanitation devices and other systems to treat store and discharge sewage hazardous waste includes paints thinners and cleaning solutions that contain hazardous substances the types and volumes of hazardous waste vary depending on the technology and processes used aboard14 nonhazardous waste is shipboard garbage including food waste plastics and other synthetic materials as well as recyclables like glass and aluminum and steel cans the gray water system includes discharges from the galley sinks showers and baths in recent years cruise ships most of which are registered in foreign countries have gained attention these very large vessels carry up to 5000 passengers who generate large amount of sewage and gray water for additional information see crs report rl32450 cruise ship pollution background laws and regulations and key issues by claudia copeland inspection of domestic ships the domestic inspection system is similar to the port state control program in assuring compliance with applicable laws and treaties 13 in 2006 8178 individual vessels from 79 different flag states made 78668 port calls to the united states us coast guard 2007 port state control in the united states annual report 2006 p 2 14 cruise ships for example will have dry cleaning and photo processing wastes crs5 rules vary according to size and type of vessel eg tanker passenger cargo and mobile offshore drilling units and the number of passengers carried in 1996 the coast guard initiated its alternate compliance program acp under which classification societies15 can perform inspections that satisfy certain periodic uscg test and inspection requirements the acp allows the service to shift its emphasis from providing quality control service inspections to evaluating the human factors in maritime operations which account for more than 80 of marine accidents and to port state enforcement national pollution funds center the coast guard created the national pollution funds center npfc in 1991 to carry out many of the requirements of title i of the oil pollution act of 1990 opa16 the npfc manages the oil spill liability trust fund osltf as well as the coast guards use of the superfund trust fund the osltf is primarily used to finance prompt responses to oil spills and to reimburse parties for applicable costs associated with oil spills eg cleanup costs natural resource damages economic losses initially the primary source of revenue for the fund was 5centsperbarrel fee on imported and domestic oil17 collection of this fee ceased on december 31 1994 because httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22145 of sunset provision in the law however in april 2006 the tax resumed as required by the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 at the end of fy2006 the fund had approximately 604 million the npfc projects it to have more than 1 billion by the end of fy200818 to ensure that responsible parties can be held accountable for cleanup costs and damages in the event of an oil spill thereby preserving the oil spill fund opa requires that vessels show evidence of financial responsibility such as insurance the npfc carries out this mandate by issuing certificates of financial responsibility cofrs to shipping vessel owners when owners demonstrate the ability to pay for oil spill cleanup and damages in general vessels over 300 gross tons are required to have valid cofr to operate in us waters the npfc also takes action to recover cleanup costs from responsible parties it documents ongoing costs and damages from the spill area and bills the responsible party about 40 of spills in us waters are mystery spills and the costs go unrecovered 15 classification societies are organizations that establish and apply technical standards in relation to the design construction and survey of marine related facilities including ships and offshore structures for more information see international association of classification societies what are classification societies at httpwwweagleorgcompanyclassmonographpdf examples include the american bureau of shipping and lloyds register 16 for more discussion on issues regarding management of the trust fund see crs report rl33705 oil spills in us coastal waters background governance and issues for congress by jonathan l ramseur 17 other revenue sources for the fund include interest on the fund cost recovery from the parties responsible for the spills and any fines or civil penalties collected 18 national pollution funds center oil spill liability trust fund osltf annual report fy 2002 fy 2006 fund estimate prepared june 27 2007 crs6 marine debris marine debris eg discarded fishing lines or nets can endanger birds and marine animals and cause damage to coral reefs even less lethal trash from recreational fishing and boating such as beverage cans and bottles food wrappers and foam plastic pieces degrades beaches coral reefs and the oceans the coast guards approach to debris is preventive promoting compliance by boarding and inspecting vessels and working with local port agencies to ensure there are facilities to receive garbage from vessels the coast guard also coordinates with the environmental protection agency epa the national marine fisheries service the national park service and the ocean conservancy19 in monitoring and measuring amounts of marine debris this activity is authorized in the act to prevent pollution from ships 33 usc 1905 and 1915 as well as marpol annex v marine and environmental science the coast guard has history of scientific study of the oceans dating back to 1881 when it began arctic cruises along the alaska coast today the uscg role is that of facilitator supporting the scientific efforts of other groups moreover many of the oceanographic and other scientific activities conducted by federal agencies including the coast guard were consolidated in 1970 with the creation of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22145 the coast guard operates three icebreakers in the arctic and antarctic and provides supplies to remote stations the uscg also participates in the international ice patrol which monitors iceberg danger in the northwest atlantic particularly in the area of the grand banks of newfoundland the iceberg season is usually from february to july but the ice patrol is logistically flexible and can commence operations when iceberg conditions dictate the coast guard is responsible for enforcing federal regulations governing commercial fisheries the uscg carries out some 40006500 boardings per year to ensure compliance with gear and harvest regulations see crs reports referenced above environmental compliance and restoration this activity is concerned with coast guard compliance with environmental laws ongoing initiatives include meeting the more stringent emission requirements of the clean air act amendments of 1990 and developing strategies to minimize the generation of hazardous waste there also are continuing efforts to design pollution prevention into shore facility improvement projects and to conduct environmental audits at facilities to find and correct potential environmental violations 19 formerly the center for marine conservation
