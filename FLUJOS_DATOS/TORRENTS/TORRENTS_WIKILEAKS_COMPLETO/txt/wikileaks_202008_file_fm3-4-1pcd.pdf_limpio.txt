broad background regarding nbc defense of fixed sites ports and airfields chapter 1 addresses the fixed site nbc environment chapter 2 identifies fixed site vulnerability and chapter 3 provides guidance on fixed site nbc defense planning and execution appendixes through j support and supplement the doctrine within the chapters chapter 1 provides an introduction addressing concerns such as wmd proliferation lessons learned during operations desert shielddesert storm toxic industrial hazards tih and worldwide terrorist activities all driving immediate considerations for fixed site nbc defense the chapter highlights command responsibilities for protecting the force in today and tomorrows nbc environment additionally this chapter establishes standard terminology for fixed sites and defines the operational environment for fixed site operations fixed sites include command control communications computers and intelligence c4i sites portsseaports of debarkation spod airfieldsaerial ports of debarkation apod logistics bases pomcus sites ammunition storage pointsdepots supply depots maintenance sites etc and medical facilities for planning considerations the fixed site operational environment discussion includes four parameters physical environment conditions and terrain which in concert with weather influences wmd targeting employment and effects military environment includes strategic chokepoints sustainment operations complex command and control implications at fixed sites and strategic centers of gravity combined these aspects translate fixed sites into high value targets discusses nbc defense of fixed sites ports and airfields provides fixed site threat overview discusses fixed site vulnerabilities and mitigation discusses fixed site nbc defense planning

technological capabilities can create and support overt or covert wmd proliferation threat environment the wmd threat spans the full spectrum of operations in peacetime and conflict the wmd threat presents tactical operational and strategic implications requiring active and passive countermeasures to address nbc hazards created by nations terrorists or by consequence chapter 2 examines fixed site vulnerability ipb analysis and mitigation intelligence preparation of the battlespace ipb supports the analytical process that allows commanders and staffs to disperse the fog of the operational environment and anticipate enemy actions before they occur ipb becomes the glue that connects chapters 13 and appendixes aj the following characteristics contribute to fixed site vulnerability bottlenecks large area targets high value targets limited defensive capabilities limited or mobility strategic and operational impacts the minimum impact caused by nbc hazards entails temporary reduction in optempo for targeted forcesoperations under less ideal conditions nbc hazards may delay fixed site operations for hours or days and result in changes of mission andor mass casualty scenarios impacts will vary based on the functional mission of the fixed site vulnerability analysis the basic methodology combines ipb nbc risk assessment and nbc vulnerability analysis procedures to identify specific measures to avoid protect against or reduce the effects of wmd and nbc hazards appendixes c and g provide information to supplement existing service procedures chapter 3 focuses on the three key measures to accomplish fixed site nbc defense goals protecting the force sustaining c2 and sustaining combat support this chapters three sections include fixed site nbc defense rolesresponsibilities who is responsible fixed site nbc defense planning procedures and considerations and resourcing deployment and execution guidance making the plan work the appendixes support the planning resourcing and execution process by providing detailed how to discussion and tools table exec1 summarizes appendix contentsduring force projection operations aspod pose lucrative strategic

summary 4chapter 1 fixed site nbc environment 111 introduction 2 3 significant national security concerns drive the immediate consideration of fixed site nbc 4 defense these concerns include proliferation of weapons of mass destruction wmd and 5 lessons learned during armed conflict from operations desert shielddesert storm and 6 terrorist incidents such as the khobar towers large conventional explosives and the tokyo 7 subway nerve agent incident s and the potential for radiological chemical or biological hazards 8 commanders must consider fully the requirements for fixed site nbc defense our forces require 9 protection from these weapons as well as nbc hazards from industrial facilities near or in our 10 area of operations ao commanders have direct responsibility for protecting their force against 11 these hazards on future battlefields failure to properly plan and execute nbc defenses for 12 critical fixed sites may result in significant casualties disruption of operations and even mission 13 degradation further commanders mission and execution plans must address the implications of 14 wmd if used at critical force projection choke points specifically ports of debarkation figure 11 15 depicts the force projection chokepoints and wmd challenges confronting commander in 16 theater of operations as forces enter the theater vulnerability concerns heighten significantly 17 protecting the force is of equal or greater concern during forced entry operations as well as 18 offensive or defensive operations 19 20 notice that the force projection pipeline generally originates from the continental united states 21 conus or from an ally eg nato although still vulnerable ports of embarkation poe at 22 the projection base offer an advantage by allowing additional security flexibility and standoff 23 therefore enemy wmd targeting efforts will likely focus on the more vulnerable ports of 24 debarkation pod wmd employed against sea and air pod and forces not yet deployed to 25 forward areas of operations can create significant casualties and bottlenecks in the resource 26know the enemy and know yourself in hundred battles ou will never be in

extremely vulnerable while at or 27 around the pod during the transition from entry operations to military operations many 28 elements begin dispersal into their assigned areas of operation however fixed sites remain as 29 centers of gravity for sustaining enhancing and controlling forward combat power and therefore 30 are high value target for wmd it is in the context of this target rich environment that chapter 1 31 define s key fixed site terminology and address the operational environment of fixed sites 32 33 terminology 34 35 common terminology is essential for establishing effective communication coordination and 36 maintaining focus on the scope of this manual specifically the term fixed site is defined as 37 shown below and discussion is focused toward but not limited to the subsequent points 38 39 fixed site developed real estate facilities and supporting equipmen t required to 40 accomplish an operational mission for example 41 command control communications computers and intell igence c4i sites 42 portsseaports of debarkation spod 43 airfieldsaerial ports of debarkation apod 44 logistics bases eg pomcus sites ammunition storage poi ntsdepots supply 45 depots maintenance sites 46 medical facilities 47 48 fixed sites can be further categorized as permanently or operationally fixed 49 50 permanently fixed sites facilities that can not move these include preexisting facilities 51 such as ports airfields railheads bridges and hospitals if war or conflict comes to these 52 facilities they may be abandoned but not moved additionally if wmd make these facilities 53 unusable they are abandoned at least until transition to postconflict operations 54 55 operationally fixed sites facilities transportable or mobile but due to ongoing 56 operational constraints they are not moved examples of operationally fixed sites include 57 the movement of air transportable hosp itals or critical communications nodes just prior to 58 commencing offensive operations examples may also include stalled convoys and bridging 59 operations 60 61 related terms that the manual will refer to are base base cluster and weapons of mass 62 destruction 63 64 base locality from which operations are projected or sup ported an area or locality 65 containing installations which provide logistic or other support jp 102 66 67 base cluster in base defense operations collection of bases ge ographically grouped 68 for mutual protection and ease of command and control jp 102 69 70 wmd weapons of mass destruction in arms control usage weapons that are capable of 71 high order of destruction andor of being used in such manner as to destroy large numbers of 72 people can be nuclear chemical biological and radiological weapons but excludes the means of 73 transporting or propelling the weapon where such means is separable and divisible part of the 74 weapon jp 102 note throughout this manual we will use wmd when referring to nbc 75 weapons and nbc hazards to refer to hazards resulting from either wmd industrial or 76 conventional battlefield residual hazards 77 78 the functions and services provided by the fixed sites noted above provide critical c4i force 79 projection and sustainment capabilities for joint forces subsequent discussions will initially focus 80fixed site nbc environment 13on aspod during entry operations and subsequently will address the joint rear area jra and 81 other critical fixed sites as the theater expands and forces transition to operations 82 83 operational environment 84 85 the fixed site operational setting is diverse and complex environment this diverse setting 86 includes the physical military civil and threat environment first by function fixed site 87 operations cross each aspect of the physical battlespace land sea air and space secondly 88 fixed site operations are inherently joint and will likely include jtf operations thirdly in addition 89 to the physical and military environments fixed site operations especially aerial and port 90 operations occur within the complex framework of the host nation and the civil environment 91 finally the significant impact of the nbc threat environment on fixed site operations will be key to 92 discussions in chapter 2 commanders will use these four parameters of the fixed site 93 operational environment discussed below as planning considerations for inclusion in 94 jointmultiservice plans and exercises 95 96 physical environment 97 98 the physical battlespace directly impacts fixed site operations and the physical environment 99 directly influences wmd wmd can impact force projection and combat operations on land at 100 sea andor in the air further the nuclear component of wmd could also impact the space 101 environment and command and control networks that rely on this dimension would be severely 102 degraded still the most notable influences of the physical environment on fixed site nbc 103 defense are weather and terrain 104 105 weather weather conditions are the uncontrollable wildcard of wmd employment and 106 provide useful cues to probable times and places for wmd use ie employment 107 windows diligent tracking of weather conditions helps in assessment of risks to friendly 108 forces from wmd as well as toxic industrial material tim hazards 109 110 terrain in concert with weather conditions terrain influences where nbc effects may 111 concentrate eg chemical agents in low lying areas and in many cases it influences 112 enemy wmd targeting eg exploiting or creating chokepoints 113 114 military environment 115 116 the military environment of fixed sites includes strategic chokepoints sustainment operations 117 complex command and control c2 and centers of gravity 118 119 strategic chokepoints the strategic projection of combat power may require air and sea ports 120 of debarkation once forward deployed these forces require operational sustainment through 121 these same pod the limited number of useable pod causes an unavoidable concentration of 122 forces at these sites thus creating an enticing wmd target 123 124 combat power sustainment continuity of support from fixed sites is the life blood for 125 sustaining forces combat power nbc hazards can interrupt fixed site operations and 126 decrease our forces overall combat power the intensity of combat operations and fixed 127 site activities vary however the fixed site operational tempo optempo remains high 128 in addition to casualties an enemy theater missile tm with wmd warhead is very 129 efficient and effective means of quickly disrupting andor halting the flow of information 130 and resources to or from the fixed site the overall impact is decrease in combat 131 capability 132 133 complex c2 multiple services activities and organizational structures eg base 134 clusters airfieldport operations and hostnation support complicate fixed site c2 135chapter 1 14additionally fixed site personnel eg logistics reserve and host nationus civilians 136 may have less training in passive defense measures than combat forces further 137 complicating c2 in an nbc environment 138 139 strategic centers of gravity as the hub for commanders sustainment and c2140 operations and with limited number of pod fixed sites become critical center of 141 gravity for joint multinational and host nation personnel result h igh value targets for 142 the enemy 143 144 civil environment 145 146 the culture and economic aspects of the civil environment that significantly influence fixed site 147 nbc defense considerations include religious national and ethnic values and economic 148 industrialtechnological capabilities 149 150 cultural influences cultural influences of religion nationalism and ethnocentrism mold 151 civic and political attitudes toward the employment of wmd and definitions of success 152 these basic ingredients support the volatile and aggressive politics seen in countries 153 such as iran and iraq strict adherence to national or religious calls to action creates an 154 atmosphere where any element of combat power eg nbc usage can be rationalized 155 further even in loss last blow using wmd weapons could provide an enemy 156 devastating final blow favorable attitudes toward martyrdom create challenging physical 157 security requirements to mitigate suicide attacks against fixed sites 158 159 economic influences industrial and technological capabilities can be double edged 160 sword nations industrial base can support defensive strategies as well as create the 161 prolific environment supporting wmd production stockpile and employment the host 162 nation with developed economic infrastructure and industry can better support redundant 163 lines of communication andor provide protection and decon resources conversely 164 nation s economic capabilities could support overt or covert wmd proliferation and 165 employment in cultural climates with permissive attitudes or lax counterproliferation 166 programs 167 168 threat environment 169 170 the threat environment of todays battlespace spans the full range of operations during peace and 171 conflict wmd create tactical operational and strategic implications for commanders and their 172 forces commanders must also weigh the impact of offensive action against enemy nbc 173 productionstorage facilities for example the downwind hazard following target destruction must 174 be considered additionally countermeasures are prepared to negate the threat posed by 175 industrial hazards and terrorists 176 177 various countries are known to possess or are suspected of possessing nuclear biological and 178 chemical capabilities figure 12 depicts countries with proliferating growing wmd programs 179 any country with pharmaceutical and agricultural research capabilities can easily disguise 180 chemical and biological weapons development programs as countries seek to expand their own 181 wmd programs potential funding is derived from sales of products andor technologies to other 182 countries or organizations this practice sustains the wmd proliferation process 183 184 combine the proliferation of wmd with the proliferation of ballistic and cruise missile technology 185 and the increasing threat to offshore assets rear areas and fixed site s becomes even more 186 apparent since each of the three main weapons of mass destruction nuclear biological and 187 chemical can be delivered by ballistic missile smart munitions or covert devices the threat 188 environment extends throughout the depth of the battlespace and continues to the force projection 189 base 190 191fixed site nbc environment 15 nuclear and radiological weapons 192 the nuclearradiological threat 193 includes strategic or tactical nuclear 194 weapons conventional munitions 195 enhanced by depleted uranium du 196 and low level radiation llr 197 although they are not wmd du 198 munitions create low level radiation 199 threat as residual hazard of the fired 200 rounda threat present in the 201 expended round damaged or 202 destroyed equipment contaminated 203 shrapnel or smoke from destroyed 204 du contaminated vehicles du 205 munitions are appearing in more and 206 more armies and commanders must 207 ensure they conduct additional training 208 that institutes proper safety 209 countermeasures llr threats may 210 also occur from inadequate nuclear 211 waste disposal deterioration of nuclear 212 security or facilities and collateral or 213 deliberate damage to facilities with 214 radioactive materialsources additionally covert or terrorist agents can use radiological 215 weapons to conduct direct actions against military andor civilian targets 216 217 biological weapons these weapons use agentstoxins that can be much more lethal 218 than chemical agents in poundforpound comparison production costs and low 219 effective doses make these weapons extremely enticing for the enemyonabudget who 220 is looking for maximum casualties and psychological impact additionally antimateriel 221 weapons loom as an emerging biological threat to fixed site functions relying heavily on 222 mechanical and electronic equipment as well as petroleum fueled power generators to 223 accomplish their missions 224 225 chemical weapons compared to biological weapons chemical weapons offer 226 increased predictability of ontarget effects against personnel and equipment and 227 persistency options as with biologicals chemical antimateriel formulas offer the 228 determined belligerent yet another option to target against support activities 229 230 industrial centers and weapons 231 productionstorage facilities can easily become 232 sources of hazards for our forces and their 233 equipment deliberate targeting of industrial 234 facilities can produce toxic industrial hazards 235 radiological biological or chemical as lethal 236 as any wmd arsenal the same results may 237 occur from collateral damage accidents or 238 covertterrorist activity therefore forces 239 operating in or located near these facilities incur 240 higher risk and vulnerability this photo 241 suggests that not only are the industrial facilities 242 potential hazard producers but also the 243 transport vehicles used to move industrial 244 products eg phosgene chlorine waste 245 products and

exploitation of industrial hazards to accomplish their 249 objectives as highleverage lowrisk form of warfare terrorism creates breeding ground for 250 the proliferation of wmd especially for biological and chemical weapons with their low cost per 251 effect ratios the tokyo subway incident involving the aum shinri kyu cults use of the nerve 252 agent sarin is prime example of wmd proliferation the aum shinri kyu cult in japan was not 253 only involved in chemical weapons research but also purchased large quantities of clostridium 254 botulinum the organism that produces the very lethal botulinum toxin additionally in 1992 the 255 cult demonstrated an interest in the ebola virus by sending medical mission to zaire 256chapter 2 fixed site vulner ability 211 overview 2 3 fixed sites provide critical functions that support force projection and sustainment discussions of 4 the threat and operational environment always provide insight into friendly vulnerabilities this 5 chapter specifically examines fixed site vulnerabilities joint intelligence preparation of the 6 battlespace jipb vulnerability analysis and vulnerability mitigation 7 8 the projected force may require ports of debarkation by spod apod or both once projected 9 these forces require sustainment from logistics bases that above division level are primarily fixed 10 sites for projected force these sites become centers of gravity for joint multinational and host 11 nation mission critical operations and as such are high value targets for enemy wmd 12 13 worldwide wmd proliferation and the threat of nbc weapons use overt or covert require that 14 commanders and their staff planners have working knowledge of nbc defense principles fixed 15 site vulnerabilities and mitigation techniques specifically the joint task force jtf 16 headquarters may develop as an ad hoc organization derived from service command assets 17 supporting the cinc mission requiring key personnel who know how to assess and reduce nbc 18 vulnerability additionally immediate operational requirements may result in the hasty 19 establishment of bases and base 20 clusters within matter of hours to days 21 in units without organic nbc staff nbc 22 defense experts may be assigned after 23 initial planning sessions therefore 24 successful nbc defense planning and 25 execution relies on commanders and 26 staffs understanding the nbc defense 27 aspects of protecting their forces 28 29 fixed site 30 vulnerability 31 32 forces are most vulnerable and 33 successful operations are at greatest risk 34 during the initial entry phase of force 35 projection operations nbc protection is 36 especially critical to mission success 37 during this phase of operations 38 commanders must ensure they consider 39 and evaluate numerous spods and 40 apods so they can deploy military 41 forces from different locations in case of 42 nbc attack this vulnerability is 43 magnified when the enemy possesses 44 wmd even during war termination and 45 postconflict operations wmd use could 46 occur and again increase risk to our 47 forces protecting the force remains 48 key mission throughout all phases of 49 force projection 50the skillful warriors first made themselves invincible nd waited the enemys moment of vulnerabilitywhen an advancing enemy crosses wateri t is advantageous to allow half his force to cross and then strikean army that lacks heavy equipment fodder food and stores will be lost sun tzu c400320 bc figure 2 1 threat wmd reachchapter 2 2251 terrorist and missile attacks are the most difficult to profile predict or detect figure 21 depicts 52 how enemy wmd effects represent 360o threat making vulnerability analysis more difficult 53 vulnerability analysis plays an increasingly important role in helping the commander focus limited 54 nbc defense assets against the most likely wmd delivery means it is the enemys ability to 55 deliver wmd and other existing nbc hazards eg toxic industrial chemical hazards that 56 causes the commander to assess unit and site vulnerability however before discussing 57 vulnerability assessment techniques and mitigation its important to understand fixed site 58 characteristics and vulnerability and the strategic and operational impact of nbc hazards to fixed 59 sites 60 61 fixed site characteristics 62 63 commanders recognize that fixed site characteristics make them vulnerable high value targets 64 these characteristics include 65 bottlenecks intertheater and intratheater movement of resources will burden limited pod 66 throughput capacities and create forceequipment concentrations additionally wmd use 67 could cause civilian panicflight and clog road networks surrounding fixed sites therefore 68 commanders must consider and evaluate other transportation avenues in case of wmd 69 employment 70 large area targets fixed sites such as base clusters may be dispersed over large areas 71 helping to decrease the conventional theater missile attack risk however this same 72 dispersion increases physical security requirements burdening limited resources and it 73 encourages enemy selection of wmd because of their large area coverage characteristics 74 high value targets fixed sites represent series of critical interrelated functions and 75 concentration of high priority activities frequently making the fixed site center of gravity 76 additionally fixed sites often provide oneofakind critical mission functions that have limited 77 redundancy 78 limited defensive capabilities long range interdiction weapons are most often task 79 organized to support combat operations leaving limited range defensive weapons such as 80 patriot for active theater missile defense tmd of fixed sites further the fixed site 81 operational environment likely possesses limited collective defensive capabilities 82 limited or mobility it is easier for the enemy to target the more fixed sites vice more 83 mobile tactical targets even with extensive camouflage concealment and deception ccd 84 efforts the large area nature of fixed sites continues to make them lucrative wmd targets 85 86 finally multiple activities complex organizational structures and varying levels of expertise in 87 passive defense measures combine to make fixed site nbc defense challenging yet 88 manageable task 89 90 strategic and operational impacts 91 92 assuming thoroughly prepared and rehearsed nbc defense plan is implemented the minimum 93 anticipated impact from nbc hazards is temporary reduction in optempo for affected forces 94 under less ideal conditions nbc hazards may delay fixed site operations for hours or days and 95 result in changes of mission andor mass casualty scenarios with little or nbc defense 96 equipment training civil reserve air fleet and merchant marine movement assets will be delayed 97 or diverted to alternate pod this section is designed to emphasize the strategic and operational 98 impacts of nbc hazards at specific fixed sites namely c4i nodes ports airfields and logistics 99 bases subsequent discussions will outline how to plan effectively 100 101 c4i impacts information hubs such as command centers communications centerssites and 102 intelligence collection sites are prime targets for wmd information flow drives decisions 103 national command authority nca decisions and intelligence are transmitted to forces 104 worldwide even temporary disruptions of this capability can force modifications of plans and 105fixed site vulnerability 23orders at strategic and operational levels and have catastrophic consequences at the tactical 106 level disrupting the c4i nodes through use of wmd will severely hinder commanders responsive 107 and timely support for mission operations therefore subordinate commanders must clearly 108 understand strategic objectives and intent 109 110 port impacts reception staging onward movement and integration rsoi operations and 111 terminal discharge transfer storage and clearance operations are immediately complicated by 112 increased protective posture without plans for redundant facilities transportation assets andor 113 logistics overtheshore lots the logistics flow decreases and over time results in decreased 114 combat power during desert storm wmd attacks against saudi arabian east coast ports 115 could have forced heavier reliance on west coast port operations resulting in fourfold 116 increase in trucking distances with too few trucks already combat power and sustainment may 117 have staged for days possibly weeks on the west coast dod personnel fleet and merchant 118 marine assets loadingunloading capabilities transportation services and host nation support 119 military civilian and commercial hires were all potential casualties or degraded capabilities 120 121 airfield impacts short of nuclear attack the main wmd impact on airlift and combat aircraft is 122 decreased sortie rates these decreases result primarily from degradation of ground support 123 crews in higher mopp levels as cargo aircraft contamination control cacc contaminated 124 payload control area cpca measures and decon operations intensify payload throughput 125 decreases personnel aircraft critical materiel handling equipment and payloads are potential 126 casualties or degraded capabilities respectively 127 128 like ports diversion of combat loads to alternate or redundant facilities may result in significant 129 delays in employment of combat forces or delivery of priority payloads normally strategic airlift 130 assets c5 c17 c141 will not deliver cargo to contaminated airfields tactical airlift to 131 contaminated areas is only conducted for critical mission exceptions as countermeasure in 132 flight refueling can allow combat aircraft to support from outside theater missile tm range for 133 limited periods 134 135 logistics base impacts wmd will primarily influence log base transportation capabilities 136 exposed supply inventories and work rates contamination of vehicles or ground transport routes 137 creates delaysdetours at best and contaminates transporters at worst contaminated uncovered 138 break bulk supplies and ammunition create exposure risks and work rates decrease as personnel 139 operate in increased mopp levels 140 141 hospitals wmd will create an 142 environment in which fixed hospital 143 without collective protection will be 144 limited in its patient care capabilities 145 contamination of the facility and supplies 146 will create an environment in which 147 patient care will be greatly degraded 148 the treatment facility can be provided 149 temporary level of protection using 150 techniques discussed in appendix j 151 152 vulnerability 153 analysis 154 155 fm 314 mcrp 3371a nbc 156 vulnerability analysis defines vulnerability analysis as systematic method for estimating 157 friendly casualties andor consequences from enemy nbc attacks the basic

164 joint intelligence preparation of the battlespace jipb is systematic continuous process of 165 analyzing the threat and environment in specific geographic area to support staff estimates and 166 military decision making in other words jipb is overlaying facts and assumptions about the 167 operational environment including enemy 168 information onto specific operation 169 the four step process provides logical 170 procedure for predicting adversary 171 courses of action coa and their 172 impacts on friendly operations the four 173 continuous steps of jipb are 174 define the battlespace 175

because it helps 184 the commander anticipate enemy actions 185 commanders can then prevent anticipated actions or respond to minimize their impact 186 anticipating enemy actions helps to identify friendly vulnerabilities and to subsequently take action 187 to reduce the impact of enemy actions figure 23 summarizes jipb these four steps comprise 188 continuous process that is integral to fixed site risk assessments and vulnerability analysis 189 during friendly coa development jipb progresses to wargaming process that helps the 190 commander identify anticipated enemy actions and respond to

analyses focus 234 specifically on casualty estimates 235 figure 24 provides the basic steps 236 that are addressed in appendix c the 237 casualty estimate process relies on 238 thorough jipb enemy and physical 239 environment assessments and friendly 240 mission analysis the basic inputs for 241 determining chemical casualty effects 242 are anticipated or actual friendly 243 target size anticipated agent and 244 delivery system and temperature 245 246 its important to note that in many 247 cases the enemys primary objective 248 may not be casualty generation the 249 primary objective may be target contamination and degradation to our mission capabilities when 250 critical equipment facilities or terrain are contaminated optempo may slow dramatically due 251 not only to casualties but also to mopp degradation decon requirements and mission 252 adjustments in response to the attack or future attacks if the only desired effect is casualties the 253 enemy will likely use only conventional munitions 254 255 vulnerability reduction mitigation 256 257 fundamental to mitigating wmd effects on fixed sites is recognizing applicable principles of war 258 such as security economy of force unity of command and objective 259 260 security enhance freedom of action by reducing vulnerability to hostile acts to be 261 successful fixed site commanders take necessary protection and physical security measures 262 to preserve their capabilities 263 264 economy of force ensure distribution of assets to accomplish assigned missions while 265 reducing the vulnerability of fixed sites

tmd and nbc 270 defense 271 272 objective mutual objectives at fixed sites are focused on key common goals such as 273 protecting the force c2 and combat sustainment 274 275 at more practical level mitigating fixed site vulnerability includes active and passive defense 276 measures that will reduce the probability of wmd attack and will minimize the effects with the 277 possible exception of strategic or operational level c4i node fixed site commanders probably 278 have little or direct control of active 279 defense assets capable of interdicting 280 wmd delivery systems although active 281 defense measures throughout the 282 battlespace and their associated 283 warnings should trigger passive 284 defense responses therefore the 285 remainder of this chapter will address 286 fixed site considerations relative to 287 passive defense measures 288 289 passive defense measures 290 291 the joint rear area coordinator 292 jrac and base cluster commanders 293 recognize that passive defense 294 represents critical aspect of nbc 295 protection figure 25 summarizes the 296 principal measures used to accomplish 297 passive defense 298 299 tactical warning established 300 warning procedures eg preattack 301 attack and postattack help 302 commanders and staffs to acquire process and disseminate warning information that minimizes 303 wmd impact timely warnings trigger critical individual and collective protection actions and 304 contamination avoidance activities warnings are both general missile launches are imminent or 305 have occurred and specific specific units or areas are in danger of attack or provide notification 306 of an all clear 307 308 reducing targeting effectiveness communications security and signature reduction deny 309 enemy sensor and reconnaissance assets key data for acquisition and identification of friendly 310 targets friendly measures include camouflage emission control cover concealment and local 311 unit security to deny enemy key targeting data deception misleads enemies by manipulating 312 distorting and falsifying friendly actions use of decoys or false electronic signatures can deny an 313 enemy key targeting information 314 315 maintaining mobility although fixed sites are essentially immobile commanders can sustain 316 force mobility by maintaining flexibility in their operations plans and orders commander may 317 decide to use an alternate spod apod or lots to maintain required throughput throughput 318 and capacity considerations may also drive prepositioning mission essential assets and keeping 319 resources mobile and containerized 320 321 trainingdiscipline dod military personnel by training and ethic maintain good order and 322 discipline however many mission essential civilian

commanders consider physical security needs and the effects wmd could have on their area of 328 operation difficult choices will confront them as they consider mission requirements available 329 terrain and dispersion requirements for example site selection for mission critical assets may 330 result in splitbased logistics operations or support from remote areas 331 332 hardening hardening reduces the effect of wmd attack careful site and terrain selection field 333 fortification and other field expedient or construction methods support increased individual and 334 collective protection 335 336 covering supplies and equipment coa considerations include identifying what resources 337 require protection andor covering wargaming identifies the impact of covering or not covering 338 selected supplies and equipment highvalue resources receive priority for limited nbc covers 339 340 limiting exposure limiting exposure is manageable process networks of nbc detection 341 and identification devices provide input as to what assetslocations are or may become 342 contaminated if possible curtail or limit operations in these areas and use other redundant 343 capabilities or surge mission operations in other sectors to sustain operations until the 344 contamination levels are reduced 345 346 preventing contamination spread effective mission orders and tactical warning and reporting 347 may reduce andor preclude the spread of contamination the integration of nbc detectors into 348 the sites reporting network provides key input further control measures eg traffic control 349 points barriers marking serve to minimize inadvertent entry into contamination areas or use of 350 contaminated resources both rotary and fixed wing aircraft movement taxiing at airfields can 351 cause contamination spread rotorwash propwash and jet blast pick up dust sand leaves and 352 contaminated debris that can contaminate the exterior and sometimes the interior of the aircraft 353 354 seeking protection planning identifies protection requirements for personnel and equipment 355 and the assets available to meet those requirements take action identify and resource individual 356 and collective protection equipment requirements search for terrain features or manmade 357 structures for equipment protection and identify and request support not immediately available in 358 the area of operations for example plan and provide hospital treatment facilities temporary 359 protection by sealing all window s doors and other outside openings with tape and plastic 360 sheeting turning off the air conditionersheaters and establishing an air lock type entryexit way 361 this procedure can provide an increased time for the hospital staff to provide the patients with 362 individual protection they require patient protective wraps pp w or mopp for protection or 363 during evacuation to another medical treatment facility the hospital gains extended protection by 364 applying the above procedures plus adding air handlers with cb filters the air handlers can 365 provide overpressure thus preventing cb agent infiltration into the facility training resourcing 366 and executing plans to this level of detail requires active aggressive planning and 367 implementation 368 369 site redundancy and robustness preserving capability may necessitate duplicating functions 370 that are particularly vulnerable robustness of soft targets such as c2 nodes and airfields is 371 improved by implementing additional survivability measures 372 373 postattack recovery and reconstitution

613 from each contributing component ie usaf usn usmc usa commanders determine the 614 proper mix of force capabilities in order to maintain flexible effective and efficient support to the 615 mission task organization decisions are always missionfocused every deployed asset must be 616 able to support the mission 617 618 for example the existence of biological threat may not support the deployment of an entire 619 biodetection company mission analysis may establish requirement for only the c2 element and 620 one platoon unless the mission is demonstration of biological defense capability the 621 deployment of the entire unit would waste valuable strategic lift capability table 34 provides 622 ideas for building modular army nbc defense deployment packages these packages are 623 designed

91 first us forces on the ground within 31 hours of the initial alert order 92 93 operation desert shield was twophase operation the first phase involved the initial 94 deployment of forces to deter further iraqi aggression and to defend saudi arabia the second 95 phase included the subsequent deployment of forces to resource the coalition with robust 96 counteroffensive capability that could evict the iraqi army from kuwait although some units did 97 not begin to deploy until late november they were in place and combatready by early february 98 1991 99 100 the tailoring of proper force mix for this operation required the mobilization of thousands of 101 guardsmen and reserviststhe largest mobilization since word war ii during this forceprojection 102 operation the services deployed nearly halfmillion personnel their supporting equipment and 103 60 days of supplies from the united states and europe all this was pipelined through fixed sites 104 ports and airfields within period

the type and size of weapon likely to be employed by the enemy 36 the commander then weighs various courses of action coa to determine which coa allows for 37 mission accomplishment at an acceptable risk 38 39 when addressing unit vulnerability to nuclear weapons employment consider blast or shock 40 wave thermal radiation or heat initial or prompt radiation and residual radiation fallout and 41 emp effects the potential exists for an enemy to employ weapon which produces only one of 42 these effects eg radioactive dust particles emp therefore assess vulnerability to each effect 43 not just the greatest effect 44 45 nuclear explosions biological effects are measured according to the amount of radiation 46 centigrays to which personnel are exposed for the biological effects of radiation in man refer to 47 table a2 fm 331fmfm 1118 nuclear contamination avoidance or appropriate service 48 publication 49 50 two techniques to evaluate unit vulnerability to nuclear detonations are 51 technical approach in which unit dispositions are compared with the effects of an 52 expected yield and 53 an operational approach in which unit dispositions are compared with targeting criteria 54 used by the threat target analyst 55 56 in nuclear environment the more concentrated unit is the more lucrative target it becomes 57 if the unit itself is not the target but falls within the fallout pattern unit monitors will be capable of 58 providing the commander with essential information regarding the hazard nuclear hazard 59 prediction is addressed in fm 331fmfm 111 8 nuclear contamination avoidance or 60 appropriate service publication 61 62 the primary tool for analyzing friendly dispositions is the radius of vulnerability rv rv is the 63 radius of circle within which friendly troops will be exposed to risk equal to or greater than the 64 emergency risk criterion 5 percent combat ineffectiveness andor within which material will be 65 subjected to 5 percent probability of the specified degree of damage see the rv tables in jp 3 66 122 srd nuclear weapons employment and effects data or jp 3123 nuclear weapons 67 employment and effects data notional unclassified for training purposes the ground zero 68 gz for the rv is always assumed to be the point where detonation will do the greatest damage 69 to the unit or installation delivery errors are not considered for rv of unspecified categories 70 see comparable table chart in jp 3122 or jp 3123 71 72 based on vulnerability radii and unit size commanders may determine risk from nuclear attack 73 and whether or not to adjust unit dispersion however personnel may not be the targets often 74 equipment due to sensitivity and vulnerability becomes the target see fm 331fmfm 1118 75 nuclear contamination avoidance for training data for actual vulnerability radii refer to jp 3122 76 srd 77 78 analyzing the vulnerability of friendly dispositions and installations consists of 79 determining the appropriate threat yields based on current intelligence determining 80 the disposition of unit personnel 81 obtaining the appropriate vulnerability radii from the rv table jp 3122 srd or jp 82 3123 or fm 331 for training purposes 83 estimating fractional coverage for each target category using the visual numerical 84 or index technique for information concerning these techniques reference jp 3122 85 srd visual technique is discussed in fm 331fmfm 1118 for training purposes 86appendix c c6 recommending ways to decrease vulnerability and increase protection 87 88 to determine vulnerability using the visual technique outline the unit battle position use 89 compass piece of plastic with the rv drawn to scale on it or circular map scale 90 superimpose the rv chosen from table c1 or jp 3122 over the predicted targeted area 91 92 the gz used for the analysis is the location that would result in the highest fractional coverage of 93 the target from this worst case gz and the appropriate rv an estimation of the percentage of 94 casualties or materiel damage that might result from an enemy nuclear strike may be determined 95 96 using the center point of the compass template or circular map scale as the gz choose the gz 97 that would result in the highest fractional coverage of the target area visually estimate the 98 percentage of the unit covered by the rv 99 100 if this fractional coverage yields unacceptable losses of personnel or equipment the commander 101 must then make decision of how best to reduce the casualty and equipment loss rate this may 102 be done by adding shielding or enacting vulnerability reduction measures if mechanized 103 battalion occupies battle position 5 km wide and 25 km deep it could be positioned as in figure 104 c4 target elements are uniformly dispersed in the area in this example the rv from 5 105 kiloton weapon for personnel in armored personnel carriers is 1250 meters as determined from 106 table c1 worst case the rv by placing the gz where it provides the largest target coverage 107 fifty percent of the battalion is covered by the rv thus up to 50 percent of the battalions 108 personnel in armored personnel carriers could become casualties when the same battalion 109 deploys in three company battle positions in depth the distances between positions significantly 110 reduce the damage probability even assuming the weapon detonates at the worst case gz as 111 seen i n figure c5 although one company is 100 percent vulnerable the battalion overall is only 112 33 percent vulnerable 113 114 table c1 radii of

and more 174 importantly provide vulnerability reduction measures at the same time 175 176vulnerability analysis and mitigation c9 chemical vulnerability 177 178 prior to conducting vulnerability analysis first determine the risk of chemical attack or the 179 threats capability and probability of use see figure c3 180 181 if the possibility exists for the threat to employ chemical agents conduct vulnerability analysis in 182 two parts 183 first make an estimate of the threats capability to employ chemical munitions in the 184 units aoal see page c4 chemical risk assessment within specific time period 185 second use this information to generate simplified effects information 186 187 estimate delivery capability 188 189 step 1 determine time periods of interest time periods of interest are determined based on 190 the commanders operational concept and situation variables such as mission enemy terrain 191 troops time and civilian consideration or metttc the time period is determined in 192 coordination with the intel and operations officers they will normally conform to phases or the 193 expected duration of an operation however it may be desirable to use other criteria 194 195 for example maintenance unit may want to use the expected time lag between an anticipated 196 threat chemical attack and the time required to retrieve and don their protective gear as in 197 mopp ready protective posture as the time period of interest time period may also be 198 based on factors relating to enemy tactics such as the expected arrival time of second echelon 199 force further significant weather changes could also influence the selection of time periods 200 the time period of interest can range from six hours to 48 hours 201 202 vulnerability analysis is generally conducted in support of the planning process not in support of 203 current operations while some planning factors are based on 12 hour to 48 hour cycle fixed 204 site operations may be based on significantly higher time frame ie 12 hours to 96 hours with 205 time periods of 24 hours or greater used when ipb allows time periods of less than six hours 206 are generally not used for shortterm actions shorter time periods could be used to estimate the 207 effects of initial enemy preparation fires or to estimate the effect of single chemical agent attack 208 209 step 2 associate weather data with each time period 210 211 associate each time period with temperature wind speed and stability category the 212 temperature will impact primarily on agent persistency for each time period temperature should 213 be expressed as one of the following in degrees celsius 55o 50o 40o 30o 20o 10o 0o 10o 214 20o or 30o 215 216 note all required information can be obtained from the ch emical downwind message 217 cdm 218 219 determine temperature by taking the average of the temperatures from each cdm line applicable 220 to the time period of interest use this average temperature for all calculations 221 222 note when estimating persistency for agents expected to t beyond the time period of 223 interest use the average daily temperature of the day in which the attack may occur 224 225 wind speed will impact on casualty production persistency and downwind agent travel it should 226 be expressed as one of the following 3 6 9 12 15 or 18 kmph 227 228 note as rule of thumb for any wind speed above 18 kmph use 18 kmph calculate 229 wind speed in the same manner used above for temperatur in some situations it may be 230 necessary to modify this number for casualty estimate purp oses 231appendix c c10 232 for example if 24 hour period contains sixhours of expected high wind speeds unstable 233 conditions you will probably elect to disregard those figures and develop separate lower 234 average for casualty estimation the staff estimates an enemy would not employ chemicals for 235 casualty effects during that sixhour period of high winds base this decision on the magnitude 236 and duration of the wind change and the expected enemy coa 237 238 stability categories stable neutral or unstable also affect casualty production and downwind 239 agent travel however their impact is minor compared to temperature and wind speed 240 determine the stability category in the same way as temperature and wind speed 241 242 other environmental factors exist that could impact the analysis 243 244 for example terrain and vegetation could affect the estimate however these factors have 245 been incorporated in the persistency estimate process 246 247 step 3 estimate delivery capability 248 249 estimate the number of chemical munitions likely to be employed in your ao for each required 250 time period coordinate with the intelligence officer andor fire support officer fso if available 251 to produce this estimate 252 253 provide the intel officer with the time periods of interest 254 the intel officer can produce information concerning the threats capability to deliver 255 chemical munitions in your ao 256 257 the estimate should indicate the number of delivery units by type and the number of rounds by 258 agent if available the intel officer also provides estimates on when where and what type of 259 agent the enemy will use in the ao if the situation or event template does not yield needed 260 information assume the enemy can optimize the agent mix 261 262 for example to determine the threats capability to create contamination obstacle assume 263 they will fire only persistent agents likewise to predict casualty effects assume the enemy will 264 fire agents that have the greatest casualty producing effects 265 266 when the primary threat is covert or unconventional express enemy delivery capability in terms of 267 agent weight or as agent weight times some expected delivery means 268 269 for example ten kilograms of nerve agent delivered by an agricultural sprayer if estimates 270 indicate limited agent supply it will be difficult to estimate how much of that supply will be used 271 each day as an option for this situation conduct the analysis for single enemy attack based on 272 the threats maximum employment capability during the selected time period 273 274 the intelligence officer considers number of factors in making his estimate 275 number of employment assets within range of the ao 276 other ao the enemy force must service note do not assume every delivery 277 system within range will be firing into the ao being considered 278 enemy locations of chemical munitions 279 weather effects on probable agents 280 threat forces capability to deliver chemical munitions to delivery systems 281 impact of threat attacks on civilians 282 283 the intelligence estimate should provide range of numbers based on estimated coa for each 284 time period the estimate should provide the enemys maximum capability and his likely delivery 285 capability alternatively different estimates can be provided that would support various enemy 286vulnerability analysis and mitigation c11coa estimates should not be based on friendly coa unless they would significantly impact on 287 enemy delivery capability 288 289 it is not necessary to assess every possible situation and enemy option to do so would result in 290 inefficient use of available time the goal is to provide estimates to the commanderstaff which 291 can be later refined continuously assess the situation and look for events and options with the 292 potential of changing the outcome of the battle 293 294 generate effects information 295 296 at this point you have estimated time periods and munitions estimate combinations for each of 297 these combinations develop set of effects information casualty estimates contamination 298 obstacles persistence and times and locations of downwind agent effects effect information will 299 provide the following estimates 300 casualty effects 301 downwind agent effects 302 303 determine casualty estimate 304 305 step 1 determine probable friendly targeted size 306 307 based on the chemical staffs and s2g2 ipb select an areaactivity the enemy would 308 probably target then determine the target size for example determine the area 309 occupied by fixed site activity in this case 400m x 600m 310 311 calculate the number of hectares in the selected target area for example one hectare is 312 10000 square meters therefore an area that is 400m x 600m 240000 square meters or 24 313 hectares 314 315 step 2 determine probable agent unless it is known which agents the threat will employ 316 assume the most effective casualtyproducing agent available 317 318 step 3 estimate casualties 319 320 estimate casualties based on 321 ipb 322 the number of rounds the threat may use to engage the specific target 323 predicted temperatures from cdm or other sources 324 then refer to tables c4 c5 and c6 for corresponding casualty percentages 325 326 note for tables c4 c5 and c6 if the number of rounds falls between given numbers 327 assume worst case by rounding up to the next higher num ber 328 329 casualty estimates the casualty estimates are valid for wind speeds less than 20 kmph other 330 factors such as air stability category humidity variations in wind speeds under 20 kmph and 331 delivery errors were found to have minimal effect on casualty estimates for given time period as 332 opposed to specific point in time 333 334 for example the templated target area is 24 hectares predicted agent is gb the temperature is 335 10o c degrees celsius and the weapon is 152mm gunhowitzer intelligence analysis estimates 336 the enemy will fire 240 rounds at the target 240 rounds divided by 24 hectares is 10 rounds per 337 hectare go to table c4 and extract approximate casualty percentage 50 to determine 338 blister agent casualties use the same procedures and table c6 however use mopp level rather 339 than temperature 340appendix c c12table c4 sarin gb casualties 341 munitions in rounds per

downwind hazard risks 347 348 associated risks from downwind hazards see atp45 afm 33 fmfm 1117 or appropriate 349 service publication for downwind prediction models can be broken into three categories 350351 high casualty risk occurs at winds speeds of 10 kmph or less during slightly stable stable or 352 extremely stable atmospheric conditions agent clouds will produce very narrow and very long 353 hazard clouds dosages of 100 times the lethal levels are possible in the hazard area 354355 high degradation risk occurs during stability categories of neutral to very unstable and wind 356 speeds less than 10 kmph agent clouds will produce wide hazard areas with lethal effects rarely 357 extending as far as 10 kilometers the casualty risk to warned unmasked personnel is low 358 however due to the large cloud width it is possible for every unit in the downwind hazard area to 359 be forced to mask for several hours 360361 low casualty risk occurs at wind speeds of 10 kmph or greater at stability categories of neutral 362 to very unstable the casualty risk is very low outside the area of immediate effects although 363 significant number of units will be forced to mask agent duration will be short and will not extend 364 as far as in previous categor ies 365appendix d fixed site nbc defense planning tools d11 overview 2 3 this appendix supports the discussion in chapter 3 by further focusing nbc defense 4 considerations on fixed site operations the format used is the standard opord format with 5 brief statement as to the type information which might be addressed under that portion of the site 6 opord because of the multiple tenant activities normally found on base or within base 7 cluster it is important that all tenants operate in concert and respond to nbc situations in like 8 manner organizing the entire base nbc defense under one plan will help preclude some tenants 9 being protected and others not getting the word 10 11 the following sections mission template section i nbc annex section ii nbc 12 reconsurveillancemonitoring appendix section iii and smoke support appendix section iv 13 are designed to stimulate thought as to the type information to be included the sections are not 14 intended to exclude the application of specific mission considerations not addressed in this text 15 16 key points for issuing orders 17 18 this section provides several general rules for preparing and issuing good orders 19 20 preparation 21 22 clarity clearly convey your nbc defense message through nbc doctrine use of approved 23 acronyms and abbreviations and use of established military terminology 24 completeness include all the information and instructions necessary to coordinate and 25 execute nbc defense operations if more information is forthcoming state expected 26 timecontent do not leave open ends 27 brevity avoid providing unnecessary nbc defense details however do not sacrifice clear 28 and complete orders for brevity 29 use the affirmative direct expressions serve to convey simple clear meanings to 30 instructions 31 avoid qualifying directives meaningless expressions and adverbs do not clearly fix 32 responsibility for actions 33 authoritative expressions be direct decisive and clear in fixing mission needs support 34 and responsibility 35 timelines do your planning early and continuously permit maximum incorporation of nbc 36 defense into all phases of planning and implementation 37 38 issuing orders 39 40 give simple and direct nbc defense missions 41 give the units time to plan and prepare for mission execution 42 use the onethirdtwothird rule backwards plan to allow subordinates twothirds of the total 43 time available 44 obtain backbrief to ensure comprehension 45 46 section i 47 mission templates 48 49 mission templates provide road map for planning preparing and successfully executing 50 operations the nbc defense staff uses doctrinal templates see figure s d1 to d 5 to plan 51 nbc defense operations to employ nbc reconnaissance biological detection smoke and 52appendix d d2decontamination assets and to conduct battle management this section provides tools for 53 developing opords and employing chemical assets 54 each template provides the process for planning preparing and executing the chemical support 55 mission from the staffs perspective the boxes on the

decontamination operations 72 73 nbc defense operations template 74 75 the nbc defense operations template figure d1 is used to evaluate the enemys ability to 76 employ wmd against fixed site operations and to delineate the assets required to mitigate wmd 77 effects this template is used to summarize what is known and not known about the enemys 78 nbc capabilities and to determine information required with this information the staff can 79 perform an nbc vulnerability assessment evaluating the impact of nbc attack on base mission 80 accomplishment site operations some operations will be more vulnerable to degradation than 81 others and individual mission performance factors finally the template provides quick 82 reference to the status of units attacked or in the downwind hazard area of an nbc attack units 83 are only posted to this last status matrix when they are at risk when longer at risk they may 84 be deleted from the matrix 85 86 nbc reconnaissance template 87 88 the nbc reconnaissance template figure d2 is used to summarize the recon naissance 89 missions and organizations charged with hazard detection and monitoring on base site or base 90 area of interest the mission box lists missions assigned by the base commander for conducting 91 nbc reconnaissance these assignments can be nbcrs unit missions missions tasked by 92 higher headquarters to bids and lrbsds teams operating within the base area of operations or 93 it can be survey and monitoring missions assigned to sector commanders or base tenant 94 activities more specific basebase cluster nbc reconnaissance missions may include medical 95 treatment personnel collecting specimens from suspect nbc patients for analysis preventive 96 medicine surveillance of drinking water sources and supplies and veterinary services surveillance 97 of potential food supplies and government owned animals the c2 box highlights the command 98 and control relationships between the nbc recon naissance surveillance and survey teams their 99 locations and the nai they will operate in or against the communications box provides contact 100 information and the sustainment box lists critical items required to perform reconnaissance 101 operations the site commander and staff should study the nbc defense operations and the 102 nbc recon naissance templates to ensure that areas potentially targeted by the enemy are 103 covered in the base recon naissance plan 104 105fixed site nbc defense planning tools d3biodetection template 106 107 the biodetection template figure d3 is very similar to the reconnaissance template except that 108 the mission block refers to the corps commanders mission for biodetection operations rather 109 than the base commanders intent and mission phases additionally the nai and utm grid 110 coordinates are generally assigned by the corps and coordinated with the base commander 111 unique sustainment items such as b w detector tickets and bidslrbsds components are 112 provided through the biological detection company common supplies and maintenance may be 113 tasked to the base logistics support operations 114 115 smoke template 116 117 the smoke template figure d4 helps organize smoke missions assigned to smoke delivery 118 elements including projected emplaced and generated obscurants combat vehicle self 119 protection smokes are not included the sensor window box helps the smoke planner determine 120 the precise types of obscurants required to counter enemy sensors the planner then determines 121 the best distribution of available smoke assets for accomplishing the bases obscuration priorities 122 unlike maneuver operations base smoke missions will likely rely heavily on landline 123 communications for mission c2 therefore both radio frequencies and phone numbers of 124 supported and controlling elements should be recorded 125 126 decontamination template 127 128 the decontamination template figure d5 helps assess decon tamination requirements based 129 upon friendly ipb ie how many targets is the enemy capable of attacking simultaneously 130 agent type and anticipated quantities drive how much deco ntamination might be required and is 131 quantified as required throughput the c2 box lists priorities for decon tamin ation based upon 132 the site commanders assessment of critical activities requiring the most immediate return to 133 normal operations additionally this box specifies decon tamination site locations linkup points 134 security requirements and coa affecting decon tamination operations under the sustainment 135 window special attention is required for site closure procedures as the decon tamination site 136 once used will remain hazardous materials site requiring

support us 33 forces by performing traffic control convoy escort base security and cargo and troop transport 34 duties however hn support is highly situational and heavily dependent on operational 35 capabilities of the hn and its support for us policies commanders using civil affairs personnel 36 must determine functional types and levels of hn support that can be accepted with high 37 assurance that the hn will be able to meet commitments for example civil affairs personnel in 38 conjunction with t heir counterparts in the hn would make the following determinations is the labor 39 force stable and adequate to provide needed resources for daily operations and to fulfill surge 40 requirements is military security competent to quell spontaneous and organized actions directed 41 at the fixed site and toward us personnel and civilians are translators competent to act as 42 intermediaries with high assurance of correctly enunciating and relating all positions correctly 43 is there

considered insignificant during wartime increase greatly 4 in significance when manufactured stored distributed or transported in close proximity to fixed site 5 operations deliberate or inadvertent release during military operation other than war moot w 6 significantly increases hazards to the indigenous population and us forces while chemical warfare 7 agents are highly toxic and lethal in small amounts the countries that produce them are generally known 8 and are few in number when compared with the quantities and universal nature of tim tim should be 9 recognized for the single hazard they pose as well as the potential risks that may result from explosion 10 fire and associated products derived from single m or tim in combination most tim will present 11 vapor inhalation hazard vapor concentration at or near the point of release may be very high and may 12 reduce the oxygen concentration below that required to support life these tim are generally in one of the 13 following categories 14 agricultural includes insecticides herbicides fertilizers 15 industrial chemical and radiological materials used in manufacturing processes or for cleaning 16 production and research chemicals and biologicals produced or stored in facility 17 radiological nuclear power plants medical facilitieslaboratories 18 19 planning considerations 20 21 given the prevalence of tim throughout the world it must be assumed that future threats to us military 22 force deployments will include tim hazards area studies intelligence estimates and or economic studies 23 may indicate potential tim hazards in the ao all levels of command should keep totally open flow of 24 information regarding the existence and status of m hazard ous areas commanders must ensure the 25 exercise of appropriate security safeguards for m hazard planning information since potential 26 belligerents could use the threat of release as well as the actual release of m hazards to increase local 27 and regional tensions identification location detection and appropriate response to potential m 28 hazards must be key part of nbc defense planning information of particular significance when planning 29 tim hazard response includes the m location hazard presented explosive flammable inhalation 30 quantity of material involved in combination or single dispersion patterns based on historical prevailing 31 wind direction activities or populations to be evacuatedprotected protection required established safe 32 distances for personnel and hazard control requirements 33 34 in addition to other sources the north american emergency response guidebook 1996 naerg96 35 provides general reference for identifying specific and generic m hazards individual protection 36 required and emergency response when responding to the initial tim hazard briefly the naerg96 37 provides quick crossreference index for tim id numbers guide numbers and alphabetical listing of 38 tim hazard categories which are then incorporated into table of initial isolation and minimum protective 39 action distances to the 90th percentile 90 probability that hazard will not exceed these distances table 40 g1 41 42 develop chart or table for known tim hazards that may affect fixed sites display information and the 43 chart for minimum protection of responding personnel and immediate protection of life and health of the

preferred location 50 balanced by mission requirements for military facilities close to m hazards is at higher elevations in 51 open areas upwind and at established safe distances from the source 52 53 establish hazard response guide for those tim hazards which could provide serious consequences if 54 released the hazard response guide must include the elements for the tim hazard involved such as in 55 table g2 56 57 of vital importance to commanders and troops is an awar eness that current military respirator 58 canisters can provide very limited protection from tim some tim hazards can displace oxygen 59 from the air rendering respirators ineffective therefore nly use respirator canisters for 60 protection while immediately exiting the hazard area 61 62 determining protective action zones 63 64 plans that support protective action zones for each hazard site and immediate evacuation from the 65 hazard path are the best defense against the tim hazard as minimum commanders should consult 66 with the engineer officer nbc defense officer legal officer medical officer intelligence officer 67 provost marshal and public affairs officer when planning protective action zones these staff officers 68 can provide guidance for hazard isolation entry denial evacuation and inplace protection national 69 sources may be available to provide operational and scientific expertise in the event of an actual incident 70 71 isolate hazard areaentry denial isolating the hazard area establishes control and is the first step 72 for protective actions that follow exclude personnel not directly involved in responding to the hazard 73 especially responding personnel that are not adequately protected the initial isolation zone will 74 include upwind distances from the incident within which dangerous concentrations of material may 75 exist 76 77 evacuate when time and mission allow evacuation is the best protective response to tim hazard 78 however there must be enough warning and preparation time to evacuate the protective action zone 79 evacuate personnel nearest and those outdoors in direct view of the scene then evacuate personnel 80 furthest from the tim hazard the protective action zone assumes that random wind direction 81 changes confine the hazard vapor plume to an area within 30 degrees on either side of the 82 predominant wind direction resulting in crosswind protective action distance equal to the downwind 83 protective action distance for practical purposes the protective action zone eg the area in which 84 people are at risk of harmful exposure is square whose length and width are the same as the 85 downwind distance as shown in figure g 1 the hazard is located at the center of the circle which 86 represents the initial isolation zone around the hazard emergency action evacuation must consider 87 that water reactive poison inhalation hazards pih that make their way into streams will move with 88 the current and stretch the

all ignition sources smoking flares sparks or flames in the immediate area all equipment used when handling the product must be grounded keep combustibles wood paper oil etc away from spilled material prevent entry into waterways sewers basements or confined areas first aid move victim to fresh air call emergency medical care apply artificial respiration if victim is not breathing do not use mouthtomouth method if victim ingested or inhaled the substances use other approved respiration devices equipped with oneway valve remove and isolate contaminated clothing administer oxygen if breathing is difficult shower and wash with soap and water effects of exposure inhalation ingestion or skin contact may be delayed ensure medical personnel are aware of the materials involved and take precautions to protect themselves 92appendix g g493 when evacuating the hazard area individuals wear clothing that prevents deposition of liquid on and 94 minimizes injury to exposed skin nbc protective clothing may be used 95 96 do not permit evacuees to congregate at established safe distances evacuation to established safe 97 distances does not guarantee complete safety for evacuated personnel when possible move 98 evacuated personnel to designated location by specific route and to distance where additional 99 movement is not required following radical wind shift 100 101 inplace protection use inplace protection table j2 when evacuation may cause greater risk 102 than remaining in place or when successful evacuation cannot be conducted inplace protection may 103 not be the option of choice if the tim vapors are flammable if the hazard is persistent or if buildings 104 cannot be closed tightly although vehicles are not as effective as buildings vehicles can offer some 105 protection for short period when windows are closed and the ventilating system is shut off warn 106 persons that are protectedinplace to stay clear of windows due to the danger from glass and 107

decisionlogic charts see figure h1 for assisting 4 commanders with decontamination decisions excluding some different techniques for 5 specialized equipment personnel and equipment decontamination procedures see figures h2 6 and h3 referred to in these charts are essentially the same throughout the services and are 7 addressed in specific service doctrinal manuals 8 9 however the remainder of the appendix focuses on facilities and terrain decon techniques see 10 figures h4 and h5 since very little detailed tactics techniques and procedures exist in any 11 single reference 12 13 decontamination decision logic 14 15 figure h 1 decon decisions 16 17 personnel contamination 18 19 contaminated personnel should automatically perform immediate decontamination as soon as 20 possible after the attack beyond immediate decontamination the commander must make 21 decisions see figure h2 based on answers to questions that will affect his mission can the 22 mission be accomplished in mopp is question of immediate importance and drives 23 subsequent decisions the commanders goal is to accomplish the mission with minimum 24 degradation from mopp balanced with the requirement to protect the force personnel from the 25 nbc hazard if time and resources are insufficient for thorough decon the commander 26 considers the same requirements for operational decontamination remember that operational 27 decontamination is not the preferred end state because it incurs risk and degradation until 28 thorough decon or weathering normally for extended periods eliminate s the risk 29 30appendix h h2 n yy yn n n 31 figure h 2 personnel decisions 32 33 equipment contamination 34 35 after decontaminating themselves personnel should perform immediate decontamination on 36 contaminated individual equipment as personnel perform immediate decontamination the 37 commander determines if the remaining contamination will cause unacceptable mission 38 performance degradation if acceptable the commander continues the mission assuming an 39 element of risk requiring frequent reassessment 40 41 when risks are unacceptable the commander considers see figure h3 operational or thorough 42 decon the staffs recommendation is based on available time and resources ideally if both are 43 available conduct thorough decon if time and resources are limited consider operational decon 44 to provide temporary relief from mopp and reduce contamination on equipment if time or 45 resources dont permit operational decon continue the mission with periodic reviews of risk and 46 resources 47 48 facility contamination 49 50 if facilities are contaminated see figure h4 the first actions are marking reporting and 51 warning of the contamination this allows the commander to determine the extent of 52 contamination in mission essential facilities in partially contaminated facilities the commander 53 determines if the contaminated area is mission essential or creating vapor hazard if the answer 54 is to both questions the commander continues the mission and the area is if necessary 55 remediated postconflict 56 57 contamination hazards that may cause mission failure or pose unacceptable risk require the 58 commander and staff to determine if mission functions can move to another facility within the 59 basebase cluster if the functions cant be moved within the basebase cluster the commander 60 and staff consider relocating the functions to another redundant facility in theater if not viable 61 option consider operational decon remember as with contaminated terrain

obstacle to maneuveroperations and downwind hazard units encountering contamination 69 mark and report the area so other units can receive warning while the area will likely require 70 postconflict environmental remediation continue the mission if it is neither an obstacle nor 71 downwind hazard 72 73 as with any obstacle the commander can choose to breach or not use the area in the vicinity of 74 the nbc hazard regardless commanders ensure personnel are protected breaching 75 operations are hasty or deliberate based on mission time available and resources in either 76 case personnel and equipment are checked afterward for contamination and will likely require 77 decon 78 79 contaminated terrain may pose hazard downwind avoiding the hazard by relocating may not 80 support mission requirements and prolonged operations in increased protection mopp may 81 also be unacceptable if so the commander may have to cover remove or decon the hazard to 82 reduce mission risks as with breaching work crews and equipment will likely require 83 decontamination 84 85 86 facility decon 87 88 decontamination of fixed sites should be considered only when the loss of the facility will 89 adversely affect mission accomplishment facilities can be heated flushed disinfected and 90 neutralized see table h1 to remove or destroy the contamination regardless of the technique 91 chosen

operations 98 after nbc attack 99 100 facility decontamination should be reduced to the minimum possible effort if it isnt nailed down 101 remove it is the best possible advice decontamination of ceilings walls nailed down items 102 built in surfaces and floors must be accomplished from the ceiling down 103 104 table h2 provides guidance but does not include everything you may find in facility that 105 requires decontamination the basic rule is if you absolutely must have it to ensure mission 106 accomplishment and you cant replace it then decontami nate it however commanders and 107 staffs must be ruthless in deciding what can and what cant be replaced and consequently what 108 must be decontaminated and what must be removed 109 110 table h1 facilities decontamination 111 decon of possible actions nuclear contaminationflushing can be effective for removing loose radioactive contamination however condition known as rainout may leave film on some surfaces that resists flushing flushing combined with scrubbing the contaminated surface should remove all contamination note control of wastewater is of vital importance as flushing removes contamination but doesnt neutralize it

biological decontamination flushing can be very effective for removing biological agents to include diluting toxins flushing does not neutralize biological agents but transfers the problem from your immediate area to contained area sump where they may be neutralized note rough surfaces must be scrubbed after the disinfectant has been applied or flushing has occurred to ensure contamination doesnt lodge or embed itself in the contaminated surface if you are unsure whether the surface is smooth or rough scrub the surface after the disinfectant has been applied and or flushing has occurred chemical contaminationheat if air filtration systems are available reduce the agent to vapor hazard with heat dry and allow the filtration system to absorb or exhaust the hazard remove the filter and dispose of appropriately flushing is not effective for removing some types of chemical agents especially thickened agents flushing does not neutralize chemical agents but transfers the problem from

action 115 they must be removed or shielded 116 if it is impracticable to wait for 117 natural decay therefore 118 radiological decontamination is the 119 process of reducing the radiation 120 hazard to an acceptable level by 121 removal and disposal of the 122 contamination or by placing shielding over the contamination table h3 describes various types 123 of decontaminants that have proven

appendix provides detailed procedures for determining and reducing residual contamination 4 levels on equipment contaminated in nuclear biological andor chemical battlespace 5 environment procedures are also included for marking this equipment maintaining historical 6 records conducting periodic monitoring and transporting this equipment out of the joint 7 operational area joa to conus retrograde destination 8 9 objective 10 11 the safety of service members and transport personnel is of foremost concern during the conus 12 retrograde of equipment with potential residual or lowlevel nbc contamination these 13 procedures are intended to 1 protect personnel against lowlevel nbc exposure resulting from 14 maintenance or transportation contactactions 2 conserve valuable assets and 3 maintain dod 15 life cycle control of previously contaminated equipment with current decon technology 16 constraints it should be recognized that some equipment may require extensive weathering to 17 meet safety objectives and in some cases equipment may require destruction in theater 18 19 overview 20 21 for purposes of this document residual contamination is defined as 1 postattackincident 22 contamination not detectable by standard field detectors eg cam m8a1 m256 and 2 23 contamination that remains on equipment after thorough decontamination any equipment 24 present in the templated hazard attack area per atp 45 may demonstrate res idual 25 contamination when monitored by specialized detectors ava ilable at specified fixed sites in 26 the jra following thorough decon residual contamination risks include potential vapor hazards 27 and limited contact hazards these risks increase as residually contaminated equipment is 28 consolidated and personnel work around this equipment for prolonged periods particularly in 29 areas with limited air circulation risks may also increase as equipment is disassembled for 30 maintenance functions or containerized for shipment 31 32 suggested retrograde procedures involving chemical agents are based on compliance with 33 published airborne exposure limits da pam 38561 toxic chemical agent safety standards 34 defines airborne exposure limits ael as allowable concentrations in the air for occupational 35 and general population exposures although that document is intended for chemical depot 36 application as opposed to warfighting its historical provision for the safety of chemical depot 37 workers supports its credibility as guide to toxic agent safety in conus retrograde scenario 38 companion documents include 29

agent wor kers can be exposed day after day without known adverse health effects 49 although some nuclear and biological retrograde procedures are discussed understand that 50 methods to mitigate these residual hazards are primarily functions of removal andor death of 51 the agent as defined by nuclear andor biological decay rates for residual radiation if the 52 particles can not be removed the time required for natural decay is function of the isotopes 53 halflife and can not be hurried at which point distance and shielding between personnel and the 54 equipment is the only means of reducing exposure risks biological agents generally die within 55 hours after dissemination andor exposure to ultraviolet light sunlight for more robust biological 56 agents thorough decon and preparation of equipment to us department of agriculture import 57 standards will eliminate most health threats even so continuing precautions are warranted 58 because of the small particle size of the typical biological warfare agent some agent may adhere 59 to internal equipment surfaces creating risk to unwarned maintenance personnel touching facial 60 areas after contact with these internal surfaces 61 62 in addition to the n b and c considerations this appendix addresses two equipment retrograde 63 scenarios emergency equipment retrograde and nonemergency equipment retrograde the 64 emergency scenario is predicated upon immediate mission requirements such as the depotlevel 65 rebuild of critical shortage end item eg jet engine conversely the nonemergency scenario 66 is basically postconflict redeployment of military equipment although an infinite amount of time 67 is unrealistic for nonemergency retrograde planning should address significant time 68 requirements for agent weathering 69 70 concept of the 71 operation 72 73 the safe retrograde and longterm 74 disposition of equipment with 75 residual contamination requires 76 thorough understanding from 77 equipment operator to cjcs of the 78 associated risks and the minimum 79 requirements necessary to mitigate 80 those risks figure i1 identifies 81 the minimum essential tasks 82 associated with these retrograde 83 operations responsibilities and 84 detailed guidance for performing 85 these tasks follow in later 86 discussion 87minimum essential tasks mark equipment equipment is marked as precautionary

increasing risks or offgassing figure i1 minimum essential tasksretrograde of equipment with residual nbc contamination i388 generally three words capture 89 the goals of nbc retrograde 90 operations fig i2 mission 91 protection and control 92 prioritization of these three goals 93 is function of operational timing 94 and the extent of contamination 95 for example under emergency 96 conditions strategic andor 97 operational objectives may 98 warrant increased risks and 99 require increased protective 100 postures to meet mission 101 requirements however in 102 nonemergency situation those 103 same risks may be unacceptable 104 and more stringent contami 105 nation control measures may be 106 required to support lower 107 individual protection levels 108 109 emergency retrograde concept 110 111 the emergency retrograde concept shown in figure i3 is based on the presumption that conflict is 112 ongoing and that failure to return critical items to conus or intermediate locations may result in 113 unacceptable strategic and 114 operational mission impacts 115 examples might include the 116 retrograde of critical items 117 such as jet or tank engines 118 requiring depot rebuild if 119 these items were contami 120 nated after removal the 121 risks associated with their 122 transport to depot and their 123 subsequent disassembly 124 would normally result in 125 significant delays

226 residual contamination hazards actions such as operational and thorough decon are common 227 service procedures in the nbc battlespace environment and in most cases these procedures 228 can reduce nbc hazards to negligible risk levels 229 230 negligible risk levels allow combat and 231 combat support missions to continue 232 at reduced mopp postures although 233 precautions for certain groups may 234 continue for example mechanics 235 working on previously contaminated 236 equipment should always monitor or 237 take protective measures before dis 238 assembling equipment components 239 also operators in restricted air flow 240 cabs or compartments use the buddy 241 system to observe for any responses 242 to lowlevel contamination left after 243 thorough decon 244 245 however the concern with residual 246 contamination is lowlevel exposure 247 over extended periods in other words 248 longterm occupational exposure 249 outside the context of accomplishing 250 specific combat mission objectives 251 mitigating these risks requires unit 252 commanders to implement certain 253 commanddirected procedures see 254 figure i10 including 255 256 special markings for 257 residual

prepare shipping containers afjman 24204 preparing hazardous materials for 31 military air shipments addresses the packaging of chemically contaminated cargo in 32 hermetically sealed bags and open head metal drums with airtight gaskets or using 33 double airtight drums advanced coordination with the air mobility command is essential 34 for cargo that will not fit into these containers extreme measures to protect the aircraft 35 from contamination are warranted since these aircraft support missions worldwide most 36 jet engines and some other major end items have airtight shipping

nbc protection individual and collective nbc protection is 4 needed when the chance of contamination from nbc weapons is anticipated or unavoidable 5 therefore fixed site commanders must ensure that their personnel have adequate protection 6 against nbc hazards and the means to sustain continuous operations throughout the hazard s 7 duration 8 9 individual nbc protection individual protective measures are taken by personnel to survive 10 and continue the mission with minimal loss in efficiency personnel at fixed sites at minimum 11 must have individual protective equipment ipe against nbc hazards this individual protection 12 consists of protective mask suit gloves and boots individual protection levels are referred to as 13 mission oriented protective posture mopp there are various levels of mopp adopted by the 14 armed forces these levels are designed to allow commanders to increase or decrease the level 15 of protection rapidly without providing long explanations commander determines the initial level 16 of mopp based on mopp analysis which finds the balance between reducing the risk of 17 casualties and accomplishing the mission the level is adjusted as nbc risks change 18 remember degradation in efficiency will occur for personnel placed in heightened individual 19 protection for extended periods although ipe provides for survival both individual and collective 20 protection are necessary to maintain continuous operations 21 22 in many cases fixed 23 site mission support 24 functions may not 25 allow the benefit of 26 working inside toxic 27 free

protection collective protection is an important aspect of fixed site nbc defense 57 ideally i t provides contaminationfree environment for personnel allowing relief from continuous 58 wear of mopp equipment the basic concept applied for collective protection is overpressure 59 and filtration by filtering incoming air and maintaining higher internal air pressure than external 60 pressure the contaminated external air is prevented from infiltrating the shelter and results in 61 toxicfree areas tfa for work and relief the human factor is the most variable input of the 62 collective protection equation due to the potential introduction of contamination inside the shelter 63 as result of poor entry procedures figure j2 shows the basic areas required to ensure the 64 toxic free area tfa remains safe for its occupants 65 66 collective protection supports three primary areas that quickly erode in an nbc environment 67 personnel restrelief breaks and sleeping work relief c4i maintenance supply etc and 68 protection of logistics storage areas for example pomcus and theater reserve materiel based 69 on different mission requirements each fixed site requires customized collective protection for 70 example personnel perform c4i and light maintenance operations more efficiently in some form of 71 collective protection than when encumbered by high mopp levels and ipe because of the large 72 machinery and frequent need to breach the building s air integrity personnel performing heavy 73 maintenance and supply operations may have to endure ipe and use collective protection for rest 74 and relief fixed sites can use combination of permanent mobile or temporary collective 75 protection shelters subsequent discussion addresses permanent modifications to existing

collective 81 protection measures and rehearse before during and after nbc attack actions commanders 82 with predominantly civilian work force may encounter extensive training program requirements 83 in this area frequent drills conducted during different shift s and during shift changes help 84 prepare the fixed site to minimize the potential impacts of wmd or tih on fixed site operations 85 86 nbc collective protection 87 88 the selection of and application of nbc collective protection techniques can be classified into four 89 categories 90 91 class i full integration permanent modifications are made to the buildings 92 and nbc filter units are fully integrated with existing heating ventilating and air conditioning 93 system hvac systems dampers controlling ventilation openings automatically actuate when 94 filter units turn on there are permanent accommodations for contamination control area 95 cca 96 97 class ii partial integration permanent modifications and sealing measures are 98 made to the building or portion of it and partial integration of hvac filter units or alternate 99 systems allow heatingcooling manual dampers control outside air and exhaust the cca may 100 be permanent or temporary eg tent 101 102 class iii expedient selected portions of the building are sealed by temporary 103 measures such as plastic sheeting and tape transportable filter units are temporarily mounted to 104 the building heatingcooling systems may or may not be employed temporary cca is 105 established 106 107 class iv secondary 108 enclosure the building is not tight 109 enough to economically maintain 110 pressurization but it is suitable for 111 using portable internal enclosures or 112 liner systems such as m28 or m20 113 collective protection equipment 114 system allows use of existing 115 heatingcooling system or alternate 116 systems examples include 117 warehouses hangers and 118 maintenance bays figure j3 119 shows the m20 simplified collective 120 protection equipment used to 121 provide tfa for command post 122 123 considerations for applying 124 collective protection to 125 existing buildings 126 127 the following considerations help 128 determine suitability or choice of 129 collective protection applied for 130 more detail on specific engineering 131 and equipment specifications contact the joint service collective protection assessment team 132 through the edgewood research development and engineering center erdec the army 133 corps of engineers omaha or pacific air forces command pacaf more detailed contact 134 information tbp 135 figure j3 m20 scpeappendix j j4136 tightness of selected building building tightness ability to maintain pressure can vary greatly 137 with the condition of the building and its hidden defects such as unsealed construction openings 138 hidden by drop ceilings or false walls fanpressurization blower door testing is the most 139 common technique used for measuring tightness there is specific level of leakage that 140 disqualifies building from collective protection modifications however tighter is better due to air 141 filtration unit costs and potential heatingcooling costs the average expected leakage reduction 142 from weat herizing measures is about 25 143 144 methods of tightening the building each time collectively protected building is pressurized 145 its protection envelope must be tightened by closing all intentional openings eg outside air 146 vents ex haust vents windows and doors other openings eg cracks crevices joints 147 penetrations for pipes and cables must be closed to the maximum extent feasible using 148 permanent means such as caulking and weather stripping 149 150 integration of filter units 151 with hvac system the 152 hvac systems in most 153 buildings are illsuited for the 154 integration of positive pressure 155 collective protection the least 156 costly approach is often to shut 157 off the hvac system and 158 block the supply and return 159 vents to the protected 160 envelope when the system is 161 pressurized such measures 162 may require alternate 163 heatingcooling methods 164 short of major modifications to 165 the hvac system the user 166 may have to accept 167 uncomfortable conditions in 168 winter and summer figure j4 shows modification of an existing environmental control unit with 169 gas particulate filter 170 171 overpressure levels the minimum overpressure recommended for stationary collective 172 protection shelters is 01 inches water gage iwg or 25 pascal based on preventing air infiltration 173 at ambient wind speeds greater than 15 mph at 15 mph the wind reduces the concentration and 174 dosage of mustard evaporating from the ground by about 98 compared with calm conditions 175 when preparing buildings and conducting test measurements it is advisable to provide for 176 highe r pressurization 02 iwg to ensure 01 iwg is still achieved over time as sealing measures 177 and building structures may deteriorat 178 179 note when overpressure is applied to hospital the operati ng rooms must have 180 overpressure at least 02 iwg higher than the rest of the hospital this provides 181 increased positive pressure in the area and prevents i nfectious organisms from 182 being introduced into the operating room suites from the r est of the hospital 183 184 filter units the joint collective protection assessment team evaluations and methodologies 185 established in 1997 recommends the ffa 580 filter unit for collectively protecting buildings this 186 600 cfm filter unit is also integrated into the survivable collective protection shelter scps 187 shown later in figure j 8 the ff 580 employs the modular collective protection equipment 188 filter set which is the most widely used filter set among the usa usn and usaf where the 189 building would require more than 10 ffa 580 units employ the m49 filter unit or largecapacity 190 commercial filter unit built to military specifications 191 air returnenvironmental control unit gas particulate filter unit unfiltered air input filtered air output figure j4 modified environmental control unitnbc protection options j5192 airlock s an airlock is transition 193 enclosure protected entryway in 194 which people wait for period of 35 195 minutes before entering or exiting the 196 tfa the main function of the airlock 197 is to prevent direct vapor transport into 198 the tfa during the airlock purging 199 period the flow of filtered air through 200 the airlock flushes out airborne 201 contaminants introduced with the 202 opening of the outer door the airlock 203 also ensures that tfa overpressure is 204 not compromised during entry or exit 205 for filtered pressurized air t he airlock 206 may rely on tfa air flow and 207 pressurization which creates variable 208 demand on the tfa pressurization 209 using dedicated filter unit for the 210 airlock reduces the variable demand 211 on the tfa and helps maintain tfa 212 integrity figure j 5 shows locally 213 fabricated airlock with dedicated filter 214 unit from the m20m28 cpe set as 215 constructed by erdec 216 217 contamination control

the 233 adherence of agent vapors to surrounding materialsobjects is the primary problem in most cca 234 recent studies indicate cca procedures require improvements in four areas 1 integration of 235 chemical detectors 2 cca decontaminant requirements 3 use of exchange masks and 4 236 reuse of protective garments 237 238 integration of chemical detectors the agent vapors in the openair cca can 239 actually adhere to the individual after doffing the overgarment and before entry into 240 the airlock there are four options for detecting and dealing with this problem 1 241 halt entry processing if vapor hazards are detected outside the shelter 2 use 242 chemical agent monitor cam to screen halt entry candidates with desorbing vapor 243 3 re quire re moval of all garments if cam or exterior monitors detect vapor and issue 244 new or temporary garments inside the tfa and 4 combine showers with previous 245 option using m8 paper to check for contamination prior to shelter entry is 246

requirements 248 249 cca decontaminant requirements recent reports indicate that unless under 250 extreme liquid contamination conditions 10gm2 use of decontaminants sorbents 251 eg diatomaceous earth or bleach inside the cca have little effect on reducing the 252 desorption of vapor inside the tfa 253 254 use of exchange masks the requirement to maintain eyerespiratory protection 255 throughout the transition process from individual to collective protection and to have 256 mask s inside the tfa is common to all services due to logistics constraints the 257 usa procedures do not include an exchange mask but rather the partial decon and 258 bagging of the individual mask that remains with the owner other options being 259 considered include disposable eye respiratory protection derp and neckdam 260 type emergency escape masks units with the m40series protective mask might 261 consider modifying doff procedures to include disposal of the quickdoff hood and 262 lens outserts which would be replaced inside the tfa 263 264 reuse of protective garments protective overgarment s are not issued in 265 quantities allowing discard each time person enters collective protection shelter 266 the scalp shown in figure j1 provides low cost option that would allow discard 267 of the outer scalp while avoiding the discard or reuse of contaminated protective 268 overgarment 269 270 shelter operating instructions 271 ideally collective protection 272 system requires only single 273 power switch to activate the 274 entire system except for closing 275 doors and windows class i 276 systems function this way other 277 systems rely on operator action 278 to close intentional openings not 279 always obvious to the operator 280 for example class iii modified 281 dormitory may require covering 282 over 100 toilet fan grilles 283 written operating instructions are 284 therefore essential and should 285 take two forms checklist 286 permanently mounted by the 287 control panel and set
