98045 background1 by the close of 1997 south korea was in the midst of serious financial crisis due in large part to sharp increase in repayments required on shortterm external debt the countrys foreign currency reserves dropped precip itously to precariously low 4 billion level this undermined investor confidence and capital f led the country the korean won lost half its value going from 800 won to 1600 won to the dollar within few days at the same time some major industrial conglomerates chaebol declared bankruptcy and the value of the korean stock market plummeted to deal with the crisis the government agreed in late d ecember 1997 to the terms of 57 billion support package put togetherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20041crs2 for background see nanto dick k and vivian c jones south

1998 korea wa s experiencing majo r improvements in its financial position with foreign exchange reserves approaching 50 billion and with an annualized current account surplus of about 4 0 billion in january 1999 korea began paying back its imf loan and international credit agencies began upgrading its sovereign risk rating from junk bond to investment grad status3 despite the improvement in koreas financial position its real economy continues to suffer the overall econom contracted by 6 and unemployment rose to about 8 in 1998 growth is predicted until the last quarter of 1999 and unemployment i s expected to continue to rise as thousands of small and medium sized companies g bankrupt every month behind these numbers are painful adjustments for millions f ordinary koreans particularly in terms of job losses and dramatic decline in livin g standards restoring economic growth restoration of economic growth depends on both improvements in the globa l economy and implementation of internal reforms improvements in the health of th global economy particularly the asian economy would do much to boost korean growth nearly 50 of korean exports now go to asia and the export sector has been hard hit by economic declines there while south korea has limited influence on improving the global economy it ca n work to restore its own economic growth by acting structural reforms more vigorously according to number of analysts the fundamental cause of koreas economic plight is that capital an d labor productivity in most industries are less than 50 of levels in th united states and japan low capital productivity resulted from banking system tha t provided the chaebol with easy credit for basically undisciplined capacity expansion in growing number of i ndustries not needing to worry about profitability the top chaebol created considerable overcapacity in industries such as cars petrochemicals semiconductors and steel at the same time under political pressure to avoid labo r troubles the chaebol over the past decade awarded labor f ivefold increase in wages that was not matched by increases in productivityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20041crs3 lee

that productivityenhancing reforms of the banking corporate and labor sectors take place while some critics have argued tha t seoul has not moved fast enough the government has maintained that much is being done particularly given t he wider economic and social repercussions that have to be considered in the implementation process all agree however that the domesti c reforms are indispensable for economic recovery banking reforms key component of koreas reform program is co mprehensive restructuring and recapitalization of the banking system koreas banks are burdened by high level of nonperforming loans an d an eroded capital base one estimate is that 20 of all bank loans are to some extent nonperforming and that half of those will have to be written off the first step the government took to deal with this problem early in 1998 was t establish an independent fina ncial supervisory institution called the financial supervisory commission next total of 94 financial institutions including 16 merchant banks two securiti firms and one investment trust were closed remaining banks have bee n ordered to clean up the number of nonperforming loans to meet international capita l adequacy standards the government has also announced and partially funded 6 4 trillion won 54 billion fund to purchase nonperforming loans and to fund ban k restructuring4 the governm ent has decided to deal with the six biggest and most troubled bank s through mergers or sales to foreign investors the hope is that super banks will have enough leverage over the chaebol to begin allocating credit efficiently in return for an infusion of new capital into the troubled banks the government is demanding cos t reductions through deep cuts in branches and staff or other efficiency measures some fear that this pl an could prolong the financial crisis by forcing strong banks to take on the problems of weaker ban ks in june 1998 for example the government closed five commercial banks but had healthier banks take over the assets while the merge d banks are under orders to restructure and cut costs plans have been announced corpora reforms efforts to restructure koreas banking sector are als intertwined with corporate sector reforms the main p roblems deal with an incredibly high corporate debt vel and weaknesses in corporate governance especially in the dominant chaebol large korean companies rely on debt as their main source of financing wit h extraordinarily high debt levels the level of corporate debt in korea has been estimated by the imf to be betwee n 500600 billion of which 60 billion is external debt short term liabilities accounted for half the total making korean companies vulnerable t economic downturns changes in interest rates and changes in creditor perceptions the vulnerability of korean companies to cyclical downturns is intensified by their ownership and financial structures nontransparent structure combining large

number of their subsidiaries nearly in half the proceeds from the sale an estimated 20 tr illion won or 16 billion of these noncore companies will be used to reduce corporate debt the chaebol leaders have also reaffirmed deadlines set fo r preparing consolidated financial statements in 1999 and for unraveling their cross subsidiary loan guarantees by march 2000 5 while president kim dae jung h as been taking leading role in pushing the chaebol leaders to implement substa ntial reforms many analysts caution that underlying problems of overcapacity and politically directed c redit need to be addressed under this view true restructuring involves shutting down moneylosing enterprises the closing of plants and reduction of excess capacity f course is vehemently resisted by both corporate captains and organized labor labor reforms the government s efforts to liberalize the labor market by passing new labor laws or strictly enforcing labor laws with regard to strikes have face d considerable resistance the labor market has been very rigid because of the tradition of lifetime employment while trade unions appeared to accept an d to lifetime employment guarantees in february 1998 based on the promise that chaebol owners would give u p some of their economic power and make themselves more accountable efforts to pus h through reform have been hampered by political stalemate and the lack or inadequacy of state unemployment benefits the opposition grand national pa rty with close links to big business has attempted to weaken number of labor reform proposals in order to maintain social stability during the reform process the government has been broadening unemployment benefits as of octo ber 1 1998 unemployment insurance was expanded from coverage of only those displaced workers who lost their jobs at large corporations to coverage of all displaced workers in addition the government s budgeted an excess of 10 trillion won 85 billion for social welfare purposes if th chaebol begin shutting inefficient plants and laying off workers on significant scale demand for social services and unemployment benefits could soar us economic interests south koreas

exports in 1997 to being the 10th largest market in 1998 at the same time us imports from south korea continued at 1997 levels 197 billion in exports through the first 10 months of 1998 compared to 193 billion during the same period of 1997 us imports from south korea are concentrated in steel computers cars and video equipment among these sectors steel imports surged b more than 125 over 1997 levels as result mostly of the steep drop in us exports to south korea the us trade surplus with korea which totaled 19 billion in 1997 moved to deficit position f about 7 billion in 1998 this reversal came after sustained upward trend over the past few years south koreas trade surplus with the united state s can be expected to grow in 1999 on the one hand korean demand for us exports of machinery and industrial inputs is likely to remain depressed as the korean economy remains in recession for most of th year on the other hand us demand for korean goods is li kely to grow due to continued us economic growth and the increased price competitiveness of korean exports the rising trade deficit in turn is likely to lea d to increased political pressures to limit korean export surges in particular sectors as well efforts to improve market access for us exports to korea political pressures to limit korean exports are being felt in the steel sector number of us steelmakers nd unions are pressing the clinton administration to impose quotas of steel im ports which grew overall by 30 in the first 10 months of 1998 korea n exports have been singled out by us steel interests due to their 86 increase in 1998 and longstanding allegations that korean steel producers have benefitted from lowinteres t loans and subsidies from the korean government6 us steelmakers and wor kers have also alleged that unfair subsidies were provided to hanbo steel koreas second largest steel producer according to industry sources hanbos access to credit on preferential terms ena bled it to undertake construction of one of the largest integrated steel mills in the world hanbo collapsed in january 1997 but the south korean governme nt allegedly continued to provide grants so that hanbo could continue its operations the us steel industry and congressional steel caucuses hav repeatedly pressed the clinton administration to address these concerns of unfai r competition in the omnibus spending bill passed in october 1998 pl 105277 congress directed section 621 that t he office of the united states trade representative report to congress within 60 days on the korean governments

1998 p 51adminis tration trade officials historically try to deflect pressures to limit impor t penetration in key sectors by increasing efforts to open up markets to us exports better market access conditions for us exports is viewed as way of minimizing th political fallout from rising bilateral trade deficit efforts along these lines in certai n sectors particularly automobiles could prove difficult even though the korea n governme nt has recently pledged to lower tariffs and eliminate other discriminator barriers the drop in projected demand for automobiles in korea means that trade in this sector will remain sensitive in 1997 for example us automobile exports to kore totaled 83 million while korean automobile exports to the united states totaled 1 9 billion for 18 billion deficit longer term assuming korea returns to position of sustained growth us economic in terests should be substantially enhanced major reason is that the kinds of changes that korea is being required to undertake under the imf program are basicall congruent with longstanding us trade and investment liberalization objectives thes entail much more open market including elimination of traderelated subsidies an d restricti ve import licenses they also include greater transparency in both korea n corporate and governmental decisionmaking wider participation by us companies i n the korean economy and less p olicydriven bank lending which in the past had given rise to overcapacity in industries such as steel automobiles semiconductors and shipbuilding perhaps the most promising changes have occurred in the area of foreign direc t investment in an effort to attract more foreign direct investment as way of fuelin g koreas economic rec overy the kim administration has enacted sweeping changes in its foreign direct investment regime buttressed by an attract foreign capital motto l limits on foreign investment in the local bond nd money markets have been lifted and the ceiling on foreign investment in the stock market has been eliminated foreign banks and securities companies have gained the right to establish local subsidiaries in june 1998 the korean government allowed hostile takeovers of korean corporations by foreigners to take place without any reservations restrictions on for eign ownership of land have also been eliminated 7 combined with cheaper asset prices the liberalized environment contributed to record amount of foreign direct investment in 1998 the nearly 9 billion invested b foreigners in korea during 1998 was more than onethird the entire amount invested i n korea since the mid1960s while the us share of foreign direct investment in korea remains around onethird south k oreas growing receptivity to foreign investment could lead to much larger
