recep tayyip erdogan and his justice and development party akp remain popular and have firm hold on power in turkey the akp is trying to recast itself from an islamistrooted party to centrist conservative democratic party although some akp actions fuel s ecularist suspicions of hidden islamist agenda the high priority that the party gives to attaining european union eu membership may mitigate fears about its inte ntions and support its centrist ambitions the government remains focused on the economy with the aid of the international monetary fund imf it s undertaken major m acroeconomic reforms achieved solid growth and reduced in flation the imf has reviewed the governments economic performance positively and is expected to approve new threeyear standby agreement for

other developments in iraq the turkish par liaments october 2003 decision to authorize the deployment of turkish peacekeepers to ir aq helped to improve ties even though the offer was not accepted however turk ey continues to be concerned about the situation in iraq and us actions there which fuel antiamericanism turkey remains important to the united states turkish air bases were used in the afghan war and its airspace in the iraq war its ports airbases and roads are used to resupply coalition forces and for reconstr uction efforts in iraq us troops rotate to and from iraq via turkey turkey will be an important transit route for pipelines carrying energy resources from the caucasus and central asia to the west and the often sabotaged oil pipeline from iraq to turk ey could be

the akp evident on march 1 2003 when parliament rejected government resolution to appr ove the deployment of us forces to turkey to open northern front against iraq have faded3 although akps parliamentary group is cumbersome it is not ripe for fissures mainly because of the strength of erdogans personality and his popularity with the grass roots and partly because members enjoy the perquisites of office erdogans power and charisma are making akp increasingly similar to traditional turkish personalitydominated political parties to avoid the short lives of series of earlier islamist political parties the akp claims the popular centerright of the political spectrum erdogan rejects the islamist label preferring to call himself and his party conservative democrats some of his statements could be part of an american debate regarding church state relations for example he has said while attaching importance to religion as social value we do not think it right to conduct

partisanship causing divisiveness to make religion an instrument of politics and to adopt an exclusionary approach to politics in the name of religion harms not only political pluralism but also religion itself4 the priority that erdogan and other pa rty leaders give to beginning accession talks with the european union eu aids the akps political repositioning eu reforms and the values they impose would pull the entire country to the center and to western values for example the eu requires equal freedom s for all believers for muslims who are not sunni and not accepted as muslim by the akps more passionate islamists for christians jews and others who heretofore have not been treated equally in turkey for more on reforms see european union below however erdogans attempt to dist ance akp from its islamist roots is undermined when some party officials and mbers of parliament raise issues with religiopolitical overtones that generate friction with the secular establishment in the military political opposition and elements in th media for thei r part secularists create discord when acting preemptively to counter real or suspected signs of encroaching islamism there have been many instances of such tension head scarves are major issue in turkey head scarf can simply be sign of religious piety or it can be an assertive expressi on of opposition to secularism the wearing of head scarves is banned in public buildings such as parliament and universities the military is particularly sensitive to this matter on april 23 2003 armed forces commanders declined to attend reception because the speakers wife wears head scarf and they did not know if she would attend she did not in august 2003 chief of staff genera l hilmi ozkok pointedly did not i nvite any officials wives to reception in october president ahmet n ecdet sezer invited wives of all his guests except those of akp deputies who might wear head scarves to republic day reception even some ardent secularists cr iticized the presidents action as divisive erdogan refuses to enter this fray saying that he is waiting for socialnational consensus to emerge on the issue he was saddened by the presidents discrimination but ttended the reception briefly with most members of his cabinet to avoid further tension the european c ourt of human rights has ruled once again on june 29 2004 that turkeys ban on wear ing head scarves in state schools does not violate freedom of religion but rather safeguards the principle of secularism necessary for the protection of the democratic system5

the chief of the general staff argued that the initiative was aimed at undermining the basic principles of the republic and they denounced it9 the prominence of the military command in the debate raised concerns about the countrys political stability and highlig hted differences between civilmilitary relations in turkey and the rest of europe at time when the akp government is seeking eu accession talks some questioned why akp decided to raise the issue at this time since the militarys sensitivitie s are well known with municipal elections just over and national elections years off akp s stated rationale of needing to reward grassroots was unconvincing pr esident sezer vetoed the bills asserting that they were incompatible with th spirit of the constitution which is based on the

erdogan and the akp often clash with president sezer popular former judge and ardent secularist who wields his veto power liberally12 sezers vetoes have delayed but not prevented passage of parts of

other words akp confirmed its dominance of th centerright the most popular segment of the turkish political spectrum there are several reasons for akps victory first its success in sustaining the
