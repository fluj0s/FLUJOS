s issues for congress summary multichannel cable and sa tellite television is the si ngle largest component of the entertainment sector it is estima ted that in 2003 americans spent 23552 per person on cable and satellite television and on averag watched 949 hours of non broadcast cable and satel lite progra mming multichannel television is major source of news and informational programming and diverse entertainment programming including niche programming some consumer advocates complain however that as result of the industry wide practice of offering almost all advertisersupported cable networks in single tier only consumers are forced to purchase networks they are not interested in receiving in order to obtain the networks they want for example in order fo r consumers to obtain desired childrens networks such as nickelodeon or discovery kids they must purchase the expanded basic service tier that includes networks whose programming some consider not of interest or objectionable these advocat claim consumers would be better off if they had the option to purchase just the i ndividual cable networks they want this is frequently referred to as carte purchasin g or at the least to purchase smaller tiers that include fewer of the cab networks they do not want the large cable programmers who provi most of the popular cable and broadcast television prog ramming respond that sing large expanded basic service tier represents the most efficient way to offer programming and that allowing customers to obtain networks on an carte basis or in small tiers would raise costs and hence prices to consumers and also reduce the diversity of programs offered so that consumer welfare would suffer in th long run they claim single large tier reduces the risks associated with introduc ing new cable networ ks and helps support niche networks in response to requests from key member s of the house nd senate commerce committees the federal communications commission fcc prepared report that concludes that replacing the current tiered pricing system with mandatory carte purchasing would likely increase the mont hly cable bill for those households that subscribe to nine or more cable networks currently the average household watches approximately 17 channels and therefore could expect its monthly bill to increase between 14 and 30 the fcc based its conclusion on study submitted by the national cable and telecomm unications association the fcc also concluded that the current practice by large cable progra mmers who also own broadcast stations of tying retransmission consent for their broadcast signals to carriage of their less attractive cable networks may harm cons umers but that this practice should be reviewed by the antitrust authorities rather than the fcc in the satellite home viewer extension and reauthorizati on act pl 108447 however congress instructed the fcc to prepare study regarding the impact of the current retransmission consent rules on competition in the multichannel television market including the ability of rural cable operators to compete with satellite television in the provision of digital television signals to

providers and cable operators distribute the same program networks which are generically referred to as cable networ ks in most situations the market analysis and public policy issues surrounding consumer options for cable networks are the same whether the multichannel distributor is cable system or satellite system for simplicity of exposition when this report refers to cable it also implicitly includes satellite in those situations where analysis differs for cable nd satellite the report explicitly identifies those differences 10 see for example the testimony of gene kimmelman on behalf of consumers union and consumer federation of america before th senate committee on commerce science and transportation kimmelman testimony march 25 2004 at pp 34 11 see for example the

package only consumers are forced to purch ase networks they are not interested in receiving in order to obtain the networks they want as shown in table 1 even those subscribers who receive more than 120 cable networks view on average fewer than 20 networks in week some subscriber s however may watch larger number of networks over longer period of time either as result of casually surfing across networks or because some networks they watch on occasion did not happen to have programming of interest to them in that particular week and may value access to those additional networks consumer dvocates claim consumers would be better off if they had the option to purchase just the individual cable networks they want carte purchasing or at the least to purchase smaller tiers that include fewer of the cable networks they do not want10 the large program providers who provi most of the popular television programming respond that single large ex panded basic service tier represents the most efficient way to offer programming and that allowing customers to obtain networks on an carte basis or in sma ll tiers would raise costs and hence prices to consumers and also reduce the diversity of programs offered so that consumer welfare would suffer in the long run11 they claim single large tier reduces the risks associated with introducing new cable ne tworks and helps s upport niche networks the economics underlying the cable progra mmers business model and its reliance on single large expanded basic service tier is discussed in detail in the next two sections some cable system operato rs have taken middle road position arguing that in most but not all cases requiring consum ers to take single large expanded basic service tier is more efficient than gi ving consumers

espn generates significantly more advertis ing revenues for cable operators than do most other cable networks however which partially compensates for the higher cost espn claims that local ad sales revenue offsets significant portion of the wholesale cost as continuedcable operators have recently agreed to pr ovide all customers upon request and at additional charge the equipment needed to block objectionable programming14 but some consumer advocates claim consumers still are forced to bear inappropriate costs and inconveniences they assert that cable operators build into the price they charge for the expanded basis service tier the licensing fees for all the networks on the tier including the fees for those networks some consumers do not want to receive these consumer advocates also claim subscrib ers are inconvenienced by the need to program the equipment to block the unw anted programming some have proposed that cable operators allow customers to purchase networks on an carte basis or at the least offer smaller or different expanded basic service package that excludes the objectionable networks15 in the debate on cable prices and media ownership concentration cable operators have argued that one of the major contributors to rising cable prices is the sharp increase in license fees that programme rs charge cable operators especially for sports networks16 the general accounting office gao found that the average license fees cable operators paid to purchase programming increased by 34 between 1999 and 2002 an average of 26 for 72 non sports networks and 59 for seven national sports networks17 james robbins chief executiv of cox cable reportedly stated at goldman sachs investors c onference in october 2003 that espn sought 20 annual increase in its fees from cox while fox sports proposed 35 increase for 200418 he stated that cox pays espn 261 month for each subscriber more than it pays for the ven toprated advertis ingsupported networks combined and that espn accounted for 4 of cox customers viewing but 18 of coxs programming costs19 these major sports prog rammers contractually requirehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32398crs6 19 continued result the

transportation for its hearing on may 6 2003 20 this contractual requirement was upheld recently by an arbitration panel in specific dispute involving cablevision and the yes network which is owned by the new york yankees and offers yankee and new jersey nets games that dispute has been perhaps the most visible contractual dispute between cable operator and sports programmer about the rights of the cable operator to place s ports network on separate premium tier instead of including it in the expanded basic service tier in 2002 cablevision had refused to carry yes claiming that the monthl subscription fee of 2 per mont h per subscriber was too high and that its 29 million new york and new jersey area customers should be allowed to choose if they wanted the network by providing the network as separate premium tier yankees games were blacked out and approxi mately 45000 cablevision subscribers turned to directv which continued to carry the yes network as part of its expanded basic service offering in 2003 just before the opening of the baseball season in negotiations that included the mayor of new york city and the governor of new jersey yes and cablevision agreed to temporary solution by which cablevision would offer yes for year as premium channel charging cu stomers 195 per month for yes or 495 month for premium package that also included msg network and fox sports net new york which between them televise the games of five professional sports teams the mets knicks rangers islanders and devils yes also allowed time warner cable to offer the yes network as premium channel cablevision and time warner reduced their rates for expanded basic service by between 050 and 100 when the yes channel was put on separate tier cablevision and yes agreed to submit to binding arbitration to determine whether cablevision could continue to offer ye s to its subscribers as separate premium tier outside the extended basic service tier about 15 million cablevision customers chose to subscribe to yes thus yes lost almost half the license fee revenues it had been receiving from cablevision for its cable s ubscribers on march 24 2004 the threeman arbitration panel voted unanimously that the ga mes should be shifted to the widest possible audience expanded basic cable service for six years although the exact terms of the arbitration decision were kept confidential vari ous news sources reported that the arbitrators set the per subscriber license fee at 183 pe r month lower than the 228 sought by yes but it appears that cablevision had to pay the license fee retroactive to the start of the 2003 baseball season which would have allowed yes to recoup the previously lost license fee revenues see news in the yes network cablevision battle at

separate premium tier but does not currently seek to offer such tier cox communications president james robbi ns stated in his may 6 2003 testimony before the senate commerce committee tiering presents an intriguing soluti on to restore an acceptable price value proposition for the most expensive networks perhaps those that charge cox wholesale prices of more than 1 per subscriber if operators had the flexibility to sell these networks sports channels or others on separate tier consumers would gain an opportunity to manage their cable expenditures by choosing whether or not to buy certain progra mming likewise programmers would be motivated to keep their prices reasonabl to remain on expanded basic cable line ups22 in response to question from senato r mccain in the march 25 2004 senate commerce committee hearing however mr robbins stated that he had ccessfully completed negotiations with espn for license fee increase that was significantly less than 20 and as result he longer wants to offer espn to customers as part of separate pr emium sports tier in the debate on cable prices and dia ownership concentration small cable operators sought congressional action to ensure that the programming conglomerates cannot force consumers and cable businesses to take bundled services or require that these services be carried on the lowest levels of service cong ress should amend telecommunications laws to provide that programming provider can require that its services be carried only on the basic or expanded basic level of service rather to give consumers choice and to allow the market to determine what gets on tv programmers should be required to make their services available as part of separate programming tier or even carte23 the small cable operators also proposed that congress amend the retransmission consent laws to prohibit broadcasters th at also own cable networks from requiring cable operators to carry those cable netw orks on their systems in order to obtain retransmission consent for their broadcast signals24httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32398crs8 25 see gao report at p 34 26 letter dated may 18 2004 from reps barton di ngell upton markey and

business model depends crucially on maintaining the large expanded basic service tier and that allowing or requiring cable operators to ffer cable networks carte or on small tiers would threaten the

subcommittee chairman fred upton telecommunications subcommittee ranking member edward markey and representative nathan deal sent detailed letter to federal communications commission fcc chairman michael powell asking the fcc to perform study within six months that provides informati on needed to make an informed decision on the potential merits nd drawbacks of proposals to allow cable and satellite operators to offer programming to their subscribers on an carte or themedtier basis they asked the fcc to determine the extent to which cable and satellite operators currently have the option of pur chasing individual cable networks and of offering them to subscribers on an carte basis to study the likely impact of carte and themedtier offerings on retail rates to investigate the likely impact of carte and themedtier offerings on advertising revenues to investigate the impact of the current retransmission consent process on consumers ability to select their own programming to investigate the likely impact of carte or themedtier offerings on the diversity of programming to study the unique characteristics of rural and smaller markets to estimate how many households would ve

co mmittee chairman john mccain sent letter to fcc chairman michael powell urging the fcc to use any existing authority you have to promote or to create incentives to promote an carte pricing option in conjunction with whatever tiers cable and satellite companies already offer27 responding explic itly to these letters on may 25 2004 the fcc initiated docket seeking comment on factual questions

services to the public fcc report29 the report summarizes the comments and analysis submitted by interested parties in the proceeding and incorporates statements made by expert witnesses at an carte symposium sponsored by the fccs media bureau the fcc did not undertake an empirical study of its own but did perfo rm analysis using an economic model prepared by booz allen hamilton that was filed as an attachment to the comments of the national cable telecomm unications association ncta30 the fcc focused on the impact of implementing mandatory carte purchasing requirement rather than on the impact of gi ving subscribers the option of purchasing programming either in tiers or on an carte basis the major conclusions of the fcc report at pp 67 are carte regulation will likely increase operational expenses for multichannel video program distributors mvpds in three main areas 1 equipment and infrastructure 2 customer service operations and 3 billing and back office support unless constrained by regulation many of these increased costs would likely be passed on to subscribers resulting in higher subscriber fees under an carte mandate networks formerly sold in tiers would need to significantly increase th eir marketing expenses to induce consumers to affirmativ ely select the network any type of carte requirement would have significant negative effect on program networks adve rtising revenues and license fee structure this may cause many program networks to fail thus adversely affecting diversity the most likely to feel the brunt of such mandate would be networks serving small niche interests such as religious programming programming aimed at minority interests arts programming and independently owned networks the impact on program networks seems likely under either mandatory or voluntar carte regime under mandatory carte pur chasing requirement only those households that would purchase fewer than 9 program networks might see reduction in their monthly cable bill households that purchase at least 9 networks would likely face an increase in their monthly bills the average cable household watche s approximately 17 channels including broadcast st ations if the average household purchased each of these channels unde r an carte regime it would likely face an increase in its mont hly bill under carte purchasing of between 14 and 30httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32398crs10 31 in sec 208 of the satellite home viewer extension and reauthorization act shvera passed as title ix of the fy 2005 consolidated appropriations act hr 4818 pl

ex clusivity and sports blackout rules on competition in the multichannel television ma rket including the ability of rural cable operators to compete with satellite television pr oviders in the

cable and satellite operators sometimes tie access to their popular broadcasting programming to the purchase and carriage of less attractive or less desired cable network which may be anticompetitive and harm consumers but the antitrust authorities not the fcc are best positioned to remedy this situation31 the fcc report does not explain how it modified the booz allen study to reach its own empirical conclusions the current cable programmer business model the current cable programmer business model is designed to maximize short term and long term industry pr ofits to the fullest extent possible it takes advantage of economies of scale and scope as well as some elements of market power and some market distortions in so doing it is in many ways very efficient but according to critics does not fully serve consumer welfare this business model has not developed independently of the market structure the industry is characterized by small number of large programmers that provide the bulk of popular cable and broadcast networks32 and that are starting to integrate forward into distribution33 as well as small number of cable and satellite providers that serve the vast majority of cablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32398crs11 34 according to data provided by ncta on its website at httpwwwnctacomdocspagecontentcfmpageid86 statistics and resources and at

served by the two major dbs providers directv and echostar 35 during the question and answer porti on of the march 25 2004 senate commerce committee hearing cox communications presiden t james robbins stated that once digital cable has been fully deployed the cable business plan will become video on demand model with most programming provided on an carte basis but he stated that was future business model that could not be implemented until the industry undertook an additional 30 billion in needed capital investment 36 cable programmers also increasingly receive revenues from product placement the visible placement of branded product in the programming itself product placement is especially prevalent on advertiserfree premium programming because it represents way for companies to show their product without the clutter ssociated with backtoback commercials on advertisersupported channels cable systems though not programmers also enjoy rapidly growing revenues from nonprogramming services such as highspeed internet access and telephone services according to ncta the number of cable modem customers increased from 19 million in the firs t quarter of 2000 to 173 million in the first

television subscribers34 although independent programmers and cable systems interests often co incide with those of the large programmers and system operators the industry business model pres ented by corporate executives and wall street analysts at congressional hearings is the one developed by and tailored to the interests of the large progra mmers and to lesser extent large distributors for example employing single large tier that allows efficient crosspromotion of cable networks on affiliated networks is most fficient for large programmers with multiple cable networks most relevant for the public policy issue of consumer options for selecting cable networks the current cable programmer busin ess model is based on the vast majority of subscribers purchasing the large expanded basic service tier of advertising supported cable networks in addition to the basic serv ice tier and smaller group of subscribers purchasing additional programming on premium tiers andor on payperviewbasis35 the business model employs the following strategies by carefully assigning cable networ ks to basic or premier tiers and using two primary programming revenue sources direct payments for programming in the form of per subscriber license fees and per use charges assessed on cable syst em operators and advertising fees36 programmers simultaneously benefit from the willingness to pay of those viewers with general demand for cable programminghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32398crs12 37 kagan world media cable program invest or april 19 2004 at p 1 net advertising revenues in 2003 were 105 billion cable programmers also received 08 billion in other revenues 38 if networks were offered on an carte ba sis or in small tiers cable operators would need to scramble all of the networks they tr ansmit to ensure that subscribers were unable to view those networks they were not paying to receive those subscribers choosing carte or small tier options would need premises quipment capable of unscrambling the scrambled signals they were paying to receive see gao report at pp 3233 39 gao report at pp 3233 40 to estimate this total number of disparate households must be added together according to kagan world medias state of hdtv 2003 in 2003 there were 17 million households with advanced analog cable sett op boxes the same source estimated that the cumulative number of digital cable settop boxes in 2003 was 375 million but with an estimated 142 boxes per household the total number of households with digital boxes was 264 million in additi on the ncta website reports at httpwwwnctacomdocspage contentcfmpageid86 viewed on 11192004 there were 249 million subscribers to noncable multichannel video program distributors in december 2003 the vast majority of these get digital satellite service with the capability for ordering and billing for individual networks or small tiers in addition to these approximately 53 million households there are an unidentified number of households that have purchased digital television sets with that capability though many of those households also have nondigital television sets that c ould not receive and be billed for individual networks or small tiersthose viewers with high intensity of demand for specific programs those advertisers that seek large audiences and those advertisers that seek targeted audiences in 2003 programmers received 123 billion in gross advertising revenues and 121 billion in license fees from cable and satellite companies an almost 5050 split37 the revenue stream from subscribers insulates programmers somewhat from business cycle effects that reduce advertising revenue s during recessions by providing all but premier programming on single large tier the cable operators minimize their investments in scrambling and unscrambling equipment38 and many consumer s avoid investments in or leasing of unscrambling equipment digital television sets with builtin unscrambling capab ility or addressable settop converter boxes that would be need ed for subscribers to make carte channel selections or to choose among number of small tiers and for cable operators to charge for these39 although data are only fragmentary it appears that somewhere in the vicinity of half of us television households currently have the customer premises equipment needed to unscramble and be billed for individual networks or small tiers40 according to the gao report the average leasing charge is approximately 439 per box per m onth since each television set requires separate box

television sets 42 gao report at p 33 43 the cable advertising market has several anom alies the disparity between the price per thousand viewers that advertisers pay broadcast television and the price per t housand viewers they pay cable has widened over time as result even though advertiser supported cable now commands total audience that exceeds that of broadcast television cable advertising revenues continue to sign ificantly lag broadcast advertising revenues also cable advertisers apparently continue to value the potential cable audience size as well as the actual audience sizehousehold might have to pay 878 in leasing charges each month41 this market effect from single tier that does not require customer premises equipment with unscrambling capability will become less important as digital pe netration increases since digital technology provides the ability to select and bill for individual channels or multiple tiers42 by requiring cable and satellite operators to offer all but premier programming on single large tier cable programmers in effect create composite product b asic cable programming that subscribers must take or leave since today consumer demand for cable programming as whole appears to be relatively price inelastic insensitive to price increases programmers can increase the per subscriber fee for their mo st highly demande d cable networks and cable systems can pass through these increases in tier rate increases it appears that demand for basic cable programming as single package is less pricesensitive than demand for individual networks and therefore price increases can be more readily sustained with single expanded basic service package than with carte offerings or small tiers with most advertisersupported cable networks on single large tier subscribers have the widest possibl choice of cable networks to surf among and casual viewing is max imized at any particular time viewers who have purchased networks carte or in small tiers may not have any programming they choose to view on the channels they have paid for and therefore may turn off the television altogether but if they had access to the full panoply of the basic enhanced service package they might find programming to watch when surfing all channels the larger the audience the more attractive cable programming is to advertisers and thus the greater the advertising revenues to cable programmers in competitive market this would be expected to lead to lower charge to subscribers43 with most advertisersupported cable networks on single tier it is less risky to introduce new adve rtisersupported cable network byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32398crs14 44 the efficiencies from marketing new cable networks on existing networks have provided strong incentive for industry consolidation both horizontally as programmers seek to exploit scale economies by offering multiple ca ble networks and vertically as distributors integrate backward into partial ownership of programming that they can crosspromote on their other channels 45 network proliferation represents type of brand proliferation which has been the subject of intense analysis in the economics literature beginning with seminal article by richard schmalensee entry deterrence in the readytoeat cereal industry bell journal of economics 9 autumn pp 305327 the general argume nt is that by proliferating slightly differentiated products dominant firms can crowd product space in fashion that raises rivals costs reduces their expected revenues and deters entry 46 the cable industry has argued that cable rates properly measured have not actually increased for consumers the industry claims that the number of networks that subscribers receive when they subscribe to expanded basic service has increased at about the same rate as the price for expanded basic service and as result the price per network has remained relatively constant and actually has fallen in terms of price per minute of viewing time see for example jeffrey eisenach and douglas truehart rising cable tv rates are programming costs the villain october 23 2003 study supported by espn inc conversely to the extent the market is operating efficiently so that the most highly demanded programming will tend to be offered first and additional lesser valued channels continuedbeing part of large package new cable network does not sink or swim based on its immediate audien ce reception rather the system operator can allow the new cable network to acquire an audience through combination of crossmarketing promoting the new network on existing networks and subscriber channelsurfing by contrast under carte viewers must make the upfront decision to pay for new cable network perhaps without having had the opportunity to see any of its pr ogramming in advance similarly with large tier large cable programmers can efficiently market new networks by advertising the new networks on their existing networks44 this marketing strategy is less effective if as in an carte environment many of the viewers receiving the marketing messages on the existing networks are not subscribed to the new network and therefore cannot eas ily check out that network in response to the marketing message placing most advertisersupported cab networks on single large tier facilitates the competitive strategy of large programmers to proliferate new networks which may act as an impediment to entry by independent networks45 the larger the tier the more efficient it is for large programmers to cro sspromote their networks and to exploit brand identification fox espn discovery mtv etc large programmers can take advantage of the market power they enjoy from owning popular networks see the discussion in the next section to pressure cable and satellite system operators to carry their new networks distributors may be faced with the choice of replacing independent networks with these new networks or expanding their system capacity to be able to carry more networks46httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32398crs15 46 continued of programming will tend to be offered only as additional capacity is made available the marginal utility or value to consumers of an additional channel will tend to fall as additional channels are made available thus constant price per channel does not demonstrate that the market is serving cust omers well moreover some subscribers have claimed that additional channels just make it more difficult for them to find the channels they prefer for them additional channels have negative utility or value 47 for example 42 major league baseball players reportedly have 2004 salaries that exceed 10 million see major league baseball 2004 salaries usa today april 9 2004 at p 10c team owners are able to offer such large salaries desp ite the leagues salary cap and attendant penalties for exceeding the cap in large part because of the very high payments they receive from broadcast and cable programmers for the rights to televise their games it is likely that such players would continue to play baseball and perform at an equally high level if their salaries were lower these pl ayers are competitors who seek to star in their sport and are unlikely to have alternative job prospects that would compensate them at comparable levelcable and satellite operators may have some incentive to resist making the additional investment needed to do the latter but that incentive is muted by the fact that customer demand for enhanced basic service is relatively inelastic and cable and satellite operators therefore can raise rates to recover the additional costs this programmer strategy also may create incentives for independent networks to sell cable and satellite operators an equity interest in their networks in order to mainta in their distribution channels market imperfections the multichannel television market can never resemble the perfect competition model beloved by economists although subs cription television clearly is valued by consumers and has substantially increased consumer choice the market exhibits elements of market power and some market distortions that if exploited can harm consumers in the current market stru cture there are few market incentives to constrain costs and hence prices popular programming will always engender market power because it is highly demanded and by defi nition has perfect substitute talent athletes actor s directors writers program producers can command high salaries precisely because consumers want to see the programming that only these talents can produce while talent should be rewarded consumers do not benefit when talent and the team owners programmers and dist ributors that package the talent for consumers is rewarded more th an is necessary for it to continue to generate popular programming47 the large programming companies and program distributors have the incentive to share in the rewards to talent and may not have the incentive to contain thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32398crs16 48 one way for programmers and distributors to share in the rewards is to own and control more of the programming which may partially explain the pattern toward greater vertical integration backward into program produc tion as discussed in crs report rl32026 market dynamics and public policy issu in the video programming industry in order to have the market leverage needed to attain cable and satellite carriage independent content providers increasingly must give substantial quity interest in their cable networks either to megaprogrammer such as viacom disc overy networks fox or disney or to major cable distributor such as comcast or time warner this has allowed the programmers and distributors to integrate back ward at the same time in some instances the owners of the talent such as professional athletic teams are increasingly vertically integrating forward into the creation of sports networks to allow them to hold on to as much of the rewards as possible for example the new york yankees have created the yes network and the national football league has cr eated its own network but as discussed in crs report rl32026 vertical integration also allows programmers to exploit economies of scope and reduce risk and these fficiencies can benefit subscribers 49 the cable television consumer protec tion and competition act of 1992 pl 102385 established new standards for television broadc ast station signal carriage on cable systems under these rules each local commercial tele vision broadcast station was given the option of selecting mandatory carriage mustcarry or retransmission request maycarry for each cable system serving the same market as the commercial television station under mustcarry the cable system must carry the broadcasters signal but the cable system does not have to pay for the programming u nder retransmission consent the cable system is not permitted to carry the broadcasters signal without the stations consent and at rate of compensation typically in the form of m oney advertising time or additional channel access determined by private negotiations 50 the large cable programmers claim that they make their broadcast signals available on stand alone basis but cable operators respond th at the prices the programmers set for those stand alone signals are uneconomic relative to the prices for carrying package of broadcast and cable network signalssize of those rewards if they are able to share in them48 s discussed below the current business model fosters their ability not just to share in but also to leve rage these rewards and thus is not likely to constrain rates to consumers the large cable programmers especially those that own broadcast network television stations are ab to exercise market power as demonstrated by their ability to require cable and satellite operators to purchase and carry their less hi ghly demanded netw orks in order to purchase and carry their popular networks and by setting the terms on which the distributors may make the networks available to consumers sometimes the primary source of the market power is not ownership of popular cable programming but rather the programming on the broadcast stations owned by these large programmers cable and satellite operators must obtain retransmission consent to carry these broadcast programs49 that consent often is provided only if the cable and satellite operators also carry all or most of the programmers cable networks50 the gao found that cable networks owned by broadcaster were 46 more likely to be carried by cable opera tors than networks not owned byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32398crs17 51 gao report at p 30 52 gao report at pp 911 53 ibid at pp 911 cable television is somewhat insulated from price competition from satellite television in part because cable opera tors are able to offer packages of cable telephone and highspeed internet access services that satellite operators cannot offer for discussion of the competitive impact of bundling services see crs report rl32232 bundling residential telephone internet and video services issues for congress broadcaster or cable operator51 this can limit consumer access to independent programming and result in consumers paying for less preferred programming the gao report found that cable ope rators face priceconstraining competition only in the 2 of markets where there are wireline overbuilders that offer consumers wireline alternative to cable52 although most households have access to satel lite service to date satellite competition has proven insufficient to constrain prices53 the lack of competition among distributors reduces their incentiveto resist programming price increases because the distributors are not heavily penalized when they pass through those increases to subscribers and perh aps advertisers in most markets consumers directly demonstrate how much they value product or service through their willingness to pay for it withdrawing from the market as prices increase beyond their willingness to pay cable programmers two primary revenue sources at best indirectly asure how consumers value the programming advertising revenues measure advertisers valuations of the audience not subscribers valuations of the programming intensity of consumer demand is at best indirectly measured per subscriber license fees more clos ely measure consumer valuations but still only indirectly cable and satellite operators pay fees for each subscriber whether or not the subscriber watches the network although the fee is assessed on per subscriber basis the level of the fee negotiated for each network will indirectly reflect the number of subscribers who actually view the network and the intensity of demand intensely demanded networks should command higher license fees from distributors since subscribers with high demand intensity might switch to competing distributor if the network were longer carried at the retail level consumers are allowed to exercise their willingness to pay for cable programming as whole in the form of single large expa nded basic service tier but not their willingness to pay for individual networks or small tiers the advertising market does not appear to value audience efficiently the gap between the cost per thousand viewers cpm for prime time advertising on broadcast television and advertising on general cable networks has grown to 61 in 20032004 2447 forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32398crs18 54 john m higgins the great divide why is the cpm gap widening if cable keeps grabbing viewers from broadcast broadcasting cable march 29 2004 at p 1 55

vi ewed on 12152004 during the 2002 2003 broadcast season 9230291203 cable captured 513 of total television viewing and 497 of primetime television viewing on season basis 56 unfortunately that threshold level is not readily identifiablebroadcast vs 963 for cable54 one might expect some differential because there will be higher tr ansaction costs associated with advertising on many different cable networks each with small audience versus advertising on fe w broadcast networks with large audiences but this differential far exceeds those costs cable eyeballs continue to be less valu ed by advertisers than broadcast eyeballs proposals to give subscribers more purchasing options for cable networks consumers are wellserved by the multi channel television industry when they receive the programming they want at r easonable prices that provide sufficient incentive for the ongoing production of responsive programming multichannel operators now have larger total viewing audience than broadcasters55 in part because of technologi cal advantages cable and satellite technologies can offer more channels can provide better signal quality and can charge consumers directly for programming which allow them to respond to consumer tastes while maintaining two primary revenue streams these technological dvantages provide the multichannel television industry with the potential for serving consumers well of course how well an individual household is served by the industry will depend in pa rt on that households tastes and needs for example its preference for niche vs popular program ming its preference for very limited number of networks vs wide variety of networks etc some aspects of the current cable prog rammer business model appear to benefit most consumers and foster certain us dia policy objectives in particular new and diverse programming may be fostered by limiting subscribers to single large expanded basic service tier if some thre shold level of the cable audience moved to carte purchasing or chose small narro wly focused tiers it could be more difficult for new cable network to build an audi ence even if it were on the expanded tier56 as explained earlier limiting all subscribers to single tier can ease rollout of new cable network by maximizing the casual viewing audience that surfs across networks and by facilitating programmers efforts to promote the new network on existing networks similarly existing cable networks that serve niche audiences might be less likely to survive if consumers could purchase networks carte or in smaller tiers which would decrease the number of expande d basic service subscribers nichehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32398crs19 57 see for example letter dated march 8 2004 from judith mchale president and chief operating

example if the per networ k carte price were 1000 per month and the price for an 60channel enhanced basic service package were 4500 then only those customers with very narrow video tastes that ar satisfied by four networks would select the carte optionnetworks that have relied on casual viewers but do not ve large enough base of viewers who would purchase on an carte basis might lose too many casual viewers to remain viable several niche cable networks have voiced concern that move to carte purchasing could harm them57 nearly 40 members of the congressional black caucus ve expressed concern that carte purchasing could result in loss of diversity in programming and that new cable networks such as tv one which serves the africanamerican community and espn deportes spanishlanguage sports ne twork might never have been launched in an carte environment58 it is not clear however how many s ubscribers would shift to carte purchasing or to smaller tiers if those options were made available substantial portion of cable and sa tellite households is accustomed to wide choice of networks and likely have number of household members with di fferent programming tastes for these households the more limited choices available under an carte or small tier option might not be attractive moreover to select the carte or small tier options subscribers would ve to have the technology in place to unscramble cable signals just as subscribers must do today to receive premium channels current recipients of premium channels and all subscribers with digital televisions have the equipment needed to unscramble the sign als but large proportion of analog subscribers would have to lease settop boxes which currently are available from cable operators at an av erage price of 439 per tele vision set per month thus reducing the potential price saving s from choosing more limited tiers in addition cable programmers might raise per subscriber license fees to make up for the lower advertising revenues generated when carte and multiple small tiers are available to the extent they raise those license fees and cable operators pass through those fee increases in their rates the sum of prices for individual programs or small tiers might be higher for many subscribers than the price for single large tier also cable operators might have the incentive to minimize the cannibalization of the expanded basic service tier by setting carte and small tier prices in way that made those options attractive only to very small portion of households with very narrow viewing tastes59 thus the threat to the cablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32398crs20 60 see for example gleason testimony at p 13 61 see for example gleason testimony at p 7 also during markup of the committee print of the satellite home viewer extension and reauthorization act of 2004 in the house subcommittee on telecommunications and the internet on april 28 2004 rep deal introduced and then withdrew an amendmen t that would have required the federal communications commission to prescribe rules to prohibit any mvpd from entering into contract with any video programming pr oducer that would preclude the mvpd from voluntarily offering carte or special tier programming to the mvpds subscribers 62 see for example kimmelman testimony at pp 34 63 see for example robbins testimony of may 6 2003 at p 2programmer business model from allowing carte or multiple tier purchasing options might not be substantial it is possible that by offering those op tions the needs of what proves to be small minority of households with very na rrow viewing tastes could be met without undermining the viability of an expanded basi c service tier that supports diverse and new networks still it appears that allowing or mandating carte or small tier purchasing options might retard the introduc tion of new cable networks and endanger niche program networks the current cable programmer busine ss model may simulta neously benefit consumers by exploiting efficiencies which could lead to lower cable rates and disadvantage consumers by fostering programmers ability to leverage their market power which could lead to higher cable rates several propos als have been made to congress that are in effect variati ons on the theme that subscribers should have greater decisionmaking power over the cable networks they receive several focus at the programmer level several at the distributor cable or satellite operator level the various proposals would prohibit programmers from requiring cable and satellite operators to carry their less popular networks in order to attain access to their popular networks and more sp ecifically prohibit programmers that own broadcast stations from tying the retransmission consent they give cable and satellite operators to carry their broadcast programming to the carriage of the programmers cable networks60 prohibit programmers from requiring cable and satellite operators to offer the programmers networks in the expanded basic service tier only61 require cable and satellite operators to offer subscribers the options of purchasing smaller program tie rs or purchasing networks carte62 require sports programmers and cable and satellite operators to offer expensive sports programming on separate tier63httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32398crs21 64 see american cable association petition for inquiry into retransmission consent practices filed with the federal communi cations commission on october 1 2002 65 ibid 66 47 usc 325b1proposal prohibit tying carriage of popular programming to carriage of less popular programming some cable operators have alleged that integrated programmers with local broadcast stations and cable networks tie retransmissi on consent for the broadcast signal to carriage of an entire suite of cable networks64 they have further alleged that these tieins sometimes extend beyond carriage on the local cable system and that these tieins may require multisystem operators to carry the suite of cable networks on all their cable sy stems andor for time periods that extend far beyond the period covered by the retransmission consent65 such tieins can result in cable system operators providing programming their customers do not prefer or passing through high programming charges to customers the proposal to prohibit programmers fro m requiring distributors to carry less popular programming in order to gain access to more popular programming would give cable and satellite opera tors greater discretion in choosing cable networks that meet their customers tastes this would tend to benef it customers in addition it would be beneficial to inde pendent cable networks and to small cable systems that have the capacity to carry onl relatively few networks some programmers that own broadcast stations claim that in some cases it was cable operators not programme rs who initially proposed that their compensation for retransmission consent take the form of carrying the programmers cable networks as well as the broadcast signal at low charge or charge rather than paying high price for the retransmission rights to the broadcast signal at the time the cable operators had available capacity on their systems but not much cash to pay for programming now the situation is reversed the cable operators have limited available capacity for additional cable networ ks and many would prefer to pay higher prices for the broadcast programming and free up scarce capacity on their systems prohibition on tieins potentially c ould have number of other market implications that could benefit but also c ould harm consumers it would strengthen the negotiating position of distributors and i ndependent networks re lative to the large programmers that own multiple cable networ ks and broadcast networks in the case of tying retransmission consent for popular broadcast programming to the carriage of less popular cable networ ks prohibition would set limits on the impact of current law which is intended to strengthen the negotiating position of broadcasters relative to cable and satellite operators the current law states cable system or other multichannel video programming distributor shall retransmit the signal of broadcasting station or any part thereof except with the express authority of the originating station66httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32398crs22 67 satellite home viewer extension and reauthorization act passed as title ix of the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act h r 4818 pl 108447 sec 208 usc numberit does not authorize the federal communications commission to regulate the terms and conditions of the retransmission c onsent agreements beyond imposing good faith negotiations standard and prohibition on providing any distributor exclusive retransmission consent under prohibition the large programmers might in the short run be able to generate just as much revenue simply by raising the prices for their popular programming rather than obtaining revenues indirectly and perhaps with lag from the new networks but several strategies at the heart of the current cable programmers business model w ould be constrained if di stributors chose not to carry the large programmers less popular networ ks the programmers efficiencies from crossmarketing and branding would be diminished in turn this could lead them to raise per subscriber license fees also th strategy of proliferating networks could be curtailed which could ma ke it easier for new independe nt networks to enter the market as explained earlier the fccs ca rte report concluded that broadcasters that also are producers of cable programming in their retransmission consent negotiations with cable nd satellite operators sometimes tie access to their popular broadcasting programming to the purchase and carriage of less attractive or less desired cable network which may be anticompetitive and harm consumers but the fcc claimed the antitrust authorities not the fcc are best positioned to remedy this situation in the satellite home view er extension and r eauthorization act however congress instructed the fcc to co mplete an inquiry and report to congress regarding the impact of the current retransmission consent rules and also the current network nonduplication syndicated exclus ivity and sports blackout rules on competition in the multichannel television market including the ability of rural cable operators to compete with satellite television providers in the provision of digital television si gnals to consumers67 proposal prohibit programmers from requiring their networks to be placed on the expanded basic service tier the proposal to prohibit programmers from requiring cable and satellite operators to offer the programmers cable networks only on the expanded basic service tier would place the decision for cable network tiering entirely in the hands of the cable and satellite operators in most situations distributors share the large programmers preference for single large expanded basic service tier and thus the impact of the prohibition on consumers might be limited but there may be situations in which programmer and distributor inte rests diverge and more generically the prohibition would create an opportunity for distributors to experiment with their cable tiers for example while cable programmers receive about half their revenues from advertising and half from per subscriber fees assessed on cable and satellitehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32398crs23 68 kagan world media

that cox fails to take into account additional local advertising revenues cox receives by carrying the espn networksoperators those operators get almost 90 of their revenues from subscribers and only little more than 10 from advertisers68 an optimal tiering strategy for programmers therefore may not be optimal for distributors moreover cable and satellite operators do not have retail layer to insulate them from consumers and therefore may be more responsive to c onsumer complaints about the placement of specific networks on tiers cable operators may choose to experiment with cable tiers and even with carte pricing if they perceive that these additional offerings might increase their profits when the per subscriber license fee for cable network does not appear to be in equilibrium with subscriber viewing patterns69 then the operator will have the incentive to either decrease payments to the programmer or increase revenues from end users or both by placing highcos t network on separate tier the operator might be able to reduce payments to the programmer by only paying for those subscribers who actually desire that network while maintaining or at least not decreasing by as much the revenues receive d from subscribers if the operator were able to take highcost cable network off its expanded basic service tier place it on separate tier and then reprice the expanded basic service tier in way that did not lower revenues from that tier by as much as it gained revenues from the new separate tier it would benefit from having the discretion to place cable networks on tiers as it saw fit as discussed earlier gao f ound that satellite opera tors do not provide sufficiently strong competitive constraints on cable operators to constrain prices and therefore the shift of control over the placement of networks on tiers from programmers to distributors might not reduce rates to consumers so much as redistribute the profits from programmers to distributors cable and satellite operators may be more willing than programmers to take particular cable networks off the expanded basic service tier and place them on premium tiers because they only indirectly benefit from the strategies of cross promotion of networks and ne twork proliferation that di rectly benefit programmers which depend heavily on single large expanded basic service tier proposal require distributors to offer networks carte and in small tiers the pros and cons of limiting consumers to single large expanded basic service tier vs giving them the option of purchasing cable networks carte or in small tiers have been discussed at length earlier in this report when cable system operators require subscribers to purchase single large expanded basic service tier without an option for the purchase of indi vidual cable networks or small tiers some purchasers will be forced to buy more programming than they want and perhaps athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32398crs24 70 the pitfalls of carte fewer choi ces less diversity higher prices national continuedan outlay that is greater than they would make if allowed to purchase individual networks thus some purchasers are wors off when forced to purchase large tiers than they would be if they coul d purchase individual channels an carte rule might constrain the large rewards that athletes performers and producers earn and that raise the costs and prices of such programming if substantial numbers of subscribers with low intensities of demand for the sports or entertainment programming chose carte or small tier options that did not include the highcost programming certain sports and entertainment programming is highly valued by small portion of cable s ubscribers however currently such programming is funded by imposing higher ra tes on all subscriber s to expanded basic service if that programming had to be supported only by subscribers with high intensity of demand ither those subscribers would ve to pay more or the talent producing that programming would ve to accept lower compensation but an carte requirement also could have disadvantages for some consumers large service tiers make it less risky for cable or satellite system to introduce new cable network with large tier the new cable network does not succeed or fail based on its immediate audien ce reception rather the system owner can allow the new cable network to ac quire an audience by having viewers accidentally tune in to the network by contrast under car viewers must make the upfront decision to pay for new cable network perhaps wit hout having had the opportunity to see any of its programming in advance similarly with packaged offering the local cable system operator can efficiently market new networks by advertising the new networks on its existing networks this marketing strategy is less efficient if as in an carte environment many of the viewers receiving the marketing messages on the existing networks are not subscribed to the new network and ther efore cannot easily check out that network in response to the marketing message also the availability of large package of networks is expected to increase overall audience size because at any partic ular time viewers who pay carte may not have any programming they choose to vi ew on the channels they have paid for and therefore might turn off the television altogether but if they had access to the basic enhanced service package they might find programming they enjoy when surfing all the channels offered in the pack age the larger the cable audience the more attractive cable is to advertisers and higher advertising revenues might allow programmers to decrease per subscriber li cense fees which in turn could result in lower rates for the expanded basic service tier in addition offering carte and sma ll tier options in addition to large expanded basic service option would accord ing to the major industry association significantly increase cable operators custom er services expenses as more customer service representatives would be needed to explain the options as well as process the more complex orders70httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32398crs25 70 continued cable telecommunications associa tion policy paper may 2003 at pp 1517 71 but some of the signal scramblingunscrambling billing and customer service costs associated with carte purchasing are fi xed and must be borne even if only small number of subscribers choose the carte option 72 see footnote 35 aboveas result of these factors it is possi ble that the sum of the individual prices for each network that typical household subs cribes to in an carte environment could be higher than the single price for the expanded basic service tier at the same time the choices available to consumers c ould be reduced both because they would only have available to them the networks they paid for and because there are likely to be fewer new networks due to the high er risk associated with network launch when many subscribers make carte network purchases the extent to which these effects of an carte requirement would actually occur would depend on the proportion of subs cribers who chose the carte option vs the enhanced basic service package if the carte option were chosen only by very small portion of subscribers with na rrow video tastes that can be met by limited number of networks it may create very weak disincentive for new network launches71 but if the carte option were widely selected the disincentive could be substantial the pros and cons of an carte or small tier option will be affected by the rate of consumer transition to digital equipment from one perspective the benefits of carte purchasing are reduced for the majority of customers who do not currently have customer premises equipmen t in the form of digital television set an advanced analog settop box or digita l settop box of the sort that comes with digital cable or satellite service they would have to lease such boxes current rates are about 439 per month per tele vision set to be able to select and be billed for individual networks or small tiers yet to the extent that the lack of customer premises equipment reduces the number of households that might forsake the expanded basic service tier for carte purchasing or small tiers the threat to the viability of the expanded basic service tier and cable programmers business model is reduced cable executives generally agree that as digital penetration of the household grows the current business m odel will evolve into video on demand model72 there is potentially an additional issue relating to small tiers even if cable and satellite operators were to offer one or more small tiers those tiers could not meet the needs of each and every household equa lly well businesses every day must determine the best way to meet the needs of their customers but if there were requirement that cable and satellite operators offer small tiers could they also be subject to regulatory as opposed to mark et challenge about the choice of networks placed on those tiers it would likely be extremely difficult for regulatory body to determine what constitutes an acceptable lin eup of networks on small tier or an acceptable suite of small tiers httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32398crs26 73 kagan world media economics of basic cable networks 2003 september 2002 table

viewing of regional cable networks assuming half the olympics viewing was on cable networks the average us household watched about 80 hours of sports programming on expanded basic cable networks in 2000 according to recent nielsen media research report entitled average daily viewing 19492003 in the broadcast year septembe r 2000august 2001 us television households spent on average 7 hours 47 minutes per day watc hing television this increased to 8 hours 12 minutes in september 2002august 2003 as discussed earlier little more than half that viewing was of cable networks on average us households watch little less than 4 hours of expanded basic television per day or bout 1 420 hours per year thus about 56 of household cable viewing is of national sports networks 80 1420 given the very high per subscriber charges for espn and fo x sports networks it certainly is likely that the proportion of programming cost s associated with those nationa l sports networks exceeds continuedproposal place hi gh cost sports networks on separate cable tier major sports networks are unique in num ber of ways first the per subscriber license fees to cable and satellite operators for major sports networks are far higher than those for almost any other networks in 2001 when the average license fee per subscriber per month was 013 for national cable networks the license fee for espn was 153 and for fox sports was 07073 by the end of 2003 the license fees for espn and fox both exceeded 200 per subscriber per month74 regional sports networks such as the yes network owne d by the new york yankees also have relatively high per subscriber license f ees gao found that license fees for sports networks have been growing at more than twice the rate of nonsports networks75 second with the exception of the super bowl world series and some olympic events only minority of television viewers regularly view sports programming and many house holds never watch such programming thus under the current system of sports programming being offered on the expanded basic service tier with per subscriber fee imposed based on total subs cribership rather than on actual viewers sports networks represent far higher portion of cable operator programming costs than they do cable operator viewers ja mes robbins chief executive of cox cable reportedly stated at gold man sachs investors conferen ce that espn accounted for 4 of cox subscribers viewing but 18 of cox programming costs76httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32398crs27 76 continued the proportion of cable and satellite viewer time

viewed on 5122004 broadcast and cable networks maintain internet sites to provide additional information to viewers with high intensity of demand for their programming to provide an additional marketing tool for their programming and to gain additional advertising revenues these internet sites are potential profit centers 80 see for example john eggert on cbs affils deal on ncaa broadcasting cable december 8 2003 at p 10third for the minority of television view ers who are sports fans their demand for sports programming is intense and they are more likely than the viewers of other programming to subscribe to premium sports channel if that were the only source of the desired sports programming for example when cablevision took the yes channel off its expanded basic service tier and made it available to subscribers in two options on its own for 195 per month or as part of new premium sports tier at 495 per month about half its subscriber s elected to receive the yes channel through one or the other of those options77 fourth although programming of major s ports is viewed by cable and satellite operators as must have programming the sports programmers report financial losses from winning the rights to these major sports for example news corp reported on february 12 2002 that it took 909 million operating charge in the second quarter because of its three major professional sports television contracts78 according to steve sternberg senior vice president and broadcast research director at tn media79 theres cachet to having sports especially major sports theyre like loss leader sports promote the networks prim etime lineups and sports are one of the things that drive people to their internet sites sports programmers pparently have made the strategic business decision to get into competitive bidding environment to attain the rights to popular sports events even with the knowledge that if they win the bi d they would be unlikely to recoup those costs directly from the sports programming shown rather sports programmers may expect to benefit indirectly by exploiting the sports events to market their other programming to the highly desirable teen age and young adult male audience both by crossmarketing their other programs and by branding their networks those programmers of course seek to recover as much of the costs as possible from program distributors through the very high per subscriber fee imposed on cable operators and for those sports programmers that own broadcast networks through attempts to get their local stations affiliates to share the cost burden80httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32398crs28 81 although an imperfect analogy automobile purchasers typically can choose between standard package of features and one or more premium packages it is unlikely that high cost feature that is sought by only half of all customers w ould be included in the standard package 82 senate committee on commerce science and transportation hearing on escalating cable rates causes nd solutions march 25 2004 83 ibidgiven these unique characteristics the consumer benefits from carte purchasing may be greater for major sports networks than for other cable networks and the consumer disadvantages may be less since the costs of major sports programming are disproportionately large re lative to the audience they attract when major sports networks are included on the expanded basic service tier those subscribers who are not sports fans are for ced to bear substantial burden if major sports programming represents almost 20 of programming costs and half the subscribers do not watch that programming then those nonfans are bearing almost 10 of total programming costs to fund programming they do not want81 placing major sports programming on separate tier woul d benefit these nonsports fans at the same time given the intensity of demand that sports fans have for major sports programming it is likely that substantial portion of sports fans would be willing to purchase that programming separately as indicated earlier half of cablevisions subscribers paid separately to receive the yes channel thus it appears unlikely that the cable programmer business model based on single large expanded basic cable tier would be threatened by placing major sports networks on premium tier in the march 25 2004 senate commerce committee hearing james robbins of cox communications stated that he opposed an requirement that cable operators be required to offer networks on an carte basis but that cox would consider offering separate sports tier82 i n t h t h r i n g m r k goldstein director of physical infrastructure issues at gao indicated that sports pr ogramming represents the best choice of programming for separate tier83
