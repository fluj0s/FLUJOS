specialist in science and technology policy resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32481homeland security research and development funding and activities in federal agencies preliminary inventory summary according to the office of management and budget omb federal agency funding for homeland security research and development rd was requested at 36 billion for fy2005 54 increase over the enacted fy2004 level and about 63 more than enacted for fy2003 and bout double the resources used in fy2002 the department of homeland securitys dhs rd programs constitute about one third of total federal homeland security rd funding other agencies which have substantial homeland security rd budgets listed in descending funding order include the national institutes of health the department of defense the department of justice the national science foundati on the department of agriculture the environmental protection agency the depa rtment of commerce the department of energy and the department of transpor tation the sum of 36 billion is large amount and arguably the fastest growin g component of the federal rd budget dhs has statutory responsib ilities mandated by the home land security act pl 107296 to coordinate federa l homeland security rd throughout the government according to dhss under secretary for science and technology homeland security rd will be coordi nated by fall 2004 coordination and subseque nt congressional oversight depend in part on the quality of information about federal homeland security rd the little information that is available does not permit identif ication of the components of homeland security rd funding nor systematic comp arisons among agencies this makes it difficult to answer questions about prior itysetting and coordination rd seems to appear most prominently in two categor ies of funding omb uses to identify types of homeland security budget accounts the two homeland security missions of defending against catastrophic threatsand of protecting critical infrastructures and key assets however the rd compone nts of these categories have not been clearly identified it is not possible to compare across agencies to determine the actual funding for homeland security rd in functional areas such as countering bioterrorism border security information s ecurity threat mitigation and so forth or for fields of science such as chemistry environmental science or psychology clearer and more consistent information about homeland security rd might assist in eliminating unnecessary duplication filling in gaps identifying future rd personnel needs and improving the capability of different types of rd performers omb has responsibility to gather homel and security rd data and federal agencies also publish information tailored to their needs section 889 of pl 107 296 requires omb to report on homeland secur ity funding and to consult at least annually with congress to identify whic h activities constitute homeland security activities for budgeting purposes there are ma ny obstacles to obtaining consistent information and several options to improve these data these are addressed in companion

land security act pl 107296 to coordinate federa l homeland security resear ch and development rd dhss under secretary fo r science and technology announced that homeland security rd will be c oordinated by fall 2004 implementation of these responsibilities depends in part on the quality of information about homeland security rd programs in dhs and in other agencies the data that are now available on homeland security rd do not appear sufficiently detailed accurate or consistent to answer questions about pr ioritysetting policy and coordination among federal agencies omb prepares several differe nt types of homeland secu rity rd data sets for different purposes agencies also produce th eir own data it is difficult task to collect comparable crossagency data and omb has made considerable progress in constructing data sets while there are some similarities in these data sets there are also major differences among them making it difficult to have confidence in the accuracy of any one data set or in compar isons over time in its reports to congress on combating terrorism omb publishes summary data on federal agencies budgets for rd for combating terrorism and give s short descriptions of some agency programs these data are current only thr ough the budget request for the fiscal year when the report is published omb descri bes homeland security rd as subset of combating terrorism rd omb s not published data on homeland security rd funding per but using an internal crosswalk budget data base it has produced an unpublished table on homeland secu rity rd also in data appended to the fy2005 budget request and available electronically omb published information on homeland security funding by agency subdivided by programs and units according to the congressional b udget office cbo ombs publication of these data are responsive to section 889 of the homeland security act of 2002 p l 107296 which directed omb to produce an annual report on homeland security funding to accompany the presidents annual budget submission65 omb is also required by that statute to consult with congress annually about ways to identify and report homeland security information rd would appear to be included in two funding categories omb uses to identify types of homeland security budg et accounts the two homeland security missions of defending against catastr ophic threatsand of protecting critical infrastructures and key asse ts however the rd components of these categories have not been clearly identified httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32481crs40 coordination of homeland security rd requires an ability to identify and compare funding and activities supported by separate federa l agencies in relation to homeland security rd needs the inventor of agency programs identified in this report suggests certain issues for which more adequate data may be needed in order to determine policy prio rities and accountability measur to coordinate homeland security rd programs such possible issues include are the funding amounts reported for homeland security rd mutually exclusive or does the rd reported as homeland security by agencies and omb also serve other civilian or defense science and technology needs th at is is some homeland security rd funding data also reported unde r other categories of rd or does some homeland security r d support dualuse purposes is there double counting of such rd are agencies programs for homeland security rd new programs or are agencies simply re labeling rd that was previously conducted and categorized for other purposes what are the governments priorities for homeland security rddivided by application or func tional area such as countering bioterrorism border security in formation security and threat mitigation what fields of science does federal agency homeland security rdsupport what is the breakdown by discipline such as by chemistry biology psychology soci sciences and so forth and by type of rd such as basic applied and development is there unnecessary duplication or on the other hand major gaps in homeland security rd who are the major performers of homeland security rd such as by type including academia federal laboratory and industrial performers in order to meet future homeland security rd needs should plans be put in place to strengthen performer or sc ientific personnel capacity for selected fields is there an opportunity or need to promote dedicated information exchange or technology transfer among researchers who receive federal homeland security rd f unding to
