program with which the agency may be affiliated and certain other outpatient services which involve the use of equipment that cannot readily be made available in the beneficiarys home home health care is covered by medicare as long as the care is medically reasonable and necessary for the treatment of illness or injury although the number of home health visits beneficiary may receive is unlimited services must be provided pursuant to plan of care that is prescribed and periodically reviewed by physician in general medicares home health benefit is intended to serve beneficiaries needing acute skilled medical care it was never envisioned as providing coverage for nonmedical supportive care or personal care assistance needed by chronically impaired persons it is not longterm care program for the disabled or the frail elderly home health utilization and spending from 1987 to 1997 the number of beneficiaries receiving home health services more than doubled and the number of visits per home care patient increased more than threefold from 23 visits in 1987 to 73 in 1997 table 1 during this time period the 2 sections 1814a2c 1814a and 1861m of the social security act 3 parttime or intermittent is defined in the statute section 1861m of the social security act as less than eight hours each day and 28 or fewer hours each week or subject to review on casebycase basis as the need

simple dressing changes that do not require the skills of licensed nurse and assistance with medications that ordinarily are selfadministered and do not require the skills of licensed nurse crs3 number of hhas participating in medicare also increased sharply growing from 5686 agencies in 1989 to 10492 in 1997 this dramatic growth resulted in similarly dramatic increases in medicare spending for home health home health spending rose from 19 billion in 1987 to about 175 billion in 1997 an average annual increase of almost 27 table 1 this growth led to the imposition of new cost limits on hhas in the balanced budget act of 1997 bba that attempted to control growth in number of visits paid by the program until prospective payment system could be implemented the interim payment system the growth also led to scrutiny by the department of health and human services hhs office of the inspector general and the general accounting office gao regarding fraudulent practices by some home health agency operators the center for medicare and medicaid services cms changed number of practices regarding home health agencies and initiated moratorium on allowing new hhas to enter the medicare

second year the number of beneficiaries served decreased about 10 year for the three years after bba passed this decrease was due to the stepped up program integrity activities directed at hhas and change in qualifying service by bba5 the average number of visits per beneficiary served also decreased dramatically falling almost 30 in the first full year after bba due to the application of new payment limits after implementation of the home health prospective payment system hhpps in october 1 2000 payments increased by 83 in 2001 and by 95 in 2002 payments fell slightly in 2003 due to the impact of the socalled 15 reduction6 the number of visits and to lesser degree the number of beneficiaries served continued to decline immediately after the implementation of pps in 2001 the average number of visits per person dropped to 28 and the number of beneficiaries served per thousand dropped to 71 however in 2002 the number of beneficiaries served increased and in both 2002 and 2003 the number of visits increased home health prospective payment system httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21814 begun october 1 2000 hhpps groups patients according to the type and intensity of services the patients require and sets payment rate for each payment group the basic unit of payment is for 60day episode of care and is adjusted for the wages of the area in which the beneficiary resides payment for the 60day episode covers skilled nursing and therapy visits aide visits and medical supplies needed by the beneficiary physician services durable medical equipment and osteoporosis drugs are not included in the hhpps the 60day episode base payment called the national standardized 60day episode rate is based on actual audited average fy1997 per visit home health costs that have been trended forward for inflation there is distinction between urban and rural base payment amounts the payment amount is then adjusted for the care needs of the beneficiaries by using hhrgs each of these represent specific amounts of nursing and therapy care care information is obtained through the initial assessment of the patients care needs using the outcome and assessment information set oasis like other ppss that pay health care providers for care to medicare beneficiaries on the basis of predetermined fixed amounts medicare payments to hhas are intended to pay the hha for its medicare beneficiary 5 bba removed venipuncture services from the list of skilled services that was used in determining beneficiary eligibility for the home health benefit because venipuncture is covered part b service beneficiaries could continue to receive that service 6 bba required that pps payments be calculated so that in the first year of pps home health spending would be the same as under the previous costreimbursement system but the cost of the old system would be calculated as though the cost limits under the interim payment system were reduced by 15 delayed until oct 1 2002 two years after the start of pps the reduction in actual payments amounted to approximately 7 because hhas are paid the lesser of their actual costs or their costs subject to the limits reduced 15 and when coupled with the update in payments that also occurred oct 1 2002 hha payments were actually reduced by approximately 49 see crs report rl31420 medicares home health benefit the fifteen percent payment cut by carolyn l merck crs5 costs on average that is although the payment is predetermined rate an agencys actual costs may be above or below that amount for an individual patient agencies have an incentive to manage costs so that on average costs do not exceed the pps average amounts hhas that provide services at lower costs than the medicare payment are able to keep the difference hhas are paid 60 of the wageand case mixadjusted payment after submitting request for anticipated payment rap the rap may be submitted at the beginning of beneficiarys care once the hha has received verbal orders from the beneficiarys physician and the assessment is completed the remaining payment is made when the beneficiarys care is completed or the 60day episode ends depending upon the circumstances additional adjustments may be made to the payment outliers outlier payments are made for extraordinarily costly episodes whose estimated costs exceed threshold amount for each hhrg five percent of total home health payments are set aside for outlier payments significant change in beneficiarys condition an hhas payments can be modified within patients 60day episode when httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21814 significant change in beneficiarys condition occurs payment will be an amount that is proportional between the hhrg prior to the change and the hhrg after the significant change in condition partial episode payment if beneficiary transfers from one hha to another during 60day episode the first hha to provide care will have its payment reduced to portion equal to the amount of time during the 60day episode in which care was provided the second hha will conduct an assessment and new 60day episode of care will begin low utilization payment adjustment the pps payment for an agency is adjusted if beneficiarys care is delivered in four or fewer visits the payment is standardized servicespecific pervisit amount multiplied by the number of visits actually provided during the episode current issues mma mma contained number of provisions affecting hhas and provided for two home health demonstration projects the mma changed the time frame for the home health update from the federal fiscal year to calendar year basis beginning with 2004 hha payments are increased by the full market basket percentage for the last quarter of 2003 october november and december and for the first quarter of 2004 january february and march the update for the remainder of calendar year 2004 and for all of calendar years 2005 and 2006 is the home health market basket percentage increase minus 08 percentage points mma also provides oneyear 5 additional payment for home health care services furnished in rural area without regard to certain budgetneutrality requirements the temporary additional payment begins for episodes and visits ending on or after april 1 2004 and before april 1 2005 and is not to be used in calculating future home health payment amounts7 7 the benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 bipa provided temporary twoyear 10 increase in payments for services furnished in rural areas that expired mar 31 2003 crs6 mma suspends the requirement that home health agencies must collect oasis data on private pay nonmedicare nonmedicaid until the secretary 1 reports to congress on the benefits of these data the value of the data compared to the administrative burden of data collection in small agencies and the use of the oasis information by both large and small agencies and then 2 publishes final regulations regarding the collection and use of oasis the provision does not prohibit home health agencies from collecting oasis data on private pay patients for the agencies own use mma requires two demonstration projects 1 beneficiaries enrolled in medicare part b with specified chronic conditions would be deemed to be homebound in order to receive home health services under medicare and 2 an hha directly or under arrangement with medical adult day care facility provides medical adult day care services to substitute for portion of home health services otherwise provided in beneficiarys home in addition mma requires the medicare payment assessment commission medpac to study payment margins of home health agencies paid under the medicare home health prospective payment system using cost reports filed by agencies and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21814 examine whether systematic differences in payment margins are related to differences in patient care needs as measured by home health resource groups among agencies payment adequacy after three years experience of hhpps analysis is ongoing to assess the adequacy of medicare payments both the gao and medpac have analyzed available data on hha costs and medicare payments recently gao studied payments to freestanding hhas for the first two years of hhpps and concluded that medicare payments more than covered aggregate costs of caring for their medicare home health patients8 gao found that aggregate medicare margins for freestanding facilities were 162 in 2001 and 178 in 2002 furthermore medpac has estimated that aggregate pps margins for all hhas were 161 in 2001 and projected margins of 168 for 2004 quality of care efforts have been underway since the late 1980s to develop and use measures of outcomes in home care in order to eventually use continuous quality improvement techniques oasis was developed for that purpose in demonstrations of these techniques outcomes were found to improve9 in november 2003 cms launched national home health quality initiative to provide hha quality data to consumers using selected measures from oasis data data on individual hhas can be obtained on wwwmedicaregov or through the 1800medicare phone line in addition to providing the data to consumers cms has offered hhas assistance in improving the quality of care they provide recent medpac study concludes that there appears to be very slight increase in the quality of care since pps began although there is little difference in the overall quality of care provided before and after pps began10 8 us general accounting office medicare home health
