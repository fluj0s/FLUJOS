dollars and constitute form of propaganda aimed at selling the policies of president george w bush critics also have complained that federal dollars are being used to influence media coverage17

communications techniques and media commonly found in the private sector such as video news releases direct mail and advertisements makes sense because th ey are effective communications tools18 in part the division between these vi ewpoints is rooted in longstanding competing notions over the nature of fede ral executive agencies should agencies be apolitical and semiautonomous or should they be politically responsive should they serve first the president congress the public or the law and should federal agencies behave cautiously taking their cu for action from fede ral law regulations

clause 7 of the us constitution requires that money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law statutory restrictions on agency communications with the public are limited to one nearly centuryold statute and prohibitions in annual appr opriations laws20 5 usc 3107 passed in 1913 prohi bits the use of appropriated funds to pay publicity expert unl ess specifically appropriated for that purpose annual appropriations laws such as the 2004 omnibus statute usually provide standard prohib ition that funds may not be used for publicity or propa ganda purposes within the united states not heretofor authorized by congress21 these restrictions have appeared in appropriations laws for over halfcentury and are little commented on by congress in the accompanying reports22 it would appear that agency freedom to expend appropriated funds for public relations and propaganda is quite limited however this is not the case for the following two reasons

spending on communications may be cause for concern member then sends written request to the government accountability office asking for legal opinion on the activities in question 2 the terms publicity propaganda and publicity expert have been interpreted to forbid very limited number of activities congress has not defined the terms publicity propa ganda and publicity expert thus to gao has gone the task of delineating what these term s encompass gao has done this on case bycase basis over the past halfcentury24 generally speaking gao has narrowly defined these terms it has held that the publicity or propaganda prohibition in appropriations laws forbids any public relations activity that involves selfaggrandizement or puffery of the agency its personnel or activities is purely partisan in nature ie it is designed to aid political party or candidate or is covert propaganda ie the communication does not reveal that government appropriations we re expended to produce it25 gao has interpreted publicity expert to mean someone who extols or advertises an agency an activity quite different from disseminating information to the citizenry about the agency its policie s practices and products26 thus construed the laws prohibiting th hiring of publicity experts and the expenditure of appropriate d funds on publicity and pr opaganda place very few limits on agency public

course this measure of public relations activities captures only those activities that were contracted out not those done inhouse41 agencies budgets do not line item list public relations expenditures

activities we re part of this single m odest public relations effort which ones should be counted who is to do the counting and how are these activities to be tracked defining propaganda beyond

propaganda as the systematic propagation of information or ideas by an interested party especially in tendentious way in order to encourage or instil particular attitude or response42 this definition is quite broad and not especially helpful in the present context since it captures any coordinated ac tivity aimed at persua ding others of the wisdom and veracity of ones ideas and positions something that is part and parcel of politics and governance43 some might suggest that agencies s hould be permitted to convey only factual information this instruction though w ould not solve the problem for example one can mislead another by communicating just facts but not all the facts an agency spokesperson might announce that thanks to his agencys tireless efforts public policy problem x has been eradicated on hearing this the listener might think highly of the agency and believe it to be effective however his opinion might be less sanguine if he were informed that in the pursuit of eradicating this one public policy problem the agency had grossl exceeded its budget and neglected its statutorily required duty to attend to dozen other public policy problems44 furthermore even the conveyance of pur facts can have persuasive effects on an audience depending on how the facts ar presented for example government official might state 5000 persons are killed by lightning each year on hearing this listener might become wary of ve nturing outside on cloudy days if on the other hand the same government official said on average you have only onetwo hundredth of onepercent chance of being k illed by lightning this year the same listener might feel the risk is so small as not to be worth changing his behavior however assuming population of 100 million both of these statements are true the facts are the same the inference drawn is quite different45httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32750crs14 45 continued paradox the art of political decisionmaking new york w w norton 2001 46 steven g

in its own opinion on the controversial dicare vnrs doj found the vnrs did not advocate particular policy or position of hhs and cms but rather provided accurate continuedenforcement and the separation of powers the enforcement of restric tions against agency use of funds to employ publicity agents or to produce propaganda faces hurdles rooted in the separate branches of government established by the us constitu tion in great part the legislative branch makes the law but the executive branch administers and enforces it in this instance the power to enforce the statutory restriction against the employment of publicity experts rests with the department of justice doj an executive agency if doj does not find fault with an executive agencys actions congress has limited tools available to change the behavior of doj or the agency in question see below for further discussion but what of the enforcement of pub licity and propaganda restrictions in appropriations laws in march 2005 the department of justice and office of management and budget omb issued memoranda that stated that executive branch agencies need not heed gaos inte rpretations of ppropriations law46 the doj and omb memoranda were issued in res ponse to gao memorandum circulated to executive branch departments and agencies providing guidance on the use of video news releases for publicity purposes47 the omb memorandum agrees that executive agencies must comply with applicable laws however it states it is the olc office of legislative counsel not the gao th at provides the controlling interpretations of the law for the executive branch48 those in the executive branch with questions about the interpretation of ppropriations laws are direct ed to contact the general counsel of their respective departments or agencies the doj memorandum takes the same pos ition because gao is part of the legislative branch executive branch agencies are not bound by gaos legal advice the doj memorandum also c ontests gaos interpretation of what constitutes propaganda doj argues agai nst gao that it is not enough for an executive branch communication to be covert as to the source it also must contain advocacy of particular viewpoint doj states that government communications that are purely informational even if they do not inform the audience that they are governmentproduced are not propa ganda and hence are legitimate49 dojhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32750crs15 49 continued even if not comprehensive information about the benefits provided under the new medicare program steven g

informational video news releases which is identical to the title of the march 11 2005 memorandum however the memorandum of july 30 2004 as found on the doj website at httpwwwusdojgovolcopfinalhtm carries the title expenditure of appropriated funds fo r informational video news releases 50 bradbury re whether appropriations may be used for informational video news releases mar 11 2005 pp 12 51 these clarifications of the law might also be included in appropriations reports on the tools of oversight see louis fisher the politics of shared power congress and the executive college station texas am university press 1998 pp 68105 then states that agencies are responsible for reviewing their vnrs to ensure that they do not cross the line between legitimate governmental information and improper governmentfunded advocacy50 thus the enforcement of restrictions on executive agency spending on publicity experts and propaganda encounters sepa ration of powers impediment congress however does possess tools to compel chan ges in agency behavior congress may threaten to reduce or reduce an agen cys appropriation or powers in order to encourage an agency to follow congressional interpretation of the law alternatively congress may pass new gislation that more sharply delineates its definition of legal and illegal activities an effort as noted above not without its own challenges which then would increase the probability that executive agencies and doj especially would agree with c ongresss interpretation of the law51
