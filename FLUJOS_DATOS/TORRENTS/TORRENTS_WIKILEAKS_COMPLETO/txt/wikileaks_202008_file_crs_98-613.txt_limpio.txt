legislative process government and finance division distinctions among amendments the amending process is central to the consideration of legislation by the house of representatives and the rules practices and precedents that underlie this process frequently depend on distinguishing among amendments based on their type and form simply put not all amendments are equal in procedural sense and the form or type of amendment frequently determines what further amendments may be offered and therefore what alternatives the house may choose among for more information on legislative process see httpwwwcrsgovproductsguidesguidehomeshtml degrees of amendments fundamental aspect of the amending process in the house is that it is limited to two degrees amendments may be offered to the measure under consideration first degree and to amendments to the measure seconddegree seconddegree amendment may only be offered while the firstdegree amendment to which it is offered is pending and the house must vote on any seconddegree amendments before it votes on pending firstdegree amendment as it may have been amended that is any second degree amendment that is agreed to is incorporated into firstdegree amendment before that firstdegree amendment is voted on house rule xvi clause 6 provides that it also shall be in order to offer further amendment by way of substitute such substitute is treated as firstdegree amendment presumably because it is offered in the form of an alternative to the original firstdegree amendment rather than an amendment to it like the original firstdegree amendment this one also is subject to seconddegree amendments rule xvi also provides that seconddegree amendments to the original firstdegree amendment must be voted on before pending seconddegree amendments to the firstdegree substitute first degree substitute as it may have been amended must be voted on prior to vote on the original firstdegree amendment as it may have been amended only one seconddegree amendment may be pending at time to any firstdegree amendment additional seconddegree amendments however may be offered subsequently if other conditions permit crs2 the degree of an amendment will have an impact on the application of the germaneness requirement imposed by rule xvi clause 7 since the definition of germaneness is dependent on the specific propositions involved firstdegree amendments must be germane to the measure while seconddegree amendments must be germane to the firstdegree amendment to which they are offered forms of amendments amendments may also be distinguished by whether they are posed in the form of 1 motion to strike out some existing text from measure or from firstdegree amendment 2 motion solely to insert some new text into measure or into first degree amendment or 3 motion both to strike out some existing text and insert something new in either measure or firstdegree amendment scope of amendments third way to distinguish among amendments is by their scope the procedural scope of an amendment is defined in relation to the text the amendment would effect and not indicative of any substantive policy changes that would result from the proposed amendment an amendment is substitute if it would replace all of pending text generally perfecting amendment is one that inserts text or replaces less than complete text although they are rarely referred to as such firstdegree amendments that are drafted to amend some portion of measure but less than the entire measure are perfecting amendments likewise seconddegree amendments that are drafted to amend some portion of firstdegree amendment are perfecting amendments as provided by rule xvi clause 6 substitute for firstdegree amendment is in order and will likewise be treated as firstdegree amendment the substitute as it may have been amended will be voted on prior to vote on the original firstdegree amendment as it may have been amended special case arises when substitute is offered in the form of motion to strike out everything in measure after the enacting clause or the resolving clause in the case of resolution and insert different text this is known as an amendment in the nature of substitute and is rarely offered without protection under special rule reported by the rules committee because committees frequently report their recommendations to the house in this form members typically focus their consideration on the substitute and special rules typically provide that the substitute be treated as an original bill for the purpose of amendment this language means that the amendment in the nature of substitute will not be treated as firstdegree amendment instead two degrees of amendment will be allowed as though the amendment in the nature of substitute were the text of the measure for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98613
