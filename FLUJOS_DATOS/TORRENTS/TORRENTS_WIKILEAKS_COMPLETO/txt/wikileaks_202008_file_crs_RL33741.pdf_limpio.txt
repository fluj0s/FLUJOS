the pentagon the navy ultimately plans to procure 55 lcs sea frames i think you would want to have t he acquisition strategy in place to buy 25 and 25 or 20 and 30 it keeps the pressure on people to

we could have xed fleet winter said in an aug 7 interview in his pentagon office we wa nt to see what both these ships can do and there are pros and cons that people have talked about for long time

million in the fy2005 budget to 531 million in the fy 2009 budget the estimate for lcs2 has gr own fro m 2137 million in the fy2005 budget to 507 million in the fy2009 budget the figures of 531 million and 507 million in the previous paragraph are end cost figures end cost is the figure ofte n reported as the total procurement cost of navy ship it is fairly comprehensive figure for ships procurement cost but it does exclude certain cost elements th fy2009 budget submission states that when additional costs for outfitting and post delivery and for final system designmission systems and ship integration team are included the total estimated procurement costs of lcs1 and lcs2 become 631 million and 636 million respectively the navy stated that although costs fo r final system designmission systems and ship integration team are shown in the navys fy2009 budgetjustification documents as part of the total estimated procurement costs of lcs1 and lcs2 the work in question is normally funded from shipbuilding programs general research and development funds rather than from f unds used to pay for the construction of individual ships in the program the navy stated that in the case of the lcs program these costs are shown as part of the total procurement costs of lcs1 and lcs2 because this is where there was r oom in the lcs programs lineitem funding breakdown to accommodate these costs18 removing these costs from the totalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33741crs13 procurement costs of lcs1 and lcs2 would lead to adjusted total procurement costs of 606 million and 582 million respectively for the two ships the fy2009 budget submission also showed that the estimated cost of follow on lcs sea frames had increased to 460 million each the same figure that congress used in 2007 in amending the it procurement cost cap for lcs sea frame procurement march 2008 press report suggested that the cost of lcs2 might increase by 41 million above the figures reported in the fy2009 budget submission this increase if realized would increase th cost of lcs2 to 548 million end cost or 677 million more broadly defined cost cbo testified in march 2008 that it estimated that the cost of lcs1 and lcs2 more broadly defined could increase to about 700 million each and that the cost of followon lcss could increase to about 550 million each review of cost growth over time estimated lcs sea frame procurement costs can be viewed as ving increased three times in early 2006 early 2007 and early 2008 early 2006 the proposed fy2007 navy budget submitted in february 2006 showed that the estimate for the first lcs had increased from 2155 million in the fy2005 budget and 2125 million in the fy2006 budget to 2745 million in the fy2007 budget an increase of about 27 from the fy2005 figure and about 29 form the fy2006 figure the estimate for the second lcs increased from 2137 million in the fy2005 budget and 2565 million in the fy2006 budget to 2781 million an increase

procurement rate of six ships per year had increased from 2233 million in the fy2006 budget to 298 million an increase of about 33 the navy stated in early 2006 that th cost increase from the fy2006 budget to the fy2007 budget was due mostly to the fact that lcs procurement costs in the fy2006 budget did not include items that ar traditionally included in the socalled end cost the total budgeted

2627 25 the lcs was earlier conceived as ship th at would be built to survivability standard that would be sufficient in the event of sign ificant battle damage to save the ships crew continuedhistorical experience indicates that cost growth in the lcs program is likely in particular using the lead ship of the ffg7 oliver hazard perry class frigate as an analogy historical costt oweight relationships indicate that the navys original cost target for the lcs of 260 million in 2009 dollars or 220 million in 2005 dollars was optimistic the first ffg7 cost about 670 million in 2009 dollars to build or about 250 million per thousand tons including combat systems applying that metric to the lcs program suggests that the lead ships would cost about 600 million api ece including the cost of one mission module thus in this case the use of historical costtoweight relationship produces an estimate that is less than the ac tual costs of the first lcss to date but substantially more than the navys original estimate based on actual costs the navy has incurred for the lcs program cbo estimates that the first two lcss c ould cost about 700 million each including outfitting and postdelivery and various nonr ecurring costs associated with first ships of class but excluding missi on modules however as of may 1 2008 lcs1 was 83 percent complete and lcs2 was 68 percent complete thus additional cost growth is possible and cbos estimate reflects that cost risk overall cbo estimates that the lcss in the navys plan would cost about 550 million each on average excluding mission modules that estimate assumes that the navy would select one of the two existing designs and make changes as the program advanced with settled design and higher annual rates of production average ship costs would probably decline if the navy decided to make changes to that design however the costs of building future ships could be higher than cbo now estimates24 reasons for cost growth various reasons have been cited for cost growth in the lcs program including the following unrealistically low original estimate some observers believe that the original cost estimate of 220 million for the lcs sea frame was unrealistically low if so potential followon question would be whether the lcs represents case of lowballing using an unrealistically low cost estimate in the early stages of proposed weapon program to help the prog ram win approval and become an established procurement effort impact of naval vessel rules nvr navy and industry officials have attributed some of the cost growth to the impact of applying new naval vessel rules nvr essentially new rules specifying the construction standards for the sh ip to the lcs program the nvr issued for the lcs program incorporated among other things an increase in the survivability standard the ability to withstand damage to which lcss were to be built25 building the ship to ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33741crs17 25

services committee as part of its discussion of the lcs program in its report srept 11077 of june 5 2007 on the fy2008 defense authorization bill s 1547 stated reviewing this lcs situation will undoubtedly result in new set of lessons learned that the acquisition community will dutifully try to implement however the committee has previously expressed concerns about the lcs concept and the lcs acquisition strategy the lcs situation may be more case of lessons lost long ago we knew that we should not rush to sign construction contract before we have so lidified requirements we also knew that the contractors will respond to incentives and that if the incentives are focused on maintaining schedules and not on controlling cost cost growth on costplus continuedhigher survivability standard represented change in requirements for the ship that led to many design changes including changes that made ship more rugged and more complex in terms of its damage control systems in addition navy and industry officials have testified the timing of the issuing of nvr created situation of concurrency between design and construction in the lcs program meaning that the ship was being designed at the same time that the shipyard was attempting to build it situation long known to be potential cause of cost growth this concurrency navy officials testified was consequence of the compressed construction schedule for the lcs program whic h in turn reflected an urgency about getting lcss into the fleet to meet critical mission demands improperly manufacture d reduction gear navy and industry officials testified that cost growth on lcs1 was partly due to main reduction gear26 that was incorrectly ma nufactured and had to be replaced forcing reordering of the construction sequence for the various major sections of the ship increased costs for materials some observers ve attributed part of the cost growth in the program to higherthanestimated costs for steel and other materials that are used in building the ships emphasis on meeting schedule combined with costplus contract some portion of cost growth on lcs1 has been attributed to combination of navy emphasis on

the chief of naval operations included remarks on causes of cost growth in the lcs program there was rush and we thought we could get by with some commercial specifications roughead said as we go t

the pmag was given less than 15 working days to do its study given the complexity of the ship sign and construction process use of multiple contractors geographical dispersi on of the key players and the size of the lcs acquisition program we believe 15 days was not sufficient time to adequately conduct indepth analyses to fully assess the validity and accuracy of program data and decisions used to support their findings the report says30 july 2007 gao testimony gao testified in july 2007 that we have frequently reported on the wisdom of using solid executable business case before committing resources to new product development effort sound business case would establish and resource knowledgebased approach at the outset of program we would define such business case as firm requirements mature technologies and an acquisition strategy that provides sufficient time and money for design ac tivities before construction start the business case is the essential first step in any acquisition program that sets the stage for the remaining stages of program namely the business or contracting arrangements and actual execution or performance if the business case is not sound the contract will not correct th problem and execution will be subpar this does not mean that all potential problems can be eliminated and perfection achieved but rather that sound business cases can get the navy better shipbuilding outcomes and better return on investment if any one element of the business case is weak problems can be expected in construction the need to meet schedule is one of the main reasons why programs cannot execute their business cases this pattern was clearly evident in both the lpd 17 amphibious ship and lcs programs in both cases the program pushed ahead with production even when design problems aros or key equipment was not available when needed short cuts such as doing technology development concurrently with design and construction are taken to meet schedule in the end problems occur that cannot be resolved with in compressed optimistic schedules ultimately when schedule is set that cannot accommodate program scope delivering an initial capability is delayed and higher costs are incurred what happens when the elements of solid business case are not present unfortunately the results have been all too visible in the lpd 17 and the lcs ship construction in these programs has been hampered throughout by design instability and program management challenges that can be traced back to flawed business cases the navy moved forward with ambitious schedules for constructing lpd 17 and lcs despite significant challenges in stabilizing thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33741crs23 31 defense acquisitions realistic business cases needed to execute navy shipbuilding continueddesigns for these ships as result construction work has been performed out of sequence and significant rework has been required disrupting the optimal construction sequence and application of lessons learned for followon vessels in these programs in the lcs program design instability resulted from flawed business case as well as changes to navy requirements from the outset the navy sought to concurrently design and construct two lead ships in the lcs program in an effort to rapidly meet pressing needs in the mine countermeasures antisubmarine warfare and surface warfare mission areas the navy believed it could manage this approach even with little margin fo r error because it considered each lcs to be an adaptation of an existing highspeed ferry design it has since been realized that transforming highspeed ferry into capable networked survivable warship was quite complex venture implementation of new naval vessel rules design guidelines furt her complicated the navys concurrent designbuild strategy for lcs these rule s required program officials to redesign major elements of each lcs design to meet enhanced survivability requirements even after construction had begun on the first ship while these requirements changes improved the robustness of lcs designs they contributed to out of sequence work and rework on the lead ships the navy failed to fully account for these changes when establishing its 220 million cost target and 2year construction cycle for the lead ships complicating lcs construction was compressed and aggressive schedule when design standards were clarified with the issuance of naval vessel rules and major equipment deliveries were delayed eg main reduction gears adjustments to the schedule were not made instead with the first lcs the navy and shipbuilder continued to focus on achieving the planned schedule accepting the higher costs associated with out of sequence work and rework this approach enabled the navy to achieve its planned launch date for the first littoral combat ship but required it to sacrifice its desi red level of outfitting program officials report that schedule pressures also drove low outfitting levels on the second littoral combat ship design as well although rework requirements have been less intensive to date however because remaining work on the first two ships will now have to be completed outofsequence the initial schedule gains most likely will be offset by increased labor hours to finish these ships the difficulties and costs discussed above relate to the lcs seaframe only this program is unique in that the ships mission equipment is being developed and funded separately from the seaframe the navy faces additional challenges integrating mission packages with the sh ips which could further increase costs and delay delivery of new antisubmarine warfare mine countermeasures and surface warfare capabilities to the fleet these mission packages are required to meet weight requirement of 180 metric tons or less and require 35 personnel or less to operate them however the navy estimates that the mine countermeasures mission package may requi re an additional 13 metric tons of weight and 7 more operator personnel in order to deploy the full level of promised capability because neither of the competing ship designs can accommodate these

might this reduce the capabilities of the planned 55ship lcs fleet in light of the cost growth is the lcs program still costeffective for followon lcss what is the it procurement cost above which the navy would longer consider the lcs program costeffective if congress had known in 2004 when it was acting on the fy2005 budget that contained funding to procure lcs1 that lcs sea frame unit procurement costs would increase to the degree that they have how might that have affected c ongresss views on the question of approving the start of lcs procurement how might the increase in lcs unit procurement costs affect the affordability and executability of the navys overall shipbuilding program32 what implications if any does the increase in lcs unit procurement costs have for estimated procurement costs of other new navy ship classes33 total program acquisition cost although this crs report estimates that 55ship lcs program with 64 mission packages might have total acquisition cost of roughly 294 billion the potential total acquisition cost of the lcs program is uncertain supporters could argue that total program acquisition cost will become clearer as the navy works through the details of the program critics could argue that major acquisition program like the lcs program should not proceed at full p ace until its potential total acquisition costs are better understood

developing the lcs seaframe gao reported in march 2008 tha the first ship in the program lcs1 was delivered to the navy on september 18 2008 and is scheduled to be commissioned into service on november 8 2008 the navy identifies total of 19 critical technologies across both lcs seaframe designs fifteen of these tec hnologies are fully mature and another 2 technologies are approaching maturity two other technologies the overhead launch and retrieval system in the lockheed martin design and the aluminum structure in the general dynamics design remain immature the navy has identified the watercraft launch and recovery concept as major risk to both lcs seaframe designs this capability is ssential to complete antisubmarine warfare and mine count ermeasures missions planned for lcs according to the navy industry watercraft launch and recovery designs are untested and unproven to mitigate this risk the navy is conducting launch and recovery modeling and simulation model basin testing and experimentati on the navy is encouraging the lcs seaframe industry teams to adopt similar approaches final integration of watercraft to each lcs seaframe design is not expected until the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 after the navy has accepted delivery of the first two lcs seaframes in addition while the navy has identified the aviation landingretrieval system as mature technology it is concerned that this system may not be qualified for use on the lockheed martin seaframe and may in fact result in damage to aircraft the navy has developed system qualification and

containers in which mission systems are stored and transported the design was not complete at critical design review neither the critical technologies nor the design of this package are expected to be fully mature until after they have been demonstrated as prototypes aboard the second lcs ship the program office does not currently track critical process control data or use other production metrics37 mine countermeasures mcm module regarding technical risk in developing the mine countermeasures mcm module for the lcs gao reported in march 2008 that technologies used in the mcm package are all mature or approaching maturity however delays in testing some airborne systems from the mh60s helicopter due to both integration challenges and competing fleet demands for the mh60s may delay the fielding of some mcm systems to later packages some systems in the mcm package were initially developed for fielding on other ships and the navy is redesigning them to accommodate launch and recovery systems planned for lcs the mcm package design is not yet stable at the design readiness review only 47 percent of design drawings were releasable the program does not track production metrics and is relying on test results using ships other than lcs to inform fullrate production decisions38 surface warfare suw module regarding technical risk in developing the surface warfare suw

strategy for followon ships in program potential oversight questions for congress regarding the navys acquisition strategy for the followon ships in the lcs program include the following is it now the navys intention as suggested in april and august 2008 press reports to build bot h lcs designs in significant quantities and consequently to shift the purpose of the operational evaluation to one of finding problems in each design that need to be fixed if so could the navy have made this shift in the acquisition strategy clearer in its prepared statements for the march 14 or april 8 2008 house and senate subcomm ittee hearings that reviewed navy shipbuilding programs40 what are the comparative costs and benefits of procuring single design versus procuring both designs in fy2010 and beyond is it still the navys plan to shift to common combat system for all lcss what are the potential co sts and operationa l benefits of maintaining one or both of the cu rrent contractorfurnished combat systems vs shifting to common governmentfurnished combat system given the shifts that have now occurred in the announced acquisition strategy for the followon ships in the lcs program why should congress have confidence that the acquisition strategy for these ships will not shift again at some point how might such shifts in the announced lcs acquisition strate gy affect congresss ability to evaluate and conduct oversig ht of the lcs program coordination of sea frames and mission packages on the issue of coordination of sche dules for delivering lcs sea frames and lcs mission packages an

capabilities gao0813 october 2007 summary pagethe navy has made progress developi ng individual mine countermeasures systems and the littoral combat ship however significant challenges remain to fielding new capabilities operational testing plans for four systems in limited production will not provide complete understanding of how the systems will perform when operated from the littoral combat ship ot her ships will be used in testing to inform fullrate production decisions on the individual systems while other ships may serve as platforms for the anti mine systems the littoral combat ship is their primary platform and it will have different launch recovery and handling systems in addition navy plans call for testing these systems in smooth uncluttered environments although operating environments are expected to be less favorable the first two littoral combat ships have encountered design and production challenges costs are expected to more than double from initial estimates and the navy anticipates lead sh ip delivery nearly 18 months later than first planned this may slow the planned transition from current mine countermeasures platforms the navy has reduced its investment s in intelligence preparation of the environment capabilities including the capability to locate and map minefield boundaries even though improvements in this area could reduce mine countermeasures mission timelines by 30 to 75 percent these capabilities are especially important for the littoral combat ship as it must stand clear of suspected minefields the navy has refined its concepts of operation for the littoral combat ship increasing awareness of operational needs however the navy has not yet reconciled these concepts with the ships physical constraints and the tradeoffs involved ultimately will determine the sh ips capabilities for example operation of mine countermeasures systems is currently expected to exceed the personnel allowances of the ship which could ffect the ships ab ility to execute this mission in addition the littoral combat ship will have only limited capability to conduct corrective maintenance aboard however because the navy recently reduced the numbers of certain mission systems from two to one per ship operational availability for these systems may decrease below current projections moreover the mine countermeasures mission package currently exceeds its weight limitation which may require the navy to accept reduction in speed and endurance capabilities planned for the l ittoral combat ship it is important that the navy assess these uncertainties and determine whether it can produce the needed mine countermeasures capabilities from the assets it is likely to have and the concepts of operation it can likely execute41

requirements for the program so as to facilitate congressional oversight on issues such as cost growth potential for common hulls in general some observers including so members of congress have expressed interest in the idea of usin g common hulls for navy and coast guard ships so as to improve economies of scal in the construction of these ships and thereby reduce their procurement costs in earlier years this interest focused on using common hull for the lcs and the offshore patrol cutter opc cutter displacing roughly 3000 tons that is to be procured under the coast guards deepwater

capabilities group are detailed in the navys new maritime strategy and include forward presence deterrence sea control maritime secur ity humanitarian assistance and disaster response you dont want highend aegis ship to handle those missions womble said you want something cheaper and smaller the national security cutter nsc as configured for the coast guard could easily handle those roles womble said the first nsc the bertholf successfully carried out its initial trials in early december and will be commissioned this year by the coast guard womble said navy version would avoid the firstofc lass issues that have plagued numerous navy programs including both designs being built for the lcs competition northrop in late december began briefing select navy leaders on its unsolicited proposal the company is taking pains to avoid presenting the ship as an lcs alternative instead calling it an lcs complement which is being built under competition between lockheed martin and general dynamics key features of northrops concept are the ship is based on proven design already under construction the nscs weapons sensors and sy stems already have high degree of commonality with navy systems increasing affordability while the nsc is 15 knots slower than the 45knot lcs the cutter can stay at sea up to two months much longer than the lcs the report also stated northrop is claiming it can deliver the first ship at the end of 2012 at an average cost of less than 400 million per ship exclusive of governmentfurnished equipment in fi scal 2007 dollars thats close to the 403 million contract cost of the third nsc which incorporates all current design upgrades major element of northrops proposa l womble said is that the navy should make changes to the current block 0 design thats the only way we can deliver the ship at this price the design however has plenty of room for upgrades womble claimed and northrop is proposing future upgrade s be handled in groups or blocks ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33741crs32 ships rather than modifying individual ones those upgrades could include nonlineofsight missiles searam missile launchers and more capabilities to handle unmanned systems the design even has room for an lcslike reconfigurable mission area under the flight deck he claimed northrop admits the ships are deficient in one significant navy requirement full compatibility with the naval vessel rules nvr essentially building codes developed by the naval sea systems command and the american bureau of shipping the belated applic ation of the nvr to both lcs designs was major factor in the cost growth on those ships most of the nsc design already is nvrcompatible womble said but upgrading the entire design to nvr st andards would involve fundamental redesign and eliminate the proposals cost and construction time attributes wed need waiver from the nvr rules to make this proposal work he said the report also stated navy response requirement the

unsolicited proposal the source said opens the way for someone else to come up with potential gamechanger northrops plan the source said may be an unexpected opportunity northrop is listening to the

contracts that is potential catalyst that could have huge impact on the way the navy buys small and midsized surface combatants mcaleese said northrop says its new coast guard cutter also experienced some cost growth but says that was mainly due to requirements added after the sept 11 2001 hijacking attacks the first of the new ships is due to be delivered to the coast guard in march followed by one ship annually over the next few years northrop said it could offer the navy fixed price on the frigate because design work on the ships is already largely completed its price excludes governmentfurnished equipment that would still have to be put on board were not advocating an lcs replacement said spokesman randy belote but after listening to the navy leadership and studying the new maritime strategy we think we can get hulls nd capabilities into the water at much faster pace womble said northrop analysts and an outside consultant studied the navys needs and concluded the navy could use another ship that can operate in shallow water be forward deployed has the range and endurance to operate independently and can work with us allies if needed the press report also

their second ship lcs3 when the program ran into major cost problems earlier last year the navy then issued stop work order on lcs3 in order to reduce expenditures and limit further cost exposure on the program while it separately reevaluated program cost estimates the navy entered into negotiations with the lcs1 team to sign up to fixed price contract on the two ships or face outright cancellation on the second ship the navy terminated the contract for lcs3 for the convenience of the government as result of that termination the government will take delivery of some sizeable inventory of equipmen t and material for the cancelled lcs3 the second contractor team had c ontract to build two lcs vessels of another design lcs2 and lcs4 the navy awarded this contract almost year

similar cost and schedulehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33741crs38 problems as those faced by the first c ontractor late last year the same poor performance and fixed priced negotiation scenario also played

ships should more than offset the effects of one years escalation for ships purchased in 2009 the fiscal year 2008 budget has res ources sufficient to award one lcs within the cost cap to eith er shipyard when taking into account the inventory of equipment and material available from that shipyards cancelled ship the navy would provide this equipment and material to the shipyard that wins the

fiscal year 2009 budget to the other shipyard the navy would likewise provide the gfm from that shipyards cance lled ship to offset the cost of that one ship similarly the value of this gfm would count against the cost cap on this ship as well the fiscal year 2009 budget request how ever would fund both ships to the full cost cap and not take the value of this gfm for the second cancelled ship into account this means that the budget request of 9200 million includes more funding than can be placed on contract without violating the cost cap unless the navy were to withhold the gfm for the second shipyard the committee believes that the navy should apply the gfm to both contractors vessels as soon as sec ond ship is purchased from either yard therefore the committee recommends reduction of 1230 million to take thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33741crs39 gfm into account this will leave sufficient funds in the navys hands to award two ships in fiscal year 2009 with both ships fully funded to the congressional cost cap of 4600 million pages 7778 regarding lcs mission packages the report states the navy has embarked on program to develop modular countermine antisurface and antisubmarine warfare systems referred to as mission packages to be deployed on the littoral combat ship lcs the navy envisions fielding 60 mission pack ages which navy commanders could interchange across the 55ship lcs class as operational requirements dictate this total system capability of the lcs pr ogram has been identified by the chief of naval operations as top priority for operations in the littorals the committee similarly views the capability provided by family of lcs mission packages as key component of the maritime strategy the committee is therefore concerned by the delays to mission package initial operational capability deployment and full operational capability caused by delays to the lcs construction program the navy has designed the lcs mission packages with modularity and with open architecture having done this the navy s hould be able to deploy this capability on other ship classes such an expanded concept of operations would provide opportunities to employ mission packages more rapidly and against threats and in operational scenarios perhaps not envisioned today therefore the committee directs the secretary of the navy to evaluate alternatives for employing lcs mission packages on other ship classes of the battle force and to provide report on his findings to the congressional defense committees with submission of the 2010 budget request the report shall outline the feasibility cost and impacts associated with integrating mine countermeasures and antisubmarine mission packages on other surface combatant and amphibious force ship classes and provide an assessment of the operational utility afforded by being able to deploy mission packages across the broader battle force page 126 compromise in lieu of conference report there

ement for s 3001 states the agreement would authorize the budget request of 9200 million for two lcs vessels elsewhere in the agreement we recommend provision that would delay implementation of the cost cap for the lcs program until fiscal year 2010 we note that the navy has taken delivery of the first ship of this class and anticipates taking delivery of the second by the end of the calendar

defense appropriations bill 48 source september 10 2008 press release from senate appropriations comm ittee entitled senate defense appropriations subcomm ittee approves fiscal year 2009 defense appropriations bill p 2these are significant milestones we remain concerned that the navy has not taken sufficient actions to control costs for followon vessels moreover in repeated testimony before the committees on armed services of the senate and the house of representatives we have been told that primary benefit of utilizing midtier shipyards is that such yards can easily balance commercial and government workload to ensure that the navy does not have to pay overhead costs to maintain capability during pe riods of limited government funding nevertheless the navy has requested for the second year in row an adjustment to the cost cap in order to preserve industrial capability because the navy is unable to purchase ship at or below its budgetary estimate and lacks coherent acquisition strategy for the program we strongly encourage the navy to take steps to procure followon ve ssels with required warfighting capability while prioritizing the aggressive management of cost and the most efficient utilization of the i ndustrial base likewise we dire ct the secretary to develop and submit to the congress longterm acquisition strategy for lcs vessels with the submission of
