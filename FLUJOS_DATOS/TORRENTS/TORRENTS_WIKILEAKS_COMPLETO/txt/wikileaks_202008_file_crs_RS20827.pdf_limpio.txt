reeligibility were the subject of considerable discussion at the 1787 constitutional convention the convention faced two basic tenure issues duration of the presidents term and whether incumbents would be able to serve multiple terms reeligibility the delegates sought to balance the need for energy and stability in the executive thus suggesting term longer than the one or tw years served by most state governors at the time with the fear that toolengthy term woul d lead to excessive concentration of power the question of reeligibility was similarly influenced by fears of tyranny would an infinitely reelectible presidency lead to dictatorship or monarchy this issue was further complicated by the fact that most delegates expected the president to be chosen by congress if he were and were also reeligible they feared the incumb ent would spend much of his time and energy in schemes to ensure reelection and that this would negatively affect the goal of separation of powers and checks and balances among the branches of government would the executive become too dependent on congress two early drafts of the constitution the virginia and new jersey plans specified that the federal executive would be elected by congress and eligible to serve just one term but neither suggested what length the term should be the delegates initially approved single sevenyear term with prospect for reelection they later changed the term to six years and dropped the prohibition against additional service but restored the sevenyear term without reeligibility after further debate this interim decision was ultimately superseded late in the convention when the committee on unfinished business submitted report that provided fouryear term with unlimited reeligibility the committee also addressed the question of executive independence by vesting the presidents election in group of electors chosen in the states the electoral college 1 opponents sought unsuccessfully to reinstate the single term requirement but the final version as approved by the convention states the familiar formula found in article ii section 1 of the constitution the executive power shall be vested in president of the united states of america he shall hold his office during the term of four years and together with the vice president chosen for the same term be elected as follows 2

about perpetual reeligibility in the presidency as early as 17884 petitioned to run for third term in 1807 jefferson declined stating his belief that if some termination to the services of the chief magistrate be not fixed by the constitution or supplied by practice his office nominally four years will in fact become for life i should unwillingly be the person who disregarding the sound precedent set by an illustrious predecessor washington should furnish the first example of prolongation beyond the second term of office 5 the twoterm limit quickly acquired the force of tradition three of jeffersons four immediate successors james madison james monroe and andrew jackson stepped down at the close of their second terms while the fourth john quincy adams was defeated for reelection in fact historian michael nelson notes that during the second quarter of the 19th century the whig party and many democrats supported oneterm limit and suggests that this proposal may have influenced presidential tenure for quarter century following jacksons retirement in 1837 during which period president served more than single term6 abraham lincoln was the first president since jackson to be elected to second term in 1864 in the 68 years between the death of lincoln in 1865 and the inauguration of franklin d roosevelt in 1933 only ulysses grant and woodrow wilson served two consecutive terms while grover cleveland was defeated for reelection in 1888 but was reelected to second nonconsecutive term in 1892 during this long period only grant explored the possibility of third term in 1880 while theodore roosevelt declined to run in 1908 notwithstanding his considerable popularity 7 the twoterm mold was broken by president franklin d roosevelt in 1940 following his 1936 reelection it was widely assumed that roosevelt would step down at the end of his second term in 1939 however the political landscape was transformed by the outbreak of world war ii as the conflict erupted into world crisis in the spring and summer of 1940 roosevelt after long silence on the subject let it be known that he would accept the democratic party nomination for third term if it were offered the party obliged with considerable enthusiasm and the president was reelected for third term that november with the united states deeply involved in the war by 1944 the injunction not to change horses in the middle of the stream seemed even more compelling and roosevelt although in failing health was elected fourth time

proposed by congress in 1932 and ratified by the states in 1933 changed the date for presidential terms to january 20 effective in 1937 and that of congress to january 3 effective in 1935 the amendment was the culmination of long campaign to 1 shorten the interval between election and inauguration 2 eliminate lame duck sessions of congress and 3 ensure that newly elected congress would count electoral votes and conduct contingent election of the president and vice president if necessary 10 since 1937 presidents have been inaugurated on january 20 except when the day falls on sunday

22nd amendment which effectively limits presidents to two terms in office has frequently been described as reaction to the presidency of franklin roosevelt11 the amendment was top priority for the 80th congress 19471948 the first to be controlled by republicans since 1931 debate on the proposal was the occasion of considerable rancor as some democrats claimed it was both undemocratic and an act of posthumous revenge against roosevelt while republicans argued their goal was the prevention of excess concentration of power in the hands of one person the idea of term limits was not new however one scholar notes that 270 amendments to limit presidential tenure had been proposed prior to 1947 moreover the measure passed both houses by wide margins and with some degree of democratic support 12 the amendment states that person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice it also provides in an amendment offered by senator robert taft for vice presidents who succeed to the office they can be elected to two full terms as president if they serve less than two years of their predecessors term up to 10 years of service if they have served more than two years of the term to which they succeed they can be elected to only one additional term between four and eight years of service depending on when the vice president succeeded to the presidency 13 the amendment also specifically exempted any person holding the office of president when this article was proposed that is incumbent president harry truman proposed in 1947 the amendment was declared ratified on march 1 1951 after being approved by 36 states since its ratification the 22 nd amendment has applied to three presidents who served two full terms dwight eisenhower 19531961 ronald reagan 19811989 and william clinton 19932001 9 during this period retiring or defeated presidents were c onsidered to be political cripples lame ducks at the same time the second lame duck session of congress followed

the 22nd amendment prohibits anyone from being elected president more than twice but could president who was elected to two terms as chief executive be subsequently elected vice president and then succeed to the presidency on the incumbents death resignation or removal from office this issue was raised during discussions of the 22nd amendment in 1960 when president eisenhower was about to become the first president affected by the amendment while it has received little attention since the question remains open14 some argue that the 12th amendments statement that person constitutionally ineligible to the office of president shall be eligible to that of vicepresident ipso facto bars any termlimited president from serving as vice president or succeeding to the presidency from any other lineofsuccession position the speaker of the house the president pro tempore of the senate the cabinet etc15 others maintain that the 12th amendments qualifications arguably apply only to the standard requirements of age residence and naturalborn citizenship the 22nd amendments prohibition they suggest can be interpreted as extending only to eligibility for election not service thus termlimited president could be elected vice president and then succeed to the presidency to serve the balance of his successors term he would not however be eligible to run for election to an additional term16 it seems unlikely that this question will be answered conclusively barring an actual occurrence of the hypothesis developed above as former secretary of state dean acheson commented when the issue was discussed in 1960 it may be more unlikely than unconstitutional17 g18g155g152g153g152g156g138g149g156g561g8g152g155g561g5g145g138g151g144g142g561

since its ratification advocates of repeal assert that popular or successful twoterm president should be able to serve additional terms that the limit imposed by the 22nd amendment prevents the voters from choosing the president they prefer and that reelection is the ultimate term limit mechanism supporters of presidential term limits argue that eight years is enough time in such powerful office and that longer presidential tenure could result in excessive concentration of power in the executive these proposals have usually been offered during the second term of president who has enjoyed degree of success or popularity eg hjres 690 99 th congress representative dornan hjres 156 100th congress representative vander jagt both offered toward the end of president reagans tenure and hjres

president and vice president usually coupled with provisions limiting these officers to single term proponents of this reform assert that the sixyear term would free the president from partisan political concerns associated with campaigning for reelection thus allowing the chief executive to concentrate on public policy issues further decisions on these questions would less likely be judged by their impact on the presidents reelection prospects finally advocates suggest that single term would eliminate the lame duck diminution of power and influence experienced by some presidents during their last years in office opponents counter by asserting that single sixyear term would make an incoming chief executive who has prospect for reelection lame duck the day he entered office lack of the prospect of reelection they contend would actually reduce presidents accountability they suggest that the single term provision is undemocratic and would deprive the nation of the services of capable chief executive further they argue that sixyear term is too long for failed president and too short for successful one six years for an incompetent erratic or listless president would have been disastrous on several past occasions and could be again 18 standalone sixyear term proposals were last offered in the 101st congress 19891991 including hjres 6 representative brooks hjres 52
