library of congress crs2 during the first eight years after the qiz amendment was adopted jordan but not egypt entered an agreement with israel to take advantage of qiz benefits offered subsequently the united states trade representative ustr on behalf of the president designated 13 qizs one was later expanded in jordan finally in december of 2004 following an agreement between israel and egypt the ustr designated the first three qizs in egypt and in 2005 expanded two of these and added fourth2 qizs in nutshell qizs can be compared to free trade zones qizs are typically industrial parks housing manufacturing operations they simplify cooperative production between countries because they 1 are enclaves of infrastructure in developing countries where infrastructure may be sparse and 2 are fiscally outside the customs territory of country thus on raw materials flowing into and goods moving out of zones customs procedures are streamlined and tariffs do not apply until the item formally enters country as an import for consumption qizs are distinguished from other trade zones as follows trade zones in general are standalone entities within one country not directly connected to other countries b produce for export to or domestic consumption in any country and c operate solely under the authority of and conditions determined by the host government qizs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22002 however have operations in two countries israel and either jordan or egypt b produce goods solely for export to the united states and c operate under both the authority of the host countries and the oversight authority of the united states which determines conditions for and authorizes tariff relief for qiz imports pl 104234 requires that articles eligible for qiz status must 1 be wholly the growth product or manufacture of and must be imported directly from the west bankgaza strip administered by the palestinian authority or qiz and 2 meet the following rulesoforigin requirements at the time the product enters the united states material and processing costs incurred in qiz3 must total not less than 35 of the appraised value of the product of this 35 20 must come from israel and jordan or egypt and 15 may be either us materials or materials from israel the west bankgaza strip andor jordan or egypt depending on the participating qiz program the remaining 65 can come from anywhere in the world in addition the article must have been substantially transformed in the manufacturing process4 the importer must certify that the article meets the conditions for the duty exemption details of the jordanianisraeli and egyptianisraeli qiz programs including exact shares comprising the minimum 20 from israel and either jordan or egypt differ slightly based on the qiz agreements between israel and jordan and israel and egypt respectively and on us approval5 2 proclamation 6955 nov 13 1996 61cfr 58761 gave the ustr power to designate 3 examples of such costs are originating materials wages and salaries design research and development depreciation of capital investment and overhead 4 section 1 of pl 104234 amending section 9 of pl 9947 5 for example the manufacturer from the jordanian side must contribute at least 117 of the final produce and the manufacturer on the israeli side must contribute 8 7 on high tech products and under the israeliegyptian agreement 117 of the inputs must be made in israel crs3 qizs in jordan for jordanianisraeli qizs jordanianisraeli joint committee with two co chairmen each appointed by the respective government and an american observer must approve all eligible products product approval is renewed every 12 months6 both the public and private sectors in jordan have role in the industrial activity taking place in jordans qizs of jordans 13 qizs three are publicly operated industrial estates and function under the supervision of the jordan industrial estates corporation jiec semigovernmental corporation with financial and administrative autonomy the jiec was created by law in 1985 to promote the establishment of industrial estates in jordan subsequently jiec spearheaded the development of qizs after president clinton inaugurated the program in 1996 impact of the qizs on trade and the jordanian economy us trade with jordan has grown substantially in recent years from both the qiz httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22002 program and to substantially lesser extent from the usjordan free trade agreement which went into effect in 2001 between 1998 and 2005 jordan moved up from the united states 13th to 8th largest trading partner among the 20 middleeastnorth african mena entities in 2005 us exports to and imports from jordan totaled an estimated 19 billion us exports at an estimated 646 million were 18 times their 1998 level us imports at 13 billion were 80 times their 1998 level usitc dataweb see figure 1 despite the 2001 fta between the united states and jordan most jordanian articles still enter the united states through the qiz program 75 the apparel industry dominates both jordans qizs and total exports to the united states accounting for 999 of all qiz exports and 86 of all jordanian exports to the united states the reason for continuing qiz dominance is that qiz products enter the united states free of duty whereas under the usjordan fta tariffs will not be fully eliminated until the end of the tenyear phasein period in 2011 nevertheless in 2005 the growth in qiz exports from jordan leveled off to only 2 growth over 2004 exports this growth slowdown could have been affected by the removal of textile and clothing quotas but not tariffs that occurred with the january 2005 expiration of the 1995 wto agreement on textiles and clothing trade in general and qiz trade in particular has been major engine of growth for jordans economy in the past few years the economist intelligence unit eiu projects that from an average annual rate of around 20 in 20002004 export earnings growth is expected to slow to more modest 9 for 20052007 as the initial impact of the special trade agreement with the united states wanes and competition from asian textile producers toughens the gains in export earnings have been overwhelmed by surge in import spending which was driven sharply upward in 2005 by rapid growth in international oil prices7 6 export

effect of the qiz program in jordan has been the creation of jobs to ease generally high rates of unemployment in late 2003 the state department estimated that qizs had created more than 40000 new jobs in jordan mainly for women8 according to local jordanian press reports and international economists httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22002 however close to half of these jobs have been filled by expatriates mainly from southern asia9 breakdown of the number of workers employed at each of the 13 qizs is not available qizs in egypt on december 14 2004 after an agreement between israel and egypt which has the largest economy of the middle east countries the ustr designated three qizs in egypt the greater cairo zone the alexandria zone and the suez canal zone 69 cfr 78094 on november 4 2005 the ustr designated fourth zone in the central delta region and expanded the greater cairo and suez canal zones several factors contributed to egypts desire for qiz participation at this time first was the january 1 2005 end of quotas on textiles and apparel which dominate egypts as well as jordans exports to the united states under wto agreement this meant that the flood of similar articles from china and india to the united states could crowd out egyptian exports and could result in the loss of 150000 job opportunities in the industry10 and some of the 32 billion us foreign direct investment in egypt in addition egypt was in search of sources for increased economic growth and trade to provide jobs for its rapidly growing labor force to contain the fiscal deficit to arrest the growth of public debt and to address the trade deficit with the united states and bolster ties with israel in order to improve regional relations the united states on the other hand views egypts

exports at an estimated 31 billion for the first 11 months of 2005 for 2005 egypts first full year of qiz participation egypt exported 230 million dollars worth of goods to the united states through the qiz program this represents 12 of egypts total exports to the united states as with the israeljordan qiz program textiles and apparel exports dominated egypts qiz exports to the united states 89 of those exports were apparel and 5 were textiles qizs broader implications although the creation of qizs has been positive step toward jordans and egypts economic growth jordan like other non oilproducing middle east countries faces enormous challenges to its long term economic well being for some countries in the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22002 region lack of adequate water resources impedes growth jordan is one of the ten most waterdeprived countries in the world beyond natural resources the regions human resources also need to be further developed in order to spur economic development for example most experts note that jordans workforce is still largely unskilled which hinders the economys transformation from one based on smallscale agriculture and pastoral grazing to laborintensive industrialized economy despite recent government investment in higher education and vocational training jordanian workers according to one jordanian businessman lack vocational experience and strong work ethic13 some factories located in qizs have high numbers of more productive foreign workers from china and southeast asia14 in order to increase the competitiveness of jordanian labor the ministry of labor has launched several programs aimed at recruiting skilled rural workers particularly women the social impact of qizs although most experts note that companies based in qizs continue to hire foreign laborers thousands of jordanians particularly women from the rural countryside have found jobs at garment factories in qizs in traditional society such as jordan many of these women had little previous work experience and were largely caretakers of their home despite the low wages paid by apparel factories in the qizs some women have been able to support their families where the father or husband had fallen sick or died and others have been able to supplement the income of the male breadwinner however traditional attitudes toward womans place in the home persist and many families continue to prohibit female members from working in 11 us to consider egypt fta after next tifa wants further reforms inside us trade jan 14 2005 12 the realities of

jordanians see trade without consent choosing between free trade and democracy in jordan daily star july 14 2003 crs6 qizs in response the jordanian ministry of labor has worked to ease the adjustment of women moving from the home to new job by providing free transportation to work subsidizing the cost of food in qizs and paying for dormitories near factories to cut commuting times according to the jordanian trade minister new sort of culture is being established where girls are going to work they are supporting their families and they are raising the standard of living in their villages15 the long term effect of female employment in qizs has yet to be measured and there is some concern that over time jordanian women may have difficulty in achieving higher wages in global economy where apparel manufacturers can easily relocate to cheaper labor markets impact on the arabisraeli peace process when the qiz program came into being in 1996 many observers regarded it as vehicle to support the development of peaceful relations and normalization of commercial ties between israel and the two arab states jordan and egypt with which it had signed peace treaties in both cases however cold peace continues to prevail between israel and the two arab states since the conclusion of the jordanisrael peace treaty in october 1994 large numbers of jordanians particularly islamic fundamentalists those of palestinian origin and members of the professional unions continue to oppose normalization with israel and resist the expansion httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22002 of commercial relations with the establishment of 13 qizs in jordan there has been an increase in the volume of bilateral trade though the overall totals remain modest trade between israel and jordan in 2004 were nearly six times what they were in 1997 israels exports to jordan in 2004 were roughly 133 million up from about 21 million in 1997 israels imports from jordan were roughly 51 million up from about 125 million in 199716 it is possible that some incremental improvement in bilateral relations could occur over time as result of increased commercial contacts and joint participation in mechanisms related to the qiz program recent issues in may of 2006 the national labor committee nlc human rights advocacy group issued 161page report alleging sweatshoplike conditions in 28 out of 100 qiz plants in jordan the report usjordan free trade agreement descends into human trafficking and involuntary servitude was compiled from interviews with over 100 foreign guest workers in jordan and workers forcibly returned to bangladesh in response to the allegations the ustr raised the matter with the jordanian government jordans trade minister sharif zubi subsequently indicated that the report incorrectly identified three sweatshops that are not even in jordan and that three others had been closed before the report was released in may in addition he noted that the jordanian government had formed nine inspections teams to investigate the entire garment trade in the country and is working with the international labor organization us labor committees the ustr the state department and us and jordanian apparel companies to address the challenges and improve their monitoring system 15 jordans peace dividend op cit 16 source of data us department of commerce trade policy information system tpis
