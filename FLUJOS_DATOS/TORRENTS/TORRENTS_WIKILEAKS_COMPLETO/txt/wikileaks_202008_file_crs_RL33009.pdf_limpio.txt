judges of the supr eme court and all other officers of the united states whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for and which shall be established by law1 as corollary to this general maxim the constitution provides further that the president sha ll have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the sena by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session2 the recess appointments clause was adopted by the constitutional conventi on without dissent and without debate regarding the intent and scope of its terms in fede ralist 67 alexander hamilton refers to the recess appointment power as nothing more than supplement for the purpose of establishing an auxiliary met hod of appointment in cases to which the general method wa s inadequate3 during the ratification debates in pennsylvania thomas mckean noted with approval the sh aring of the appointive power with the senate and stated that th senate need not be under any necessity of sitting constantly as has been alleged for there is an express provision made to enable the president to fill up all vacancies that may happen during their recess the commissions to expire at the end of the next session4 likewise during the ratification debates in north carolina archibald maclaine stated it has been objected that the power of appointing officers was something like monarchical power congress are not to be sitting at all times they will only sit from time to time as the public bus iness may render it necessary therefore the executive ought to make temporary ppointments this power can be vested nowhere but in the executive because he is perpetually acting for the public for though the senate is to advise him in th appointment of officers c yet during the recess the president must do this bus iness or else it will be neglected and such neglect may occasion public inconveniences5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33009crs2 6 crs report rs21308 recess appointments

accepted that the clause was designed to enable the president to ensure the unfettered operation of the government during periods when the sena was not in session and therefore unable to perform its advice and consent function6 this conception of the recess appointment power as practical accommodation is supported by the fact that until the civil war congress consistently met for relatively short sessions followed by long recesses of six to nine months7 this pattern largely adhered during and after the civil war with congress scheduling an intrasession recess of approximately two weeks from the end of december until the beginning of january8 the recess practices of congress changed in the midtwentieth century and are now characterized by more frequent recesses of relatively short duration within sessions of congress adjournments be tween sessions are also shorter9 however in addition to fostering administrative continuity presidents have exercised authority under the recess ppointments clause for political purposes throughout the history of the republic giving rise to significant political and legal controversy for instance president madisons recess appoi ntments of albert gallatin john quincy adams and james bayard as envoys to negotiate peace treaty with great britain in 1813 prompt ed heated debate in the senate10 presidents jackson taylor and lincoln made hundred s of recess appointments during their terms11 additionally recess appoi ntments to the judiciary were common during the early years of the republic with the first five presidents making 31 such appointments including five to the supreme court12 among these president washingtons recess appointment of john rutledge as chief justice generated significant controversy ultimately factoring in his rejection by the senate13 it is interesting to note however that recorded challenge was made to the constitutionality of hi s recess appointment14 in total twelve justices have been appointed to the supreme court during sena recesses and many of these justiceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33009crs3 15 henry b hogue the law recess appointments to article iii courts presidential studies quarterly 34

spurred congress to impose st atutory restrictions on the presidents appointment and removal power including restrictions on paying certain classes of recess appointees16 additionally the tenure of office act of 1867 that figured prominently in the impeachment effort ag ainst president johnson included several provisions purporting to limit the recess ppointment power of the president17 as noted above modern congressional r ecess practices differ significantly from the initial dynamic sessions of congress are now characterized by more frequent recesses of relatively short duration nd adjournments between sessions have likewise become shorter18 accordingly controvers over recess appointments may also now adhere to additiona l factors such as the length of recess and the application of statutory rest rictions to recess appointees textual issues and historical interpretation as noted above practices with respect to recess appointme nts developed early and debates between presiden ts and the congress over th propriety of particular recess appointments occurred in the formative years of the republic19 f r m l consideration of the issue has occurred prima rily in the context of attorney general opinions with periodic attention from the courts and congress aspects of the recess appointment power were consid ered as early as 1792 and th ere were at least nineteen formal attorneys general opinions in the nineteenth century on recess appointments the earliest being in 1823 the most recent major exposition by an attorney general on the recess appointment power was in 1992 and while many of the interpretational questions surrounding the clause are now d eemed at least by the executive branch to be settled the course of arriving at these interpretations was not unbroken by contrary opinions and expressions of doubt vacancies that may happen an initial question that arose was what constitutes vacancy that may happen during the recess of the senate if the term happen is interpre ted as referring only to vacancies that occur during recess it n ecessarily follows that the president would lack authority to make r ecess appointment to vacancy that existed prior to the recess conversely if ppen is construed more br oadly to encompass vacancies that exist during recess the president would be empowered to make recesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33009crs4 20 edmund

senate in 1792 the first attorney general edmund randolph responded to an inquiry from thomas jefferson then serving as secretary of foreign affairs as to whether recess appointment could be made to the position of chief coiner of the mint newly created position for which nomination had been made before the senate recessed20 positing whether the unfilled office was vacancy which has ppened during the rece ss of the senate randolph concluded that the vacancy occurre d on the day the office had been created and thus could not be fille d with recess appointment21 randolph based his opinion on the text of the clause and on the spir it of the constitution declaring that the recess appointments clause must be inter preted strictly because it serves as an exception to the general participation of the senate22 in 1799 alexander hamilton then serving as major general of the ar my responded to similar inquiry from the secretary of war stating it is clear that independent of the authority of special law the president cannot fill vacancy which happens during session of the senate23 in 1823 attorney general william wirt without mentioning the randolph interpretation concluded that the phrase encompassed all vacancies that happen to exist during the recess24 while attorney general wirt acknowledged that the opposite construction is perhap s more strictly consonant with the mere letter of the clause namely the construction limitin g the president to filling vacancies that originate during recess he opted for in his view the only construction of the constitution which is compatible w ith its spirit reason and purpose25 wirt stated further the substantial purpose of the constitution was to keep these offices filled and powers adequate to this purpose were intended to be conveyed but if the president shall not have the power to fill vacancy thus circumstanced the powers are inadequate to the purpose and the substance of the constitution will be sacrificed to dubious construction of its letter26 early controversies between the senate and the pr esident revolved around the meaning of this phrase and opposition to the interpretation offered by attorney general wirt had been ex pressed in the senate27 story in his commentaries on thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33009crs5 27 continued russell ed 1960 28 3 story commentaries on the constitution of the

recess commissions had expired and both opinions noted that under ch circumstances the vacancy could be said to occur after adjournment of the senate when the first recess commission ended29 furthermore attorney general taney in the 1832 opinion stated that the constitution was formed for practical purposes and construction that defeats the very object of the grant of power cannot be the true one it was the intention of the constitution that the offices created by law and necessary to carry on the operations of the government should always be full or at all events that the vacancy should not be protracted one30 attorney general taney went on to stress however that vacancies are not designedly to be kept open by the president until the recess for the purpose of avoiding the control of the senate31 in brief opinion in 1845 attorney ge neral mason concluded that if vacancies are known to exist during the ssion of the senate and nominations are not then made they cannot be filled by executive appointments in the recess of the senate32 the attorney general did not men tion his predecessors opinions to the contrary although in subsequent opinion he did note the prior opinions and stated that from the commencement of the government it is believed that power has been exercised which would appear to be inconsistent with construction of the section of the constitution which would confine the meaning of the word happen to the time at which the ffice is in fact vacated33 attorney general evarts discussed this later opinion of masons in an opinion issued in 1868 stating that it expresses his general concurrence in the construction of the constitutional provision under consideration adopted by his predecessors34 beginning in 1855 formal attorneys general opinions returned to the wirt interpretation even with respect to newly created offices that had never been filled35 attorney general bates in an 1862 opini on stated that the question is settledas

capacity for action and that to adopt narrow construction of the recess appointments clause would in terfere with that ability38 attorney general evarts in an 1868 opinion declared the matter so settled that it is hardly useful to express an opinion as u pon an origin question39 evarts nonetheless attempted to weigh anew the opposing interp retation of this clause of the constitution in light of the renewed interest in the whole subject of executive authority in appointments to office excited by recent legislation of congress ultimately concluding that icannot but give my concurrence to

paralysis and do violence to the orderly functioning of our complex government46 likewise in united states v woodley the court of appeals for the nint h circuit stated that contrary interpretation would lead to the absurd result that all offices vacant on the day the senate recesses would have to remain vacant at leas t until the senate reconvenes47 most recently in evans v stephens the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit stated that interpreting the phrase to prohibit the president from filling vacancy that comes into being on the last day of session but to empower the president to fill vacancy that arises immediat ely thereafter on the first da of recess contradicts what we understand to be the purpose of the recess appointments clause to keep important offices filled and the government functioning48 the decisions in allocco woodley and evans v stephens are additionally significant in that all three held that the presidents power under the recess ppointments clause extends to filling judicial vacancies on article iii courts49 thus attorneys general and courts have rejected na rrow interpretation of the provision and have adopted construc tion seen as necessary for contin uous and efficient operation of the government it can also be argued that the congress has acquiesced in this interpreta tion primarily through the passa ge of statutes discussed below that recognize the possibility of such appointments50 furthermore while congressional statements disputing the pr evailing interpretati on have been made during periods of controversy surrounding r ecess appointments such statements have been made by individual members of the senatebut not the senate itself51 the recess of the senate another question that emerged later was the meaning of the phrase the recess of the senate in the clause the first formal opinion on the subject was issued by attorney general knox in 1901 and conc luded that the phrase applied only to adjournments between sessions of congre ss commonly referred to as intersession recesses52 in reaching this determination knox placed significant weight on the use of the definite article the in the r ecess appointments clause

aspects of the recess appointment dynamic st ating that if the presid ents power of appointment is to be defeated because the senate takes an adjournment to specified date the painful and inevitable result will be measurably to prevent the exercise of governmental functions56 in support of this interp retation the attorney general cited the court of claims decision repudiat ed in the knox opinion as well as 1905 report of the senate judiciary committee that had been asked to examine the meaning of the term recess the report had concluded it was evidently intended by the framers of the constitution that it article ii sec 2 should mean something real not something imaginary something actual not something fictitious they used the word as the mass of mankind then understood it and now understand it it means in our judgment in this connection the period of time when the senate is not sitting in regular or extraordinary session as branch of th congress or in extraordinary session for the discharge of executive functions when its members owe duty of attendance when its chamber is empty when because of its absence it can not receive communications from the president or participate as body in making appointments this is essentially proviso to the provision relative to appointments by and with the advice and consent of the senate it was carefully devised so as to accomplish the purpose in view without in the slightest degree changing the policy of the constitution that such appointments are only to be made with the participation of the senate its sole purpose was to render it certain that at all times there should be whether the senate was in session or not an officer for every office entitled to discharge the duties thereof57 further emphasizing this functional pproach the daugherty opinion rejected the notion that this broader interpretati on would authorize intrasession appointments during brief adjournments declaring that an adjournment for 5 or even 10 days

legal counsel opinions have c ontinued to support the constitutionality of intrasession recess appointments with more r ecent pronouncements on the issue asserting that the clause encompasses all recesses in excess of three days60 it would appear that the pocket veto case kennedy v samspon has influenced at least to minor degree the view of the propriety of rece ss appointments during short recesses of the senate61 in kennedy the court struck down the exercise of the presidents pocket veto power during sixday intrase ssion recess of the congress the constitution provides that bill becomes law if not returned by the president after presentment within ten days unless the congress by their adjournment prevent its return in which case it shall not be law62 the case cast doubt on the validity of all intrasession poc ket vetoes not only those of s hort duration and presidents have since limited their pocket vetoes to periods between sessions or after congress has finally adjourned63 the department of justice while asserting the validity of recess appointment during 33 day intrasession r ecess neverthe less advised president carter that in view of the functional affinity between the pocket veto and recess appointment powers presidents dur ing recent years have been hesitant to make recess appointment s during intrasession r ecesses of the senate64 while the decision in kennedy appears to have moderated the use of the recess appointment power in some instances r ecent presidents have nonetheless made numerous appointments during short intrase ssion

ecess as short as the one in this case appointments to other offices offices or dinarily requiring senate confirmation have been made during intrasession recess of about this length or shorter furthermore several times in the past fairly short intrasession recesses have given rise to presidential appointments of judges to article iii courts66 while it did not specifically address i ntrasession recess appointments the 1905 senate judiciary co mmittee report mentioned above and relied on by attorney general daugherty in his 1921 opinion was prompted by what undoubtedly was the briefest recess ever relied on by president in order to make recess appointments at the moment the 58th congress 1st session ended at noon december 7 1903 and the 2nd session immediately began president th eodore roosevelt announced the recess appointment of over 160 mostly military fficers two of these appointees had previously held recess appoi ntments and were controvers ial officeholders taking action in accordance with the aforementioned position of attorney general knox rejecting the validity of in trasession recess appointments roosevelt construed the period between these sessions as constructive recess67 the 1905 senate judiciary committee report was issued fourteen months after this action and as is indicated by the quotation included above emphatica lly rejected roosevelts action it is important to note however that the repor t while expressing disapprobation of the presidents exercise of the recess appointment power in such manner could be interpreted as validating the execution of intrasession recess ppointments generally furthermore roosevelts acti ons could be viewed as pr actical manifestation of the potential infirmities of the knox interpretation that is to say if formalistic interpretation of the clause rests upon concern that allowing intrasession appointments will foster syst ematic avoidance of the nates advice and consent function the fact that president is ab to make such appointments during an instantaneous constructive recess of the senate would appear to belie such distinction68 alternatively it could be argued that this historically anomalous event is simply that and lends weight to the overall consideration of the matter the question of what constituted rece ss for purposes of the appointment power arose substantially later than the vacancy i ssue due to the fact that congress took few intrasession recesses other than brief holiday recesses until the advent of the

congress authority and tenure of recess appointees as fundamental matter it is important to note that confirmed appointee and recess appointee possess th same legal authority70 the commission of

congress could serve until the end of the second session which would likely be late in the following year73 the president may remove recess appointee before expiration of his term either by outright removal assuming he otherwise has discretionary re moval authority with respect to the office or by having another nominee confir med by the senate74 if the nomination of the person appoint ed during the recess is confirmed upon the reconvening of the sena it has been held that the new commission for the full statutory term commences from the date of the recess appointment in other words the full statutory term relates back to the date on which the person first assumed office by means of the recess appointment the determination of this question may also depend on the particular statutory

apparent that the issue of wh ether holdover provision constitutes vacancy for recess appointment purposes will hing on the specific language contained therein85 congressional action since the early history of the republic congress has established statutory framework designed to protect the senates constitutional role in the confirmation process for instance the federal vacanci reform act of 1998 which governs the filling of vacancies falling outside the sc ope of the recess appointments clause establishes which individuals may be designated by the president to temporarily perform the duties and functions of vacant office and the length of time designee may serve86 the original version of the vacancies act was enacted in 186887 and the legislative roots of such provisions can be traced back to 1795 enactment limiting the time temporary assignee could hold office to six months88 in 1863 congress attached rider to the fy1864 army appropriations act that was the forerunner of current statutory pr ovisions it prohibited the payment of money from the treasury to any person acting or assuming to act as an officer civil military or naval as salary in any office which is not authorized by some previously existing law unless where such office shall be subsequently sanc tioned by law and provided further that nor sh all any money be paid out of the treasury as salary to any person appointed during the recess of the senate to fill vacancy in any existing office which vacancy existed while the senate was in session and is by law required to be filled by and with the advice and consent of the senate until such appointee shall have been confirmed by the senate89 under this language an officer might have to serve without pay relying on savings or loans until such time as the

the nate was in session could not be filled by recess appointment91 other members noted that contrary opinions existed on the subject elaboratin g on the intent of the provision senator fessenden stated it may not be in our power to prevent the appointment but it is in our power to prevent the payment and when payment is prevented i think that will probably put an end to the hab it of making such appointments92 these provisions were followed by the passage of the tenure of office act in 1867 which contained number of restrictions on the pr esidents appointment and removal powers93 section 2 of the act purporte d to limit the presidents power to suspend officers during recess to inst ances where it was determined to the satisfaction of the president that an offi cer was guilty of misc onduct in office crime or was incapable or legally disqualified to hold office such removals were to be reported to the senate afte r it reconvened and in the event that the senate did not concur with the suspension such officer so suspended was to resume the functions of his office94 section 3 of the act pur ported to limit the presidents authority to make recess appoi ntments providing that such an appointment could be made only if the vacancy occurred by death or resignation if recess ppointees nomination was not thereafter confirmed in the next session of the senate the office was to remain in abeyance95 the act also delineated criminal penalties and cutoff of salary for violations of its provisi ons president andrew johnson ignored the provisions of the act in removing secretary of wa r edwin stanton from office precipitating his impeachment96 congress amended the act in 186997 and ultimately repealed the provisions entirely in 188798 similar limits on the presidents removal power were struck down as uncons titutional in the 1926 decision of myers v united states with the court stating we have hesitation in holding that the tenure of office act of 1867 in so far as it attempte d to prevent the president from removing executive officers who had been appointed by him by and with the advice and consent of the senate was i nvalid and that subsequent gislation of the same effect

the flat prohibition making it less burdensome on offi ceholders codified at 5 usc 5503 it currently establishes that if vacancy existed while the nate was in session person subsequently appointed to that position during recess may not receive his salary until he is confirmed by the senate exceptions to this payment prohibition are provided 1 for appointees to vacancies that arise within 30 days of the recess 2 for appointees to an offi ce for which nomination was pending at the time of the recess so long as the nomination is not of an individual appointed during the preceding recess of the senate and 3 for appointees selected to an office where nomination had been made but rejected by the senate within 30 days of the recess and the appointee was not th individual so rejected100 section 5503b provides that nomination to fill vacancy falling within any of the aforementioned exceptions must be submitted to the senate not later than 40 days after the beginning of the next session of the senate put more succinctly recess appointee to vacancy existing while the senate was in session can receive salary pending senate confirmation of his nomination if 1 the vacancy arose within 30 days befo re the end of the session 2 nomination for the office other than the nomination of person appointed during the preceding recess was pending at the nd of the session or 3 if nomination for the office was rejected within 30 days of the end of th session and person other than the rejected nominee receives the recess appointment th exceptions were designed as stated in house report accompanying the act to render the existing prohibition on the payment of salaries more flexible101 the report further explained that from practical standpoint it frequently creates difficu lties especially in those cases in which vacancy arose shortly before the cl ose of congressional session leaving insufficient time to fill the vacancy by mination and confirmation difficulties also arise in cases in which session terminates before the senate acts on pending nominations as has at times happened102 it is interesting to note that the term session as used in 5503 refers to any time the senate convene s and as such does not have the same meaning as employed in the recess appointment clause the version of this law preceding 5503 used the phrase termination of the session as opposed to the phrase end of the session which now appears in 5503a1 this revision was not intended as substantive change however103 the termination phrase was interpreted by the comptroller general to encompass any adjournment wh ether final or not in contemplation of recess covering substantial period of time104 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33009crs16 105 see eg pl 108447 div h sec 609 118 stat 3274 106 see

limitation has been included in all treasury and genera l governmental appropriations acts for over 60 years that prohibits the payment of any recess appointee whose nomination has been voted down by the senate105 the argument is sometimes forwarded that the service of recess appointee who falls under one of the aforementioned pay restrictions is barred by 31 usc 1342106 that provision states that an officer or employee of the united states government or of the district of columbia government may not accept voluntary services for either government or employ personal services exceeding that authorized by law except for emergencies involving th safety of human life or the protection of property the prohibition codified at 1342 was enacted in response to practice common late in the nineteenth cent ury under which lower grade government employees were asked to volunteer their services for overtime work and agencies subsequently requested dditional appropriations fro m congress to pay them107 because the voluntary services prohib ition is designed to prevent federal agencies from seeking additional appropr iations interpreta tions of 1342 have concluded that although the section prohibits federal entities from accepting voluntary services it does not prohibit acceptance of gratuitous services for which future claim for compensation will be made108 pursuant to this distinction the government accountability office gao s ruled that compensation that is not fixed by statute may be waived so long as the waiver renders any service gratuitous conversely gao has ruled that compensati on that is fixed by statute may not be waived and deemed gratuitous w ithout specific statutory authority109 while 1342 may be controllin g with regard to the general service of officers and employees of the united states there does not appear to be any basis for its application to recess appointees who ar statutorily barred from receiving pay irrespective of whether the position at issue carries discretionary or fixed rate of pay as fundamental matter the pres idents recess appointment power including the power to make recess ppointments arises from the text of the constitution accordingly it is difficult to formulate rationale that would support the conclusion that congressional enactment may preven t the service of recess appointee who falls within one of the aforementioned prohibitions on payment additionally it should be noted that the aforementione d pay proscriptions themselves clearlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33009crs17 110 the gao has relied upon this dynamic in determining that the voluntary services prohibition does not preclude the service of recess appointee falling within the pay proscriptions codified at 5503 even in in stances where the compensation of the position in question is fixed by statute addressing the recess appointment of sam fox to serve as ambassador to belgium under circumstances triggering 5503 payment prohibition the gao noted that while the rate of compensation for such position is set by statute the department of state may allow him to serv without compensation despite the voluntary services prohibition of the antideficiency act because mr foxs service would not result in coercive deficiency or subsequent claim against the government which was the original justification behind the prohibition mr fox could not make such claim because of the statutory bar of section 5503 government accountability office recess appointment of sam fox b309301 at 78 june 8 2007 the gao further stated that an alternative

their purvi ew will continue to serve further obviating the application of 1342110 the provisions governing recess appoin tments are designed to protect the senates advice and consent function by confining the recess appointment power of the president by targeting the compensation of appointees as opposed to the presidents recess appointment power itself these limitations act as indirect controls on recess appointments and their constituti onality has not been adjudicated the court in staebler v carter noted in dicta that if any and all restrictions on the presidents recess appointment power however limited are prohibited by the constitution 5 usc 5503might also be invalid111 additional constitutional concerns might arise from the application of these provisions to judicial recess appointees112 attorneys general have consistently advised presidents of the applicability of the pay restriction statut without raising constitutional concerns113 the scope of the decision in evans could be seen as lending credence to the concerns raised in staebler as touched upon above the eleventh circuit in evans upheld the intrasession recess appointment of william h pr yor to that court based upon broad interpretation of the pres idents authority under the clause114 the courts decision was accompanied by dissent from judge barkett arguing that literal and restrictive interp retation of the clause was necessitated by the real concrete concern that th understanding of the rece ss appointment power embraced by the majority will allow the president to repeatedly bypass the role the framers intended the senate to play in reviewing presidential nominees115 accordingly the majoritys acceptance of brief intrasessi on recess appointments coupled with the potential constitutional invalidity of the stat utory restrictions noted above could give rise to dynamic whereby the president would have legal and constitutional basis upon which to completely

of abling an appointee to serve throughout the course of an administration without sub mitting to the senate confirmation process116 the development of such dynamic is pl ausible in light of the decisions in staebler and evans and could arguably transform the recess appointments clause from the supplementary and auxiliary mechanis m discussed by hamilton into more significant grant of presidential power in addition to the aforementioned st atutory provisions congress has also attempted to influence pres idential action in the recess appointment context through resolutions resolutions objecting to ma disons appointments of envoys to great britain were debated in 1814 but not brought to vote117 it is arguable that sense of the senate resolution enacted in 1960 expressing reservation over recess appointments to the supreme court has influe nced presidential exercise of the recess appointment power in the judicial context118 prompted by president eisenhowers recess appointments of earl warren william j brennan jr and potter stewart to the supreme court in 1953 1956 and 1958 re spectively senator hart introduced sres 334 to discourage such appointments the resolution provided that it was the sense of the senate that this type of recess appointment i s not wholly consistent with the best interests of the supreme cour t the nominee who may be involved the litigants before the court nor indeed the people of the united states the resolution further announced the position that such appointments should be avoided except under unusual and urgent circumstances119 recess appointments to the supreme court have been made since the enactment of this resolution and there has been an attendant decrease in the number of judici recess appointments generally with only four such appointments occurring since 1960 however as is indicated by the decision in evans the use of the recess appointment power in the judicial context remains contentious issue conclusion while generally perceived as straig htforward pragmatic provision designed to foster administrative continuity the history of the recess appointments clause shows that it has also been employed by presidents for political purposes throughout the history of the republic as such th clause has been the source of recurrent controversy beginning with the admin istration of george washington and continuing to the current administra tion of george w bush historical interpretation and judicial treatment of the clause have fleshed out many of its inherent ambiguities to the extent th at there is now precedent supporting the propriety of such appointme nts irrespective of when th vacancy at issue arose likewise precedent has been established to support recess appoi ntments during bothhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33009crs19 intersession and brief intrasession rece sses however many tensions remain regarding the proper scope nd application of the clause these tensions coupled with the lack of any definitive consideration by the supreme court would thus seem to ensure that the clause will continue to be the source of political and legal controversy
