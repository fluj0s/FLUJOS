heniff jr analyst in american national government government and finance division summary during the 106th congress several proposals have been introduced to provide off budget status to certain trust funds and other special funds in which revenues are collected for specified purposes these proposals would prohibit the receipts and disbursements of the funds from being counted as new budget authority outlays receipts or deficit or surplus for purposes of the presidents budget the congressional budget or the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 proponents argue that taking fund off budget provides an assurance that the federal government is fulfilling its contract with taxpayers by ensuring the collected receipts will be used for the dedicated purpose rather than for general government activities opponents argue that removing fund from the unified budget would free its transactions from statutory and congressional budget enforcement procedures thereby weakening budget controls and limiting the ability of the president and congress to make tradeoffs between all possible government priorities background prior to 1968 the federal budget was represented by three competing measures of federal financial activities the administrative budget the national income accounts budget and the consolidated cash budget the federal government did not have single presentation of its annual budget and the most frequently used one the administrative budget did not encompass the full range of federal financial activities only the revenues and expenditures from federal fund transactions were included all trustfund transactions were excluded from the administrative budget as trustfund activities increased the existing budget presentations were seen as inadequate in representing the full impact of federal government financial activities on the national economy the 1967 report of the presidents commission on budget concepts stated that the budget should as general rule be comprehensive of the full range ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20350crs2 1report of the presidents commission on budget concepts washington gpo october 1967 p 25 2the president may present the budget in such form and detail as he may determine under the authority granted by the budget and accounting act of 1921 however excluding an entity from the congressional budget process and sequestration process requires statutefederal activities1 the commission recommended unified budget consolidating the revenues and expenditures from both federal and trust funds in 1968 president lyndon b johnson adopted the unified budget for his fy1969 budget submission to congress and every president since then has used the unified budget initially the unified budget excluded only the board of governors of the federal reserve system the exchange stabilization fund and governmentsponsored enterprises which are privately owned by the early 1980s however several additional government entities had received offbudget status usually by statute2 in 1984 for example seven federal entities were off budget federal financing bank rural electrification administration and rural telephone bank strategic petroleum reserve account united states synthetic fuels corporation united states railway associa tion board of governors of the federal reserve system and us postal service in addition the social security and hospital insurance ie medicare part trust funds were scheduled to go off budget beginning with fy1993 this increase in offbudget entities prompted review of the budgetary treatment of these federal activities by the task force on the budget process of the house committee on rules the socalled beilenson task force named after its chair representative anthony beilenson the task force recommended that all off budget entities and those entities scheduled to go off budget be placed back on budget the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the us postal service were to be partially excluded because of their independent status although the proposed legislation resulting from the work of the task force was not enacted into law several of its recommendations were incorporated into the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 title ii of pl 99177 99 stat 10381101 in particular the 1985 balanced budget act required that the existing off budget entities be included in the presidents budget and the congressional budget the board of governors of the federal reserve system and governmentsponsored enterprises remained off budget in addition the offbudget status of the federal oldage and survivors insurance trust fund and the federal disability insurance trust fund commonly referred to as the social security trust funds was accelerated to begin with the fy1986 budget the offbudget status of these trust funds is discussed below current offbudget federal entities currently there are two federal entities off budget the social security trust funds and the postal service fund both were initially included in the unified budget beginning in fy1969 congress removed these entities from the budget generally to provide assurance that changes in the social security program and us postal service operations were not made on the basis of budgetary considerations social security trust funds like other trust funds the social security trust funds were incorporated into the unified budget beginning in 1968 so as to present the full rangehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20350crs3 sec 13301 offbudget status of oasdi trust

the 1985 balanced budget act see 99 stat 10931094 accelerated this process by providing that the receipts and expenditures from the social security trust funds be removed from the presidents budget

any sequestration the 1990 budget enforcement act title xiii of pl 101508 104 stat 1388573 through 630 specifically 104 stat 1388623 reaffirmed the offbudget status of the social security trust funds

against offbudget status the current proposals to provide offbudge t status to additional funds generally follow the 1990 budget enforcement act language that reaffirmed the offbudget status of the social security trust funds all the offbudget proposals would prohibit funds receipts and disbursements from being counted as new budget authority outlays receipts or deficit or surplus for purposes of the presidents budget the congressional budget or the balanced budget act of 1985 under these terms offbudget status would effectively free the receipts and expenditures of fund from pointoforder controls under the congressional budget act of 1974 and the discretionary spending limits and payasyou go rules under the 1985 balanced budget act in addition most of the current proposals would exempt funds expenditures from any general budget limitation imposed by statute on budget outlays this latter provision would protect the funds expenditures from any other spending limitations the president and congress may adopt in the future proponents argue that dedicated fund in the budget particularly trust fund represents contract with taxpayers that the money will be spent on its intended purpose and not on other government activities taking fund off budget provides an assurance that the president and congress will fulfill that contract by removing any incentive to spend less on the funds intended purpose in order to spend more on other government activities moreover citing the 1967 report of the presid ents commission on budget concepts proponents argue that providing offbudget status allows the identity and integrity of trust fund transactions and balances to be preserved4 because actual spending for some trust funds usually does not match revenues during fiscal year proponents further argue that including these trust fund balances in the unified budget either understates the true size of the budget deficit or overstates the true size of the budget surplus excluding funds transactions from the budget totals would provide an incentive to match more closely funds income and spending while offbudget status frees the revenues and disbursements of these funds from statutory and congressional controls under the 1974 congressional budget act and the 1985 balanced budget act supporters argue that more appropriat control on fund spending is the amount of revenue dedicated to the fund as long as spending does not exceed the dedicated revenues they argue that funds transactions do not contribute to any budget deficit opponents of offbudget proposals on the other hand reaffirm the argument made for unified budget by the presidents commission on budget concepts in 1967 they argue that the federal budget should include the full range of government activities regardless of whether any certain activity is financed through trust fund or the general fundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20350crs5 5in fy1997 there were over 100 trust funds for more

office of management and budget budget of the united states government fy2000 analytical perspectives washington gpo february 1999 pp 335350 6the argument to take the aviation trust fund off budget is similar to those put forward for other transportation trust funds for further discussion on the budgetary treatment of transportation trust funds see crs report 9863 transp ortation trust funds budgetary treatment by john w fischer for more specific information on the aviation trust fund see crs report rs20177 airport and airway trust fund issues in the 106th congress by john w fischeropponents further argue that offbudget status provides these funds with preferential treatment in the budget process offbudget programs would be protected from the statutory and congressional budget enforcement procedures while onbudget programs would remain constrained by the existing fiscally tight controls this unequal treatment effectively weakens budget enforcement and restricts the flexibility of decision makers to make tradeoffs between all government activities when deciding priorities finally opponents have noted that the federal budget consists of numerous trust and special funds5 if offbudget status is provided to certain funds then the incentive will exist to provide it to the remaining funds that have dedicated purpose opponents argue that if this were to occur congress would further reduce its ability to control the size of the budget and the deficit or surplus and ultimately the size of the federal government proposals providing offbudget status in the 106th congress several measures have been introduced in the 106th congress to provide offbudget status to certain trust funds and special funds including the airport and airway trust fund the nuclear waste fund the inland waterways trust fund the harbor maintenance trust fund and several new and existing special funds for conservation activities so far during the 106th congress one proposal taking
