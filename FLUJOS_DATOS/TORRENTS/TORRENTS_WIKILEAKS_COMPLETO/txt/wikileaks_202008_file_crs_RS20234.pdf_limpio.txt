specifically defined type of bill or resolution 1 for example house and senate consideration of budget resolutions and reconciliation bills are governed by fasttr ack procedures congress includes expedited procedures in bills that are enacted into lawthe congressional budget act as amended and the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act for exampleinstead of adopting them as part of the standing rules of the house or senate however these procedures have the same force and effect that they would have if they were incorporated in the standing rules of the house or senate for more information on legislative process see httpwwwcrsgovproductsguidesguidehomeshtml the regular legislative procedures of the house and senate can be timeconsuming and they provide guarantee that every bill or resolution that is introduced will be considered quickly or at all in committee and on the floor in fact most bills are never considered and only small fraction are passed by the house and senate and enacted into law most of the time most representatives and senators consider the slow and selective nature of the legislative process to be virtue in that it protects against enactment of new laws without adequate scrutiny and debate members sometimes decide in advance that it will be important for congress to act expeditiously on certain kinds of measures in these cases members devise special procedures that put those measures on legislative fast track and that protect them from being blocked or unduly delayed by the procedural obstacles that prevent most measures from completing all the stages of the legislative process in addition to the budget measures mentioned above other kinds of bills and resolutions that 1 this report was originally written by stanley

include resolutions relating to the use of us armed forces under the war powers act and measures to implement international trade agreements under the trade act of 1974 as amended other laws give congress limited opportunity to disapprove some action that an executive branch official has taken or proposes to takeperhaps within 30 or 60 daysby passing joint resolution of disapproval the house rules and manual includes the texts of expedited procedures applicable to the house in the section on congressional disapproval provisions2 fasttrack procedures often include some or all of the following elements definition of the kinds of bills or resolutions to which the expedited procedures are to apply mandatory introduction of such measure often promptly after the house and senate receive message that the president is required to submit requirement for the committee to which the measure is referred to report it within certain number of days provision for automatic discharge of committee or for privileged motion to discharge if the measure is not reported within specified time privileged access for the measure to the house and senate floor for consideration limitations on the length of time that each house can debate or consider the measure on the floor prohibitions against members proposing floor amendments to the measure and offering certain other motions during its consideration and automatic hookup procedures that ensure prompt floor action in either house on any companion bill or resolution that the other house has passed not all expedited procedures include all these elements for example congress has enacted fast track procedures that provide for expedited floor consideration of certain measures but only if the committees to which those measures are referred choose to report them in other cases fasttrack procedures are more likely to promote prompt committee and floor action in one house than in the other in general expedited procedures that fail to include one or more of these elements leave opportunities for delay or inaction in one or both hous for instance if fasttrack procedures do not bar all amendments to the measure in committee and on the floor there is way to guarantee that the house and senate will reach final agreement on the text of that measure and that it will reach the president for possible enactment into law 2 available
