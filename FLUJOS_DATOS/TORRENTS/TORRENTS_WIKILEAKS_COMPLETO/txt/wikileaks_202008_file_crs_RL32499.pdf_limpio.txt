responsible for the content of their respective reports and through charities and indicates that charities with significant saudi government sponsorship such as the haramain islamic foundation may have diverted funding to qaeda for mo re on this subject see action against questionable charity below specifically the report describes bin dens use of the golden chain an informal financial network of prominen t saudi and gulf i ndividuals originally established to support the antisoviet af ghan resistance movement in the 1980s us officials state that this network collected funds and funneled them to arab fighters in afghanistan and later to qaeda using charities and other non governmental organizations5 according to the commissions report saudi individuals and other financie rs associated with the golden chain enabled bin laden and qaeda to replace lost financial asse ts and establish base in afghanistan following their abrupt departure fro m sudan in 1996 these activities were facilitated in part the report argues by the extreme religious views that exist within saudi arabia and the fact that until recently saudi charities were subject to very limited oversight although the report highlights series of unsuccessful us government efforts to gain access to senior qaeda financial operative who had been detained by saudi arabia in 1997 the report credits th saudi government with assisting us officials in interviewing members of the bin laden family in 1999 and 2000 the report argues that these meetings were inte gral to us efforts to understand the role of bin ladens personal wealth in the fina ncing of qaeda as result of this assistance us officials learned that saudi governme nt actions in the early 1990s had in effect divested bin laden of his share of the bin laden family fortune leading qaeda to rely thereafter on core gr oup of financial facilita tors based in the persian gulf and par ticularly in saudi arabia for funding the report also credits saudi government actions following the may 2003 bombings in riyadh which apparently reduced the funds availabl to qaeda perhaps drastically council on foreign relations studies6 an independent task force

unds flow through saudi arabia washington post october 16 2002task forces october 2002 report strongly criticized what it asserted was saudi financial support for intern ational terrorist groups fo r example the report stated both in its summary and in the main body for years individuals and charities based in saudi arabia have been the most important s ource of funds for qaeda and for years saudi officials have turned blind eye to this problem the authors argued that connection between saudi donor s and qaeda is logical for several reasons saudi arabia possesses the greatest concen tration of wealth in the region saudi nationals and charities were previously th most important sources of funds for the mujahideen fighters against the soviet occupation in afghanistan saudi nationals have always constituted disp roportionate percentage of qaedas own membership and qaedas political message has long focused on issues of particular interest to saudi nationals especially those who are disenchanted with their own government emphasis added the report grouped saudi arabia with pakistan egypt and other gulf states and regional financial centers as source and transit countries implying that donations to terrorist causes not only originate in th countries but also that donations from other countries pass through them rout to terrorist organizations the saudi government responded by charging that th reports allegations were based on false and inconclusive information7 treasury department spokesperson reportedly described the report as seriously flawed because in the departments opinion it did not describe new initiatives to combat terrorist financing adequately8 the task forces second report releas ed in june 2004 updates the first report and chronicles the steps the saudi arabian government had taken to strengthen its financial legal and regulatory systems and to combat terrorist financing since late 2002 the report acknowledged the saudi governments announcement of the enactment or promulgation of profusi on of new laws and regulations and the creation of new institutional arrangements intended to tighten controls over the principal modalities of terrorist financing the report welcomed the steps and concluded that on comparative basis sa udi arabia had taken more decisive legal and regulatory action to combat terrorist financing than many other muslim states the second report also identif ied several areas in whic h its authors argued that saudi authorities could ve done more to combat terrorist financing it argued that additional action was essential because of the funda mental centrality that persons and organizations based in saudi arabia have had in financing militant islamist groups on global basis the report cited lack of publicly
