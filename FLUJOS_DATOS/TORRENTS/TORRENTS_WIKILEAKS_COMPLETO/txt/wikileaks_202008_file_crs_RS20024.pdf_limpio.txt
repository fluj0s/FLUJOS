conflict recently in buckley v american constitutional law foundation inc t alclarifying the debate by analyzing various provisions of colorado laws regulatin g initiative petitions it is well established proposition that the first amendment affords the broades t protection to political expression in order to assure the unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social cha nges desired by the people at the same1 time however it is widely accepted that states possess the needed authority to enac t reasonab regulations of the electoral process in order to avoid campaign relate d disorder these two lines of leg thought have come into increasing conflict due to state2 attempts to regulate the electoral process and petitioninitiatives in particular while the supreme court has always protected first amendment rights regarding politica l expression staunchly prior decis ions related mainly to areas of pure speech offering little certainty as to how these rights would be interpreted in light of states interest i n preserving the integrity of its electoral processeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20024crs2 buckley v american constitutional law foundation inc

burden politica l expression 9 the court then cons idered the requirement that all petition circulators be registered voters the state of colorado asserted that this requirement was necessary in that i t demonstra ted circulators commitment to the lawmaking process in colorado an d allowed for more efficient verification of circulators residential address competin g with colorados assertion was the proposition that the requirement had th unconstitutional ffect of reducing the number of circulators paid or volunteer available to circulate petitions statistical evidence adduced at the district court level established that roughly 400000 eligible voters were not registered and further testimony indicated that significant n umber of circulators fell into this category despite this evidence the10 district court determined that since the registration requirement had been establishe d through referendum approved by the citizens of colorad the provision was not subject to judicial review the tenth circuit disagreed with this position ruling that laws passed by ballot stood on the same constitutional ground as those pass ed by traditional legislation subsequently the court held that the registration requirement was unconstitutional in that it excluded nonregistered individuals from participating in core political speech11 the supreme court greed with the tenth circuits holding stating that by limiting the number of individuals capable of communicating proponen ts message the regulation restricted speech in much the same fashion as was the case in meyer v grant one12 prong of colorados argument centered on the assertion that due to the ease f registering the regulations limitations on speech should be tolerated the court rejected this argum ent noting that the choice to remain unregistered served as form of political thought and expression for some individuals colorado next argued that the regulation13 should be permitted due to the states int erest in assuring that all circulators are subject to the subpoe na power of the secretary of state the court also found this argumen t unpersua sive noting that colo rev stat 1401112 requiring that each circulato r disclose his r her name and address satisfied this interest in light of these factors the14 court ruled that none of colorados asserted interests were sufficient to justify the ensuing limits on speech caused by the regulation the next point of contention between the parties wa s the requirement that circulators wear identification badges while collecting signatures colorado argued that the badg requirement was justified in that it was necessary to combat instances of fraud and libel in the petitioning process and to enable citizens to identify circulators engaging in suc h improper behavior aclf on the other nd pointed to evidence showing that the badgehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20024crs4 id at 815 talley 362 us 60 196016 mcintyre 514 us 334 199517 see timmons v twin ci ties area

circulators from participating in t he initiative process due to fears of persecution stemming from the advocacy of controversial causes15 in dealing with this issue the supreme court was faced with conflict between states regulatory interest in the electoral process on one hand and the first amendment right to anonymous political expression on the other the court previously had decided cases which established strong right to anonymous political speech such as talley v california which dictated that ban on all anony mous leafleting was violative of the first amendme nt this ruling had been extended to encompass anonymous speech in th e16 electoral context in mcintyre v ohio elections commn however the court d17 established general rule recognizing state power to regulate elections and ballot access and noted in mcintyre that limited identification requirement might be permissible in given instance 18 at the appellate level the tenth circuit gave great weight t prior cases dealing with the right to anonymous political sp eech ultimately concluding that the badge requirement was unconstitutional specifically the tenth circuit found that by requiring circulators19 to reveal their identities at the exact moment of speech the regulation stripped them f their right to anonym ous political expression at time when reaction to the message is at its most immediate and unreasoned such severe infringement was deemed untenable particularly in light of the aff idavit requirement of 1401112 which the tenth circuit deemed sufficient to serve colorados asserted regulatory interests20 the supreme court agreed with this determination focusing its analysis on th similarit ies between the case at hand and mcintyre v ohio elections commn in mcintyre the court had previously ruled that prohibition on the distribution f anonymou s campaign literature was violative of the first amendment in comparin g21 mcin tyre to the present case the supreme court agreed with the tenth circuit s determination that the circulation of petition was similar to h andbill distribution stressing that both activities involve direct communication howev er the supreme court went even further stating that the restraint imposed by the badge requirement was even more severe in that petition circulators engage in more intensive interchange with citizens thereb increasing the chances of conflict this factor led in large part to the courts conclusion that the injury to speech is heightened for the petition circulator because the badg requirement compels personal name identification at the precise moment when th circulators interest in anonymity is greatest as such the court ruled that the badg e22httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20024crs5 id 23 american constitutional law foundation inc et v meyer 120

mcintyre23 the next regulation addressed by the court was the requirement that monthly an d final reports be submitted to the secr etary of state disclosing the names and addresses of all paid cir culators the amount paid per signature and the total amount paid to eac h circulator colorado argued that these disclosures w ere necessary to apprise the electorate of whethe r particular initiative possessed grass roots support and to discourage fraud aclf on the other hand maintained that these provisions had chilling effect on fre speech by denying paid circulators the anonymity afforded to volunteers 24 at the appellate level the tenth circuit invalidated the final report provisions which required disclosure of personall specific information leaving intact provisions calling for the disclosure of the amount paid per petition signature regarding the monthl disclosures the tenth circuit invalidated provisions calling for the disclosure of the names and addresses of and amounts disbursed and owed to paid circulators 25 in its disposition of the issue the supreme court discussed its decision in buckley v valeo dealing with compelled disclosure of campaign related expenditures specifically the court reiterated that disclosure of certain campaign related spending may be required as it provides the electorate with information on the sources and targets of politica l campaign money furthermore the court also recognized that such disclosures dete r corruption and the appearance of impropriety in the campaign context applying these26 factors however the court agreed with the tenth circuits determination that th compelled disclosures of personal information were unconstitutional 27 specifically the supreme court affirmed the tenth circuits holding that wherea s buckley provided for disclosure regarding the so urces of campaign money meeting certain monetary thresholds the provisions of 140121 required disclosure of payments t payees regardless of the amount involved furthermore the court ruled that many of the concerns deemed sufficient to justify the disclosure provisions in buckley did not adhere in the present case the court found it dispositive for instance that 140121 did t regulate candidate electi ons and that the risk of corruption so prevalent in such elections was minimal in the initiative context the court also state d that the disclosure provisions28 which remained in place more than satisfied the goals delineated in buckley by informing voters of the source an d amount of money spent by initiative proponents based on these factors the supreme court determined that constitutional interests in fostering political debate on initiative issues outweighed colorados regulatory arguments29httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20024crs6 id 30 id 31upon completing its review of th regulations at issue the supreme court identified other provisions of colorados initiative and referendum act which it concluded met the states substantial inter ests in regulating the ballotinitiative process pertaining to the30 states avowe d interest in combating fraud and corruption the court referred to statutes criminalizing the forgery of initia tive petition signatures and providing for the invalidation of any portion of an initiativepetition secti on tainted by circulator violation as well as the states ability to identify those paying circulators furthermore the court noted tha t colorados interest in ensuring grass roots support for any proposal would be met by the requirement that petition contain valid signatures comprising five percent of the tota l votes cast for secretary of state in the previous election finally the court explained that colorado had established several measures to aid the fficiency veracity and clarity of the initiativepetition process31
