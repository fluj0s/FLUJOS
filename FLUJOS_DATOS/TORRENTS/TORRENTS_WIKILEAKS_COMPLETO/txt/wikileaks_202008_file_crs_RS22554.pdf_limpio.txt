the indian child welfare act icwa2 in 1978 to address the high rate of separation of indian children from their homes and cultural environments3 prior to 1978 as many as 25 to 35 percent of the indian children in some states were removed from their homes and placed in nonindian homes4 this practice of removal fragmented families and threatened the continued survival of native american tribes respect for the selfdetermination of tribes required in the view of congress that tribes be given greater say in decisions affecting indian children 5 in evaluating the perceived biases of state agencies the house report accompanying the legislation cited the apparent inability of social workers to accord proper recognition to factors in indian environments that tended to mitigate the severe economic deprivations found on many reservations deprivations that often served as basis for state agency neglect findings6 the legislative history also indicated that indian parents often lacked adequate legal representation in child custody proceedings and were frequently co erced into voluntary waivers of their parental rights7 as result addressing the situation was thought to require both procedural and substantive components to promote policy of stability and security for indian tribes and families while also ensuring that the foster and adoptive homes of indian children reflected the unique values of indian culture 8 g5g152g159g142g155g138g144g142g561 icwa applies to indian children involved in certain child custody proceedings for purposes of icwa an indian child is an unmarried individual under age 18 who is either member of federally recognized indian tribe or the biological child of member of tribe and eligible for membership in tribe 9 membership eligibility is evaluated

important elements of icwa are its jurisdictional provisions in enacting icwa congress recognized that indian tribes have distinct societal interests in the lives of indian children that can be distinguished from that of the parents in preserving these interests icwa both enhances the jurisdictional reach of tribal courts and provides right of intervention in state court proceedings that involve indian children 17 in part the act delineates areas of exclusive tribal jurisdiction and those of concurrent state and tribal jurisdiction

child who resides or is domiciled within the tribes land 18 indian tribes also have exclusive jurisdiction over indian children who are wards of tribal court that has previously exercised jurisdiction over their cases19 there are two exceptions to the grant of exclusive tribal jurisdiction tribal courts do not have jurisdiction where jurisdiction is otherwise vested in the state by existing federal

his parent or indian guardian in order to prevent imminent physical harm21 under icwa federal state and tribal courts must all afford full faith and credit to the orders and judgments of tribal court that has exercised jurisdiction in an indian child custody proceeding22 g5g152g151g140g158g155g155g142g151g157g561g12g158g155g146g156g141g146g140g157g146g152g151g561 in child custody proceedings involving indian children not residing or domiciled on the tribes land icwa confers concurrent jurisdiction on tribal and state courts 23 icwa expresses preference for tribal jurisdiction in child custody proceedings involving indian children as such state court proceedings that address foster care placement or termination of parental rights and involve indian children residing or domiciled off the reservation may be transferred to tribal courts this transfer shall take place upon the petition of either parent the indian custodian or the childs tribe unless one of the childs parents objects the tribal court declines jurisdiction or good cause to deny transfer exists 24 the first two exceptions present very little room for judicial analysis however the good cause exception is broader area of judicial interpretation guidelines issued by the department of the interior state that party opposing transfer to tribal court bears the burden of demonstrating good cause to deny transfer25 the guidelines also provide examples of what constitutes good cause26 g12g158g141g146g140g146g138g149g561g6g142g140g146g156g146g152g151g156g561 the only us supreme court case to address icwa dealt with the statutory construction of the acts domicile provision and how it was to be interpreted in mississippi band of choctaw indians v holyfield the supreme court determined that for purposes of icwa childs domicile at birth is that of his or her parents at the time of birth 27 in reaching this decision the court reasoned that the purpose of the statute indicated congressional intent to establish uniformity in the application of icwa instead of allowing varied state court definitions of key term to dictate icwa application thus the court held that an indian tribe had jurisdiction over twin baby girls whose parents took care to have the children born off the reservation in order to put the children up for adoption under state law state courts have developed different approaches to addressing general questions of icwa applicability and such other concerns as the grounds for invoking the good cause exception to transfer for example some state court judicial decisions scrutinize the level of contact between continued reservations under laws such as public law 280 25 usc 132125 public law 280 is the popular name of pl 83 280 as amended law conferring jurisdiction over activities in most of the indian country in specified states to state courts however in these circumstances 25 usc 1918 authorizes tribes to retake jurisdiction over child custody proceedings upon

courts engage in best interests of the child analysis in assessing possible reasons for transfer28 other courts have dealt with the issue of applying the judicially crafted existing indian family

the ability of tribes to strengthen and preserve indian families icwa not only enhances tribal jurisdiction but also provides comprehensive procedural protections for indian tribes parents and custodians throughout state court proceedings for example where state court knows or has reason to know at the outset of an involuntary custody proceeding that the child at issue is an indian child icwa requires that the party seeking termination of parental rights or foster care placement notify the childs parent or indian custodian and tribe 30 notice must be given at least ten days before the advancement of the state proceedings31 tribes must be notified of their unconditional right to intervene in the state court proceeding and their right to examine all relevant documents as well as their ability to obtain delay of the proceedings32 these provisions are all aimed at ensuring that parents custodians and tribes are aware of their rights under icwa and are given adequate time to exercise these rights additional provisions applicable in both voluntary and involuntary cases are also intended to ensure that indian parents custodians and tribes are not misled or coerced into losing their rights to rear indian children as such cases that proc eed in state courts are subject to number of procedural protections whether the proceeding is voluntary or involuntary voluntary proceedings consist of tribal member parents choosing termination of parental rights and adoption or foster care placement of their child involuntary proceeding s involve state attempts to terminate parental rights or place indian children in foster care tribes may intervene in both involuntary and voluntary proceedings also an indian childs trib parent indian custodian or an indian child who is the subject of an action for foster care placement or termination of parental rights under state law may seek to invalidate the action upon showing that the action violated icwa provisions33

before judge of court of appropriate jurisdiction the judge must certify that the consequences of the action to be undertaken are explained to the parent in language that the parent understands the
