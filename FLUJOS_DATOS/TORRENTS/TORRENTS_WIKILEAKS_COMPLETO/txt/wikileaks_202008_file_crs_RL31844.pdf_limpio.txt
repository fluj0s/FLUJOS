the 107th congress at the start of the 108th congress the united states was involved in an unprecedented number of trade negotiations it was meeting with over 140 countries on multilateral trade agreement under the wo rld trade organization it also was negotiating with 33 other countries in the western hemisphere to create free trade area of the americas and was near conclusion to freetrade agreements with chile and with singapore furthermore th administration had given notice that it intended to begin freetrade negotiations with the central american common market the southern african cust oms union morocco and australia these agreements if concluded are expected to be considered by the congress under provisions of major trade gislation enacted during the 107th congress that legislation the bipartisan trade prom otion authority act of 2002 pl 107210 provides that if the administration consu lts with congress and meets other specified conditions congress will vote on legislation to implement the trade agreements under limited debate and without amendmen t this arrangement between the executive and legislative branches is commonly called trade promotion authority tpa and was formerly known as fasttrack authority this report provides background on the orig in of tpafasttrack legislation trade agreements negotiated under such legisla tion in the past the lapse of legislation in 1994 and attempts at rene wal in the late 1990s the report follows tpafasttrack authority legislation as it developed during the 107th congress and includes action on trade agreements in the first months after enactment early presidential authority to cut tariffs the constitution gives congress the primary power over trade policy article 1 empowers congress to regulate commerce with foreign nations and to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excise s the president by virtue of his constitutional power to conduct foreign affairs has authority to negotiate and enter into agreements with foreign countries in cluding those dealing with trade and tariff policy the president however has constitutional authority to impose new tariff reached in trade agreement unless congress delegates that authority for 145 years congress exercised its power in trade policy through frequent enactment of tariff acts setting duty rates in detail for individual imports the highhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31844crs2 tariffs and economic depre ssion of the early 1930s however led to major change in the congressional and executive roles in ta riffsetting under th reciprocal trade agreements act of 1934 congress authorized the president to negotiate reciprocal reductions of tariffs with in limited range and time pe riod and to implement them by proclamation without the need for implementing legislation this delegation of tariffcutting author ity to the president was intended to encourage lower tariff levels since congress was elected by local interests that often benefitted from protection against imports there were incentives for keeping tariffs at high levels on the other hand because the president was accountable to broader constituency the president could negotiate reciprocal reductions in tariffs within the limits allowed without the local po litical liability faced by members for the next several decades congress extended the presidents tariffcutting authority number of times under this authority the president negotiated reductions in tariff levels multilaterally in five rounds under the general agreement on tariffs and trade and afterward procla imed the lower tariffs under the authority congress had delegated nontariff barriers and fasttrack authority the sixth round of multilateral trade ne gotiations called the kennedy round 196467 involved negotiations on nontariff as well as tariff barriers congress had extended presidential tariffcutting author ity for the kennedy round under the trade expansion act of 1 962 that author ity did not include negotiation of nontariff barriers nonetheless the administrati on negotiated agreements that involved two nontariff barriers 1 the am erican selling price asp which was relatively high us import valuation based on domestic producers prices that primarily protected the us chemical industry and 2 code or set of rules on antidumping although the 1962 act authorized as did the 1934 act the president to negotiate reduction of any existing duty or other import restri ction the view in congress at the time was that by entering into the antidumping agreement the president had overstepped his delegated power congre ss subsequently did not enact legislation to implement the two agreements and even approved opposing measures the decision by congress not to pprove the nontariff commitments made by the president showed that there was dilemma regarding ne gotiations on nontariff barriers nontariff barriers were becoming increasingly important in restricting trade since tariffs had been reduced in prior r ounds trading partners wanted assurance that us negotiators could reach deal with likelihood of approval back home us negotiators were concerned they would have credibility in future trade talks without some goahead by congress to negotiate on nontariff trade barriers in the early 1970s in anticipation of seventh round of mu ltilateral negotiations that was sure to include nontariff barriers president nixon submitted legislation for new type of negotiating authority the proposed legislation w ould have granted to him proclamation authority for nontariff barriers much like the previously granted authority for tariffs he proposed that he be able to reach nontariff agreementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31844crs3 submit it to congress and unless congress legislatively disapproved the agreement the president would put the changes into ffect by proclamation there would be need for implementing legislation the nixon proposal was passed by the house but died in the senate senate members and staff reached di fferent substantially new arrangement with the administration under this arra ngement which was endorsed by the house and enacted in the trade act of 1974 pl 93618 congress agreed to consider and vote on legislation to implement trade agreement negotiated by the president without amendment and with limited debate as long as the president met the conditions set out in the act the presid ent would have to c onsult with appropriate congressional committees before and during the negotiation and to notify congress at least 90 days before entering into the agreement the president also would have to submit implementing legislation statemen t of administrative ac tions to be taken to implement the agreement and reasons why the agreement served the interests of us commerce the arrangement in the 1974 act an assured vote by congress without amendment on bill to implement trade agreement on the condition that the president consulted with congress and took other required actions became commonly known as fasttrack authority at the time there was little controversy about the procedural restric tions that congress imposed on itself it was viewed that congress had already achieved an enlarged role in trade negotiations through consultation and notif ication requirements the negotiating authority in the 1974 act enabled the administration to negotiate the tokyo round of mu ltilateral trade negotiations 197479 after the round was completed when it was time to construct the impleme nting legislation senate staff argued that congress should have an active part in that process the result was that congress took draft bill th rough mock legisl ative process with committee consideration amendments and conference committee the president then submitted legislation ba sed on that final draft bill although not formally outlined in any document the executive and legislative branches thus agreed on process that allowed congre ssional involvement in craftin g legislation that would eventually be formally consid ered under expedited procedures the 1974 act granted fasttrack author ity to the president for agreements reached over the following 5 years th trade agreements act of 1979 pl 9639 extended the authority another eight years after brief lapse the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 pl 100418 renewed th presidents fasttrack authority for agreements reached throug h may 1993 the latter two years of that renewal were granted because the presiden t requested the additional two years and congress did not disapprove the 1988 ac t was subsequently amended pl 103 49 to extend fasttrack authority fo r uruguay round multilateral agreements r eached before april 16 1994 after that the presid ents trade negotiating authority expired fasttrack authority had been in strumental in the negotiation and implementation of five major trade agreements two of those five agreements were multilateral agreements reached during the tokyo round and the uruguay round negotiations in the gatt the other three agreements were bilateral and regional free trade agreements the usisrael free trade agreement which was negotiated with special authority in the trade nd tariff act of 1984 pl 98573 the ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31844crs4 canada free trade agreement and the north american free trade agreement agreement has been disapproved under fasttrack procedures stalemate on fasttrack renewal during the 104th congress 19951996 president clinton proposed an extension of fasttrack authority the presidents intent was to use the fasttrack authority to extend the north american free trade agreement to chile democrats supported the presidents proposal re publicansupported alternative hr 2371 was approved by the house ways and means committee the bill did not reach floor vote major reason why legislati on did not move forward was disagreement over inclusion of labor nd environmental issues major push to enact fasttrack legislation occurred during the 105th congress 19971998 in the first half of 1997 presid ent clinton did little on fasttrack bill because of attention to the budget and other priorities in spite of warnings from both democrats and republicans he waited until after bor day september 16 1997 to submit proposal to congress th proposal met with criticism neither democrats nor republicans supported how bor and the environment were treated in the proposal two weeks later on october 1 1997 th senate finance committee approved bill s 1269 by voice vote the bill did not include labor and the environment as principal objectives it did include th em in separate section under policy objectives but the finance committee stated in its bill report that those provisions were intended to encourage the president to develop initiatives outside of the context of trade agreements subject to fast track approval the bill stipulated that fasttrack procedures would apply to only certain ki nds of provisions in an implementing bill further limiting how labor and the environment could be addressed in early november the senate approved motion to proceed to floor consideration of s 1269 but paused to wait for the house to act meanwhile in the house on october 8 1997 the committee on ways and means approved hr 2621 which was similar to the b ill in the senate the committee vote was 2414 with only 4 of the 16 democrats on the committee voting for the bill house speaker gingrich set the floor vote for november 7 then delayed it to november 9 president clinton lobbi ed hard for democratic votes but was unsuccessful house speaker gingrich and president clinton agreed to hold off on the floor vote the following year on july 1 1998 the senate finance committee voted 182 to approve s 2400 comprehensive trade bill that included essentia lly the same fast track provisions that the committee had approved the year before together with other trade programs such as trade preferences for subsaharan africa and the caribbean and renewal of the generalized system of preferences s 2400 did not r each the senate floorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31844crs5 on july 23 1998 house speaker gingrich announced that vote would be scheduled on fasttrack bill hr 2621 that september president clinton and some democratic members opposed vote that cl ose to the november elections they wanted the vote postponed until the next ear some republicans claimed that the democrats did not want to vote for trade authority against their labor supporters democrats claimed that the republicans scheduled the vote to get agriculture and business support and to hurt the democr ats on september 25 1998 the house voted down fasttrack bill hr 2621 by vote of 180243 the vote was along strongly partisan lines during the 106th congress 19992000 there was little done on fasttrack renewal in 1999 the senate finance committee considered the idea of another omnibus trade bill with fast track provi sions but decided to split up the proposals and didnt act on fasttrack with th presidential election in 2000 there was virtually activity on fasttrack that year developments during the 107th congress the bush administration pursued fasttrack renewal from the start during his first state of the union address on febr uary 27 2001 president bush asked congress to give the strong hand of presiden tial trade promotion authority and to do so quickly the administration introduced th new phrase trade promotion authority or tpa to replace fasttrack authority and the two terms are now widely used interchangeably the president called tpa his top trade priority he said that he wanted tpa for new round of multilate ral trade talks in the world trade organization free trade area of the amer icas agreement and other regional and bilateral negotiations including free trad agreements with chile and singapore house approval of h r 3005 bipartisan trade authority act of 2001 major issue during the first session of the 107th congress was how labor and the environment should be treated in tr ade agreements some members supported fasttrack reauthorization but only with strong labor and nvironmental provisions that could be enforced with sanctions these provisions generally related to labor rights and environmenta l protection ot her members supported labor and environmental provisions but wanted the pr esident to have discretion to choose from toolbox of remedies to enforce thos provisions yet other members favored excluding labor and the environment completely and limiting the authority for fast track implementation to provisions that related strictly to removal of trade barriers there was clear partisan split of these views with democrats generally favoring labor and the environment as enforceab objectives and republicans generally favoring them in less important roles the administration and some members offered early proposals on may 10 2001 in his legislative agenda for interna tional trade president bush included labor rights and environmental protection as obj ectives but in ma nner consistent with us sovereignty and trade expansion he also included related actions among thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31844crs6 toolbox of actions that coul d be taken together with tr ade negotiations on may 24 2001 the house and senate new democrats applauded the presidents inclusion of labor and the environment but argued that the presidents plan was silent on the critical issue of appropriate mechanisms for enforcing trade agreements they said that labor and the environment shoul d have parity with the other negotiating objectives partisan differences continued on june 13 2001 representative crane chairman of the trade subcommittee of the house ways and means committee introduced hr 2149 with 61 original co sponsors all of whom were republican except one original democr atic cosponsor who later w ithdrew labor and the environment were not specifically included in any of the provisions of hr 2149 house democratic leader ge phardt said that the bill looks like another my way or the highway solution to problem few months later after the september 11th attack the administration promoted tpa as part of national security package some democrats strongly objected saying that the administration was unfairly suggesting that it was unpatriotic to oppose tpa on october 3 2001 representative thomas chairman of the house ways and means committee introduced hr 3005 bill to extend trade negotiating authority chairman thomas has worked with small number of democrats on the bill through the summer the democrats included representative dooley leader of the new democrats and representatives jefferson and tanner both on the ways and means committee the three democrats represen tative crane and representative dreier chairman of the house rules committee we re the original cosponsors although the bills title was entitled the bipartisan trade promotion authority act of 2001 many democrats charged that chairman thomas was not trying to build bipartisan consensus but was trying only to secure enough democrats to win passage in the house the day after chairman thomas introduced his bill democratic leaders submitted their own bill on october 4 representative rangel ranking member of the ways and means committee and representative levin ranking member of the ways and means subcommittee on trade released hr 3019 they said that there were key differences between hr 3019 and hr 3005 in the areas of labor standards environmental issues enfo rcement and the role of congress ways and means committee chairman t homas scheduled markup of hr 3005 for october 5 2001 the markup of tpa bill was postponed because of complaints by democratic committee members that more time was needed to debate key proposals the committee still met on octobe r 5 to markup other trade bills hr 3009 to extend andean trade preferences hr 3010 to reauthorize the generalized system of preferences and hr 3008 to reauthorize trade adjustment assistance taa the committee met on october 9 for markup of tpa legislation and on that day it defeated hr 3019 by 1226 vot and approved hr 3005 by 2613 vote hrept 107249 part 1 both votes were largely along party lines the legislation stalled after the committee vote house floor votes were repeatedly postponed president bush nd house speaker hastert conferred with house ways and means committee ranking member rangel but compromisehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31844crs7 resulted ways and means committee chairman thomas and ranking member rangel had angry exchanges the world trade organization ministerial conference took place in doha qatar in early november wit hout the president having tpa which he had wanted for that meeting on december 6 2001 the house approved hr 3005 by vote of 215214 along party lines 194 out of 221 republicans voted for the bill compared to 21 out of 211 democrats the version of hr 3005 considered and approved in the house had been amended in some significant ways under rules committee resolution hres 306 of note was lastminute d eal on the house floor between republican leadership and representatives from textile states that deal was outlined in letter from house republican leaders to representative demint it stated that trade bills would be brought to the house fl oor until the house approved provisions that us knit and woven fabrics must underg all dyeing finishing and printing procedures in the united states in order to qualify for caribbean or andean trade preferences senate approval of trade bill hr 3009 trade act of 2002 on december 12 the senate finance committee approved its version of hr 3005 on an 183 vote subject to further amendment the committee met again on december 18 rejected three am endments and ordered the b ill to be reported with an amendment in the nature of substitute srept 107139 the version of hr 3005 approved by the senate finance committee was similar to the housepassed version in most major respects but it did have some differences regarding negotiated changes to trade remedy law investorgovernme nt disputes and dispute panel action the controversy over labor nd the environment that was so heated in the house seemed to diminish as the tpa bill moved to the senate two other issues however became increasingly important trade adjustment assistance to help workers hurt by trade and trade remedy laws eg an tidumping and countervailing duty laws democrats in the senate wanted substantial taa benefits to be part of any tpa legislation considered on the senate floor finance committee chairman baucus and senate majority leader daschle cos ponsored s 1209 taa bill that included among its provisions 75 subsidy of hea lth care premiums for dislocated workers for up to year under the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act or cobra which allows workers to continue their coverage through the plans where they worked benefits for secondary worker s ie those supplying parts to an injured firm and assistance to farmers and fishermen the finance committee approved s 1209 on december 4 2001 bout week later at the start of the finance committee markup of tpa bill hr 3005 chairm an baucus said that if fast track was to be taken up on the floor he would use every legislative option at my disposal to ensure that taa and fast track are joined early in january 2002 majority leader daschle repeated that tpa renewa l would be linked to taa benefits for workers republicans in the senate did not n ecessarily oppose taatpa package but they expressed concern about the cost of the increased benefits in s 1209 they supported tax credit for workers to privat ely buy their own health care policies orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31844crs8 if not that then lower subsidy for hea lth care premiums or combination of tax credit and subsidy benefits for sec ondary workers and other changes from provisions in s 1209 they also opposed democratic proposal to use customs user fees to pay for increased taa benefits in addition to taa another major i ssue in the senate debate on tpa was protection of us trade reme dy laws some members of the senate especially those from steelproducing states wa nted provisions in tpa bill that assured us trade remedies would remain uncha nged under trade agreements they were furious that the us trade representative had agreed to include trade remedy reform on the negotiating agenda for the new wto round that agenda was t in doha qatar in november 2001 in march 2002 president bu sh imposed tariffs of up to 30 on most steel imports undoubtedly aware that he was using trade remedies to help domestic steel producers shortly before vote on tpa was expected in the senate tpa legislation was delayed in the sena for the early part of 2002 because of other legislative priorities and by partisan differences over taa provisions to accompany tpa finally at the end of april 2002 senate leadership pushed trade legislation forward on may 1 2002 the nate invoked cloture and agreed by 77 21 vote to proceed to consideration of th vehicle for trade package hr 3009 the house had passed hr 3009 on november 16 2001 as bill to reauthorize the andean trade preference act atpa and the senate finance committee had approved hr 3009 also as an andean trade preferences bill on december 14 2001 the senate was going to amend h r 3009 to add other trade

democratsupported taa provisions for workers that offered 73 refundable ta x credit for workers health care and controversial health care benefits for retired steelworkers legacy costs it also included the tpa and atpa language reported out of the senate finance committee republican senators opposed the daschle amendment and called its taa provisions partisan as debate on hr 3009 stalle d senate majority leader daschle said he would pull the bill if democrats and republicans couldnt reach an agreement on taa on may 9 2002 senators baucus and grassley the chairman and ranking member respectively of the senate fi nance committee announced they had reached major agreement on taa provisions th next day they introduced samdt 3401 as substitute to hr 3009 the baucus grassley amendment

amendment also included tpa atpa and 5year reauthorization of the generalized system of preferences gsp program number of amendments to the bauc usgrassley amendment were proposed and many were

an implementing trade bill that weakened us trade remedy law motion to table thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31844crs9 daytoncraig amendment was defeated 3861 and the amendment passed on voice vote supporters of the amendment cla imed that the amendment was necessary to ensure that us safeguards antidumpi ng and countervailing duty laws were not undermined during trade negotiations th bush administration strongly opposed the craigdayton amendment claiming that the amendment would tie the hands of us negotiators by restricting their ability to negotiate on may 23 2002 the senate approve d the baucusgrassley substitute amendment which included the dayton craig provision above by voice vote and approved hr 3009 as amended by the ba ucusgrassley substitute by 6630 vote tpa provisions

argued would strengthen the position of the house in the conference in departure from usual practice he recommended rule hres 450 to go to conference that essentially included language for new comprehensive trade bill he pushed for rule that included the houseapproved tpa bill new taa language significantly different from previously passed hr 3008 houseapproved reauthorization of andean trade preferences extension of the generalized system of preferences passed in house committee but not on the floor and other provisions almost all house democrats and some house republicans opposed the thomas rule some opponents said that because th thomas rule included new language that the house had not previously approved the rule bypassed the legislative process further according to some reports hous democrats opposed the broader language that was in the thomas rule because they wanted the higher taa benefits and stronger trade remedy protec tions in the senate version after some delay which democrats said reflected lack of support but republican leaders said was used to explain the rule the house rules committee reported out hres 450 hrept 107518 on june 19 2002 as reported hres 450 stated that upon its adoption the house shall be considered to have insisted on the provisions in the rule as an amendment to the senate amendment of hr 3009 in other words the language of the thomas rule would become the working document for house conferees several days later the house voted on hres 450 press reports suggested that the delay was needed to secure support for the measure
