forecasts and the budget summary outlays revenues and the federal budget surplus or deficit for given year depend on both economic performance and fis cal policy the budget surplus is outlays minus revenues for given fiscal year the deficit is simply negative surplus slower economic growth means lower incomes and tax r eceipts which tend to reduce federal budget surplus or increase budget deficit slower growth also means increased outlays for income support programs which tends to reduce federal budget surplus or increase budget deficit faster economic growth means higher tax receipts and lower outlays rais ing federal budget surplus or decreasing deficit early each year the office of management and budget omb and the congressional budget office cbo release economic forecasts for the coming year as required by law these releases are coin cidental with the release of the presidents proposed budget for the coming fiscal year projections of revenue s outlays and the federal budget surplus or deficit are ba sed in part on these economic forecasts numerous measures can be used to determine the relative accuracy of an economic forecast and assess whether partic ular forecasters projections tend to be optimistic or pessimistic these measures are mean error mean absolute error and root mean squared error this report uses these summary measures of error to assess the forecasting records of omb cbo and the blue chip consensus forecast between 1982 and 2007 the blue chip forecast was selected as representative of private forecasters because as consensus or av erage forecast it would be at least as accurate as about half of the 50 or so forecasts that go into it the economic variables that are examined here are real gdp growth c onsumer price inflation the unemployment rate and shortterm interest rates with respect to the accuracy of past economic forecasts one forecaster examined here emerged as more reliable or more accurate than the others neither does there appear to be any significant pattern of excessive optimism or pessimism in any of the forecasts future forecasts will undoubtedly continue to be characterized by errors revenue projections for example will turn out to have been too high one year or too low in another over the longer run how ever the evidence suggests that there is statistically significant bias in forecast errors future surpluses or deficits may turn out to be higher or lower than expected because of imperfect economic forecasts but forecast errors are not likely to be factor in longer run budget trends this report

economic performance and fis cal policy the budget surplus is revenues minus outlays for given fiscal year deficit is simply negative surplus slower economic growth means lower incomes and tax receipts which tend to reduce federal budget surplus or increase budget deficit slower growth also means increased outlays for income support programs which tends to reduce federal budget surplus or increase budget deficit faster economic growth means higher tax receipts and lower outlays rais ing federal budget surplus or reducing deficit policy decisions made on the basis of optimistic projections may have to be adjusted down the road if and when those projections are not realized if forecasts of economic growth are pers istently optimistic then proj ections of budget surpluses will tend to be too high introduction early each year the office of mana gement and budget omb and the congressional budget office cbo release economic forecasts for the coming year as required by law1 these releases are coincide ntal with the release of the presidents proposed budget for the coming fiscal year as required by law projections of revenues outla ys and the federal budget surp lus or deficit are based in part on these economic forecasts given the current state of the art econo mic forecasts will err but whether forecaster tends to be overly optimistic or pessimistic cannot be determined on the basis of single years forecast this report examines and compares the accuracy of past omb economic forecasts with those of cbo as well as those of third private forecast the blue chip economic indicators 2 the blue chip bc forecast is anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30239crs2 3 individual contributors to the blue chip forecast change from time to time 4 for detailed discussion of the nature of consensus forecasts see stephen k mcnees consensus forecasts tyranny of the majority new england economic review novdec 1987 pp1521 5 for this reason it is difficult after the fa ct to explain why actual budget amounts differ from earlier projections in part it may have to do with economic forecast errors but it may also be result of changes in policy 6 for current information on the federal budget see crs report rl33915 the budget for fiscal year 2008 by d andrew austin for current information on economic conditions and the economic outlook see crs report rl30329 current economic conditions and selected forecasts by gail makinen 7 summary measure of error is an attempt to measure forecast accuracy in single statistic 8 individual forecast errors are calculated by s ubtracting the measured actual historical value from the one that was forecastaverage of about 50 private forecasts3 because it is consensus forecast it is good standard for assessing the accuracy of the omb and cbo forecasts4 economic forecasts are used to make budget projections but those budget projections depend not just on economic forecasts but also on assumptions regarding future tax and spending po licy economic forecasts nd related budget projections are interdependent5 just as budget projections ar based on assumptions about the economic outlook changes in budget polic can have an effect on the economic outlook omb and cbo deal with this inte rdependence in slightly different ways ombs economic projections ssume that the budget is enacted as it is introduced cbos economic projec tions are based on current services budget which assumes that tax and spending polic ies remain unchanged thr oughout the forecast this difference in approach may explain some of the differences between omb and cbo forecasts shown below6 summary measures of forecast error three summary measures of error can be used to examine economic forecasting records7 the first is mean error m ean error is simply the average of all of the forecast errors8 large positive negative mean error would indicate tendency for forecasts of given variable to be too high low significantly large mean error either positive or negative might indicate propensity towards overly optimistic or pessimistic forecas ts depending on the partic ular variable small mean error can be misleading however b ecause large negative errors may be offset by equally large positive errors the second measure of forecasting erro r is mean absolute error mean absolute error is the average of the absolute value of all of the forecasting errors it measures how far off forecast was regardless of whether it was too high or too low taking the absolute value eliminates the problem of negative and positive errors offsetting each otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30239crs3 9 to see this point consider two forecasts for two time periods the first forecast had errors of 2 and 2 the second forecast has errors of 0 and 4 in both cases the mean error is 2 suggesting equal accuracy the first forecast also has root mean squared error of two however the root mean squared error of the second forecast is 28 if large errors are considered critical then the first fore cast might be considered superior 10 in both 1981 and 1989 with the change in pres idential administrations omb released two forecasts for 1981 the last forecast released by the carter administration was used for 1989 the last forecast released by the reagan administration was used the blue chip forecasts compared here were all published in january 11 in late 1991 the bureau of economic anal ysis of the commerce department began emphasizing gdp as the summary measure of the level of economic activity in the united states more information is in crs report 93570 gross national product or gross domestic product what difference does it make for copy of the report contact brian w cashell 77816 12 at one time the administration forecast the total unemployment rate which is on average 01 percentage point below the civilian unemployment rate to allow the comparison shown here to be consistent some administration forecasts for the unemployment rate have been adjusted to refl ect the actual difference between the total and civilian unemployment rates in each year th administration forecast of the unemployment rate shown here is of the civilian unemployment rate further interest rates as forecast by the administration are assumed to follow the rate of inflation that is when the inflation rate rises or falls in the projection interest rates are assumed to rise and fall by equal continuedthe third measure is root mean squared rror it is calculated by taking the square root of the average of the squares of the errors squaring the errors avoids the problem of negative and positive errors ffsetting each other in addition it places larger weight on large errors this measure helps to point out those forecasters who when wrong miss by lot9 standard deviations for forecast errors ar also useful here standard deviation is measure of the dispersion of set of numbers about their mean used here it gives an estimate of the variation in individual errors it helps to identify those errors that are significant rather than just matter of chance if the mean error is substantially larger than th standard deviation that c ould constitute evidence of bias in the forecast the forecasting record the omb cbo and blue chip forecasts made from 1982 through 2007 are compared here using each of the three mmary measures of error measures of standard deviation are presented as well in each case the forecasts examined are those that were released early on in the year forecasted10 for each of these forecasts four variables are examined growth in real gross national product gnp or gr oss domestic product gdp11 the change in the consumer price index cpi the civilian unemployment rate and the interest rate on threemonth treasury bills12httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30239crs4 12 continued amounts 13 gnp and gdp data are subject to periodic revi sions in other words the actual data is subject to change and so the apparent accur acy of forecasts is also subject to change actual data shown here are the latest estim ates available as of january 31 2008 although this may be unfair since definitions and methodol ogies have changed in the actual data since the forecasts were made it is at least equally unfair to the three forecasts 14 for the mean error estimate to lead to conc lusion of systematic bias in the forecasts it would have to be at least two standard deviati ons greater than or less than zero in other words the error cannot be considered to be sta tistically significant unless it is at least larger than the standard deviation which measures the overall variation in the error termsactual and forecast values for these variables for each of the past 26 years are shown in tables 1 through 4 individual differences are calculated by subtracting the actual from the forecasted value negative difference means that particular forecast turned out to be too low positive difference mean s that particular forecast turned out to be too high13 in any given year and for any particular variable one forecast may have proven superior to either of the other two in cases where one forecasters projection proved to be off by substantial amount the other two forecasts were also off by relatively large amounts in other words one fo recaster tended to make major errors more often than the others to get picture of the overall accuracy of these forecasts the summary measures are more useful at the bottom of each table summary m easures of error are presented for each forecaster these figures suggest that one of the three forecasters examined here stands out as either substantially in ferior or superior to the others all of the forecasters showed slight tendency to underpredict the real growth rate although ombs average error was slig htly less than either cbo or the blue chip consensus much of that apparent tendency is due to forecast errors between 1996 and 2000 in the second half of the 1990s productivity growth accelerated and it took some time for many econo mists to adjust their for ecasts to reflect the new faster trend rate of growth causing them to err on the low side the overall mean error figures are not large enough to be inte rpreted as evidence of bias in any of the three forecasts14 the other two summary measures of error in forecasts of real growth mean absolute error and root mean squared error suggest that the three forecasters did about equally well with respect to inflation forecasts of the consumer price index cpi were compared there are two cpis the cons umer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers cpiw and the cons umer price index for all urban consumers cpiu prior to 1992 omb forecast the cpiw because it is the index used to make cost of living adjustments to social s ecurity benefits ce then all three have forecast the cpiu all three forecasters tended to overestimate future inflation although the errors were small nd not statistically significanthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30239crs5 table 1 forecasts of growth in real gnpgdp 1982 2007 omb cbo blue chip actualaforecast difference forecast di fference forecast difference

statistically significant tendency to either ove r or underpredict interest rates budget implications of economic forecasts economic forecasts have substantia l effect on the budget outlook for

smaller budg et deficit projection each year cbo publishes timates that go out 10 years of th effect that alternative economic forecasts would have on their projections of revenues outlays and the budget surplus or deficit economic growth changes in forecasts of economic growth have greater effect on revenues than they do on outlays with respect to reve nues faster economic growth means higher incomes and higher tax payments outlays are also reduced because borrowing needs are reduced the debt grows less rapidly nd interest payments are smaller slower economic growth on the other hand would tend to reduce the projected path of revenues increase projected outlays and the projected surplus would tend to be smaller or the deficit would tend to be larger table 5 presents the estimated effects of changes in assumptions about economic growth on projections of revenues ou tlays and the surplus through 2018 cbo estimates the effect of 01 slower growth in real gdp and the change is assumed to persist over the entire interval in other words the change is not considered to be cyclical but rather is assumed to be chan ge in the longrun trend rate of growth of the economy because the change in gr owth is not cyclical phenomenon but is related to productivity empl oyment levels are assume d to remain unchanged according to these estimates for each 01 drop in economic growth

rate forecasts also have substantial effect on the budget outlook higher interest rates raise the cost of financing the outstanding debt at first the higher rates apply mostly to new debt but as older securities mature and are refinanced the higher rates apply to more and more of the tota l outstanding federal debt at the same time higher interest rates increase the incomes of holders of federal securities raising their taxes and federal revenues as well table 6 presents the estimated effects of changes in assumptions about interest ra tes on projections of revenues outlays and the rplus deficit through 2018 the long run effect on budget projections of assuming higher interest rates is much greater for outlays than it is for revenue s thus higher inte rest rates have the direct effect of reducing projected surpluse s increasing deficits because of the smaller surpluses larger deficits th outstanding debt grows more rapidly magnifying the effect of higher borrowing costs the

about the economic outlook projections of revenues require proj ections of incomes out of which taxes are paid projections of outlays depend on estimates of future inflation and interest rates wide range of economic variables can affect both with respect to the accuracy of past economic forecasts one forecaster examined here appeared to be significantly more reliable or more accurate than the others neither does there appear to be any significant pattern of excessive optimism or pessimism in any of the forecasts it ppears that to the exte nt that the official forecasts have missed the mark it is simply reflection of the state of the art of economic forecasting rather than an indication of bias forecasts of future economic performance will undoubtedly continue to err revenue projections for example will turn out to have been too high one year or too low in another surplus may turn out to be higher or lower than was expected because of an imperfect economic forecast with respect to forecasts of real economic growth there has been slight tendency for forecasts to be low especially in recent years inflation forecasts meanwhile have tended to be little high in neither case however was the error significant in the case of forecasts of the unemployment rate and shortterm interest rates the evidence suggests that forecast errors tended to balance out although there is basis to ssume that biased forecasts will lead to unrealistic budget projections small devia tions from the underlying economic forecast can have significant effects on future budgets
