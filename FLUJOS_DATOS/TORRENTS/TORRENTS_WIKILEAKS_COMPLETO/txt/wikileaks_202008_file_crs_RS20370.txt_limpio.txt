and underlying issues in us policy kerry dumbaugh specialist in asian affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division summary taiwan has become an increasingly controversial issue in uschina relations and has attracted more attention from congress some members believe that china poses more of threat now to taiwan than in the past while they see taiwans ability to defend itself as having eroded over time questions have also been raised about us policy toward taiwan and particularly about the consistency and credibility of us defense commitments as spelled out in pl 968 the taiwan relations act in response to these growing concerns members of the 106th congress have introduced the taiwan security enhancement act s 693 hr 1838 legislation to enhance ustaiwan military communication and cooperation and strengthen taiwans security the administration says it shares the desire to bolster taiwan but sees the legislation as unnecessarily provocative and potentially harmful to us security interests this report reviews what the legislation does discusses its political implications and its status and assesses how the measure compares with current us policy background since 1979 when the united states ended official relations with taiwan and established official relations with the peoples republic of china us policy toward taiwan including arms sales policy has been governed by pl 968 the taiwan relations act tra and by other us policy statements about taiwan contained in three communiques the united states has signed with china since 1972 the tra set forth comprehensive prescription for how unofficial us relations were to be conducted with taiwan after official relations were severed the taiwan security enhancement act tsea is an attempt to expand upon and make more explicit the provisions of one particular section of the tra section 3 which deals with us defense commitments section 3 of the tra is nonspecific about the defense articles and services the united states will provide to taiwan merely calling for such defense articles and servicesas may be necessary it reads as follows congressional research service the library of congress crs2 sec 31 in furtherance of the policy set forth in section 2 of this act the united states will make available to taiwan such defense articles and defense services in such quantity as may be necessary to enable taiwan to maintain sufficient selfdefense capability2 b the president and the congress shall determine the nature and quantity of such defense articles and services based solely upon their judgment of the needs of taiwan in accordance with procedures established by law such determination of taiwans defense needs shall include review by united states military authorities in connection with recommendations to the president and the congress c the president is directed to inform the congress promptly of any threat to the security or the social or economic system of the people on taiwan and any danger to the interests of the united states arising therefrom the president and the congress shall determine in accordance with constitutional processes appropriate action by the united states in response to any such danger3 some members maintain that in the two decades since the tra was enacted several trends have helped erode taiwans ability to defend itself and us policy should be adjusted accordingly in 1995 for instance after the clinton administration yielded to heavy congressional pressure and issued visa for taiwans president to make private visit to the united states an irate china responded by conducting an unprecedented series of livefire missile exercises in the taiwan strait the united states responded to the provocation in 1996 by sending two carrier battle groups to the area in june 1998 president clinton sparked renewed controversy during his summit trip to china when he made public statement that has come to be known as the three noes raising questions about whether longstanding us policy toward taiwan had changed4 in february 1999 the us department of defense issued congressionallymandated report assessing the military balance between taiwan and china the report concluded that in light of improvements in offensive military capabilities by the year 2005 china will have acquired the ability to attack taiwan with air and missile strikes which would degrade key military facilities and damage the islands economic infrastructure5 along with these developments since 1995 concerned observers are disturbed that china continues to insist publicly on its right to use force against taiwan most 1 22 usc 3302 2 sec 23 of the international security assistance act of 1979 pl 9692 93 stat 710 provided authorization for the president to transfer to taiwan war reserve material and other property during calendar years 1980 and 1981 for text of sec 23 see legislation on foreign relations through 1994 vol ia page 504 3 taiwan relations act pl 968 sec 3 22 usc 3302 4 according to white house transcript of his remarks during roundtable discussion in shanghai on june 30 1998 the president responded to question about taiwan saying i had chance to reiterate our taiwan policy which is that we dont support independence for taiwan or two chinas or one taiwanone china and we dont believe that taiwan should be member in any organization for which statehood is requirement so i think we have consistent policy some members believe that the presidents statement went beyond earlier us statements regarding taiwan see crs report rl30341 chinataiwan evolution of the onechina policy by shirley kan 5 the security situation in the taiwan strait report to congress pursuant to the fy1999 appropriations bill the text of the report can be found at httpwwwusiagovregionalea uschinatwnstrthtm crs3 recently in white paper the chinese government issued on february 21 2000 they further believe that china has demonstrated increasing hostility to taiwan not only in the 199596 missile exercises but in subsequent large military buildup on the chinese mainland opposite taiwan they claim that us administrations have been too cautious over the years in making decisions concerning arms sales to taiwan and that the current administration prefers to curry favor with beijing as the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee put it at taiwans expense6 finally some are concerned that taiwans military is increasingly anemic out of step with international standards and disadvantaged by its inability to conduct joint military exercises or participate in military exchanges with other countries because of beijings objections hr 1838 and s 693 address these perceived shortcomings and obstacles overview of hr 1838 and s 693 and comparison with current policy as introduced hr 1838 introduced by representatives delay gilman and others and s 693 introduced by senators helms and torricelli were almost identical but on october 26 1999 the full house international relations committee marked up hr 1838 and by vote of 326 ordered it reported with an amendment in the nature of substitute h rept 106423 pt 1 the full house passed this amended version on february 1 2000 by vote of 341 70 the substitute compromise version which chairman gilman referred to as the result of lengthy negotiations between himself and representatives bereuter gejdenson and cox made some important changes in the original house version7 the senate bill s 693 was the subject of senate foreign relations committee hearings on august 4 1999 markup has been scheduled yet and reports are that the bill is being held for range of concerns sections 1 and 2 both bills are called the taiwan security enhancement act section 1 and contain number of findings about taiwan and china section 2 s 693 provides details about chinas military buildup taken from 1999 pentagon report on the military balance in the taiwan strait8 the house international relations committee toned down these findings in the substitute to hr 1838 removing details about chinas military buildup and substituting series of statements about current us obligations under the taiwan relations act also the substitute declared that it is in the national interested of the united states to eliminate ambiguity in us policy toward taiwan9 section 3 s 693 makes several sense of congress pronouncements concerning taiwans special status including statements that taiwan should receive additional slots at the us national defense university and other senior service schools and should have 6 statement by senator jesse helms chairman of the senate foreign relations committee and sponsor of s 693 in opening an august 4 1998 committee hearing on the legislation 7 representative bereuter is chairman of the committees asiapacific subcommittee representative gejdenson is the committees ranking minority member representative cox not committee member is chairman of the house republican policy committee 8 see the security situation in the taiwan strait february 1999 9 some on the committee objected to making us policy more express representative tom lantos for instance stated that in the case of the us policy on taiwan ambiguity is virtue crs4 full and timely access to price and availability data for defense goods and services section 3 of the substitute version of hr 1838 mandates these things section 4 and 5a sections 4 and 5a of s 693 contain several mandates that go beyond current us policy toward taiwan although the substitute version of hr 1838 makes minor changes the provisions are substantially similar in both bills an increase in technical staff for the ait office in taiwan with the caveat that this be upon request from the defense security cooperation agency an annual report to congress detailing taiwans defense requests needs and justifications for us decisions on sale of defense articles to taiwan finding that taiwans defense needsand not the 1982 communique on arms sales to taiwan or other us policy documents are to be the sole basis of determining the defense articles and services to be offered to taiwan section 5b h it is from section 5b and afterward that the substitute version of hr 1838 differs most from the original version and from s 693 trainingmilitary exchanges section 5b of both measures requires the secretary of defense to develop andor implement plan for enhanced military exchanges and operational training with senior military officers in taiwan within 210 days of enactment and to submit that plan to congress within 180 days of enactment s 693 requires the submission of either classified or unclassified version the house substitute requires the submission of both although the united states has contact with and provides some training for taiwan military personnel this appears to be limited to training on weapons doctrine site visits and other military contacts related to weapons sales the united states does not now conduct joint exercises with taiwan or joint operational training reporting requirements the house substitute contains additional reporting language not found in s 693 requiring the secretary of defense to submit an annual report on the security situation in the taiwan strait the first such report in both classified and unclassified form is to be submitted not later than 45 days after enactment of the act the report is to include specific assessments of military threats to taiwan and an assessment of the steps taiwan has taken direct military communications s 693 and the original text of hr 1838 require the united states to establish secure direct communications between the us pacific command and taiwans military command the house substitute changed this language to direct the secretary of defense to certify to relevant congressional committees that such communications exist between us and taiwan armed forces weapons sales and military assistance both bills originally established general guidelines for us defense cooperation with taiwan and provided specific authorization president for specific weapons systems for the united states to transfer to taiwan the house substitute deleted all this language section 5d g there are weapons systems mentioned now in hr 1838 crs5 s 693 still contains this language much of which is general mentioning ground based and seabased systems reconnaissance and communications systems and anti submarine warfare asw systems for instance without giving further specifics in number of cases the united states already has sold to taiwan systems that fall under these general rubrics for instance the united states has sold the patriot modified pac 3 system to taiwan which is groundbased missile defense system with limited anti missile capabilities and also taiwan s70 sikorsky helicopters and s2e grumman maritime patrol aircraft both of which are airborne asw systems the united states has not been willing to sell taiwan the p3 orion longerrange airborne asw system although some recent reports suggest that the united states may be rethinking that position although taiwan has sought these planes in the past one recent report is that taiwan has decided to use helicopters for its fixedwing asw mission10 in four instances s 693 is more specific mentioning dieselpowered submarines aim120 amraam airtoair missiles awacs airborne warning systems and aegis destroyers the united states has not been willing to sell taiwan these systems to date and decision to do so could be considered significant upgrade of us military assistance to taiwan section 6 found only in the house substitute as reported by the committee section 6 of hr 1838 amended requires the secretary of defense to submit within 180 days of enactment of the act an additional report classified and unclassified versions on the us ability to respond to major military contingency where us interests on taiwan are at risk the report to be updated as appropriate specifies description of us planning on the national operational and tactical levels contrasting views both the original and substitute versions of the tsea have opponents the clinton administration opposes both versions saying that the bill could have serious unintended negative consequences that would weaken taiwans security and impinge on us security interests in the region11 the administration also maintains that the tseas specificity on military matters constitutes congressional interference in the presidents constitutional authority to make military decisions as commanderinchief the pentagon doubtless finds the reporting requirements of the house substitute onerous the administration has expressed particular concern about the tseas plan for operational training and exchanges of ustaiwan military personnel sec 5b hr 1838 and s 683 and the establishment of secure direct communications sec 5c s 693 between the two militaries these portions of the bill the administration maintains are more suggestive of military alliance than is compatible with ustaiwan unofficial relations12 the administration also objects to s 693s specific mention of ballistic 10 world military and civil aircraft briefing teal group corporation march 1999 p 12 11 testimony of stanley roth assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs before the senate foreign relations committee on august 4 1999 12 as part of the decision to establish official relations with china and break official relations with taiwan the united states had to terminate its defense alliance with taiwan the us mutual defense treaty in 1979 the united states gave taiwan the oneyear notification of termination required by the treaty the treaty was officially terminated on january 1 1980 crs6 missile defense and early warning radar sec 5d as items that the president should consider selling to taiwan saying that sale of these systems is premature at this time the administrations concerns are shared by some members who believe that current us arms sale policies are sufficient to meet taiwans needs and that additional weapons sales and other measures are both unnecessary and needlessly provocative to uschina relations representative bereuter chairman of the house international relations committees asiapacific subcommittee maintains that the most recent us arms sales approved for taiwan already provide for earlywarning radar for missile launch detection upgraded patriot 3 antimissile batteries and new equipment intended to ensure the technological superiority of the taiwanese air force over its chinese counterpart13 the administration also reportedly is discussing with taiwan the possible sale of p3 orion aircraft and advanced aegis radar for battleships14 during markup representatives lantos and salmon both argued against the bills specificity and said that the taiwan relations act was sufficient directive for us policy representative lantos stated his belief that the motivations behind introduction of the legislation were purely political designed to put the president in difficult position implications and prospects more important than the tseas practical implications are its political implications the administrations objections notwithstanding the current language of s 693 places requirements on the president to sell specific weapons to taiwan merely authorizing him to make the specified sales but under the tra the president already has broad authority to make available to taiwan any type of us defense equipment he deems necessary in other words current us law places exclusions on the types of defense articles and services that can be made available to taiwan congressional and other advocates of the new legislation argue however that us president yet has chosen to make available to taiwan the specific kinds of defense articles and services that s 693 and hr 1838 describe the reason president has done so they contend has far more to do with political considerations than with practical calculations about taiwans defense needs among these political considerations are chinas claims of sovereignty over taiwan and its objections to us arms sales us commitments in the 1982 joint communique on arms sales to taiwan the fact that the united states has neither an official relationship nor defense treaty with taiwan and the potential implications of us arms sales for independence sentiments in taiwan these same political considerations are operative in considering those portions of the tsea that do mandate executive branch action particularly where those provisions imply an operational linkage to weapons sales decisions and military contacts with taiwan that goes beyond the character of current us sales sec 4b and 5c in essence the tsea places increased congressional pressure on the president to be more proactive and aggressive in decisions about taiwans defense but may not change the prevailing political dynamic surrounding arms sales to taiwan 13 white house opposes bill on taiwan business
