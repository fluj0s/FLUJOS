many issues involved in the selection and confirma tion of federal judges from wh at should be considered when making choice for lifetime appointment to how fast the process should work republican president ronald reagan found it much more difficult than his predecessors to get his judges through senate controlled by democrats in the 100th congress1 presidents since reagan have encountered problems winning approval of their judicial nominees particularly when the senate is controlled by the opposing party2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21506crs2 3 see crs report rl31980 senate consideration

nominations process for lifetime appointments to us district court and us circuit court of appeals judg eships involves several steps3 the president begins the process by selecting an indi vidual to fill judicial vacancy and submitting nomination in writing to the senate the nomination may follow some consultation by the president with senators from the state where the vacancy exists particularly if the senators are from the same political party as the president us ually the same day the nomination is received by the senate it is referred to the judiciary committee the senate committee having jurisdiction over nominations to circuit and district courts next the judiciary committee may hold hearing on the nomination followe d by committee vote on whether to report the nomination to the full senate and what recommendation to make to the senate if the nomination is sent to the full chamber the final step occurs if the senate votes to confirm or reject the nomination c onfirmation requires simple ma jority vote if the senate votes in the negative on whether to confirm resolution of disapproval is sent to the president judicial nominations sometime s fail to advance through each procedural step in the appointment process afte r referral to committee judicial nomination might fail to receive hearing or after receiving hear ing might fail to receive committee vote on whether it should be reported even if reported by the judiciary committee the nomination might fail to receive vote by the senate on whether to confirm if it fails to receive senate vote the mination ultimately ma be withdrawn by the president or may be returned to him by the secretary of the senate upon nate adjournment or recess of more than 30 days any nominati on on which the senate has not acted by the end of twoyear congress is automatically returned to the president4 one reason why judicial nomination may not make it through the process is known as blue slipping according to longsta nding tradition in the senate when judicial nomination is received by the judiciary co mmittee the chair sends notice called blue slip to the two senators who represent the home state of the nominee asking for their opinion of the nominee whether they approve or disapprove senators can return the slip marked either with their approval or disa pproval of the nominee or sometimes will hold on to the slip and refuse to return it th ere has been debate am ong senators about how strongly negative blueslip should be weig hed in the process should one negative slip block nominee or should it take two should blue slip be considered advisory only5 there have also been instances of judges not receiving final vote on the senate floor during the 108th congress the senate took 20 votes to invoke cloture or shut off debate on 10 different nominees to the federal bench none cceeded this situation has led some senators to debate whether the senate should ch ange its rules regarding cloturehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21506crs3 6 for more information on these options see crs report rl32684 changing senate rules the constitutional or nuclear option by betsy palmer for more information

number of vacancies on the federal bench some lasting for years in 2000 the task force on federal judicial selection subset of citizens for independent courts group founded by the constitution project documented that in the 95th congress 197778 the sena took on average 38 days from the receipt of nomination to final action on it by the 105th congress the senate took on average 201 days from the time it r eceived nomination to final action on that nomination 7 us supreme court chief justice willia m h rehnquist in 1997 and again in 2001 urged the senate to act more quickly on nominees for the federa l bench the senate ought to act with reasonable promptness nd to vote each nominee up or down he wrote in 2001 the senate is not of course obliged to confirm any particular nominee but it ought to act on each nominee and to do so within reasonable time8 currently there are 871 authorized article iii life time appointment judgeships which are appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate as of march 8 2005 there were 42 vacancies on the federal bench9 new time line president bush has placed high priority on winning senate confirmation of his judicial nominees and has said he believes the current conf irmation system does not work well10 even before announcing his time lin proposal bush on march 22 2001 changed the process by deciding not to get formal evaluation from the american bar association aba on each of his judicial nominees since 1952 the aba had evaluated each candidate reviewing his or her integrity professional competence and judicial temperament the group then issued ratin g of well qualif ied qualified or not qualified prior to bushs announcement this aba review was done before the nominees namehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21506crs4 11 amy goldstein bush

changes to the judicial nomination process bush said that our federal courts t oday are in crisis the judicial confirmation pro cess does not work as it should nominees are too often mistreated votes are delayed hearings are nied and dozens of federal judgeships sit empty and this endangers the quality of justice in america12 the new process would begin when sitting federal judge decided to retire and would inform the president under the plan the judge would give the president as much as years notice of his or her intent to re tire before actually leaving the bench currently there is uniform standard on how much noti ce judge must give before retiring the president would then have up to six months to chose nominee and send his or her name to the senate for confirmation the presidents plan would require the senate judiciary committee to hold hearing on nomination within 90 days the plan indicates that this deadline should be strict one which would apply matter who is president and which party controls the senate the next step in the process would traditi onally be the consideration of the nominee by the senate judiciary committee the pres idents proposal makes mention of if or when the judiciary committee should vote on nominee the proposal skips the committee markup stage entirely going direc tly from required hearing in the committee to required vote on the floor of the senate the plan would require the full senate to hold vote within six months of the senates receipt of nomination the goal acco rding to the proposal is to make sure that all senators will have an opportunity to have their voices heard and their votes counted if all the guidelines in th presidents proposal were followed senate consideration of nomination would take more than 12 months after the president learns there will be vacancy on the bench the bush plan is the latest in series of proposals to overhaul the confirmation process in 1996 the white burk ett miller center of public affairs at the university of virginia assembled commission on the selec tion of federal judges that 11member bipartisan panel included form er republican majority leader howard baker and former democratic senator birch bayh the pane l found that the process for choosing and vetting nominees for federal judgeships had become much more complicated and time consuming during the last two decades the

independent courts found that the process for nominating and confirmin g federal judges had become not only long and slow but also highly politicized and polarized the panel called for series of changes to the system which focused more on depoliticizing the process than on specific timetable for action though the task fo rce did endorse the miller plans goal of seating judge on the bench within about nine months of vacancy14 newspaper editorials split in their reaction to the presidents proposal president bush has put forth plan for speeding up confirmation of his judicial nominees that misstates the problem and proposes to solve it by placing the burden on congress and the judiciary the administration should turn its attention to the real roadblock its own overly ideological

courant under the bush plan there would be beginning and an end to the process like the endless wait that takes place nowmr bush has offered reasonable way out16 implications for the senate the bush plan is designed to speed sena consideration of judicial nominations and as such raises questions about its imp act on the senates dvise and consent role were the plan to be adopte d if adopted it could mean veral of the traditional powers of the senate and individual senators would be circumscribed committing in advance to certain timetable would r ob the senate of its indepe ndence and its responsibility to consider these issues as long as it needs to senate historian rich ard baker told the washington post the framers of the constitution expected the senate to slow things down and that has annoyed lot of presid ents over the two centuries baker said17 the plan raises question about the ability of an individual senator to use the power of the blueslip to block action on nominati on

and charles w pickering sr were both nominated for seats on the us court of appeals for the 5th circuit and were renominated by president bush in 2003 and 2005down on the nomination the ability to block or stall action while perhaps frustrating to observers is key institutional power of any senator the presidents time line could make the process more difficult for homestate senators to maintain their influence over judicial nominations to hold to the deadlines recommended by the president homestate nators would be compelled to send their choices to the president quite rapidly once it became know n vacancy was going to occur to allow the white house time to review the choices before the president made his selection and sent it to the nate historically senators tend to be important players in the selection of district court nominees in th eir states senator nds to have less of an influence on the choice for an appellate nominee where courts jurisdiction includes more than one state18 with the streamlined procedures for all judicial nominations the president might feel less pressure to consu lt with senators about judges in their home states and regions that could tip the balance of power on the selec tion of such nominees toward the president the plan also raises questions about th power of the senate judiciary committee to take meaningful action on judicial nominati ons if the full senate were required to act on every judicial nomination within six months of receiving it would it cancel out the role played by the judiciary committee even if the committee rejected nominee the nomination would still go to the full senate for vote during the 107th congress there was intense debate over the proper role of the committee in the judicial nomination process the nominations of two judges were defeated by vote of the senate judiciary committee and their names did not go before the full senate for vote19 on its face the presidents plan proposes to reduce the length of time it takes to fill judicial vacancies it desc ribes specific timetable that would have the presidents nominations for such vacancies voted on by the full senate within six months
