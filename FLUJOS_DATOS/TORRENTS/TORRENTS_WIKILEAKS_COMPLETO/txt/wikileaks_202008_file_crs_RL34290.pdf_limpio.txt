act an overview summary the indian tribal governmental tax st atus act pl 97473 title ii section 202a the act extends to indian trib governments and their subdivisions in certain specific circumstances the same tax treatment as states and their political subdivisions for example tribal gove rnments may receive an exemption from certain federal excise taxes when purchasin g an item if the transaction involves the exercise of an essential governmental function likewi tribal governments may also issue taxexempt bonds either to finance the exercise of an essential governmental function or to build manuf acturing facility on tribal trust lands the act also grants deductions to individua ls who make charitable donations or tax payments to tribal governments and provides various other means for tribal governments to receive favorable forms of tax treatment though the act provides many forms of favorable tax treatme nt these benefits are limited to the specific situations prescribed in the statute federal courts are unlikely to extend state tax status to tribes in other areas not explicitly authorized in the act furthermore the tax treatment that tribal governments receive is severely limited by restrictions that do not apply to states for example exemptions from federal excise taxes and th authority to issue taxexempt bonds are available only when tribe is exercising an essential g overnmental function this means that tribal governments cannot claim an exemption from an excise tax if the item was purchased solely for the purpose of resale to consum ers moreover because of the essential governmental function restri ction and other restrictions embedded in the act tribal governments do not have the same flexibility in issuing taxexempt bonds as states two bills introduced in the 110th congress s 1850 and hr 3164 would amend the act by giving tribal governments greater flexibility in issuing taxexempt bonds this report will be

the transacti on must further an essential governmental function16 essential governmental functions are distinct from the substantial governmental functions17 essential governmental f unctions unlike substantial governmental functions do not test whether an entity possesses governmental power rather the test is whether the transaction in question serves or furthers governmental purpose that the entity is supposed to fulfill for its citizens section 7871e of the internal reve nue code states that essential governmental function sh all not include any functi on which is not customarily performed by state and local govern ments with general taxing power18 outside of this provision there is li ttle defin itive guidance on what constitutes an essential governmental function in recently issu ed advance notice of proposed rulemaking anprm the irs announced rule it an ticipates to propose that would define essential governmental function in the context of taxexempt bonds as an activity 1 that numerous state and local government s have conducted and financed with tax exempt governmental bonds prevalence 2 that state and local governments have conducted for many years dur ation and 3 that is not commercial or industrial19 the rule will also provide that essential governmental functions include but are not limited to roads schools and government buildings20 in formulating this rule the irs refers to both statutory lang uage and legislative history establishing prevalence and duration was deemed necessary because the statutory definition of esse ntial governmental function demands that activity in question be one customarily performed by states21 the irs interpreted the word customarily to mean that the activity must be practiced by large number of states for long duration of time22 moreover the prohibition on commercial or industrial activity was included because of language in the legislative history which suggestshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34290crs4 23 hrept

administrative material that provides examples of what the agency considers to be an esse ntial governmental f unction while discussing the extent of the exemptions from federal excise taxes in private letter ruling the irs held that school police and firefigh ting services were ssential governmental functions24 in technical advice memorandum th irs remarked that the issuance of bonds to finance industrial or comme rcial facilities was not an essential governmental function while activities customarily financed with governmental bonds such as schools roads and governme ntal buildings did fall within the scope of the definition25 from these sources it appears that the irss current approach mirrors the method nnounced in the anprm26 the irs now seems to classify an activity as an essential governmental function if the activity is 1 practiced by large number of state or local governments 2 for long duration of time and 3 is not an industrial or co mmercial activity27 when determining whether an activity is practiced by other state or local governments the irs also seems to require that the manner in which tribal g overnments conduct the activity must closely match the general practice of the activity among the states28 when determining whether an activity is commercial the irs appears to approach the issue by looking at host of factors such as whether the facility operates to earn profit competes with forprofit entities and functions in commercial manner29 the irs also looks at the balance of the operations of the facility between service to the local community and attraction of paying customers from outside the local community30 there is caveat the anprm and th technical advice memorandum define essential governmental func tion in the context of taxexempt

communication taxes if the communication services or facilities are furnished for the use of tribal government or its subdivisions35 and the highway use tax for any use of highway motor vehicle used by tribal government or its subdivisions36 exemptions from federal excise taxes are limited to transactions that involve the exercise of an essential govern mental function of the indian tribal government37 purchases made in furtherance of an essential governmental function will qualify for an exemption if there is provision in the act covering the transaction38 on the other hand even if stat utory provision in the act expressly grants an exemption for the purchase of an item if the item was purchased for the purpose of resale to consumers the purchase does not serve an essential

wagering and occupational taxes43 the act does not expressly extend this exemption to tribes in chickasaw nation v united states the supreme court held that the indian gaming regulatory act did not exempt tribes from paying the tax on lottery styled pulltab games even though there we re provisions providing that tribes were to be treated like states for matters cerning the reporting and withholding of such taxes44 though this case was based on statut ory construction it demonstrates the reluctance of the federal courts to infer exemptions from federal excise taxes for indian tribes in the absence of express provisions taxexempt tribal bonds the act also provides tribal governments in manner similar to states the authority to issue taxexempt bonds45 taxexempt bonds facilitate capital forma tion for tribal governments by excluding the interest earned on these bonds from gross income of bondholders for federal income taxation purposes46 this results in lower cost of capital for tribal governments since tribal bonds can offer lower yields than privat bonds while still ensuring highincome investors competitive aftertax return47 tribal governments however do not have the same flexibility in financing projects with taxexempt bonds that states enjoy congress has instead restricted the ways in which tribal governments can use the proceeds from taxexempt bonds tribal g
