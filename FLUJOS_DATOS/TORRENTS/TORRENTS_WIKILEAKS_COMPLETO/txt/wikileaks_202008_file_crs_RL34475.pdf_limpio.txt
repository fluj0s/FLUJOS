those seeking to alter federal fuel tax collection are doing so in the belief that reduction in fuel taxes would give americans modest level of economic relief from high pump prices there is however significant opposition to this proposal by those who believe that fuel tax holiday would provide minimal relief to individuals while potentially adding to the overall federal deficit increase in crude oil and refined product prices due to the continued tightness in crude oil markets spot prices of crude oil rose by almost 20 per barrel between the end of december 2007 and the end of april 2008 from about 91 per barrel to about 112 pe r barrel perhaps more publicized the futures price of one grade of crude oil exceeded 115 per barrel in late april the average acquisition cost of crude oil to u s petroleum refiners which excludes some transportation costs increased by approx imately 15 over almost the same period from 85 per barrel at the end of decem ber 2007 to 98 per barrel in march 2008 because the cost of crude oil to refine rs accounts for substantial portion of the price of refined petroleum produc ts to users retail prices of gasoline diesel fuel and heating oil have risen the average us retail price of gasoline of all grades increased from about 307 per gallon at the end of december 2007 to 3 51 per gallon by the end of april 2008 an increase of about 14 the average price

driving season from memorial day until labor day is believed to result in an increase in the demand for gasoline due to holiday and vacation travel as well as increased driving for personal errands

american trucking associations global insight and the energy information administrati on us department of energyprices among other policy options intere st has focused on possible moratorium on the federal excise taxes on transportation fuels especially gasoline and diesel fuel virtually all transportation fuels are taxed under complicated structure of excise tax rates and exemptions that vary by transportation mode and fuel type gasoline used in highway transportation is taxed at rate of 184 cents per gallon this is composed of an 183centperga llon highway trust f und rate the revenues from which are earmarked for the federa l highway trust fund and 01centper gallon rate dedicated to funding the leaking underground storage tank lust trust fund diesel fuel used in highway transportation is subj ect to total federal excise taxes of 244 cents per gallon 243 cents of which is earmarked for the highway trust fund and 01 cent of which go to the lust fund every state also has excise taxes on fuels used for highwa transportation these differ widely by state some states have employed fuel tax moratoriums in the past with varying results1 in the current situation congressional attention has focuse d on temporary and extended suspension of highway fuel excise taxes higher gasoline costs for consumers reduce the amount of disposable income available for other purchases and may be especially disruptive to c onsumers during the summer driving season2 higher fuel costs for truckers potentially increase hauling charges transportation costs and consumer prices and may also decrease trucking company profits andor drivers income fuel costs constitute significant portion of trucking company operating costs3 selected legislativ proposals in the 110th congress s 2890 senator mccain april 17 2008 w ould suspend the fuel taxes for the summer driving season may 26 2008 to ptember 1 2008 and requires that the highway trust fund and lust accounts be reimbursed by treasury general funds for revenues not collected from fuel taxe s s 2971 senator clinton may 2 2008 would suspend fuel taxes for the same peri od it would also reimburse the highway trust fund and lust deposits from the tr easury general funds although it does provide offsetting new revenues from windf all profits tax on the oil industry third senate bill s 2896 senator snow april 21 2008 would partially suspend only the diesel highway fu excise tax setting it at 183 cents per gallon from passage until december 31 2008 this bill w ould also provide for highway trust fund and lust reimbursement from treasury general fundshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34475crs3 4 economists measure the responsiveness of the supply by estimating the value of the supply elasticity 5 economists identify

importertwo house bills were introduced in the first session of the 110th congress that take different approach to providing fu tax relief hr 1569 representative mchugh march 19 2007 suspends highwa

steep and rapid increases in the retail prices of refi ned petroleum products and are intended to reverse those increases at least to some extent for limited period of time under normal market conditions and assuming reasonable degree of competition in oil and petroleum product markets the market response to cut in the excise taxes would be tendency to reduce user prices by an amount less than or equal to the tax cut economic theory suggests that the key factor in determining the extent of the passthrough to consumers of the reduced tax is the degree of price responsiveness of the supply of petroleum products4 if the quantity supplied is extremely responsive to even tiny price changes the entire tax cut would be passed on to consumers5 if as is more likely in the real world there is less sensitive relationship between prices and the supply of refined pe troleum products less of the tax cut would be passed on to consumers in the case of sensitiv ity of petroleum product supply to changes in price none of the tax cut is likely to be passed on to consumers in the latter two cases the taxed entities refiners importers and terminal operators6 would view the tax cut as decrease in the cost of doing business take advantage of the quantity constrained nature of supply and pass forw ard some or none of the tax cut in the form of lower prices current market conditions however may limit or even prevent an observed reduction in prices to endusers rising crude oil prices have resulted from continued growth in world demand that s put pressure on available world supplies resulting in diminished world excess oil production capacity and generally tight inventories these conditions have persisted in the oil market since 2003 in addition some analysts have identified other fact ors including speculation on oil futures markets inflation hedging political disr uption and mismanageme nt by national oil companies as contributing to high oil pr ices rising crude oil prices may continue to push up the price of gasoline offsetting any reduction in the fuel taxes httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34475crs4 7 energy information administration weekly imports and exports available at httpwwweiadoegov 8 downstream operations include re fining distribution and marketingwith respect to refined pe troleum products especially gasoline and diesel fuel demand in the united states has exceeded domestic refining capacity even though the refining industry has run at high capacity utilization rates as result about 1 million barrels per day of finished gasoline and gasoline blending stocks are imported to meet us demand7 the combination of limited capacity and high capacity utilization rates greatly limits the ability of the refining industry to increase the availability of refined pe troleum products under these conditions most experts would likely conclude that it is probable that little if any of tax cut due to temporary suspension of the fuel excise taxes would be passed forward to final consumers notwithstanding generally hi gh profits in the oil indus try profit margins in the the refining sector have been much lowe r four shell bp chevron and marathon of the six exxonmobil conocophillips largest integrated oil companies experienced declining income grow th in downstream operations in 20078 reduced profits in the refining sector might provi further incentive for the firms not to pass tax cuts on to consumers especially in light of the temporar nature of the tax cut moreover because 184 cents is small in re lation to current end user prices for transportation fuels about 5 most expert s would likely conclude that even full passthrough of suspension or repeal w ould have little effect on end user prices in an environment of rapidly increasing prices even full passthrough might only offset the price increases emanating from mark et pressures in that case consumers might continue to see increasing prices at the pump even though the tax cut was made fully available to them if lesser amounts than the full tax cut were passed on to consumers marketgenerated price increas might make the effect of the tax cut inconsequential proposals to suspend the full amount of only the gasoline or diesel fuel tax could be expected to have more complicat ed market effects although temporary singling out one fuel for tax relief could change the relative price structure among refined products and introduce incentives to change the pr oportions of products derived from each barrel of crude oil all of which would be affected by the seasonality of demand also it is possible that refiners would apply some of particular product tax cut to the prices of one or mo re other refined products thus it is uncertain not only that measures that give excise tax relief will result in reductions in prices to end users but th at any reductions will apply to the product given tax relief if the tax cut is passed on to users of gasoline and prices are reduced it is likely that consumption will increase an increased consumption of gasoline will lead to an increased demand for oil that will likely increase its price and lead to further increases in the price of gasoline in addition increased demand for gasoline in the united states is likely to be met by an increase in imported gasoline increasing

highway trust fund beginning in fy1998 10 vlasic bill as gas costs soar buyers are flocking to small cars the new york times may 2 2008dependence on foreign supplies increased consumption of gasoline will also increase carbon emissions also although it may not be likely some states experiencing budget pressure could substitute increased state fuel taxes for the reduced federal tax in that case if the refiners did not pass through the full tax cut to consumers and if state raised its tax by an amount equal to the proposed reduction in the federa l tax the net tax effect on consumers might increase this response could result from decrease in funding from the highway trust fund few states have provisions that automatically increase their taxes to some extent when federal taxes fall below certain level surface transportation program effects federal funding for surface transportation is closely linked to the revenue stream provided by the highway trus t fund in act uality the trust fund consists of two separate accounts highways nd mass transit in common usage the term highway trust fund normally refers to the highwa account as mentioned earlier the primary revenue sources for these accounts are th 184centpergallon tax on gasoline and 244centpergallon tax on diesel fuel lthough there are other sources of revenue for the trust fund these fuel taxes provide about 90 of the income to the funds of these amounts the transit account receive s 286 cents per gallon and 01 cent per gallon is reserved for an unrelated l eaking underground storage tank lust fund over the almost 50year life of the trust f und there have been several increases in the level of taxation the last increas in the fuel tax occurred in 19939 growth in the trust fund revenue stream over the last five decades has remained reliable largely because of continued growth in auto and truck registrations which combined with increased auto and truck use has resulted in relatively constant annual increase in national fuel consumpti on growth in fuel consumption has also been enabled by changes in the makeup of the national vehicular fleet this was especially the case in the 1990s when c onsumer demand for suvs and light trucks led to an even higher level of growth in fuel usage although driving has not yet decreased significantly as result of 350plus pergallon fuel costs it is believed that these price levels are affecting vehicle purchase decisions and othe r userelated decisions10 for example fuelefficient vehicles such as hybrids are selling well and less fuelefficient vehicles are selling at much reduced rate this situation will if it continues potentially reduce long term growth in fuel tax revenue other fuel costrelated tre nds may develop over time for example significant shift to alcoholbased fuels would put pressure on the overall federal budget becau of federal subsidies afforded these fuels httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34475crs6 11 there is widespread concurrence within th transportation finance community that the trust funds are in financial difficulty and that the highway account balances will be negative before the end of fy2009 the primary item of continuing debate is the point during the fiscal year at which this might occur for discussion of the overall financing issue see national surface transportation infrastructur financing commission interim report the path forward funding and financi ng our surface transportation system washington february 2008 p 11 12 office of management and budget budget of the us government fiscal year 2009 appendix washington 2008 p 888 and p 917federal surface transportati on program revenue issues federal surface transportation programs are currently authorized by the safe accountable flexible efficient transpor tation equity act legacy for users safetealu or safetea pl 10959 th is act reauthorized federal surface transportation programs through the end of fy2009 the act provided 2864 billion for sixyear authoriza tion period in actuality the act provided 2441 billion for the five years remaining in the authorization at the time of passage of immediate concern to the transportation community is the fact that the federalaid highway program is currently spending more on highways on an annual basis than the highway trust fund is recei ving annually in ne w revenues although this trend began prior to passage of sa fetea the funding levels provided by the act can only be met by spending down the cash balances in the highway and transit accounts of the trust fund the authors of safetea believed that the existing cash balances in the trust fund when combined with new revenues were sufficient to carry the program through the fy2009 author ization period there is now widespread agreement in the transportation community that this was an optimistic prediction both the office of management and b udget omb and the congressional budget office cbo believe that the cash balances in the highway account will be negative prior to the end of fy200911 fuel tax repeal or mora torium without concomitant increase in revenues from some other sour ce such as the treasury general fund could hasten and otherwise exacerbate this situation at the time of this writing cbo omb or joint tax committee estimate of the amount of revenue that would be forgone by gas tax holiday is available rough estimate of how much tax holiday could cost the trust fund can be derived as follows the bush administration budget proposal for fy2009 estimates that the highway account of the trust fund will collect revenues of 3419 billion in fy200812 the transit account will collect an estimate d 501 billion for the same period total estimated revenue collection for the f und for fy2008 would therefore be 392 billion as mentioned earlier approximately 90 of trust fund re venues derive from fuel taxes therefore approximately 3528 billion of fy2008 revenues would be from fuel taxes if annual fuel sales ar evenly divided over 12 months each month that the fuel tax might be suspended woul d result in 294 billion in lost revenue threemonth suspension similar to those proposed by s 2890 and s 2971 equates to 88 billion under these assumptions since the suspension period proposed in this legislation represents the peak summer dr iving period it is possible that the amount forgone could be slightly higherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34475crs7 because of the manner in which federa l transportation programs operate the effects of these reductions would not beco apparent in high way project spending immediately federal transportation programs are reimbursable programs meaning that actual outlays only occur after work has been completed at the state or local level the fy2009 budget predicts that th highway trust fund would have an end ofyear fy2008 balance of 3 billion if lternative funding were not provided to make up for the fuel tax holiday lost revenues it is likely therefore that the highway trust fund will have negative balance at some point prior to the end of fy2008 this would not be the case for the trans it account which is operating with larger unexpended balance at so point the federal highway administration fhwa would have to defer outlays for highway project reimbursement pending the accrual of revenues to the highway account which would be minimal until the reinstatement of the fuel taxes it is also likely th at fhwa would deem it prudent to reduce or otherwise delay the award of new obligation authority to the states this is the authority that allows states to ter into contracts for new projects the programs authorized by safetea ar due for reauthorization at the end of fy2009 any disruption in surface tran sportation funding could hasten the reauthorization debate which was expected to take place in the first session of the 111th congress reauthorization is expected to include significant discussion about the size of the overall fede ral commitment to surface tran sportation funding and the adequacy of existing revenues suspension of the fuel taxes assuming that they would be reinstated at the end of th holiday period could raise problematic questions about the supposed sanctity of th fivedecadeold link between fuel taxes and surface transportation funding this w ould especially be the case if surface transportation programs were to become ever more pendent on treasury general funds
