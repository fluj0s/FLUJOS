terrorist ttacks and discovery of anthrax in the mail on october 5 2001 the us postal service usps was in deep financial trouble although usps froze 800 capital projects and imposed three rate increases in 18 months its losses for the past 2 years still exceed 3 billion and there is growing consensus that usps faces long erterm set of problems that place the preservation of universal serv ice at risk some mailers foresee an economic death spiral of more price rises further cutting mail volume and requiring yet more price increases to cover operating costs of th vast postal network with 800000 workers while there is widespread agreement that usps has longterm problems there is consensus on their underlying causes some say that the business model of usps is outmoded as electronic communication grows and volume declines the board of governors blames an outdated regu latory regime and the lack of authority for usps to control its prices its wages or its facility locations mailers point to low productivity questioning whet her usps and its workers have appropriate incentives previous attempts to modernize the postal enterprise through legislation have foundered on profound differences of interest among such stakeholders as large mailers employees competitors and ove rsight bodies proposals abound however and it is likely congress will face so combination of the following splitting usps into competitive and noncompetitive monopoly entities allowing more price and financing fl exibility as proposed in hr 22 during the last two congresses and h r 4970 introduced late in the 107th congress relief from regulatory and statutory restrictions as proposed by the board of governors usps would have authority to set its own rates within broad range and wage disputes would longer go to binding arbitration privatization which is the trend for pos ts elsewhere in the world and which the former postmaster general thinks is inevitable in some form an independent reform commission to overcome immobilization by powerful stakeholders with irreconcilable interests as proposed in s 2754 redefinition of universal service which now includes lowcost home delivery anywhere in the nation at single low price six days week internal reform in accordance with usps transformation plan that calls on congress to give usps new authorities to generate savings

postal stakeholders the us postal service u sps was in deep financial trouble even before the sept ember 11 2001 terrorist attacks and the discovery of anthrax in the mailstream on october 5 despite two rate increases during the year usps suffered its second rgest loss in history in fiscal year fy2001 in an effort to curb spending the board of governors froze 800 construction projects and ordered review of the effects of cutting deliveries to five from six days week the general acc ounting office gao projecting that the statutory debt limit of 15 billion could be reached by 2003 and noting that usps has debt reduction strategy placed the post services longterm outlook on its high risk list in an unusual midyear action both of the usps oversight committees house government reform nd senate governmental affa irs held hearings early in the 107th congress on the uspss deteriorating financial outlook1 witnesses raised the prospect of spiral of rising prices leading to reduced mail volume and requiring further price rises to cover the enormous fixe d operating costs of the vast postal enterprise usps has increased borrowing and cut deeply into capital investment to save cash but this too come s at the cost of productivity and efficiency improvements for the future this report is description and analysis of the underlying financial predicament of usps as it stood before the september 11 attacks and the anthrax scare usps implemented its third rate increase in 18 months in june 2002 and has asked congress for 5 billion in appropriations to cover added expenses estimated at 3 billion to 4 billion and sudden dropoff in revenues projected at from 2 billion to 4 billion for fy2002 stemming from both attacks this will do nothing however to solve uspss structural deficit or its longer term problems that were building well before september 11 some stakeholders believe that the terrorist attacks will provide the impetus that has long been lacking to focus public and congressional attention on structural reform others however argue that it would be mistake to allow the current crisis to precipitate illadvised legislative changes which would further enhance the po

does so from the perspective of the postal service management but also from the multiple perspectives of the many organized stakeholders in the postal enterp rise congress has ways paid attention to the views of such stakeholders as large mailers competitors employees regulators and the 137 million household nd business delivery point customers visited by usps every day public administration scholars have also been drawn to the study of postal affairs by the unique usps governing structure by the curiosity of government entity trying to act like bus iness and by the fact that about third of the civilian federal workforce is postal employees background the current structure of usps was set by the postal reorganization act pra of 1970 before passage of this act the post office was an executive branch department and congress was heavily invol ved in such basic decisions as postage rates annual wage increas patronage appointment of local postmasters and selection of commemorative stamp issues postage rates were set by law and because raising them was politically difficu lt the substantial nnual postal deficit often as much as 25 of costs was cove red by appropriated f unds postal workers engaged in disruptive and illegal strike in 1970 forcing congress to address the state of the enterprise the pra reconstituted the post office partment in 1971 as the us postal service an independent establishment of the executive branch with mandate to operate as business and cover its expenses through postal revenues parttime board of governors was tablished to oversee the postal service much like corporate board it has nine members minated by the president and confirmed by the senate for 9year terms more than five of whom can be of the same political party the board was empowered to hire and fire the postmaster general pmg who with the deputy postmaster general became board members for other purposes because usps retained its monopoly ove r letter mail and exclusive access to mailboxes an independent regulatory commission the postal rate commission was constituted as politica llyappointed fulltime board with authority to review and approve postage rates proposed by usps rate cases are to follow prescribed 10month process with ample opportunities for usps customers competitors and unions to weigh in with alternative analyses of both institutional and variable costs of service labors support was necessary for passage of the pra it was secured by promises of substantial wage incr ease and provision in the pra for binding arbitration by neutral mediator in

america congress felt sufficiently confident of the fundamental soundness of the fina ncial outlook of usps that in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 it made usps responsible for all

congressional attention in recent years appropriations confined to revenue forgone in providing free ma il for the blind and overseas voters were small and unc ontroversial6 the senate handled postal affairs in the governmental affairs subcommittee on interna tional security prolifera tion and federal services the house post office and civil service committee which once had three subcommittees devoted to postal affairs was dissolved in the 104th congress and postal affairs were assigned to subcommittee of the house government reform committee in the 107th congress the postal subc ommittee

world fewer and fewer depend on monopoly letter delivery business for survival outdated regulatory regime usps and its board of governors which for many years have had sty relationship with the postal rate commission both believe that the regulatory model established by the pra has become cumbersome and count erproductive based on control rather than marketbased principles they chafe at 10month

billion for retiree health bene fits that is not carried on the books though it should be23 these numbers will only grow in the future and servicing these debts for past delivery services will become

delivering mail to constan tly expanding delivery network and the resources expended in producing these outputs has increased only about 11 in the past 30 years even though billions have been spent on automation and information technology according to gao postal productivity declined 33 from fy 1993 to fy 1999 though it increased 22 in fy 2000 and 07 in fy 200124 to the organized mailing community the fact that costly automation programs are apparently not resulting in significant productivity increases may be the most critical of all of uspss management problems25 perverse incentives while the pra directed usps to operate in businesslike manner usps lacks some key features of competitive enterprise its aim is to break even rath er than make profit it does not have the option of abandoning unprofitable lines of business or locations the pra anticipates that costs will rise and provides way to raise rates when they outstrip revenues as report from the progressive policy institute said of the uspss flawed incentive structure it is simply easier to raise rates than to do the hard work of cutting costs including standing firm against unreasonable union demands26 the prc cannot order

of mail in the words of gene polito president of the association for postal commerce the incentives that underlie todays postal service are the pposite of what is required of an enterprise that must function in competitive environment27 similarly work rules discourage coope ration between mana gement and labor to improve productivity28 for example the reward for letter carrier who finishes his or her route early is to be assigned to finish another route except for rural carriers overtime is negotiated daily leading to endemic conflicts with supervisors there is an incentive pay system for managers but it measures factors unrelated to the marketplace and guarantees rewards in advance of demonstrated bottomline performance29 too manytoo old facilities post offices are often centers of community activity and efforts by usps to move consolidate or close them to adapt to altered commercial residential and transportation patterns are invariably controversial the pra prohibited cl osing small post offices solely for operating at deficit and requires usps to go through an elaborate community consultation process with appeals to the prc before closing post office moreover under congressional pressure in 1998 usps adopted moratorium on initiating any consolidations or closures30 usps maintains that about half of its facilities do not generate nough revenues to cover their costs and has been focusing particular attention in recent hearings on the burden its rigid real estate profile imposes on the bottom line ruth goldway member of the prc has noted that cost savings from extending the drop shipment of prepared mail deeper into the sortation and transportation network will not be achieved unless congress permits reducing the number of bulk mail centers and large

congresses representative mchugh was also chairman of the subcommittee on the postal service of the house committee on government reform and held extensive hearings on the legislation over 4year period the theory behind the bill was that usps needed freedom to engage more competitively in growing markets but on leveled playing field while having an enhanced degree of supervised flexibility in its monopoly markets as approved by the subcommittee on the postal service on april 29 1999 the bill would have divided postal operations between competitive and noncompetitive products competitive mail would include pr oducts that could easily be sent through private corporation such as fede ral express n oncompetitive mail is traditional letter mail and addressed advertising mail for which usps is the only practical or legal alternative set cap on the price of noncompe titive mail every 5 years essentially allowing rates to rise at rate lower than inflati on while allowing competitive mail to be priced according to market conditions established private corporation owne d by usps that could offer new non postal competitive pr oducts but would not have such advantages as tax exemption and strike protection authorized usps to conduct largescale tests of experimental new products allowed usps to offer volume discounts to large customers such as government agencies and

closing post offices that lose money but with belated and tepid support from usps and its board and opposition from such influential stakeholders as ups and the american postal workers union the bill was not voted on by the government reform committee hr 22 was the direct predecessor to hr 4970 which reflects modifications and enhancements worked out with mailin g groups and with mocratic members postal service enhancement act representative henry waxman ranking minority member of the house government reform committee introduced hr 2535 in the 106th congress the bill would have provided some rate making flexibilities for competitive pr oducts negotiated rate agreements nd phasedin rates but according to usps the increased authority would be nominal and would leave unchanged prc authority over the pricing of noncompetitive m onopoly products such as letter mail nd addressed advertising mail37 the bill also would establish national commission to review and report on the present practices and organizational structure of usps with an emphasis on promoting efficiency in mail coll ection processing and delivery the bill was not considered by the committee in the 106th congress however its provision for national commission was re flected in title vii of hr 4970 which also provided for national commission on the future of the postal service relief from regulatory nd statutory restrictions the usps board of governors wrote the chairs of its oversight committees on may 15 2001 that the reforms most needed are greater empowerment of usps in its relationships with the prc and with its unions it urged that usps be given authority to set its own rates within broad indexed range reflec ting costs and market trends prc would have authority at all over services not covere d by

number of postal observers believe that political power is so thoroughly dispersed among stakeholders that only an independent blueribbon commission rather than the legislative process can devise contemporary solution to todays postal crisis the association for postal commerce for example cites the bruising experience of attempting to gain support fo r hr 22 as its reason for calling on the

administration on the characteristics of successful commissions agrees that the gislative process cannot achieve genuine reform he cautions against commission made up of stakeholders however because it is likely to mirror the established interests that have fought to draw on capitol hill the suggested model for successful commission is the 1967 commission on postal organization which d to

while opening up the acceptance transport sorting and processing of the mail to much greater competition in our vision customers will be able to send mail from local stores instead of the local post office private companies will sort and transport the mail faster and more cheaply and customers who put more effort into preparing their mail will get discounts on postage all the while usps mail carriers will deliver to american homes and businesses 50 while acceptance processing and trans port of physical mail can sustain multiple firms competing for business the last mile delivery of mail into mailboxes is very possibly natural monopoly the postal system has significant economies of scale that constitute high barriers to try for other firms including high fixed costs of last mile delivery which currently accounts for more that onethird of total usps costs51 postal rate commissioner ruth goldway testified before the senate governmental affairs committee on the benefits of concen trating on the last mile concept she believes congress should encourage usps to work with private sector companies to extend the drop shipment of prepared mail d eeper into its sortation and transportation network she contrasts the proven track record of the private sector in capturing cost savings through automation with the poor postal service record especially in flats media mail and parcels strategically she said the uspss competitive advantage lies in its last mile delivery connections to every household in the us network52 usps has not mentioned the concept in the past 2 years perhaps concerned that it is too limiting and would require downsizing of distribution and sorting facilities that congress would find it difficult to accept redefine universal service most reform

countries have begun to redefine universal rvice canada eliminated saturday delivery first for urban areas and then for rural areas in 1982 cut mail delivery to remote northern areas to as infrequently as once week and lowered its ontime delivery standards by full day in all categories55 british member of parliament for the labour part has written that the mailman is as anachronistic as the milkman it is time for politicians on all sides to confront the public with the brutal truth that universal mail delivery at standard price has had its day and that it is business of government or its agencies to be involved in such an activity in every other system of distribu tion most notably food the public has largely chosen through the dynamics of the market to dispense with doorstep delivery56 the usps board of governors opened the door to such redefinition by ordering study of delivery only five days wee k on july 9 2001 it publicly abandoned the idea which had generated considerable criticism in congress congressional opposition has also greeted any initiative to close the thousands of small post offices that fail to generate revenue s sufficient to offset their cost on the grounds that these facilities provide essential community services some have compared the situation to military base closings and suggested that only package of closures with an upor down vote would have chan ce of congressional approval appropriations although usps has taken pride in the independence that follows from its self supporting status there have been occasi onal proposals to augment postal revenues through appropriations on the grounds that public interest goals are being imposed unrelated to the mail delivery mission one proposal is that usps be subsidized for the cost of paying skilled labor wage rates for semiskilled work as means of opening gateway to the middle class57 in the detailed justification of its fy2003 budget re quest usps asked for an appropriation of

mailstream on october 5 2001 brought new and wholly unanticipated pressures on usps to step up its law enforcement activities and to invest in costly new technology and mail ndling procedures to sanitize the mail neither law enforcemen t nor public health re sponsibilities fit within the framework of the pra or the mission it assigned to usps to preserve universal delivery cover its costs th rough revenues act like bus iness and break even over time whatever reluctance usps had to accept appropriations disappeared within month of the appearance of anthrax in the mailstream usps received

for 2 billion in lost revenues64 usps revenues were 15 billion less than pla nned during the first 24 weeks of fy2002 members of the subcommittee said that appropriations were much more likely to cover the cost of sanitization equipment than to cover revenue losses asked what hehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31069crs19 would do if appropriations were insufficient the pmg said that only increased rates borrowing above the current 15 billi on limit and service reductions were alternatives and all of them threatened uspss longterm future conclusion even before the anthrax scare congressi onal hearings revealed broadly based consensus that usps faces an unsus tainable longterm prospect as gao characterized uspss future even if there is agreement on its underlying causes or on appropriate reme dies while postal stakeholders have spent most of the 107th congress trying to develop consensus re form package by the time it was introduced in the house its democratic sponsors rejected it on the grounds that there was leadership commitment to consider the measure on the floor it appears that only the prospect of reaching the 15 billion borrowing limit offers any promise of mobilizing congressional attention to the longter m financial state of the enterprise the anthrax crisis seemed for time to have revised those calculations usps faces 3 billion to 4 billion in added costs and its ability to pay those costs has been seriously constrained by sudden drop in revenues as mailers and postal customers began to question the safety of the mail this issue is being handled through the supplementary appropriations route however and has not been linked to the policy question whether the statutory framework established 30 years ago contemplating selfsupporting usps whose rates and labor costs are in large part in control of others is still viable most stakeholders think it is not but differences among them on remedies are deep and persistent calls for presidential commission to resolve these differences are based on perception that congress cannot do so b ecause it is immobilized by conflicting pressures from postal stakeholders if this is not to be so then congress will be forced to confront number of issues that have been off the table for decades including return to operational appropriations allowing usps to compete in new markets against the private sector redefinition of universal service allowing usps to close some of its unneeded facilities and finding way to reduce costs of the huge and politically influential postal workforce
