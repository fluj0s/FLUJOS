competition policy dick k nanto specialist in industry and trade foreign affairs defense and trade division summary international competition policy is aimed at prohibiting private activities that restrict or distort competition particulary as they affect trade it is both process of harmonizing national competi tion policies and goal of negotiating multinational agreement on antitrust policy although every industrialized nation has national antitrust and competi tion laws there is consensus on the need for shape of or reach of an international competit ion policy the world trade organization is exploring the possibility of including competition policy in its negotiating agenda congressional action on competition policy centers mainly on its oversight of trade economic and antitrust relations with foreign countries this report will be updated as events warrant competition policy refers to the administration of antitrust and other laws aimed at ensuring competition in markets it has gained importance in international economic relations because successive reductions in tariff and nontariff barriers have shifted the focus from governmentcontrolled import barriers to restrictive practices by private companies as trade is liberalized governments longer can impose impediments to products from abroad private companies however can erect barriers with similar effect international competition policy tries to prohibit agreements and practices which restrict and distort competition among trading states it also is aimed at preventing the misuse by firm of its dominant position in market in way that adversely affects international trade it is intended to protect consumers from private firms who unilaterally or collectively set prices that are higher than otherwise would prevail the pressure for governments to act on competition policy emanates mainly from multinational corporations that operate in different world markets and often face anticompetitive practices there that may be considered illegal in the united states it also emanates from domestic industries competing with imports from companies that may be engaged in unfair trading practices eg dumping that may be financed by excess profits generated through exercising monopoly power at home or through international cartels congressional action on competition policy centers mainly on its oversight of trade economic and antitrust relationships with foreign countries the first area of oversighthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20191crs2 deals with us efforts to open markets for american exports and businesses abroad the second is in the activities of multilateral organizations such as the world trade organization wto and the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd the third is in cooperative comity activities with other national antitrust authorities in the 106th congres s hr 1120 s levin et would require an investigation by the international trade commission to collect information on and assess the adverse effects of anticompetitive practices in international steel trade hearings dealing with international competition policy also are being scheduled background competition policy has heretofore been mostly domestic issue it centers on identifying regulating and dealing with restrictive economic structures and practices collusive business behavior barriers to entry into industry and other activities that may deter companies or other economic actors from engaging in free and open market competition the targets of competition policy include restrictive business practices such as public and private monopolies cartels including export cartels vertical or horizontal restraints certain mergers and acquisitions predatory pricing price fixing price discrimination and abuse of market power some trade restrictions also can inhibit competition these practices usually cause economic inefficiencies abnormally high prices or may retard the advance of technology monopoly power or restrictive business practices are usually question of degree anticompetitive behavior can range from that of huge corporation that may destroy all competitors through predatory pricing to producer with unique product the issue is not the existence of monopoly power per but its effect on the marketplace firms with monopoly or monopolistic power can diminish economic efficiency but they also can enhance it while governments recognize that monopolies cause inefficien cies they often provide monopoly power to companies they grant patents copyrights and licenses to operate they establish standards that favor existing companies they allow public utilities to service specific geographical areas provide protection from import competition and allow mergers and acquisitions that reduce competition governments recognize that some industries require large oligopolistic companies to take advantage of economies of scale in production domestic company moreover may make the case that it requires some monopoly power to compete with foreign companies that dominate their home markets some governments look aside as companies monopolize distribution channels and often are ambivalent about enforcing competition policy still most agree that certain types of anticompetitive behavior should not be tolerated every industrialized nation has some form of domestic competition policy there is consensus however on the need for shape of or reach of an international competition policy international competition policy could proceed on three basic paths the first is to harmonize national antitrust laws and rely primarily on cooperat ion among national antitrust authorities to enforce those laws the second would be to devise set of binding competition rules that would be enforceable through an international dispute settlementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20191crs3 1 shelton joanna r competition policy what chance for international rules paper delivered

negotiations by arlene wilson 4 see for example ftc chairman discusses competition policy trends in international continuedprocess third approach would be to have countries agree on framework for rules or core principles basic concepts upon which there could be broad agreement1 adopting an international competition policy agreement faces three major hurdles the first is that the theory underlying the policy and consensus on the appropriate measures necessary to achieve it are still being developed there are authoritative ways to measure restrictive business practices nor do definitive policy prescriptions exist the second hurdle is political the appeal of competition policy depends partly on the level of economic development of country developing nations seem more interested in pursuing industrial policies that will foster strong companies than in antitrust policy aimed at keeping their companies within bounds developing nations also have gained greatly by raising their export prices through cartels or other arrangements in order to shift the terms of trade in their favor particularly in raising the price of petroleum the third major hurdle is enforcement and dispute settlement the initial responsibility for enforcement rests with the authorities in the countries themselves nations may or may not be willing to cede supranatio nal authority to an international organization for enforcement extraterritorial enforcement of antitrust laws also carries problems and comity does not always achieve desired results2 at the international level competition policy is being addressed by the oecd through its committee on competition law and policy and its joint group on trade and competition these oecd groups have been doing considerable intellectual work on trade and competition policy the oecd has worked to define best practices or common approaches to the enforcement of competition law it has been seeking to promote the convergence of competition policy across countries at the wto competition policy is under consideration as new issue for its negotiating agenda3 in its singapore ministerial in december 1996 the wto established working group to study trade and competition policy this group however has focused first on analytical and educational issues rather than on the possibilit of negotiations it is to issue its report in 1999 the united nations conference on trade and development unctad works mainly with countries that are adopting or modernizing their antitrust laws as for support for including competition policy in wto negotiations in general the us justice department and federal trade commission have been cool to the idea while the us trade representative has given it limited support4 in the private sector

competition authority in principle has favored placing competition policy on the wto negotiating agenda the competition bureau in canada has stated that it is time to contemplate an agreement on competition policy in the next round of the wto5 multinational corporations tend to support more work on competition policies by international organizations but they are concerned about the exchange of confidential information dealing with their market positions in the united states in november 1997 the department of justice formed the international competition policy advisory committee icpac to address global antitrust problems6 in forming the committee the department noted that recently there have been dramatic increases in both international commerce and international anticompetitive activity the number of transnational corporate mergers has been rising steadily and the department has numerous investigations involving international cartels icpac is to provide advice and information to the department on international antitrust issues such as transnational cartels multiju risdictional merger reviews and international anticompetitive business practices in 1992 the us justice department stated that it would challenge anticompetitive conduct abroad if 1 the conduct has direct substantial and reasonably foreseeable effect on exports of goods or services from the united states 2 the conduct involves anticompetitive activities that violate us antitrust laws and 3 us courts have jurisdiction over foreign persons or corporations engaged in such conduct7 in 1994 congress passed the international antitrust enforcement assistance act 15 usca 62016212 which emphasizes cooperat ion and mutual assistance between the justice department in the united states and foreign antitrust enforcement entities these efforts rely heavily on positive comity or cooperation among antitrust authorities competition policy has been at the heart of several recent trade disputes on march 31 1998 the wto released decision in usinitiated dispute involving access by kodak to the photographic film and paper market in japan the wto panel decided against the us which highlighted the lack of an explicit competition policy agreement in the wto that would have provided better legal foundation for such cases8 competition policy also came into play in 1995 dispute over

anticompetitive practices in many other countries for example asian industrial groups keiretsu in japan and chaebol in south korea are often accused of anticomp etitive behavior china has created industrial conglomerates to improve the profitability of stateowned enterprises some of which are authorized to fix prices allocate contracts and restrict competition among domestic suppliers in south korea the governmentaffiliated korean broadcasting advertising corporation holds monopoly over the allocation of television and radio advertising time in india both stateowned and private indian firms can engage in most types of anticompetitive practices with little or fear of reaction from government overseers or action from heavily backlogged court system in 1996 switzerland strengthened its anticartel law but it still permits cartels under certain circumstances10 also even though virtually all industrialized and many developing nations have antitrust laws enforcement varies widely from country to country some of the newly industrializing nations have pressed for abolishing antidumping laws and replacing them with competition policy agreements dumping would be treated as an abuse of power although australia and new zealand have taken this approach in their freetrade agreement us policymakers have not supported this approach existing competition policy agreements as with most other international economic policies the competition policy agreements that do exist began with arrangements for cooperation or as part of the rules for international trading agreements or economic blocs the general agreement on tariffs and trade which has been incorporated into the wto contains some provisions which address certain competitionrelated governmental actions dealing with monopolies exclusive service arrangements the effects of domestic regulation and the need for transparency in all these matters in the wto telecommunications agreement there is an obligation to allow service providers of other members access to public telecommunications networks which often are public monopolies on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms and conditions11 with respect to particular nations the european union has the most welldeveloped policy the commitment to economic integration there is strong enough that members have agreed to common competition policy and ceded some of their

laws between their two countries with provisions from their competition laws the monopolization or abuse of dominant positions also applies to dumping cases14 the asia pacific economic cooperation apec council is examining competition policy as complement to its goal of free trade the aim is to facilitate trade and reduce trade friction particularly between the united states and japan15 the oecd has long been addressing competition issues for this group of 25 industrial nations it has formed joint group on trade and competition and its members have agreed to cooperate on anticompetitive practices affecting international trade and to continue to work informally for greater convergence in standards for competition law more use of common analytical methods and more international enforcement capacity and information sharing competition policy agreement therefore is on the agenda for considerat ion and possible action by the wto oecd and apec in sense international competition policy is both goal and process as process nations are seeking to harmonize their antitrust laws and enforcement as goal international organizations are studying the relationship between competition policy and trade the wto however is yet to decide whether to initiate activity leading to formal negotiations on internat ional competition policy
