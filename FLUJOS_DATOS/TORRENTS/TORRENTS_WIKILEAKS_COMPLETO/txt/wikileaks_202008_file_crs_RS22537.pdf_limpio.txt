of defense dod has not released composite estimate of iraqi civilian deaths during operation iraqi freedom however in the report measuring stability and security in iraq it has released chart containing two separate estimates of iraqi civilian deaths from january 2006 to august 20081 the first estimate is derived from compilation of coalition and iraqi reports of civilian deaths while the second estimate is derived from the iraq significant activities sigacts iii database which includes coalition reports only the dod noted in the december 2007 update of measuring stability and security in iraq that host nation reports capture some types of deaths on which the coalition does not have visibility in particular murders and deaths in locations where coalition forces are not present 2 while the chart provides guideline to iraqi civilian deaths trends the specific data used to create the chart have not been released using the dod chart as guideline therefore crs has reproduced an

statistics on iraqi civilian deaths from august 2005 to march 2007 the united nations assistance mission for iraq unami published series of quarterly reports on human rights in iraq that included sections on iraqi civilian casualties on april 25 2007 however the iraqi government announced its intention to cease providing civilian casualty figures to the united nations3 ivana vuco human rights officer stated iraqi government officials had made clear during discussions that they believed releasing high casualty numbers would make it more difficult to quell unrest4 the unami report on human rights released on october 11 2007 and concerning the period between april june 2007 expressed regret that for this reporting period unami was again unable to persuade the government of iraq to release data on casualties compiled by the ministry of health and its other institutions unami continues to maintain that making such data public is in the public interest 5 unami did not publish another human rights report until december 2 2008 when it issued report covering the human rights situation in iraq from january 1 2008 june 30 20086 this latest report provides list of instances of bombings in which civilians were killed but does not give comprehensive estimate of civilian deaths the reports first recommendation to the government of iraq is to issue on regular basis mortality data compiled by the ministry of health based on information received from all governorates and statistics kept at the medicolegal institute in baghdad together with details of the methodology used to calculate the figures 7 in november 2008 statement in front of the united nations security council ambassador zalmay khalilzad announced that the security situation in iraq had significantly improved since june 20078 according to the ambassador the number of overall attacks since june 2007 had decreased by 86 and iraqi civilian deaths due to violence had decreased by 84 in the same time period the nonprofit iraq body count also re ported decrease in civilian deaths in 2008 according to their database 83159028 or approximately 25 people day iraqi civilians died due to violence in 2008 9 by comparison 2267124295 or approximately 67 day civilian deaths were added to their database in 2007 and 2577427599 civilian deaths or approximately 76 day were added in 2006 however the reported decrease has not been entirely consistent on monthtomonth basis the new york times reports that the iraqi health ministry counted total of 148 civilian deaths for november 2008 compared with 118

violencerelated mortality in iraq have recently been undertaken the first two studies were both conducted by researchers from johns hopkins university and baghdads almustansiriya university and are commonly referred to in the press as the lancet studies because they were published in the british medical journal of that name the third study was conducted by consortium of researchers many of whom are associated with the world health organization and so the study is commonly referred to as the who study in the press the first of these studies published in 2004 used cluster sample survey of households in iraq to develop an estimate ranging from 8000 to 194000 civilian casualties due to violent deaths since the start of the war 11 this report has come under some criticism for its methodology which may not have accounted for the longterm negative health effects of the saddam hussein era former 11 roberts ridyah lafta richard garfield et mortality before and after the 2003

response rejecting the findings of the first lancet report on the grounds that the data analyzed were inaccurate12 the second study published in 2006 increased the number of clusters surveyed from 33 to 47 and reported an estimate of between 426369 and 793663 iraqi civilian deaths from violent causes since the beginning of operation iraqi freedom13 this article too has sparked some controversy14 stephen moore consultant for gorton moore international objected to the methods used by the researchers commenting in the wall street journal that the lancet article lacked some of the hallmarks of good research small margin of error record of the demographics of respondents so that one can be sure one has captured fair representation of an entire population and large number of cluster points15 on the other hand documents written by the uk ministry of defences chief scientific advisor have come to light which called the surveys methods close to best practice and robust 16 in the third and most recent study team of investigators from the federal ministry of health in baghdad the kurdistan ministry of planning the kurdistan ministry of health the central organization for statistics and information technology in baghdad and the world health organization formed the iraq family health survey ifhs study group to research violence related mortality in iraq17 in their nationally representative cluster study interviewers visited 894 of 1086 household clusters the household response rate was 962 they concluded that there had been an estimated 151000 violencerelated deaths from march 2003 through june 2006 and that violence was the main cause of death for men between the ages of 15 and 59 years during the first three years after the 2003 invasion this study seems to be widely cited for violencerelated mortality rates in iraq neither the lancet studies nor the ifhs study make an effort to distinguish different victims of violence such as civilians versus police or security force members the associated press has kept database of iraqi civilian and security forces dead and wounded since april 2005 according to its database between april 2005 and january 5 2009 44971 iraqi civilians have died and 51540 have been wounded 18 number of nonprofit groups have released unofficial estimates of iraqi civilian deaths the iraq body count ibc is one source often cited by the media it bases its online casualty estimates on media reports of casualties some of which may involve security forces as well as civilians as of january 7 2009 the ibc estimated that between

testimony given on september 1011 2007 and other sources to develop its own composite estimate for iraqi civilians who have died by violence by combining all of these sources by date the brookings

civilian and iraqi security forces deaths using an ibclike method of posting media reports of deaths iccc like ibc is prone to the kind of errors likely when using media reports for data some deaths may not be reported in the media while other deaths may be reported more than once the iccc does have one rare feature it separates police and soldier deaths from civilian deaths the iccc estimates
