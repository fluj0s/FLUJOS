education in general federal k12 education assistance program requirements include activities or outcomes that state or local educational agenci seas leas are expected to provide or achieve in order to establish accountability for use of funds consistent with the purposes of authorizing statutes these requirements are usually intended to provide target accountability ensuring that funds are

2001 ncl b pl 107110 the authorization of special forms of flexibility for grantees has been major focus of most federal k12 education assistance legislation in particular the nclb extended some flexibility authorities that had been established earlier and initiated new ones this report provides an overview of these authorizations for state and local flexibility in administering federal k12 education programs it will be updated infrequently to incorporate major new developments in the implementation of these authorities or new information on their use and impact flexibility is defined for purposes of this report as authority under which federal program requirements particularly restrictions on the use of federal aid may be waived by or on behalf of state or local aid recipients meeting certain eligibility criteria in some cases this flexibility is granted in return for meeting specified accountability requirements related to program outcomes such flexibility includes provisions for consolidation of multiple programs or for transfer of funds among programs so that federal assistance may be used for broader range of activities or purposes than ordinarily would be allowed as well as the authority to waive specified types of program requirements in general these flexibility authorities appl to federal aid programs authorized by the elementary and secondary education act esea the largest source of federal aid to k12 education in contrast almost none of these authorities involve the second largest source of federal aid the individuals with disabilities education act idea for this reason as well as the existence of number of issues regarding requirem ents and flexibility that are specific to that program the idea will not be discussed further in this report and discussions of federal involvement in k12 education in this report should be understood to apply to the esea and to exclude the idea esea programs are authorized through fy2008 and the 110

applicable to esea and related federal k12 programs many of these requirements may be waived in part or in whole for some or all states and leas under the special flexibility authorities discussed

intended to provide accountability by assuring that federal funds are used in ways that are consistent with the purposes of the federal statutes authorizing the programs typically federal programs of aid to elementary and secondary education exhibit mix of relatively specific and explicit requirements in such areas as eligibility of pupils to be served allocation of funds or increasingly outcomes along with substantial flexibility in many other important respects such as instructional methods or grade levels to be served federal k12 education programs generally focus upon one or more of the following student populations with special educational needs such as disadvantaged or limited english proficient lep pupils b specific aspect of instructional services such as educational technology or recruitment and professional development of teachers c development demonstration and dissemination of innovative instructional approaches such as charter schools or demonstrations of comprehensive school reform or d specific subject area such as instruction in math or science most of the larger federal programs such as esea title ia fall into category while several programs of small to moderate size are in categories bd almost all federal k12 education programs in all of categories ad are sometimes referred to as categorical programs because their focus is targeted or limited in one or more important respects in contrast one esea programthe innovative programs au thority of esea title vaprovides support for such broad range of activities that it is generally considered to be block grant at the other end of the intergovernmental assistance spectrum

three general sources of federal requirements or related guidance to state and local recipients of federal aid an important distinction at least in theory can be made between requirements and nonregulatory policy guidance requirements must be met by grantees as matter of law while they are always derived ultimately from the authorizing statute for program or other federal statutes or judicial actions they may appear in the form of regulations in addition to statutory text program regulations which are published initially in the federal register then later integrated into annual updates of the code of federal regulations supplement statutory language primarily with respect to limited number of major issues or topics which are complex where us department of education ed officials place high priority on grantees taking certain specific actions and where statutory text is deemed by ed to provide insufficient guidance one example would be ea title ia requirements regarding curriculum content and pupil performance standards and assessments in few cases authorizing statutes explicitly provide that ed is to publish regulations addressing certain issues although ed may issue regulations with respect to any aid program which it administers g16g152g151g556g20g142g144g158g149g138g157g152g155g162g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g9g158g146g141g138g151g140g142g561 in contrast nonregulatory policy guidance is also published by ed for many programs such nonregulatory policy guidance may be published in the form of extensive questions and answers regarding several aspects of program or more specific dear colleague policy letters from the us secretary of education to chief state school officers or other state and local officials as this designation implies grantees are not legally required to follow this guidance which is generally intended to answer relatively specific questions regarding topics such as uses of funds or selection of pupils to be served nevertheless the typical perception and use of non regulatory guidance may be more complex than this stated intent would imply grantees may httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31583g13g556g343g344g561g7g141

effective challenges to their use of federal aid if they follow such nonregulatory guidance and may often treat such guidance as if it were equivalent to regulations even if they are not explicitly required to do so somewhat analogous form of nonregulatory guidance may be found in the competitive priorities established by ed for competitive or discretionary ie not formula grant programs in these grant competitions ed typically sets certain priorities for applications which would receive preferential consideration in the awarding of grants for example priority might be established for applicants which would use funds to provide services in schools with high percentages of pupils from lowincome families while applicants are not required to meet these priorities it is obvious that they will have much greater likelihood of receiving support if they do so these priorities are not regulations they are typically published only in the announcement of the grant competition in the federal register over the past several years especially since adoption of the iasa in 1994 there has been trend toward the publication of regulations which are less voluminous and address fewer aspects of many federal elementary and secondary education programs than in the past for several programs ed has published regulations at all implying that guidance in the statute is sufficient and requires supplementation by regulations although in most cases some form of nonregulatory policy guidance is provided for esea programs where some regulations are still published such as esea title ia the regulations are generally somewhat briefer and often address fewer issues than was the case prior to the early 1990s for example proposed program regulations for esea title ia after enactment of the iasa in 1994 followed rather minimalist approach in that they addressed relatively few program issues primarily standards assessments and accountability schoolwide programs participation of children who attend private schools and allocation of funds within states and leas more recently following enactment of the nclb of 2001 ed embraced similar strategy with respect to esea title ia for example it has thus far published regulations on relatively limited number of topics 1 the department has stated the secretary intends to regulate only if absolutely necessary for example if the statute requires regulations or if regulations are necessary to provide flexibility or clarification for state and local educational agencies rather than regulating extensively the secretary intends to issue nonregulatory guidance addressing particular legal and policy issues under the title i programs this guidance will inform schools parents school districts states and other affected parties about the flexibility that exists under the statute including different approaches they may take to carry out the statutes requirements 2

federal aid funds federal elementary and secondary education program requirements are usually intended to provide one or more of three basic types of accountability for use of funds consistent with the purposes of statutes that authorize the programs these intended forms of accountability include target accountability assuring that funds are focused on eligible localities pupils and purposes usually for the ultimate purpose of promoting more equal educational opportunities outcome accountability assuring that funds are used effectively to improve student achievement and enhance the quality of k12 instructioneither in specific subject areas or for particular types of pupils or overall and fiscal accountability assuring financial integrity and providing that federal aid funds constitute net increase in resources for the eligible pupils or purposes rather than potentially replacing suppl anting state or local funds that would otherwise be available for the same purpose specific types of requirements intended to support one or more of these purposes include requirements to target resources on specific high need pupil groups or types of localities or schools limit the authorized uses of funds to certain high priority types of services conduct audits or assure that federal funds supplement and do not supplant state and local resources enhance parental participation or provide for equitable treatment of pupils attending nonpublic schools implement minimum qualifications for school staff report to parents and the general public of information on program activities and their impact meet certain student achievement and other outcome goals and evaluate the effectiveness of federally supported instructional services grantees that violate any of these types of regulations implicitly face the possibility of having to repay funds to the federal government or being prohibited from receiving further grants although such sanctions are rarely invoked in some cases authorizing statutes explicitly provide for more limited specific sanctions for states or leas which fail to meet some requirements 3 in addition to such programspecific requirements number of general requirements apply to all recipients of federal education assistance under any program many of these are published in the 3 for example the esea provides that the secretary shall withhold 25 of funds otherwise available for state administration and program improvement activities from states which fail to meet the esea title ia requirements regarding standards and assessments which were originally adopted in the improving americas schools act of 1994 and may withhold additional state administration funds for failure to meet new assessment requirements adopted under the nclb

applicable to lea s and schools in their role as employers eg regulations related to workplace safety environmental protection access for persons with disabilities labor relations etc however state and local educational agencies are given wide latitude in other aspects of the use of federal education assistance such matters as grade levels subject areas and instructional techniques have typically been left almost totally to state and local discretion if requirement is applied to instructional methods under the esea and related programsfor example the requirement applied to selected programs under the nclb that instructional methods be scientifically basedit is almost always broad leaving great scope to state and lea discretion

greater flexibility are often focused on selected range of particular types of requirements program specific requirements that are often the focus of criticism include explicit or implicit prohibitions against commingling mixing of funds under different federal programs with each other or with revenues from state and local programs b restrictions on the use of resources purchased with federal program funds for activities other than those conducted under that program c requirements that aid be targeted on certain types of pupils or schools d eligibility thresholds for special forms of flexibility eg esea title ia schoolwide programs and esea title ia outcome accountability requirements under the nclb 6 in general prohibitions against commingling of fundsa abovearise from efforts to establish fiscal accountability restrictions on the use of instructional resources to the pupils eligible to be served b as well as requirements to target aid on pupils and schools with the greatest incidence of poverty c are intended to focus limited federal funds on those with the greatest needs the eligibility thresholds for certain forms of flexibility such as esea title ia schoolwide programs d have rationales that are discussed later in this report finally the new or expanded outcome accountability requirements which are key element of the nclb are intended to increase

shift the focus away from other types of requirements toward improved outcomes nevertheless from state or local perspective these requirements may sometimes seem to be unnecessarily inflexible especially in relatively low enrollment leas that may receive small grants under each of variety of federal programs while the categorical approach of most of the larger ed programs directs aid at highneed pupil groups like disadvantaged and lep pupils such an approach may have undesirable and unintended effects some of these effects may include fragmentation of services to children with challenges for coordinating special program instruction with their regular inst ruction inefficient use of resources that may remain unused when not required by the special needs pupils treatment of partial needs when more coherent focus on the whole child and herhis entire instructional program might be more effective especially with respect to children with multiple special needs or instruction of pupils in separate settings whether or not this is explicitly required by the legislation when this might not be the most effective instructional technique the traditional federal categorical approach has been criticized as leading to fragmented instruction and focusing more on targeting resources and inputs than on improving achievement and other outcomes for pupils difficulties may also arise from efforts to implement federal programs in st ates and leas with widely varying educational policies and demographic conditions some of these problems with categorical program structures and associated requirements may be based on misunderstandings of the requirements of federal statutes and regulations or overly strict state or local interpretations of these others may be the inevitable effects of efforts to ensure that federal aid is focused on pupils most in need coupled with grantee efforts to avoid problems with federal program monitoring and audits whatever their basis and regardless of whether regulatory burdens have been reduced in recent years state and local education officials sometimes complain about these and other constraints on the use of federal funds

applicable to recipients of federal k12 education assistance first lea staff complained that it was difficult to obtain current accurate and concise information on the wide variety of federal requirements with which they must comply and that existing sources of technical assistance on these matters were inadequate the authors of the gao report concluded that lea staff often respond to such information gaps in cautious manner that unnecessarily limits their flexibilitynamely that they often are unaware of or do not exercise degrees of flexibility that are available to them second staff in most of the surveyed leas expressed concern about the costs of meeting their administrative responsibilities under federal education programs including the preparation of required reports finally

education programs the following discussion will focus primarily on the most broadly applicable and frequently utilized of these which is in title ix part d of the esea as amended by the nclb under this provision the secretary of education is authorized to waive most requirements associated with any program authorized by the esea the waivers must be specifically requested by seas leas indian tribes or schools via their leas waiver requests must include specific measurable educational goals and the methods to be used to measure annually such progress for meeting such goals and outcomes for pupils eligible to be served by the relevant programs with respect to types of requirements that may not be waived the provisions regarding caseby case waivers are generally the same as those for the edflex program however there are four types of requirements that may not be waived under the esea title ixd casebycase waiver authority in addition to those that cannot be waived under edflex 1 prohibitions against consideration of esea funds in state school finance programs 2 prohibitions against use of funds for religious worship or instruction 3 certain prohibitions against use of funds for sex education under esea title ix section 9526 and 4 the eligibility requirements for charter schools under the public charter schools program esea title vb1 esea title ixd also has authority analogous to the edflex provision that requirements generally not subject to waiver may be waived if the underlying purposes of the statutory requirements continue to be met to the satisfaction of the secretary waivers granted under the authority of esea title ixd may not exceed four years except that they may be extended if the secretary determines that the waiver has contributed to improved student achievement and is in the public interest in contrast waivers are to be terminated if the secretary determines that pupil performance or other outcomes are inadequate to justify continuation of the waivers or if the waiver is longer necessary the secretary of education is required to publish notice of the decision to grant waiver in the federal register according to memorandum from eds office of the inspector general dated april 5 2007 the department had failed for several years to publish such notices 13 apparently in response to draft version of this memorandum ed did publish on march 12 2007 list of waivers granted under esea title ixd between the enactment of the child left behind act of 2001 pl 107110 in january 2002 and december 31 2006 total of 197 waivers were granted during this period however relatively few of these were substantiv almost twothirds 128 or 65 were waivers of 50 administrative cost limitation on formula grants for indian education under esea title vii part and another 24 were extensions of the period during which funds under an esea program could be obligated of the remaining 45 waivers granted 18 were related to the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 5 were granted to allow states to participate in pilot program using growth models of adequate yearly progress 14 6 allowed leas to provide supplemental educational services

schools participating in the esea title ia program at which 40 or more of the pupils are from lowincome families are eligible to conduct schoolwide programs with broad and substantial degree of flexibility in the use of funds under almost all federal education programs in schoolwide program federal aid provided under title ia plus many other federal k12 education programs may be used to improve services to all pupils rather than limiting services to particular pupils deemed to be the most disadvantaged if they meet the intent and purposes of title ia and the other federal programs and address the needs of the programs intended beneficiaries schoolwide programs are exempted from variety of regulations under title ia and most other programs with specified exceptions such as regulations regarding health safety civil rights parental participation services to private school pupils and teachers or fiscal accountability title ia and other federal program funds must be used so that they supplement and do not supplant other federal and nonfederal funds that the school would otherwise receive further only commingling or flexibility in the use of funds is authorized with respect to the idea in schoolwide programs all of the ideas programmatic requirements must still be met 17 although the schoolwide program authority applies to wide variety of federal k12 education programs it is of significance primarily with respect to title ia this is because almost all of the other programs affected typically are focused on leas overall not individual schools further to the extent that the nontitle ia programs are focused on individual schools they are not 16 according to john fiegel of the us department of education as of august 1 2002 eight waivers had been granted under this authority five of these waivers were to allow seas to use more than statutory cap of 10 of their public charter schools pcs program funds for dissemination grants one waiver was to allow states governor rather than the sea to administer the pcs program practice which was later discontinued and the final two approved requests were to waive certain impact aid esea title viii provisions

focused on groups of pupils with specific educational needs except for the idea where the schoolwide program authority is specifically limited nevertheless the ability to use title ia funds on schoolwide basis combining them with state and local funds without the need for separate accounting is in itself quite significant form of flexibility in comparison to the traditional targeted assistance title ia program format under which funds may be used only to serve the lowest achieving individual pupils in school there are few additional requirements that schoolwide programs are required to meet in return for this increased flexibility the number of schoolwide programs has grown rapidly in recent years and large majority of the pupils served by title ia are now in schoolwide programs they constitute more than half of title ia schools and large majority of pupils participating in title ia programs 18 the eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs was reduced from 50 to 40 of pupils from lowincome families by the nclb before this many of the edflex and other waivers granted between 1994 and 2001 had allowed schools below the 50 threshold to operate schoolwide programs the rationale for providing schoolwide program authority to relatively high poverty schools is that in such schools all pupils are disadvantaged so most pupils are in need of special assistance and it seems less equitable to select only the lowestachieving individual pupils to receive title ia services and b the level of title ia grants should be sufficient to meaningfully affect overall school services in high poverty schools since these funds are allocated on the basis of the relatively large number of lowincome pupils in these schools the nclb has reduced the eligibility threshold to level that is approximately the national average percentage of pupils from lowincome families which may raise questions regarding the validity of both aspects of this rationale for schools that just meet the new threshold 19 in addition there is little direct evidence of the achievement effects of this expansion of schoolwide programs

among selected esea programs was initially authorized under pl 106554 the consolidated appropriations act of 2001 it was extended in essentially similar form by the nclb the rural education achievement program reap under esea title vib includes both pair of grant programs for rural andor small and relatively high poverty leas plus special 18 according to the latest available data published in state esea title i participation information for 20032004 55 of title ia schools were operating schoolwide programs in 20032004 and these schools served 85 of all pupils served under title ia for that year 19 at the level of individual schools the most commonly used criterion for determining whether pupils are from low income families is eligibility for free andor reducedprice school lunches not the more narrow census poverty income standard the national average percentage of k12 pupils mee ting this criterion in public schools participating in the federal school lunch programs is approximately 391 percentage point less than the 40 schoolwide program threshold in addition the freereduced price school lunch data may overestimate the percentage of pupils from lowincome families as there is evidence th at more children and youth are counted than may be eligible based on family income see officials seek to refine lunch program tallies education week march 27

relevant to this report and is described below leas with total average daily attendance below 600 pupils or which are located in county with population density of fewer than 10 persons per square mile and in which all schools are classified as being in rural locations21 may combine or transfer any funds received under esea titles iia teacher and principal training and recruiting fund iid enhancing education through technology iva safe and drugfree schools and communities and va innovative programs block grant these funds may be used for any activity authorized under any of these programs or under esea titles ia education for the disadvantaged iii english language acquisition and enhancement and ivb 21 st century community learning centers the primary rationale for this authority is that the smallest leas need special flexibility due to the small size of grants which they receive under number of separate programs these amounts typically based in large part on lea enrollment are often too small to support separate programs of sufficient size and scope to be effective lowing such leas to combine andor transfer funds among limited range of program activities may facilitate more effective use of those funds the degree of special flexibility provided to eligible small rural leas under this reap flex authority is similar to different transferability authority described below that is available to almost all leas under the nclb the major differences are that the small rural lea authority applies to 100 of the funds under the affected programs while the broader transferability authority applies to only 50 or in some cases less of such funds and the small rural lea authority includes more programs into which funds may be transferred esea titles iii and iv b in addition perhaps the greatest advantage of the small rural schools flexibility authority is that leas eligible for it are also eligible for supp lementary grants that may be used for any of the purposes for which combined or transferred funds may be used under the flexibility authority according to study released by ed in july 2007 22 participation in reap flex is widespread with approximately 4781 leas eligible and an timated 51 of these participating in the rural lea flexibility authority in 20052006 leas participating in reap flex most often transferred funds out of esea titles iia teacher and principal training and recruiting fund and iva safe and drugfree schools and communities and most frequently into titles ia education for the disadvantaged and va innovative programs block grant rural leas reported that they found this flexibility to be particularly useful because the amount of formula allocations they received under many of the eligible programs was too small to fund substantial school improvement activities the authors of this evaluation also found significant amount of 20 for additional information see crs report rl33804 rural education and the

finally one individual ed program is worthy of mention in the context of special forms of flexibility for states and leas in the use of federal aid funds esea title va innovative programs although the identification of aid programs as categorical versus block grants is always somewhat judgmental esea title v is the one major k12 education program currently administered by ed that is almost univ ersally considered to be block grant in the field of education block grants are aid progra ms covering an exceptionally wide range of educational activities and types of students and providing great deal of flexibility to states and leas in using the funds they are often constructed through consolidation of number of preceding categorical programs that are more limited in the purposes or activities they support in the case of title va the initial consolidation took place in 1981 after reservation of 1 of appropriations for grants to the outlying areas esea title va funds are allocated to the 50 states the district of columbia and puerto rico in proportion to their total population aged 517 years except that state is to receive less than 05 of total grants to states majority of title va funds must be allocated by seas to leas on the basis of state developed formulas these formulas must meet gene ral criteria of taking into consideration each leas enrollment of pupils in public and private nonprofit schools and incorporating adjustments to provide increased grants per pupil to leas with the greatest numbers or percentages of high cost pupils including those from economically disadvantaged families and those living in sparsely populated areas or areas of concentrated poverty the specific minimum percentage of funds that must be suballocated to leas varies depending on the programs aggregate funding level and whether the state receives the minimum grant amount 05 of total grants to states all states must suballocate to leas an amount equal to at least 85 of the grant which they received under this program for fy2002 in addition most states are to suballocate to leas 100 of their title va grants in excess of the fy2002 level however for states receiving the minimum grant amount the minimum share of title va grants above the fy2002 level that must be suballocated to leas is only 50 of the funds that may be retained by states more than 15 may be used for administrative costs the remainder is to be used for one or more of seven specified types of programs and services the latter include the design and implementation of pupil assessments implementation of achievement standards planning and implementation of charter schools independent analysis and reporting on lea achievement apparently the implementation of policies to offer public school choice options to pupils attending unsafe schools 23 school repair and renovation and broad category of statewide education reform school improvement programs and technical assistance and direct grants to leas section 51213 leas may use their title va funds for any of 27 different types of innovative assistance programs listed in section 5131 several of these are relatively specific such as planning and implementation of charter schools programs to provide same gender schools and classrooms 23 the language of esea title va on this point contains an incorrect reference to nonexistent section 9507 it appears that the intended reference was to section 9532 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31583g13g556g343g344g561g7g141 g158g140g138g157g146g152g151g561 g561

improve the academic achievement of educationally disadvantaged elementary and secondary school students it is essentially because of the existence of these broad catchall categories of authorized use of funds by leas and states that title va is generally considered to be block grant in addition the statute includes prohibit ion against seas exercising influence over lea decisions on how title va

the program now authorized by esea title va was first enacted in 1981 pl 9735 as chapter 2 of the education consolidation and improvement act ecia which consolidated more than 40 previous federal k12 education programs chapter 2 was the legislative response to reagan administration proposal for much broader block grant into which almost all federal k12 education programs would have been consolidated the block grant initially reduced the number of federal education programs howeve r many new categorical programs were authorized in the years immediately following doption of the consolidated program including some that were essentially direct successors to programs initially consolidated into the block grant eg aid for magnet schools the most recent study by ed of the program study of educational resources and federal funding final report august 2000 based on survey of representative sample of leas found that 58 of recipient leas used great deal of their title va funds for instructional materials while 39 of leas used substantial funds for educational technology and 34 of leas for supplemental targeted academic services large leas were found to be especially likely to use title va funds for teacher professional development services and schoolbased improvement efforts resources or services funded by this program were found to be infrequently targeted at particularly highneed pupils or schools it was also reported that the primary factors influencing decisions on the use of title va funds were longterm lea plans and the priorities of individual schools appropriations have steeply declined over the life of title va from 442 million in fy1982 the first year of funding to 99 million for fy2007 further p l 110161 the consolidated appropriations act for fy2008 provides zero funds for title va raising the possibility that the program is being effectively terminated at least in terms of direct appropriations one reason for this trend is that there have been few constituencies promoting increased funding for the program although it is apparently popular with broad rang of state and local public education officials as well as many private school administrators its support seems to be diffuse in recent years the direct appropriation for title va has been supplemented by funds transferred into the programs under the reap flex see above and transferability see below authorities and this trend seems likely to continue as possibly the only source of funding for this program limited information on the effects of title va services may have reduced incentives to maintain the programs funding level title va has tended to receive less favorable treatment in funding decisions than programs that could demonstrate targeting of funds or linkage to improved 24 this prohibition would not apply to states participating in new stateflex authority which is described later in this report

adopted in the years preceding enactment of the nclb are sometimes cited as providing increased flexibility to states and leas these are not discussed in detail here because their potential impact is substantially more marginal than those of the flexibility authorities described above andor their impact is primarily in the area of administrative convenience for seas or leas these additional forms of flexibility include authority for consolidated sea or lea applications plans or reports for number of esea and related programs and authority to consolidate certain funds used for sea or lea

of the relatively limited amount of program funds over which they have authority except for administrative funds among the first four of these programs plus the 21st century community learning centers program thus states could not transfer either any of the funds they are required to suballocate to leas or funds reserved for state administration so the significance of this transferability authority for states is limited the overall scale of the programs subject to this authority is moderately significantthe fy2008 appropriations for the four programs subject to lea transferability authority total approximately 35 billion the transferability authority is relatively simple and straightforward it is available to most leas without the need for specific application or approval although state or lea plans must be modified to reflect the transfers and lea s must inform their sea further the range of purposes for which transferred funds might be used is especially wide given that one of the programs into which funds could be shifted is the innovative programs block grant nevertheless all program requirements continue to apply to the transferred funds including any requirements regarding shares of program funds which must or may be used for specified purposes funds cannot be transferred across fiscal years and all of the affected programs would continue to exist in places where the authority is exercised since state or lea could transfer more than 50 of its funds out of any program according to study released by ed in july 2007 26 participation in transferability is relatively modest with approximately 1216 of leas participating in 20052006 estimates of the level of participation are complicated in part by the significant confusion at the lea level between reap flex and transferability authorities as well as many instances of conflicting reports on use of transferability between leas and seas ie cases where states identified leas as participating in the programs but the leas reported that they did not and viceversa as with reap flex leas participating in transferability most often moved funds out of esea title iia teacher and principal training and recruiting fund and to lesser extent title iva safe and drugfree schools and communities and most frequently into titles ia education for the disadvantaged and va innovative programs block grant many leas reported using transferability to partially compensate for reductions in formula grants under esea title ia and va to better target resources on schools failing to meet adequate yearly progress standards under title ia or to be able to use funds with the high degree of flexibility allowed under title va according to this evaluation report the reasons most frequently cited by leas for not participating in transferability included lack of information about the authority satisfaction with the existing level of flexibility under affected federal programs or funding levels too low to carry out desired activities even if the transferability authority were exercised continued httpwwwedgovprogramstransferabilitylegislationhtml 26 flexibility evaluation

beginning in spring 2002 ed conducted multifaceted sometimes complex series of competitions for stateflex and localflex authority however there has ultimately been very little interest by states and leas in obtaining these authorities as noted above currently only one lea has ever participated in localflex nd states in stateflex one state and eight associated leas initially received approval to participate in these programs but they subsequently withdrew with respect to both stateflex and localflex recent ed study 29 reported that major barriers to participation included additional responsibilities but few or clear benefits limited organizational capacity especially during period when many new nclb requirements had to be met and limited dissemination of information about the programs new round of competition for these authorities began on march 18 2004 when ed published in the federal register an announcement of new simultaneous round of competition for both stateflex and localflex there is deadline for this competition the announcement indicated that as an extra inducement to apply states and leas participating in stateflex or localflex would receive preference in future competitions for grants under relevant discretionary grant programs administered by the department the rationale offered for this preference is that stateflex and localflex participants have undergone comprehensive planning to improve teacher quality and the academic achievement of all students especially disadvantaged students and are held to higher degree of accountability 30 28

g3g140g157g561 in comparison to the transferability authority described earlier stateflex and localflex are relatively broad since all of the funds under the affected programs may be involved the funds may be used for any purpose authorized under any esea program including the exceptionally wide range of activities authorized under titl va and only comparatively small number of specified program requirements apply to the use of these funds at the same time the scope of stateflex and localflex is more narrow in th sense that only maximum of seven states and 410 leas in each of these plus up to 80 leas in other states may participate nevertheless as indicated above interest in these provisions on the part of seas and leas has thus far been very limited in spite of multiple invitations to compete for them over an extended period of time the scope of the stateflex authority in particular is limited in at least two respects first although state administration funds may be used for other purposes under this authority states are still responsible for meeting their administrative responsibilities under each program second for many of these programs the overall share of funds that may be used for state administration plus statelevel activities is relatively small and it is smallest for the largest affected program this relevant share of state total grants varies from 1 for esea title ia by far the largest program involved to high of 265 under the safe and drugfree schools and communities program however participating states would also be given substantial influence over the use of funds consolidated by the 410 leas with local performance agreements and over the use of innovative programs block grant funds in all of the states leas in some respects participating leas in the state demonstration program might have diminished flexibility because their use of consolidated funds must be aligned with the state use of funds which they may consolidate and because of the authority given to participating states to specify lea use of title va funds finally the inclusion of the esea title va innovative programs block grant in the localflex authority ie in states which do not participate in stateflex is of limited significance in the sense that those funds may already be used for an exceptionally wide range of activities

senatepassed version of hr 1 would have provided significantly greater flexibility than the enacted stateflex and localflex authorities in return for at least marginally increased outcome accountability at the same time all of these authorities are substantially more limited than optional performance agreementgrant consolidation proposals considered but not enacted during the 106th congress32 the scope of the hr 1senate flexibilityperformance agreement authority was the same in terms of the maximum number of participating states 7 and more narrow in number of leas in other states 25 which could participate the types of program requirements eg civil rights fiscal accountability which continued to apply to the use of consolidated funds was similar however the range of esea programs subject to the flexibility authority was much more broad and involved substantially higher levels of funding incorporating most stateadministered formula grant programs authorized by the esea in cluding such programs as title ia grants for education of the disadvantaged 33 and limited english proficientimmigrant education as with stateflex and localflex funds could be used for activities authorized under any of the combined programs including the exceptionally wide range of authorized activities under the innovative programs block grant under the performance agreement authority participating states could in general have reallocated funds under all of the affected programs among and within leas as long as the resulting allocations targeted funds on concentrations of poor children at least as well as the statutory formulas stateflex provides similar authority to reallocate funds among leas the additional element of outcome accountability required of participating states and leas under the senate version of hr 1 is that they would have been required to exceed ayp goals by statistically significant amount this would mean that achievement gains in excess of those required under state ayp standards must be sufficiently large that they are unlikely to have resulted from random variations in pupil achievement scores while statistically significant such an amount would not necessarily be large especially in state or lea with large pupil population

states andor leas to use federal aid funds more thoroughly in accordance with their own priorities which may or may not be consistent with federal priorities than would otherwise be possible each of the special flexibility authorities is significantly limited in terms of the number of states and leas that may participate the number and size of the esea and related programs affected andor the range of program requirements that may be waived with the major exceptions of the transferability authority the innovative programs block grant and title ia school wide programs states andor leas are allowed to waive variety of federal program requirements in return for some degree of accountability based on pupil achievement outcomes however the outcome accountability requirements are essentially just increased attention to andor consequences related to outcom accountability requirements that are applicable to all states and leas participating in title ia and other esea programs these special flexibility authorities particularly those enacted as part of the nclb have been adopted in policy context of substantially increased accountability requirements and authorized degrees of flexibility in general for the esea and related federal programs at least one of the flexibility authorities adopted under the nclb has been utilized by an estimated 1216 of all leas transferability while interest in others has been very limited stateflex localflex however reap flex is the most widely used flexibility authority among eligible small rural leas the flexibility authorities often include variety of requirements for regular reporting on ways in which the authorities have been used and the impact of increased flexibility on pupil achievement however there is very limited information regarding the specific impact of special forms of flexibility on pupil achievement selected crosscutting issues associated with these and other common characteristics of special flexibility authorities are discussed below

the primary concerns of states and leas about restrictions on the use of federal funds or administrative burdens accompanying participation in federal programs while broad in terms of the potential uses of funds and federal programs covered the esea title ia schoolwide program authority is limited to the school level and only schools with lowincome pupil rates somewhat above average may generally qualify further as noted earlier the significance of this authority with respect to programs other than title ia is quite limited the secretarial casebycase waiver authorities are limited by the necessity of submitting individual requests to the us secretary of ed ucation in most cases leas must similarly apply to their seas for waivers under the edflex authority while almost all states and most leas may exercise the fund transferability authority none may transfer more than 50 of the funds httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31583g13g556g343g344g561g7g141 g158g140g138g157g146g152g151g561 g561

associated with participating in any of the affected programs must still be met the rural lea flexibility authority is available to only select group of exceptionally lowenrollment leas in addition the amount of funds subject to statefl ex authority is limited and only seven states may participate localflex authority affects only limited range of programs and is available in maximum of only 80 leas plus 2870 leas in st ateflex states the limited increase in flexibility provided by these authorities is probable reason for the very low rate of participation in these authorities thus far importantly there are several types of requirements that cannot be waived under any of these authorities including those involving fiscal acco untability participation by private school pupils and staff or the increasingly important esea title ia requirements regarding standards assessments and schoollea accountability for pupil achievement it is noteworthy that many of the flexibility authorities do not include the largest esea program title ia and none of them would allow states to reallocate funds among leas further the authors of 1999 government accountability office gao report elementary and secondary education edflex states vary in implementation of waiver process hehs9917 found that the flexibility authorities enacted as of that time do not address the main regulatory burdens of states and leas which are associated with requirements under the idea the americans with disabilities act child nutrition program administration and environmental requirements eg underground storage tanks and asbestos removal according to this gao report sea staff in some states think edflex is of limited value because of the relatively few programs and requirements that may be waived in contrast sea staff in other states think its usefulness extends beyond specific use of the authority through creating climate that encourages innovation and flexibility these remarks would apply also to the new authorities enacted in 2001 and 2002 finally it is significant that these authorities have been adopted during period when regular federal program requirements have become more flexible in some important respects for programs such as esea title ia the increased emphasis on outcome accountability beginning in 1994 and continuing under the nclb has been accompanied by generally increased flexibility for all leas and schools in determining how funds may be used especially in the schoolwide programs which have become the dominant service mode for this program the nclb consolidated major groups of programs related to teachers and educational technology giving states and leas substantially greater flexibility in deciding how to use these funds in this context the additional flexibility provided by the special authorities described above seems relatively marginal in many respects

increased flexibility in federal education programs often argue that waivers can remove federal regulatory barriers to local ed ucational reform and initiative very limited information is available on the use of the new forms of flexibility authorized under the nclb partly because of low participation in some of them available information on waivers granted under prenclb authorities indicates that they have been used for relatively few purposes at httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31583g13g556g343g344g561g7g141 g158g140g138g157g146g152g151g561 g561

reform in addition several of the requirements which were frequently waived in the past were subsequently eliminated or made less restrictive for all states and leas by the nclb at the same time the esea title ixd authority has been used to allow limited number of states to participate in growth model pilot for determining adequate yearly progress ayp under the esea title ia accountability provisions widely supported modification of that program as was discussed above recent study prepared for ed34 found that under the two recently adopted forms of flexibility authority that are widely usedreap flex and transferabilitythis authority was most often used to move funds out of esea title iia teacher and principal training and recruiting fund and to lesser ex tent title iva safe and drugfree schools and communities and most frequently into titles ia education for the disadvantaged and va innovative programs block grant many leas reported using these authorities to partially compensate for reductions in formula grants under esea title ia and va to better target resources on schools failing to meet adequate early progress standards under title ia or to be able to use funds with the high degree of flexibility allowed under title va in the prenclb era secretarial waivers edflex and other prenclb flexibility authorities during the mid to late1990s were most often used to waive the following requirements 1 the minimum lowincome pupil percentage threshold for esea title ia schoolwide program eligibility before this was reduced under the nclb 2 withinlea targeting of title ia funds on schools with the highest number or percentage of pupils from lowincome families 3 deadlines for adoption and implementation of standards and assessments under esea title ia and 4 series of limitations on the use of fu nds under two prenclb programs related to teacher recruitment and training the class size reduction csr and eisenhower professional development programs 35 each of these categories is briefly discussed below although schoolwide programs offer great deal of flexibility to use funds under not only title i but also most other federal programs in ways that might not ordinarily be allowed it has been questioned whether schools with relatively low percentages of their pupils from lowincome families should be granted this authority if schools with relatively low poverty rates receive permission to operate schoolwide programs the scope of these programs might be limited since the size of schools title ia grant is based on its number of children from lowincome families and it would be difficult for such modest program to have significant schoolwide impact further systematic evidence is available that schoolwide programs are more effective than more traditional targeted assistance title ia programs in improving the education of disadvantaged pupils the use of waivers to maintain or expand the number of schools participating in title ia would tend to disperse title ia funds among an increased number of relatively lowpoverty schools reducing the concentration of funds on highpoverty schools as noted above edflex places restrictions on but does not prohibit waivers regarding esea title ia school selection the use of waivers to delay meeting deadlines for implementing esea title ia standard and assessment requirements arguably undercut the most substantial prenclb outcome 34 flexibility evaluation 35 see for example the notice of waivers granted federal register may 2 2000 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31583g13g556g343g344g561g7g141

this increasingly important aspect of federal requirements is discussed further below with respect to the former csr and eisenhower programs leas and states frequently requested the waiver of requirements intended to focus teacher hiring on the early elementary grades require small leas to form consortia if their csr grants were too small to pay the salary of new teacher ensure that minimum shares of teacher training funds would be used to support instruction in the subject areas of mathematics and science or to limit the share of csr funds used for professional development as opposed to hiring new teachers such waivers appear generally to have been requested to accommodate relatively strict and specific limitations on the use of funds to varying local conditions following enactment of the nclb some of thes formerly common uses of edflex and other prenclb flexibility authorities are longer as relevant as in the past as noted earlier the nclb lowered the schoolwide program eligibility threshold to 40 of pupils from lowincome families nationwide although some may still seek edflex or secretarial waivers for schools below 40 to conduct schoolwide programs the csr and eisenhower programs were consolidated into broader and more flexible esea title ii program supporting teacher and principal recruitment and training as noted earlier relatively few substantive waivers have been grated under the esea title ixd during the postnclb era g11g150g153g138g140g157g561g152g143g561g8g149g142g161g146g139g146g149g146g157g162g561 regarding the impact of special forms of flexibility on pupil achievement or other outcomes only limited information has been available although states that received edflex authority have been required to submit annual reports to ed on waivers granted and their impact the information reported by the original 12 edflex states under the prepl 10625 authority was of limited value and reports have yet been published on the actual purposes of waivers or their effects in states under the edflex authority enacted in 1999 36 anecdotal information on the achievement effects of number of edflex and secretarial waivers in limited number of leas was included in 1999 ed report waivers flexibility to achieve high standards the information in this report was primarily limited to whether affected leas or schools met state ayp standards in effect at the time at the same time supporters of special flexibility authorities often point to broader forms of evidence of their impact on state and local public education systems these arguments are reflected in 1998 ed report on edflex37 the authors of which concluded that edflex authority has supported standardsbased reform in the affected states in three major ways edflex facilitates the coordination of programs and strengthens the planning process by encouraging leas and schools to develop instructional programs without regard to the perceived constraints of many standard federal or state program requirements 36 see 2001 report to congress on the implementation of the education flexibility partnership act of 1999 july 25 2001 37 goals 2000 reforming education

administration of programs by reducing paperwork deemed unessential to meeting basic purposes of federal programs edflex supports the use of resources in way that can together with the implementation of standardsbased approaches lead to increased student achievement and reduction in the gap in achievement between different populations by shifting oversight focus away from inputs or procedures and toward outcomes

which special forms of flexibility have been granted the conclusions by ed immediately above should presumably be considered to be debatable this is related to final aspect of this set of issues will sufficient information be available on the use of special flexibility authorities and their effects on pupil achievement to make it possible to analyze or judge their benefits and impact as mentioned earlier while the statutes authorizing several forms of flexibility include significant requirements for reporting to and by ed on the use of waivers and other special authorities and the pupil achievement and other effects of these activities little relevant information has been disseminated by ed efforts by ed to compile and publish information on the use of waiver or other special flexibility authorities seem to have been priority only infrequently this makes it very difficult to evaluate the significance advantages and disadvantages of these flexibility authorities

basic question regarding all special forms of flexibility is whether the increased emphasis on outcomes that is typically associated with themwhether or not such additional outcome requirements are substantialis an adequate substitute for other forms of accountability requirements such as required targeting of services on priority activities or high need pupil groups which may be diminished through the grant of flexibility in general the outcome accountability requirements associated with either obtaining or maintaining the special flexibility authorities in this report are combination of goals established by the states and leas themselves either in the implementation of programs such as edflex or in competing for and ultimately implementing stateflex or localflex authority and b meeting the stateestablished adequate yearly progress ayp requirements under esea title ia in some cases such as the innovative programs block grant or title ia schoolwide programs there is direct linkage between the flexibility authority and any form of outcome accountability 38 38 like all schools participating in title ia schoolwide programs must meet ayp standards but their eligibility to operate as schoolwide program is not dependent on meeting the ayp requirements httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31583g13g556g343g344g561g7g141 g158g140g138g157g146g152g151g561 g561

study39 which found that states granted edflex authority under the original prepl 10625 legislation differed substantially in the clarity and specificity of their outcome goals related to the granting of waivers five of the original 12 edflex states had set specific objectives at all for leas or schools being granted waivers and only one of the states had established outcome objectives that were specifically linked to the leas schools and pupils affected by the waivers the gao study further concluded that ed oversight of edflex implementation by the states was limited involving mostly the collection of annual reports from the states with highly varying degrees of detail in the information they provided if such practices continue then the most significant and the only concrete outcome accountability requirement associated with any of the special flexibility authorities is b above meeting ayp requirements thus the current flexibility authorities do not actually require substantial additional outcome accountability for participating leas and statesthat is accountability for pupil outcomes beyond that which is applicable to all other states and leas participating in title ia and other esea programs instead they place increased emphasis on attention to and consequences for failing to meet generally applicable outcome accountability requirements although this outcome requirement is not an additional one in comparison to states and leas which do not receive special flexibility authority it may nevertheless be substantial as states continue to implement the ayp and related requirements under the nclb 40 while all schools leas and states are required to meet these requirements and are to face variety of consequences if they fail to do so those with special flexibility authority would have an additional incentive to meet the requirements ie to maintain their eligibility to exercise the flexibility authority and an additional negative consequence of failing to do so while limited such an enhancement of outcome accountability requirements may be consistent with the nature of the special flexibility authorities described in this report in many respects both the additional flexibility and the increased outcome accountability are quite limited at the same time these provisions take effect in the context of recent legislation particularly the nclb which substantially expands both outcome accountability requirements and at least in some major respects flexibility in the use of federal aid funds for all states leas and schools whether or not they have been granted one of the special flexibility authorities described in this report 41 finally some proponents of high degrees of state and local flexibility in the use of federal k12 education aid funds often argue that increase in outcome or other accountability requirements is necessary to justify the granting of special forms of flexibility to such proponents increasing the ability of states and leas to use federal funds for purposes which they deem to be most appropriate and effective is sufficient justification for such policies and is most likely to lead to improved pupil outcomes 39 elementary and secondary education edflex states vary in implementation of waiver process gaohehs99 17 november 13 1998 40 for discussion of the ayp and other esea title ia acc ountability
