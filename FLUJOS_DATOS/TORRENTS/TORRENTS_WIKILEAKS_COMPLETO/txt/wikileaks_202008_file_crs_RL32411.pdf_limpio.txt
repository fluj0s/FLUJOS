twork centric warfare is key component of dod planning for transformation of the military network centric operations nco relies on computer equipment and networked communications technology to provide shared awareness of the battle space for us forces proponents sa that shared awareness increases synergy for command and control resulting in superior decisionmaking and the ability to coordinate complex military operations over long distances for an overwhelming warfighting advantage nco technology saw limited deployment in afghanistan and more recently increased deployment in operation iraqi freedom oif several dod key programs are now underway for deployment throughout all services congress may be concerned with oversight of the dod organization and the individual services as they transform through nco programs that are intended to promote management style and culture with joint objectives oversight may involve review of service efforts to improve interoperability of computer and communications systems and may also involve questions from some observers about whether dod has given adequate attention to possible unintended outcomes resulting from overreliance on high technology updates may also be required on emerging threats that may be directed against increasingly complex military equipment this report describes technologies that support nco and includes 1 questions about possible vulnerabilities associated with nco 2 description of electronic weapons and other technologies that could be used as asymmetric countermeasures against nco systems 3

provides background information and discusses possible oversight issues for congress regarding dods strategy for implementing network centric approach to warfare otherwise known as network centric operations nco nc forms central part of the administrations plans for defense transformation proponents argue that network centric appr oach may improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of us combat operations however when nco was originally envisioned the us military was structured to counter conventional threats including possibly two regional war scenarios involving national armies1 now partly from recognition that us forces were inadequately prepared for the insurgency in ir aq and the wider hunt for terrorists worldwide dod reportedly may be considering new policy that places less emphasis on waging conventional warfare and more on dealing with counterinsurgency terrorist networks and other nontraditional threats 2 some observers now question the effectiveness of network centric operations and its relevance to different types of conflict including close urban combat others argue that technology may be dictating military strategy and point out that the militarys extreme reliance on high technology may also present new vulnerability that adversaries may exploit 3 still others pose questions about 1 the interoperability of information systems for joint and coalition forces 2 shortage of available bandwidth to support net centric operations and 3 possible unexpected outcomes when organizations rely on datadependent systems

that is occurring in many countries around the world defense transformation for the us military involves largescale and possibly disruptive changes in military weapon systems organization and concepts of operations these changes are the result of technology advances or the emergence of new international security challenges4 many observers believe that us military transformation is necessary to

dod must transform to achieve fundamentally joint network centric distributed force structure capable of rapid decision superiority to meet this goal dod is building doctrine training and procurement practices to create culture of continual transformation that involves people processes and systems past experimentation to stimulate wider innov ation for military operations and nco has been coordinated by the dod office of force transformation oft however dod plans to shift many ongoing technology initiatives formerly managed by the oft into the dod research and engineering directorate in addition reorganization of the office of the dod undersecretary for policy will lead to establishment of new office of strategic futures which will examine technology issues that may affect us defense policies the reorganization is reportedly planned for early 2007 and will require congressional approval for new assistant secretary position 6

application of information age concepts to speed communications and increase situational awar eness through networking improves both the efficiency and effectiveness of military operations proponents advocate that this allows combat units to be smaller in size operate more independently and effectively and undertake different range of missions than nonnetworked forces7 networked sensors are sources of data and data is processed into information nco is intended to increase collaboration through enabling the free flow of information across the battlespace so that acquired data is shared processed into information and then provided quickly to the person or system that needs it8 proponents argue that strong and flexible network linking military forces will speed up the pace of warfare prevent or reduce fratricide and also provide the means for getting more combat power out of smaller force 9 these proponents also argue that theory and practice have merged through achieving proof of concept in the major operations phase of operation iraqi freedom and that nco is now an accepted and enduring part of current and future combat10 procurement 5 us department of defense transformation

economic efficiency by eliminating stovepipe systems parochial interests redundant and noninteroperable systems and by optimizing capital planning investments for present and future information technology systems command and control objectives of nco include the following 1 selfsynchronization or doing what need s to be done without traditional orders 2 improved understanding of higher commands intent 3 improved understanding of the operational situation at all levels of command 4 increased ability to tap into the collective knowledge of all us and coalition forces to reduce the fog and friction commonly referred to in descriptions of fighting11 some argue that as new concepts and technologi are proven over time nco may also become stabilizing deterrence against extended conflict for example if adversary targets are neutralized by nco systems before they can engage in fighting with us forces then the battle can be finished before it has really begun12 others argue that wealthy countries now only have temporary advantage which may be reduced as nco technology becomes less expensive and as technical knowledge spreads to other nations and also to terrorist groups13 hence to maintain its advantage the united states must continue to refine the uses of technology to increase adaptability for both joint and coalition nco operations other observers have wondered whether proponents of nco are making claims that create unrealistic expectations they wonder if the dod model for network centric operations may underestimate an enemys ability to deceive high technology sensors or block the information necessary for nco to be effective possible vulnerability cited by observers may be the fact that dod has openly published its plans for using nco technologies in future warfare thus giving an enemy time to create strategies to avoid strengths and attack weaknesses 14

however the command and control objectives of nco seem to align closely with many of the key properties of complexity nonlinear interaction decentralization and selforganization proponents of nco support the theory that power is increasingly derived from information sharing information access and speed this view is reportedly also supported by results of recent military operational experiences16 showing that when forces are truly joint with comprehensively integrated capabilities and operating according to the principles of nco they can fully exploit the highly pathdependent17 nature of information age warfare some resulting military advantages that are expected from applying nco systems to military operations include the following 1 networked forces can consist of smallersize units that can travel lighter and faster meaning fewer troops with fewer platforms and carrying fewer supplies may be able to perform mission effectively or differently at lower cost 2 networked forces can fight using new tactics during oif us army forces utilized movement that was described by some as swarm tactics because networking allows soldiers to keep track of each other when they are out of one anothers sight forces in iraq could move forward spread out in smaller independent units avoiding the need to maintain tight formation using swarm tactics unit movements are conducted quickly without securing the rear network technologies enable all units to know each others location if one unit gets into trouble other independent units nearby can quickly come to their aid by swarming to attack the enemy from all directions at once benefits may include the following 1 it is harder for an enemy to effectively attack widely dispersed formation 2 combat units can cover much more ground because they do not have to maintain formation 3 knowing the location of all friendly units reduces fratricide during combat operations and 4 swarming can allow an attack to be

urban warfare in iraq nco has reportedly reduced fratricide among friendly forces21 however in afghanistan and iraq the insurgents mix in with the population and are able to get very close to us

scientific status despite its mesmerizing transformational luster they also state that the nco thesis simultaneously overstates the promise of information and communications technology while being incapable of adequately realizing the great potential the technology does offer27 their argument is that nco theory has several paradoxes including 1 proper definition of nco yet exists but proponents claim that expe rimentation supports the nco hypothesis 2 experimental evidence equally supports multiple alternative explanations for potentially improved performance with networking and 3 the conclusions of proponents are based on an invalid notion of knowledge development known as inductivisim these researchers maintain that close examination of the structure of repeated nco experiments shows that the only hypothesis that has actually been tested is refutation of the theory that networks cannot yield improvements finally these researchers have asked how it can be possible for faults to remain unrecognized despite troubling results found through critical review and testing they warn that contemporary military theory may be encouraging nco proponents to seek confirmation and ignore refutation of their ideas

that shared situational awareness enables collaboration and self synchronization and enhances speed of command which increasing mission effectiveness critics however are concerned that dangerous assumptions are being made by military planners about how future forces will benefit from infor mation dominance to such degree that fewer soldiers will be needed or that us forces will not require as much protection because they will be able to act ahead of enemy action they believe that the doctrine of see first act first that underlies nco may be flawed because the tempo of operations may outpace the ability of us forces to assess and respond 28 while network may provide better access to information usually about the activities of ones own side that information may not be complete and may not necessarily enable an accurate understanding of the situation they have indicated that sensorbased situational awareness may not reflect an accurate picture of operational reality29 other observers say that the military leaderships commitment to nco may stifle useful criticism from operational commanders these observers question whether the us military is constructing it forces to

some military researchers say that opponents using guerilla tactics can significantly reduce the value of hightechnology security measures and that the utility of nco can be less certain in urban counterinsurgency operations31 when nco is employed against conventional forces sensor detects target passes information to decisionmaking process the most effective weapon available is selected and the target is engaged however when opponents hide behind walls in sewers or inside buildings they may be difficult for nco sensors to detect if the enemy is better at concealment than us forces are at finding them then our forces may also become more vulnerable 32 some observers report that during operation iraqi freedom oif in order to understand the enemy us forces had to go out and meet them on the ground meaning that effective reconnaissance often required engaging the enemy in close combat these observers say that interviews with oif warfighters suggested that modern surveillance technology did not alter that condition and in some instances did not provide forces in iraq in spring 2003 and onwards with very much insight on the opposing forces 33 this suggests that dod should perhaps reexamine several of its basic assumptions about nco and the power of technology for surveillance and information dominance

land sea and in the air for example observers estimate that at least 31 million lines of computer code will be required to operate the army future combat system43 also many military combat systems which now operate as stand alone equipment will eventually be tied into network systems44 however as complexity grows components of networked systems may sometimes process information received from other systems whose capabilities intentions and trustworthiness are not always known45 recent article published by the carnegie mellon software engineering institute about the growing complexity of military computerized systems argues the following with modern complex systems of systems most systems are described as unbounded because they involve an unknown number of participants or otherwise require individual participants to act and interact in the absence of needed information for the complex systems of systems being constructed today and defined for the future it is longer possible for any human or automated component to have full knowledge of the system each component must depend on information received from other systems whose capabilities intentions and trustworthiness are unknown unbounded systems of systems are fast becoming the norm in many of the most demanding military and commercial applications these include commandandcontrol systems air traffic control systems

triggered accidentally by normal actions of users and automated components or exploited consciously by intelligent adversaries often when problems of interoperability arise in complex systems there is tendency to try to gain greater visibility to extend central control and to impose stronger standards not only are these actions ineffective in complex systems they also increase the likelihood of certain kinds of accidents user errors and other failures what are called normal accidents are inherent and occur naturally in complex systems the frequency of normal accidents increases with the degree of coupling in systems coupling is increased by central control overly restrictive specifications and broadly imposed interface standards developers of systems of systems should strive for

rely on general purpose opensource commercial computer software for the command control and communications functions in advanced defense systems for tanks aircraft and other complex equipment an example of opensource code is the popular com puter operating system known as linux which has been developed by worldwide community of programmers who continuously add new software features by building on each others openlyshared source code subscriptions can be purchased from different commercial vendors who will provide technical support for specific versions of the linux opensource software in contrast proprietary code created by other commercial vendors is called closedsource and includes software products such as microsoft windows both opensource and closedsource products which are supported by commercial software vendors are commonly referred to as commercialofftheshelf cots however opensource software appears much less expensive than proprietary software and the reputation it has earned for general soundness and reliability is helping opensource software gain acceptance by different government organizations and the global business community nsa has researched secure version of linux but it is not clear that all military computer systems that use linux are restricted by the results of that research 50 some experts believe that opensource software violates many security prin ciples and may be subverted by adversaries who could secretly insert malicious code to cause complex defense systems to malfunction other computer experts disagree stating that prec isely because linux is openly reviewed by worldwide community of contributing programmers it has security that cannot easily be compromised by foreign agency the open review by many contributors acts as safeguard against insertion of malicious code recent study by the defense information syst ems agency disa states that dod currently uses significant variety of opensource comput er software programs and concluded that open source software is vital to dod information security this is partly because many information security tools used by dod are built using open source code and effective counterparts are not available from proprietary cots products the study also states that dod web services and dod software development would be disrupted wi thout continued use of opensource software this is because many tools that are basic to web design and software development are based on opensource code 51 experts at the naval post graduate school reportedly have stated that software subversion can only be avoided by using highassurance software that has been proven to be free of any malicious code52 because of the added development rigor and intensive test procedures required to achieve such proof highassurance software would cost considerably more than opensource software53 however researchers at the massachusetts institute of technology have reportedly 50 see nsa security

intelligence recently the army deployed the coalition military network new satellite communications system designed to add bandwidth to support coalition forces in remote areas of iraq however despite the growing number of military satellites the defense information systems agency disa reported that up to 84 percen t of the satellite communications bandwidth provided to the operation iraqi freedom oif theater was supplied by commercial satellites63 some drawbacks using commercial satellite services became apparent during oif us army officials indicated that the high volume of traffic on iridium communications satellites at times overwhelmed that system which also had to suspend service periodically for updates in addition the military reportedly was unable to get encrypted data transmission services from the inmarsat satellite system at transmission rates of 128 kilobits per second and instead had to settle for rates of 64 kilobits per second which was too slow for the armys needs 64 the transformational satellite communications tsa t program run by the air force is part of plan to build satellitebased military internet the future tsa t program involves launching 5 military satellites in geosynchronous orbit with laser communication links and internetlike routers to provide highspeed highcapacity communications to us warfighters worldwide65 the first tsat satellite is scheduled to be launched in 2014 with full operational capacity scheduled for 201866 the united states remains highlydependent on space assets and has enjoyed space dominance during previous gulf conflicts largely because its adversaries simply did not exploit space or act to negate us space systems however the united states may not be able to rely on this same advantage in the future for example nonstate group could possibly take advantage of commercial spacebased technology by leasing satellite bandwidth or by purchasing high resolution imagery from suppliers in the soviet union china or other countries that own and operate space assets also lesstechnically advanced nations and nonstate actors may employ electronic jamming techniques or launch attacks against satellite ground facilities 67 news

increase in military demand for bandwidth largely due to efforts to speed up the delivery of digital information defense officials remain concerned about whether the bandwidth available through dod communications systems will grow to keep up with increasing military demand in the future some observers question whether enough bandwidth will be available in the future to support dod plans for major nco systems such as the future combat system warfare information network tactical and joint tactical radio system 70 when the supply of bandwidth becomes inadequate during combat military operations officers have sometimes been forced to subjectively prioritize the transmission of messages they do this by literally pulling the plug temporarily on some radio or computer switching equipment in order to free up enough bandwidth to allow the highestpriority messages to get through this can delay messages or cancel other data transmissions latency or delays in information updates resulting from bandwidth shortage could leave some units attempting to fight on their computer screens with outdated information when the enemy change s position faster than the screen image data can be updated an example of this type of problem occurred in april 2003 when us army battalion was surprised by large force of iraqi tanks and troops because intelligence systems were unable to update enemy information in databases quickly enough to keep front line units accurately informed 71 by the year 2010 the congressional budget office estimates that the supply of effective bandwidth in the

joint tactical radio system jtrs is intended to enable faster more streamlined communications among many different types of forces but stalled development of this system may have created an obstacle to the full implementation of netcentric operations 156 originally the jtrs program was intended to replace dod legacy radios operating between 2 megahertz and 2 gigahertz and which were not designed to communicate with each other however requirements were modified in 2004 so that future jtrs radios would also include frequencies above 2 gigahertz to allow communication with satellites and to support future access to the military global information grid to spur development of jtrs dod in november 2004 developed policy that restricted the purchase of nonjtrs radios already on the market however this policy was cited by congress as an impediment to meeting the needs of operational commanders in the field 157 jtrs is seen now as program to enhance rather than replace existing legacy

strategy for implemen ting nco incorporate the right technologies and strategy for acquisition some observers have stated there is not enough coordination between dod and the private sector officials involved in information technology acquisition162 others have suggested that the acquisitions community mu st communicate more directly with the most forward areas of the military where the business processes deliver value to the warfighter so that needs are more clearly understood 163 dod directive 5000 requires that acquisition for all equipment and systems must follow standard process which involves an examination of requirements safety testing developmental testing and operational testing164 however the acquisition for an information system sometimes requires the same processes as that used for acquiring major weapons system for critically needed system an operational needs statement ons can sometimes shorten the debate about requirements and also shorten the traditional testing process thereby speeding acquisition and deployment of critical systems to warfighting units also in some circumstances to reduce delays in deployment of critical equipment and systems the secretary of defense was given rapid acquisition authority to waive all federal acquisition regulations for acquisition of equipment165 some observers have suggested that another possibility for speeding up the process for acquisition and deployment would be to give combatant commanders limited acquisition authority for example the united states special operations command socom already has been granted acquisition authority and reportedly they use it efficiently and find they are able to buy offtheshelf technologies to meet some requirements 166 future research into areas such as nanotechnology will likely lead to radically new innovations in material science fabrication and computer architecture however the basic research to develop new technologies requires highrisk investment and increasingly involves international collaboration maintaining us military advantage for nco may require stronger policies that encourage domestic education in science and hightechnology and that nurture longterm research that is bounded within the united states private sector universities and government laboratories 167 1 technologies is dod making sufficient investments for rd in nanotechnology nanoscience

used for global communications through the internet since the 1970s the us military now uses several transport protocols for digital communications in addition to ipv4 however dod planners see need for more network capabilities to support future nco operations by 2008 dod is planning to convert digital military communications to use the newer internet protocol version 6 ipv6 as the standard for all transmi ssion through the global information grid gig and for all systems that are part of the defense information system network disn that will interoperate with the gig ipv6 technology is considered the nextgeneration internet transport protocol and all commercial network communications equipment also heavily used by the military will eventually transition to its use and gradually reduce support for ipv4 this is because ipv6 offers advantages in speed capacity and flexibility over ipv4 for example ipv6 will enable network users to more easily set up secure virtual private network also known as secure tunneling through network than with ipv4 using ipv6 hardware devices can be attached to network and configured more easily which will also provide mobile users with easier and faster access to network services 171 however because use of ipv4 is so firmly embedded in the commercial systems now used in the united states the transition for the civilian communications infrastructure in other countries may go more smoothly and quickly this is because new communications infrastructures now being built in other countries will use the newest equipment with ipv6 capability already built in this may also mean that much of the talent for managing the new ipv6 technology may eventually belong to technicians and programmers who reside in countries outside the united states research has shown that regional agglomeration of technical expertise increases active sharing of tacit knowledge among groups of innovators 172 some of that tacit knowledge may also include sharing of information about newlydiscovered vulnerabilities for the ipv6 technology what follows is brief explanation of some technical differences between ipv4 and ipv6 and discussion of

means that ipv4 can only support approximately 4000000000 internet devices computers routers websites etc with internet access expanding globally and with more types of equipment now using internet addresses eg cell phones household appliances and pdas the number of internet addresses needed for connected equipment could soon exceed the addressing capacity of the ipv4 protocol for example slightly more than 3 billion of the 4 billion possible 32bit ipv4 addresses are now allocated to usoperated isps in contrast china and south korea with combined population of more than 13 billion are allocated 385 million and 236 million respectively therefore asian counties are especially interested in the possibilities that come with adoption of ipv6 internet protocol version 6 ipv6 quadruples the size of the address field from 32 bits to 128 bits ipv1ipv3 and ipv5 reportedly never emerged from testing in the laboratory ipv6 could theoretically provide each person on the planet with as many as 60 thousand trilliontrillion unique internet addresses theoretically by switching to ipv6 humanity will never run out of internet addresses ipv6 is also believed to be more secure than ipv4 because it offers feature for encryption at the iplevel however several drawbacks may slow the global adoption of the ipv6 standard switching to ipv6 means that software applications that now use internet addresses need to be changed every web browser every computer every email application and every web server must be upgraded to handle the 128bit address for ipv6 the routers that operate the internet backbone now implement ipv4 via computer hardware and ca nnot route ipv6 over the same hardware by adding software to route ipv6 packets the routers will operate more slowly which may cripple the internet alternatively upgrading and replacing the hardware for millions of internet routers would be very costly ipv4 also uses technology feature called natural address translation na t which effectively multiplies the number of ip address that may exist behind any single firewall this technology trick is widely employed within the united states and its usage also adds an extra layer of security to both commercial networks and home pc networks that have router nat allows home user to connect multiple pcs to their home network so they all can share single ipv4 address behind the routerfirewall by using nat it is possible and certainly much cheaper to put off or ignore the problem of r unning out of ipv4 addresses at least temporarily in the united states most technologists prefer sticking w ith nat rather than switching over to ipv6 also despite the new feature that allows iplevel encryption there may be new security problems associated with converting to ipv6 whenever new code is deployed onto computers undiscovered bugs are usually soon discovered th rough study and repeated experimentation by hackers therefore ipv6 may well hold security surprises that the designers have simply not found through extensive testing and because switching over to ipv6 will be global undertaking some of the newly discovered security problems could possibly become critical and even threaten the functioning of the internet itself ipv6 also offers other technical advantages over ipv4 for example ipv6 makes peertopeer communication between individual computers much easier than with ipv4 this will make applications like internet telephony and next generation multimedia groupware work much more smoothly

technology for technicians and engineers who reside outside the united states for example countries such as india north korea iran pakistan and iraq that are now building new communications infrastructures for internet commerce may initially adopt the latest network switching equipment using the newer ipv6 technology and thus leapfrog over ipv4 meanwhile industries in the united states which are already heavily invested in older ipv4 technology may remain tied to ipv4 using the nat technology for longer time this is because nat can extend the useful life of older ipv4 applications and can defer the cost of conversion by transferring that cost to the isps who would then set up gateways to translate between all ipv4 and ipv6 internet traffic going into and out of the united states the us could then become divided from the technology used in the rest of the world at least for while by an ipv4ipv6 difference that is similar to the usmetric divide we see today 173

secure siprnet network by using an encryption technique known as tunneling which lets users traverse nonsecure network to access topsecret one for example marine corps staff recently began using tunneling through the nonclassified niprnet to extend the dod classified siprnet to 47 sites in the marine forces pacific command 174 however during oif as much as seventy percent of niprnet traffic reportedly was routed through the civilian communications infrastructure this means that when there is need for high volume of us military communications security may be partly dependent on reliability of ipv6 equipment found in the civilian infrastructure and in commercial satellites175 countries with emerging communications infrastructures and purchasing the latest commercial network equipment may also be the home countries of those best able to exploit ipv6 technical vulnerabilities if this includes countries where the united states may be involved in military activity hostile groups with appropriate technical knowledge of ipv6 vulnerabilities may be positioned to attempt to interfere with us military communications 173 simson garfinkel the net effect january 7 2004

interpretations of what is known as metcalfes law may lead to different priorities for acquisition and deployment of nco technologies systems and equipment in the past some observers have stated that according to metcalfes law the power of network is proportional to the square of the number of nodes in the network176 proponents of nco in the past have also stated that network centric computing is governed by metcalfes law which asserts that the power or payoff of networkcentric computing comes from informationintensive interactions between very large numbers of heterogeneous computational nodes on the network177 however metcalfes law observes that the potential value of communications network increases or scales as function of the square of the number of nodes that are connected by the network after some deliberation many of the same proponents now argue differently about the applicability of metcalfes law to nco saying that it only provides insight into the fact that the value of network to its users depends mainly on the interaction between the following178 1 content quality and timeliness of information interactions enabled by the network 2 networkenabled valuecreation logic and 3 uservalue functions these proponents further state that nco does not focus on networkcentric computing and communications but rather on information flows and the nature and characteristics of battlespace entities however it is also noteworthy that other military observers now propose corollary to metcalfes law the complexity of system is proportional to the cube of the number of nodes and the reliability of system is inversely proportional to its complexity 179 in line with this corollary some observers propose that different types of networks could have indirect limitations that may begin to appear as those networks reach very large numbers of nodes briscoe et 2006 use observations of the rise and fall of internet companies to propose that use of metcalfes law to predict organizational success can sometimes result in organizational damage if expectations are set too high180 other observers agree stating that with 176 col tx hammes war isnt rational business

force transformation httpwww oftosdmil has indicated that dod must continue to refine the rules and theory of network centric operations through simulation testing and experimentation this section notes that although some experiences have shown that networking may increase certain advantages in wa rfare other experiences may also indicate that relying on information systems can sometimes lead to unexpected results informationage warfare is increasingly pathdepe ndent meaning that small changes in the initial conditions will result in enormous changes in outcomes speed is an important characteristic for nco because it enables military force to define initial conditions favorable to their interests and then pursue goal of developing high rates of change that an adversary cannot outpace182 to this end whenever datalinks are employed between military units and platforms digital information can be shared and processed instantaneously which produces significant advantage over other military units that must rely on voiceonly communications examples that illustrate this advantage are found in several training exercises conducted in the 1990s between royal air force jets equipped with datalinks referred to as link16 and us air force jets with voiceonly communications series of airtoair engagements showed that the raf jets were able to increase their kill ratio over the us jets by approximately 4to1 other training engagements involving more than 12000 sorties using 2versus2 or 8versus16 aircraft showed that jets equipped with link 16 increased their kill ratio by 150 percent over those aircraft having voiceonly communications si milar results were seen in training exercises involving navy and army units equipp ed with new networking technology 183 however some observers believe that important military decisions may not always lend themselves to informationbased rational analysis184 they argue that the military services national security establishment and intelligence community have not thoroughly studied the risks associated with datadependent military doctrine issues raised by these observers include the following 1 information flows may be governed by diminishing marginal utility for added effectiveness quantitative changes in information and analysis may lead to qualitative changes in individual and organizational behavior that are sometimes counterproductive 2 an informationrich opportunityrich environment may shift the value of the information redefine the mission objectives and possibly increase the chances for perverse consequences

visualization of the battlefield resulted in surprises such as requests for up to five times the normallyexpected amounts of ammunition instead of concentrating on only critical targets the experimental army units were overwhelmed with the vast array of potential targets they could now see the unprecedented requests for larger quantities of ammunition caused logistical failures more information did not assure better decisionmaking but rather it exposed doctrinal flaws185 similar effect was observed in later experiments conducted as part of the network centric operations conceptual framework ammunition wa s expended at faster rate possibly because more information creates targetrich environment these observations imply possibly greater demand for logistics support186 issues raise by other observers of datadriven systems are 3 reliance on sophisticated information systems may lead to management overconfidence 4 different analytical interpretations of data may lead to disagreements among commanders about who is best situated to interpret events and act on them the past economic underperformance of many hedge fund organizations and other technology firms that have employed very sophisticated ne twork centric management techniques may serve as examples to caution dod against ove rreliance on datadriven military information systems for example longterm capital management ltcm highlyleveraged multibillion dollar hedge fund and cisco systems wellrespected hightech firm both used sophisticated systems to track market conditions and expand their datadriven situational awareness to gain and maintain competitive advantage however in 1998 us governmentled consortium of banks bailed out ltcm after its trading losses put the entire worlds financial system at risk of meltdown also in 2001 cisco was forced to ta ke 225 billion inventory writedown while there is yet professional consensus explaining these poor performance problems many analysts agree that the presumed excellence of information systems may have invited managerial overreliance and that overreliance led to overconfidence executives may have ignored unambiguous external signals in favor of their own networked data 187 finally some believe that more information imposes higher degree of accountability on actions failure to minimize casualties or protect civilians may be digitally reviewed and used to politicize flawed military decisions these observers suggest that modern portfolio theory bayesian analysis and monte carlo simulation are three quantitative tools that military decision makers should explore if they want the benefits of information transparency to consistently outweigh its costs these tools could answer questions such as if information were to be managed as portfolio of investment 185 robert r leonhard principles of war for the information age novato ca presidio press 2000 p 156 and p224 186 dr kimberly holloman evidence based research inc
