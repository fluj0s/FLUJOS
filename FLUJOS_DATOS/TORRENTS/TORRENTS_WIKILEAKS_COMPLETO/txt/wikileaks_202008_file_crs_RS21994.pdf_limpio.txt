passed by the house one year earlier to extend lmpr for five years and to amend hog reporting provisions it was signed into law pl 109296 on octobe r 5 2006 this report will not be updated background under the agricultural marketing ac t of 1946 7 usc 16211627 usdas agricultural marketing service ams has long collected livestock and meat price and related market information on voluntary basis the agency s trained market reporters have attended public livestock auctions visited feedlots and packing plants personally contacted many individual buyers and sellers and consulted with tr ade associations to develop data the information along with similar types of data covering other major commodities such as grains dairy and pr oduce has been disseminated through hundreds of daily weekly monthly nd annual written and electronic re ports on sales of live cattle hogs and sheep and wholesale meat products from these animals the goal has been to provide all buyers and sellers with accu rate and objective market information by the 1990s the livestock industry had undergone many sweeping changes including increased concentra tion in meat packing and animal feeding more production specialization and more vertical coordi nation for example animals were more frequently being sold under priv ate marketing arrangements eg formula sales value based pricing with prices not publicly disclosed or repor ted some livestock producers believing such arrangements made it difficult or impossible for them to determine fair market prices called for mandatory price re porting for packers and others who process and market meat usda had estimated in 2000 that the former voluntary system was not reporting 3540 of cattle 75 of hog and 40 of lamb transactionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21994crs2 1 65 federal register 7546475542prior to the 1999 enactment of livesto ck mandatory price reporting lmpr opponents including some meat packers and ot her farmers and ranchers had argued that mandate would impose costly new burdens on the industry and could cause the release of confidential company information some had argued that voluntary reporting was more effective because those in the industr were willing not compelled participants it was also argued that if certain desired information was lacking it might be better remedied by providing more resources to ams ie funding and staff to improve the voluntary program nonetheless some of these earlier opponents decided to support consensus lmpr law these included the national cattlemens beef association ncba and national pork producers council nppc many of whose memb ers had been hit by very low prices in the late 1990s some meat packers also decided to support national consensus bill at least partly to preempt what they viewed as an emerging patchwork of state price reporting laws as well as the specter of more onerous national law congress responded in 1999 by enacting lmpr as title ix of pl 106 78 usdas fy2000 appropriations law lmpr authority had lapsed briefly on october 22 2004 but president bush signed legislation pl 108444 extending the program through september 30 2005 this authority also expired while the 109th congress pondered the programs future participants voluntarily reported transaction data to ams the program again became mandatory with house and senate passage of hr 3408 pl 109296 lmpr provisions ams published final rule imple menting lmpr on december 1 20001 t h mandatory program included the following elements detailed market information must be reported to ams by packers processors and importers who annually slaughter an aver age of at least 125000 cattle 100000 hogs or 75000 lamb s and by importers with average annual imports of at leas t 2500 metric tons of lamb meat swine purchases must be reported three times daily cattle purchases twice daily domestic and export sales of boxed beef cuts twice daily lamb carcasses and boxed lamb cuts once daily and imported lamb cuts once weekly usda in turn must publish frequent detailed reports on these transactions the law requires usda to collect and publish at least monthly information on retail prices for meat and poultry products and increases the number of required reports mandatory news reports include the current and prior days swine market forward contract and formula

accurately reflect sales and prices paid in the sow market altering data reporting deadlines to better balance usdas workload and increase report accuracy and efficiency and enabling usda to publish

letter their goal was to forge and maintain consensus on an extension bill to help ensure its passage w ithout additional amendments that could prove divisive and controversial according to veral industry lobbyists an ami spokesman said its members although skeptical of th value of mandatory reporting supported simple extension because they already had made the investments needed to comply with the original law at its 2005 annual convention in kentuc ky the national farmers union nfu endorsed policy that congress should re new and make permanent the mandatory reporting law the nfu policy also calls on usda to eliminate the socalled 360 rule to require open reporting to occur at least twi ce daily by region and to provide transparent information without exemptions to farmers and ranchers4 selected issues it was anticipated that the simple extension of lmpr from 2004 to 2005 would provide lawmakers with additional time to consider number of possible lmpr issues these included whether the program has in f act brought more transparency to livestock markets and is more effective at trans mitting price information than voluntary reporting and whether the cost and administrative burdens outweigh lmpr benefits some critics contended that the lmpr information has not been as widely used as it could be despite usdas continuing efforts to improve its clarity accessibility and timeliness two 2003 papers discuss the impacts and effectiveness of lmpr and various reauthorization issues5 the two papers observe that mandatory price reporting resulted not only in gains in available information but also in losses for example lmpr does not provide the same timeliness or frequency of reports as under the voluntary system andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21994crs5 6

confidentiality of thos reporting may cause less transparency they conclude lmpr has resulted in less local information on terms of cattle trade for those regions once covered by voluntary reporting but longer included in regional daily and weekly mandatory reports6 on the other hand at the national level it is now possible to compare prices across purchasing methods the short run supply situation is more transparent packer ownership and captive supply can be observed and price impacts of such examined and perhaps most notable the act ensures that data available to and used by market participants are representative of actual market transactions7 schroeder and wachenheim ra ise several questions for further study such as what exactly is the added cost to packers and to taxpayers compared with the voluntary system which would be helpful in assessing the mandatory programs net value8 how important was the price data that is longer being reported who supports lmpr and how are they using the information how is it facilitating decision making ho w might lmpr influence industry conduct and performance could it be made more useful to market participants has the lmpr law increased the opportunity for packer collusion after initiation of lmpr in april 2001 the socalled 360 rule which was aimed at protecting confidentiality see footnote 4 was causing usdaams to withhold substantial amount of data fro m the public so ams replaced this rule in august 2001 with new 37020 guidelines they specified that for 60 days prior to report at least three entities had to provide data at least half the time single entity could provide more than 70 of the reports data and single entity could be the sole reporting source for report more than 20 of the time as result ams releases of the regional fed cattle morning reports increased from 24 to 77 according to the department9 usda observed confidentiality guidelines present difficult challenge for usda note that lmpr imposes the reporting requirement on packers cattle slaughter is so concentrated in many regions only thr ee or four packers may be active that confidentiality guidelines designed to protect the information of individual reportinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21994crs6 10 ibid 11 usda ers did the mandatory require ment aid the market ldpm13501 september 2005entities may often apply restricting the release of market news it added that the issue is of less concern in hog slaughter10 in more recent september 2005 report usda evaluates the lmpr to determine whether it has improved the amount and quality of information available in fed cattle markets compared with the previous voluntar program the report concludes that prices received under formula purchasing arrangem ents which were not comprehensively reported under the voluntary system appear to closely match prices received with negotiated purchases it observes that the trend toward formula purchases has slowed since implementation of lmpr and the volum of cattle under nego tiated purchases has increased although other market factors lik lower cattle inventor ies and the discovery of bse in north america may also have influenced this shift11 gao report the longawaited gao report livestock market reporting usda has taken some steps to ensure quality but additional efforts are needed gao06202 was released december 12 2005 gao found that usdas market reporters had not informed users about the extent to which they regularly ex cluded some packer data in preparing the reports and that packers themselves had not always fully and accurately reported their transactions nor promptly corrected problem s gao also concluded that coordination between ams and gipsa the two agencies charged with addressing competition in livestock markets was limited largely because of their different statutory authorities gao recommended improvements in the transpar ency of the market reports and the auditing of packer transactions in the 110th congress interest could focus on among other things usdas reaction to and adoption of the gao recommendations and the need if any for additional legislative amendments if new options ar proposed they might be debated along with other livestock issues as part of new omnibus farm bill see also crs report rl33037 previewing 2007 farm bill coordinated by jasper womach
