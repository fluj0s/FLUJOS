for the instability that has recently plagued ecuadorian democracy since 1830 regionalism and personalism have defined ecuadorian political culture quito the colonial capital and guayaquil the industrial port have battled for urban dominance superimposed against this regional divide are the ethnic and class divisions that have encouraged political parties to develop as electoral machines for compet ing segments of the elite following the return to democracy in 1979 party splits bureaucratic ineptitude and corruption proliferated as the economic situation has deteriorated since the 1980s voters have reacted by blaming incumbents for their troubles and by periodically backing populist antiparty candidates similar to correa this trend has led to the inability of presidents to complete their terms as well as inconsistent economic policies from one administration to the next ecuador has weak and poorly regulated economy that is overly dependent on few export commodities oil bananas and shrimp with volatile prices in 1998 niño rains caused an estimated 26 billion worth of crop damage white spot disease hit the shrimp industry and oil prices plunged as result ecuador
