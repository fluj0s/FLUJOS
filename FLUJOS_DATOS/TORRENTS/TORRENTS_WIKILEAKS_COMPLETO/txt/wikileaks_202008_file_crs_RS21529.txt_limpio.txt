trade division updated may 23 2003 abstract this report analyzes current viewpoints about the state of qaeda and the threat it poses to the united states order code rs21529 may 23 2003 crs report for congress received through the crs web qaeda after the iraq conflict audrey kurth cronin specialist in terrorism foreign affairs defense and trade division summary the may 12 2003 suicide bombings of three western housing compounds in httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21529 riyadh saudi arabia reopened questions about the strength and viability of qaeda in the postiraq conflict environment the apprehension of number of senior qaeda leaders in recent months combined with the absence of major terrorist attacks during the military campaign in iraq had led some to believe that qaeda was severely crippled and unable to launch major attacks others argued that the organization was in transition to more decentralized structure had gained new recruits and might even be growing threat this report analyzes current viewpoints about the state of qaeda and the threat it poses to the united states it will be updated as events warrant the may 12 2003 bombings of three western housing compounds in riyadh saudi arabia marked an apparent evolution in the behavior of qaeda that some experts believe provides insight into the viability of the organization after the us military campaigns in iraq and afghanistan although there has been important measurable progress in the united states efforts against qaeda since september 11th experts disagree as to whether the organization as whole presents greater or lesser threat to the united states and its interests today at the heart of the analysis is the question of whether qaeda can launch additional major attacks of strategic impact or whether the organization is now largely relegated to low level tactical attacks in the wake of the riyadh bombings this report examines the debate about how to assess qaedas strength and will explain the major points on which experts differ as well as the assumptions underlying their arguments the attack in saudi arabia was not the first recent incident to display suspected links to qaeda beginning in 2002 qaeda reportedly either contributed to or participated directly in number of wideranging attacks including against passenger plane and hotel in kenya in which 15 were killed and 40 injured night club in indonesia where about 180 were killed french oil tanker off the coast of yemen in which one crewman was killed and four injured and synagogue in tunisia where 19 were killed and 22 congressional research service the library of congress crs2 injured1 number of other potential qaeda operations were successfully disrupted2 the organization is still considered dangerous and the bush administration has been warning of the likelihood of additional terrorist attacks for many months3 but the absence of major terrorist incidents during the iraq war had led to degree of optimism even among those who believed that qaedas terrorism had not ended osama bin laden in an audiotape released april 7 2003 urged his followers to mount suicide attacks to avenge the innocent childrenassassinated in iraq on some previous occasions such public declarations had been followed by major events when those attacks did not occur after bin ladens april statement their absence was seen as possible indicator of the organizations weakness although intelligence officials cautioned that qaeda was still capable of mounting significant attacks there was sense that us counterterrorism operations against qaeda had severely damaged the organization cofer black head of the state departments counterterrorism office was quoted in early may 2003 saying this was the big game for them you put up or shut up and they have failed it proves that the global war on terrorism has been effective focused and has got these guys on the run4 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21529 the attacks in saudi arabia as well as subsequent explosions in morocco seem to have tempered that optimism not just because they occurred us officials had consistently argued that future attacks were inevitable and had even warned of heightened security threat to saudi arabia but because the riyadh bombings in particular displayed specific characteristics that worried terrorism experts before then the selection of targets since 911 seemed to indicate that the us assault on qaeda had forced it to shift to opportunistic soft targets especially tourist destinations in areas of the world that were relatively unfortified against terrorist attacks the riyadh attacks were more sophisticated the perpetrators reportedly used high quality explosives engaged in multiple coordinated attacks carried out longterm reconnaissance and attacked wellfortified targets5 they also used large suicide assault teams to kill the guards and breach the existing fortifications seeming tactical innovation6 these characteristics potentially reflective of enduring advanced operational capability caused 1 us department of state office of the coordinator for counterterrorism patterns of global terrorism 2003 pp

2003 accessed at httpwwwtimecom on may 19 2003 crs3 some experts to reassess their understanding of how qaeda is evolving as an organization in the postiraq conflict environment the characteristics of qaeda there is great deal that remains unknown or debatable about the specific nature size structure and reach of the organization despite many years of studying it for example western experts are not exactly sure how many members it has now or has had in the past estimates are often based upon an approximation of how many people trained in qaeda camps in afghanistan and sudan the estimates range as high as 600007 and as low as 200008 these assessments are inexact in part because the total number of camps that operated is not firmly agreed9 but even if experts knew the correct total number of camps and trainees not all the people who took the training necessarily became or remained actual members of the organization10 the state department estimates that qaeda probably has several thousand members and associates11 but since these are all estimates it is not known what proportion of qaeda members us and allied forces have captured or killed12 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21529 but do operatives even necessarily need to be members it is apparent from some of those apprehended in failed plots that it is not essential to be formally in qaeda in order to carry out attacks operatives seem to vary from the besttrained controlled and financed professional cadres such as mohammed atta who led the september 11th attacks to lesstrained and relatively uncontrolled volunteers such as ahmed ressam who intended to blow up angeles international airport and richard reid who tried to detonate plastic explosives in his shoes aboard an american airlines transatlantic flight13 qaeda even acts like foundation at times reportedly giving grants to existing local terrorist groups who present promising plans for attacks that serve the organizations general goals14 unlike many traditional terrorist groups qaeda has single standard operating procedure although it does have welldeveloped manual for 7 german intelligence cited in the atlantic online atlantic unbound terrorisms ceo

said to be structured like modern corporation reflective of management concepts of the early 1990s including bottomup and topdown networks common mission statement and entrepreneurial thinking even at the lowest levels this makes it extraordinarily flexible and many believe able to survive serious blows15 qaeda has also developed strong ties to other terrorist organizations some new and some longstanding16 osama bin laden formed an umbrella group in late 1998 the international islamic front for jihad against jews and crusaders which included not only qaeda but also groups from egypt algeria pakistan and bangladesh some argue that qaeda has been something of hybrid terrorist organization for some time17 sampling of groups currently thought to be connected includes the moro islamic liberation front philippines jemaah islamiah southeast asia egyptian islamic jihad merged with qaeda in 2001 alansar mujahidin chechnya algamaa alislamiya egypt and has worldwide presence abu sayyaf philippines the islamic movement of uzbekistan and harakat ulmujahidin pakistankashmir the list is illustrative not comprehensive some experts see increased reliance on connections to other groups as sign of qaedas weakness others point to enhanced cooperation with other groups httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21529 as worrisome indicator of strength especially with groups that formerly focused on local issues and now display evidence of convergence on qaedas international antius antiwest agenda an important question is whether qaeda might be evolving further into new form more like movement than formal organization increasingly diffuse internationally and less reliant upon its own membership organization in transition clearly qaeda is in transition whether that transition will lead to something more or less dangerous is point of contention on one hand clear progress in apprehending or killing senior leaders of qaeda has been evident in recent weeks president bush announced that the united states has captured about half the senior leadership18 other sources claim that about third have been captured19 many of these terrorist leaders have been crucial participants in past qaeda attacks the arrests of september 11 plotter and thirdincommand khalid shaikh mohammed and operations chief abu zubaydah for example are believed to have hurt the organization and disrupted its operations according to us officials the organizations previous 15 ibid p 26 16 for further information see crs report rl31119 terrorism near eastern groups and state sponsors 2002 february 13 2002 by

laden the terrorist as ceo the atlantic monthly april 2003 p 26 crs5 communications network has apparently been crippled its leaders are on the run and its afghanistan base has been largely eliminated20 still qaeda is not like state whose regime you can remove in order to disable it counterterrorism officials describe it more as an organic structure that adapts to changing circumstances including the loss of some senior leaders the two most senior leaders osama bin laden and ayman alzawahiri are widely believed to be alive and at large and terrorism experts argue over the extent to which succession plan is in effect to replace those who have been captured21 during the week before the riyadh attacks email interviews conducted by the londonbased magazine majalla apparently with qaeda spokesman thabet bin qais claimed that qaeda had undertaken thorough restructuring of its leadership22 one of the worrisome aspects of the attack itself was the apparent involvement of people thought to have been lowerlevel fighters who may have now stepped into the breach for example khaled jehani who was previously considered lowlevel operative seems to have been involved in the riyadh operation23 also mentioned is seif aladel one of number of younger qaeda members who seem to have gained influence in the absence of former leaders and who may have played role24 many worry that this could illustrate an evolution within qaeda to new httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21529 generation25 this as well as other evidence in the attack itself seems to demonstrate level of central direction finally some believe that there has been spike in recruitment to the network as result of the us military operations in iraq leading to worry that despite its serious recent losses qaeda could grow stronger in future months26 stronger or weaker ultimately the debate about qaedas current status centers on the important question of whether it is growing or declining in strength in the wake of the afghanistan and iraq military campaigns when the predicted terrorist attacks on the united states and its interests did not materialize what is the current level of threat to the united states most believe that the denial of safe havens and arrests of senior leaders have seriously crippled the organization when judged by its earlier form however it may be 20 robert schlesinger dispersed qaeda

evolving into something new for terrorist groups periods of evolution can be particularly dangerous organizations in transition can be especially vulnerable to disruption and destruction but they can also be less predictable and prone to lash out in order to cause additional damage rally flagging supporters andor prove their continuing viability27 with respect to qaeda evidence of new sophisticated operations possible succession plan in action central coordination of attacks and growing international ties all increasingly converging on common international agenda hostile to the united states and its allies may give us officials new reason for concern in the short term at least even successes in counterterrorist operations against more decentralized organization can lead to greater difficulty in collecting reliable intelligence as the paths of communication are increasingly unfamiliar the personalities are changing and the locations of operatives are more diffuse while the long term trajectory is very difficult to assess for the time being it seems that qaeda or its successors has emerged from period of inactivity and remains very serious threat requiring concentrated attention and vigorous countermeasures on the part of its prospective targets issues for congress httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21529 congress may face number of questions in the coming months these include how does us counterterrorism policy need to adapt to match the changing threat of qaeda and its associated groups is there need for strategic reassessment of the successes and failures of us counterterrorism policy in the postiraq strategic environment not only in the military and intelligence fields but also in foreign policy law enforcement international cooperation public diplomacy foreign aid homeland security and elsewhere are there places where us policies in given area are now longer meeting the challenge are potentially counterproductive or where funding is inadequate or misplaced how will the us occupation of iraq affect the changing regional terrorist threat to what degree will regime change in iraq alter the overall international terrorist threat to the united states at home and abroad will progress or the lack thereof in achieving an israelipalestinian peace agreement and resolving sensitive issues such as the conflicts in kashmir southern philippines chechnya and elsewhere affect qaedas prospects 27 aum shinrikyo is good example of an organization that executed its most spectacular attack the 1995 sarin gas attacks on the tokyo subway
