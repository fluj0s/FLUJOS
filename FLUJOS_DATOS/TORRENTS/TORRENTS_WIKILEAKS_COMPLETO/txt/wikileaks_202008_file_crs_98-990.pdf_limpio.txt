trial of all crimes except impeachment shall be by jury these few words provide4 the constit utional framework for discussion of the standard of proof in impeachmen t proceedings but definitive answer as to what standard is to or should be applied the use of cer tain words such as try convicted and conviction suggests that impeachme nt might be likened to criminal proceeding where the standard of proof i s beyond reasonable doubt this position was enunciated in the minority view s contained in the report of the house judiciary committee on the impeachmen t proceedings against president nix on in their view the appropriate standard of proof for5 the senate was that applicable to criminal cases for support they rely in part on the6 constitutional language cited above the position that proof beyond re asonable doubt is required has been advanced as one might expect by defendants in impeachment proceedings while the house managers who present the case for conviction have urged lower civil standard preponderance of the evidence thus in the senate trial of the impeachment of judge harry claiborne in 1986 his attorneys filed motion to designate beyond reasonable doubt as th applicabl standard for the senate in reaching its determination in the brief in suppor t of the motion they argued that the constitutional language made it clear that n impeachment trial was i n the nature of criminal proceeding the standard of proof in all criminal trials is beyond reasonable doubt historically impeachments have bee n conducted in the nature of criminal proceeding and the consequences for the defendant were grave requiring the prosecutors to be held to the highest standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt7 the response of the house managers in opposition to the claiborne motion noted that the reasonable doubt standard was designed to protect criminal defendants who risked forfeitures of life liberty and property quoting brinegar v united states 338 us 160 174 1949 such standard was inappropriate they maintained because th ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98990crs3 gray reams volume 5 document 41 x house managers opposition to motion to8 designate beyond reasonable doubt as the standard of proof in essence their argumen t was that since criminal sanctions could not be imposed criminal standard of proof was t required additionally they contended that the criminal standard was inappropriate in n impeachment because impeachment was by its nature proceeding where the public interest the interests of society weighed more heavily than the interests of the individual defendant

fro m office and disqualification from holding office in the future explicitly preserving th option for subsequen t criminal trial in the courts added support for their position was drawn from the fact that the framers while borrowing some terms associated wit h criminal law from the english impeachment model expressly rejected the englis h practice allowing the imposition of traditional criminal punishment including forfeitures of life property and liberty contrary to the defendant they found that historically the senate had rejected the analogy to criminal proceeding citing the ritter impeachment in 1936 as precedent 8 during the course of the floor debate on these motions the attorney for judg claiborne quoted statements by senators robert taft jr sam ervin stromthurmond and john stennis indicating that they would apply the beyond reasonable doubt standard if the case against president nixon came before the senate representative kastenmeier responded for the house repeating the arguments contained in the memorandum i n response summarized above and stressing 1 that the senate had never adopted such standard of proof 2 that the statements quoted were expressions of individual inten t only and not binding on the senate as body 3 that the proceeding was not criminal trial and use of the criminal standard was inappropriate where the public interest i n removing corrupt officials was significant factor and 4 that historically the senate had allowed each member to exercise personal judgment in these cases9 during the consideration of the motion by judge claiborne to designate beyond reasonable doubt as the standard of proo f the question was posed as to the consequences of voting the motion down senator humphrey asked what the standard would be if the motion was re jected senator metzenbaum asked whether rejection left an inference that the reasonable doubt standard was not applicable and senator heflin questioned whether rejection would prevent an individual senator from applying the reasonable doub t standard the response of the presiding officer was that rejection of the motion lef t individual members free to apply standard of their choice including but not limited to the reasonable doubt standard judge claibornes motion was rejected by the presiding officer holding th at the standard to apply was up to each senator to decide individually senator hatch requested the yeas and nays and the motion was rejected by vote of 17 yeas and 75 nays 10httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98990crs4 132 cong rec s15763 daily ed october 9 1986

impeachment and the d ebate and vote on the standard of evidence in that case noting that the senate had verwhelmingly rejected the motion to establish beyond reasonable doubt as the senate standard leaving that determination to each individual member he suggested that historical records and commentary might provide insight for an individual making these judgments but do not provide any single definitive answer15 some commentators have urged middle ground between the usual civil standar d and the criminal standard of proof noting that impeachment is serious business but that the usual criminal sanctions of fines and imprisonment are denied the senate professo r rotunda suggests that the appro priate standard of proof should be clear and convincing evidence this is an intermediate

degree of proof which will produce in the mind of the trier of facts firm belief or conviction as to the allegation sought to be established 16 the national commission on judicial discipline and removal decided not t recommend the adoption of standard of proof nevertheless its report provides n illuminating discussion of the issue standards of proof the question remains what is the appropriate standar d of proof for senate impeachment proceedings the senate has declined to establis h standard leaving it matter for the conscience of each senator the disadvantag of this practice is that the respondent judge the house managers and indeed th senators themselves cannot know in advance what standard the senate will apply the commission consider ed whether it would be desirable as matter of policy for the senate to prescribe standard to guide participants in their preparation fo r impeachm ent trials the senate could choose from among three establishe d standard s beyond reasonable doubt clear and convincing and preponderance f evidence some senators favor the beyond reasonable doubt standard because of thei r concerns about the separation of powers and because impeachment proceeding s parallel crimin trials if the senate is impeaching based on prior felony conviction which requires the jury to find commission of an offense beyond reasonable doubt then the senate should use the same standard some argue others claim that the beyond reasonable doubt standard is too deferential to the convicted judge and fails sufficiently to recognize the purpose of impeachment namely to defend the community against abuse of power by judges the purpose of an impeachment proceeding is different from the purpose of criminal trial the argue in criminal proceeding court may take defendants life liberty r property whereas an impeachment proceeding involves respondents office impeachment is political proceeding and in their view the lower standard f preponderance of the evidence is therefore the appropriate one still others have argued that the appropriate standard of proof is clear an d convincing evidence that the respondent has committed an impeachable offense i t gives force to the purpose of remedying judicial abuse of power while recognizin g the competing interests of avoiding unjustified removals and protecting judicia l independence in the final analysis the commission recognizes that each senator is both judge and juror as observed by senate legal counsel michael davidson it is the sum f senators separate judgments that amounts to either conviction or acquittal an member is entitled to establish the highest the medium or lower standard t govern his or her analysis of the evidence17httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98990crs6 c black impeachment handbook at 1718 1974 18while the report focuses on the impeachment of judges similar competin g consideratio ns may come into play when executive branch officials are the subjects of an impeachment proceeding in 1974 with possible presidential impeachment as n impetus pro fessor charles l black jr published his i mpeachment handbook in it he discusses the conflicting policy considerations of an impeachment in the context of the trial of president in response to rhetorical question as to the right standard for judging guilt in an impeachment proceeding he replies of course we dont know the answer with any sureness we have to work it out for ourselves as with so many constitutional questions we have to ask what i s reasonable and the reply here is far from obvious removal by conviction n impeachment i s stunning penalty the ruin of life even more important it unseats the person the people have deliberately chosen for the office the adoption of lenient standard of proof could mean that this punishment and this frustration f popular will could occur even though substantial doubt of guilt remained on th other hand the high criminal standard of proof could mean in practice that man could remain president whom every member of the senate believed guilty f corruption just because guilt was not shown beyond reasonable doubt neithe r result is good law is often like that of course each senator must find his own standard in his own conscience s advised by reflection the essential thing is that part whatever be played by th natural human tendency to think the worst of person of whom one generall disapproves and the verbalizati on of high standard may serve as constant reminder of this weighing the factors i would be sure that one ought not to be satisfied r anything near satisfied with the mere preponderance of an ordinary civil trial bu t perhaps must be satisfied with something less than the beyond reasonable doubt standard of the ordinary criminal trial in the full literal meaning of that standard overwhelming preponderance of the evidence comes perhaps as close as can t denoting the desired standard unique rule not yet named by law may find itself in the terrible seriousness of great case senators have plainly authoritative guide in this matter and ought not be censured for the rule they conscientiously choose t act upon after thought and counsel and above all in total awareness of the danger s of partisanship or feelings of distaste18 in sum the senate has traditionally left the choice of the applicable standard of proof to each individual senator while rejecting motion to make the criminal standard th standard in the claiborne impeachment the discussion made clear that it was simply decision to allow eac h member to make that choice and not repudiation of the standard itself individuals might apply that or any ther standard of their choice walk through history and an examination of the discussions of legal commentators may aid individuals in weighi ng their choices but provides definitive answers indeed such an exercis is perhaps most useful in highlighting basic questions that members will want to as k themselves when searching for the appropriate standard
