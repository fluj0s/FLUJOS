introduction charging fees for grazing private livestock on federal lands is statutorily authorized and has been the policy of the forest servi ce fs department of agriculture since 1906 and of the bureau of land management b lm department of the interior since 1936 today fees are charged for grazing on pproximately 160 million acres of blm land and 95 million acres of fs land basically under fee formula established in the public rangelands improvement act of 1978 pria and c ontinued administratively1 on blm rangelands in fy2006 there were 15799 operators authorized to graze livestock and they held 17880 grazing permits and leases under these permits and leases maximum of 12634580 animal unit mont hs aums of grazing could have beenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21232crs2 2 us government

february 2008 the fs uses hdmo as its unit of measurement for use and occupancy of fs lands similar to aum hereafter aum is used to cover both hdmo and aum the blm and fs are charging grazing fee of 135 per aum from march 1 2008 through february 28 2009 this is the lowest fee that can be charged it is generally lower than fees charged for grazing on other federal lands as well as on state and private lands study by the government account ability office gao found that other federal agencies charged 029 to 11250 per aum in fy2004 while the blm and fs use formula to set the grazing fee see the fee formula below most agencies charge fee based on competitive methods or market price for forage some seek to recover the costs of their grazing programs state and pr ivate landowners generally seek market value for grazing with state fees ranging fro m 135 to 80 per aum and private fees from 8 to 23 per aum2 the average monthly lease rate for grazing on private lands in 11 western states in 2006 was 1510 per head3 blm and the fs typically spend far more managing their grazing programs than they collect in grazing fees fo r example the gao determined that in fy2004 the agencies spent about 1325 million on grazing manage ment comprised of 583 million for the blm and 742 million for the fs these figure s include expenditures for direct costs such as managing permits as well as indir ect costs such as pe rsonnel the agencies collected 175 million comprised of 118 million in blm receipts and 57 million in fs receipts4 receipts for both agencies have been relatively low in recent years apparently because western droug ht has contributed to reduced livestock grazing other estimates of the cost of livestock grazing on federal lands are much higher for instance 2002 study by the center for biological dive rsity estimated the federa l cost of an array of blm fs and other agency programs that benefit grazing or compensate for impacts of grazing at roughly 500 million annually toge ther with the nonfederal cost the total cost of livestock grazing could be as high as 1 billion annually according to the study5 grazing fees have been contentious si nce their introduction generally livestock producers who use federal lands want to keep fees low they assert that federal fees arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21232crs3 not comparable to fees for l easing private rangelands becau public lands often are less productive must be shared with other public user s and often lack wate r fencing or other amenities thereby increasing operating costs they fear that fee increases may force many small and mediumsized ranche rs out of business conser vation groups generally assert that low fees contribute to overgrazing and deteriorated range conditions critics assert that low fees subsidize ranchers and contri bute to budget shortfalls because federal fees are lower than private grazing land lease rates and do not cover the costs of range management they further contend that because part of the collected fees is used for range improvements higher fees c ould enhance the productive potential and environmental quality of federal rangelands current grazing fee formula and distributi on of receipts the fee formula the fee charged by the fs and blm is based on the grazing on federal rangelands of specified number of animals for one month pria establishes policy of charging grazing fee that is equitable and prevents economic disruption and harm to the western livestock industr the law requires the secretaries of agriculture and the interior to set fee nnually that is the timated economic value of grazing to the livestock owner the fee is to represent the fair market value of grazing beginning with 1966 base value of 123 per aum this value is adjusted for three factors based on costs in western states of 1 the rental charge for pasturing cattle on private rangelands 2 the sales price of beef cattle and 3 the cost of livestock production congress also established that the annual fee adju stment could not ex ceed 25 of the previous years fee pria required sevenyear trial 19791985 of the formula while the fs and blm undertook study to help congress determine permanent fee or fee formula president reagan issued executive order 12548 februar 14 1986 to continue indefinitely the pria fee formula and established the minimum fee of 135 per aum without that requirement the 2008 fee would have been be low one dollar due to decrease in beef cattle prices and an increase in production co sts according to the blm and the fs the annual grazing fees since 1981 when the fs nd blm began charging the same fee are shown in table 1 the fee has ranged from 135 to 231 table 1 grazing fees from 1981 to 2008 dollars per aum 1981231 1990181 1999135

for example blm regulations provide that lf of the fund is to be allocated by the secretary on priority basis and the rest is to be spent in the state and district where derived forest service regulations provide that half of the monies are to be used in the national forest where derived and the rest in the fs region wh ere the forest is located in general the fs returns all range

are those outside grazing districts for which the blm leases grazing allotments see figure 3 for both agencies any state share is to be used to benefit the counties that generated the receipts

agriculture and the secretary of the interior washington dc february 1986 fee evaluation and reform attempts pria directed the interior and agriculture secretaries to report to congress by december 31 1985 on the results of their evaluati on of the fee formula and other grazing fee options and their recommendations for implementing permanent grazing fee the secretaries report included 1 discussion of livestock production in the western united states 2 an estimate of each agencys cost for implementing its grazing programs 3 estimates of the market value for public rang eland grazing 4 pot ential modifications to the pria formula 5 alternative fee systems and 6 economic effects of the fee system options on permittees8 1992 revision of the report upda ted the appraised fair market value of grazing on federal rangelands termined the costs of range management programs and recalculated the pria base value through the application of economic indices the study results criticized by so as using faulty evaluation methods were not adopted and the report s not been updated since president clinton proposed and congress c onsidered grazing fee reform in the 1990s but reforms were adopted in 1993 the clinton administration proposed an administrative increase in the fee and revisi ons of other grazing policies the proposed fee formula started with base value of 396 per aum and was to be adjusted to reflect annual changes in private land lease rates in the west called the forage value index the current pria formula is adjusted using multiple indices practice that some criticize as doublecounting abilitytopay factors congressional objections forestalled an administrative increase and new rules for blm rangeland management that took effect on august 21 1995 did not increase fees grazing fee bills have passed either chamber for several years in the 104th congress the senate passed bill to establish new grazing fee formula and alterrangeland regulations the formula was to be derived from the threeyear average of the total gross value of production for beef nd longer indexed to operating costs and private land lease rates as under pria by one estimate the measure would have resulted in an increase of about 050 per aum in the 105 th congress the house passed bill with fee formula based on 12year average of beef cattle production costs and revenues the formula would have re sulted in 1997 fee of about 184 per aum current issues and legislation there is ongoing debate about the appropriate grazing fee with several key areas of contention first there are differences over which criteria should prevail in setting fees fair market value cost recovery whereby the monies collected would cover the governments cost of running the program sustaining ranching or resourcebased rural economies generally or diversification of cal economies second there is disagreement over the validity of fair market value estima tes for federal grazing because federal and private lands for leasing are not always directly comparable third whether to have uniform fee or varied fees based on biol ogical and economic conditions is an area of debate fourth there are diverse views on the environmental costs and benefits of grazinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21232crs6 on federal lands and on the envi ronmental impact of changes in grazing levels fifth it is uncertain whether fee increases would reduce the number of cattle grazing on sensitive lands such as riparian areas sixth some environmentalists assert that the fee is not the main issue but that all livestock grazin g should be barred to protect federal lands handful of livestock owners in some western states have grazed cattle on federal land without getting permit or paying the re quired fee the blm and fs have responded at times by fining and jailing the owners as well as impounding and selling the trespassing cattle the livestock owners claim they do not need to have permits or pay grazing fees because the land is owned by the public or that other rights such as state water rights extend to the accompanying forage or the blm improperly allowed wild horses and burros to graze the land particularly longrunning controversy involved grazing without permits by western s hoshone indians on land in neva da they asserted belongs to the tribe under treaty but which the federal government ma nages as public land there have been efforts to end livestock grazing on certain federal lands through voluntary retirement of permits and leases and subsequent closure of the allotments to grazing this practice is opposed by thos who support ranching on the affected lands fear widespread effort to eliminate ranching as way of life or question the legality of the process supporters seek to have ranchers relinquish th eir permits to the government in exchange for compensation by third partie s particularly envir onmental groups after acquiring the permits through transfer the groups advocate agency amendments to land use plans to devote the grazing lands to ot her purposes such as watershed conservation these groups would not pay grazing fees under their permits if they opt not to graze during the amendment process because fees are paid for actual grazing in recent congresses legislation has been introduced to buy out grazing permittees or lessees on federal lands generally for instance hr 3166 in the 109th congress provided that permittees who voluntarily relinquished their permits would be compensated at rate of 175 per aum estimate d at more than twice the market rate the allotments would have been permanently cl osed to grazing such legislation backed by the national public lands grazing camp aign is advocated to enhance resource protection resolve conflicts between graz ing and other land uses provide economic options to permittees and save money according to proponents such national buyout program would cost about 31 billion if all permits were relinqui shed but would save more than that am ount over time hr 3166 would have authorized 100 million to compensate permit holders and make transition payments to counties and established priorities for compensation if funds were insufficient for all buyouts opponents of buyout legislation include those who support gr azing others who fear the creation of compensable property right in grazing permits some who contend the program would be too costly or still others who support different types of grazing reform other legislation has sought to buy out grazing leases on pa rticular allotments and to retire those allotments from grazing use eg s 2379 110th congress for land within the cascade siskiyou national monument in oregon sti ll other measures have sought to require federal land management agencies to compensate permit holders when certain actions reduced or eliminated grazing and alternative forage was not available eg hr 411 109th congress
