in lhasa and other tibetan regions of china to mark the 49th anniversary of an unsuccessful tibetan uprising against chinese rule in 1959 the demonstrations appeared to begin peacefully with small groups that were then contained by security forces both the protests and the response of the prc authorities escalated in the ensuing days spreading from the tibetan autonomous region tar into parts of sichuan gansu and qinghai provinces with tibetan populations by march 14 2008 mobs of angry people were burning and looting establishments in downtown lhasa authorities of the peoples republic of china prc responded by sealing off tibet and moving in largescale security forces beijing has defended its actions as appropriate and necessary to restore civil order and prevent further violence still chinas response has resulted in renewed calls for boycotts of the beijing olympics opening ceremony on august 8 2008 and for china to hold talks with the dalai lama china sees itself as having provided tibet with extensive economic assistance and development using money from central government coffers and prc officials often seem perplexed at the simmering anger many tibetans nevertheless retain against them despite the economic development tibetans charge that the prc interferes with tibetan culture and religion they cite as examples beijings interference in 1995 in the choice of the panchen lama tibets second highestranking personage enactment of reincarnation law in 2007 requiring buddhist monks who wish to reincarnate to obtain prior approval from beijing and chinas policy of

appeared to begin on january 4 2008 when five tibetan organizations outside china launched the tibetan peoples uprising movement tpum to engage in direct action to end chinas illegal and brutal occupation of tibet13 the organization announced that it was seeking to take advantage of two approaching historic moments the beijing olympics in august 2008 and the coming 50th anniversary of the 1959 tibetan uprising among the groups stated demands are the dalai lamas return to tibet as its sole leader the end of chinas colonial occupation of tibet release of all tibetan political prisoners

generated by report s of differing media coverage of the march demonstrations in tibet with prc officials charging that western media coverage has been biased on march 21 2008 prc web log with disturbingly inflammatory language was established purporting to show this media bias15 the site reproduces videos shot by observers in lhasa showing the violence of the riots discusses news photos cropped in ways some say are misleading and cites errors in news stories captions and photos in which police in nepal and india roughing up tibetan demonstrators appear with written descriptions of prc police actions in lhasa tibetan supporters counter that prc accounts make mention of the days of peaceful demonstrations preceding the riots and that chinese press reports focus on reportage of

organizations outside tibet as the dalai clique reflecting their belief that all these groups are controlled and directed by the dalai lama and thereby represent his views and effectively are acting on his behalf16 the prc has alleged that the agenda of some of these groups proves that the dalai lama has never renounced his dream of an independent tibet in recent years the dalai lama has advocated greater autonomy for tibet within china but not formal independence from the prc the prcs ministry of public security mps asserted that it had gathered sufficient evidence showing that the march 2008 unrest in lhasa and elsewhere was organized premeditated masterminded and instigated by the dalai clique and its tibet independence forces 17 according to prc official the lhasa incident

clique18 two decades ago the prc used similar language to refer to the widespread demonstrations in tibet from 1987 1989 we have conclusive evidence to show that the lhasa riot early this month was instigated and engineered by the dalai separatist clique19 other prc references to the dalai lama have been more venomous on march 18 2008 the communist party secretary of tibet called the dalai lama jackal and wolf clothed in monks robes and vicious devil who is beast in human form 20 supporters of tibet point out that the international tibetan movement is not as monolithic as prc officials claim they say that some tibetan organizations including those in the tpum do not support the dalai lamas policy of seeking broader tibetan autonomy under chinese sovereignty21 as for the march 2008 demonstrations the dalai lama has denied that he is behind them saying i appeal to the chinese leadership to stop using force and address the longsimmering resentment of the tibetan people through dialogue with the tibetan people i also urge my fellow tibetans not to resort to violence 22 those who have met the dalai lama personally or who know something of his pacifist views generally find it impossible to reconcile their own experiences of him with the deviousness and malign intent that prc officials generally ascribe to him in public statements to western audiences the dalai lamas adoption of middl way approach indicates he has given up his aspirations of independence for tibet despite the contrary views of proindependence wing in the international tibetan community and instead is seeking only greater autonomy for tibet as part of the prc in his speech at the congressional gold medal award ceremony in october 2007 for instance the dalai lama said let take this opportunity to restate categorically that i am not seeking independence i am seeking meaningful autonomy for the tibetan people within the peoples republic of china 23 in written appeal directly to the chinese people on march 28 2008 the dalai lama reiterated that he has desire to seek tibets separation from china but that he seeks to ensure the survival of the tibetan peoples distinctive culture language

demonstrate that there is little hope that beijing will make significant changes in its policy calculations despite even the urgent advice of those who wish china well china appears to have calculated that it can outwait the 72yearold dalai lama and that the demise of this compelling personality will result in the disintegration of the tibetan movement altogether but many westerners see the dalai lama and his influence within the tibetan community as the key to unlocking chinas longstanding difficulties in tibet they see chinas continued rejection of the dalai lamas middle way approach as

boy living in tibet had been found to be the legitimate reincarnation of the deceased panchen lama beijing officials reportedly were furious that the dalai lama made his announcement unilaterally without involving leaders in beijing regarding this as direct challenge to central government authority to have final say in this important tibetan decision prc officials responded by maintaining that only they had the authority to name this spiritual leader consequently in november 1995 chinese leaders rejected the dalai lamas choice and announced they had discovered the real panchen

upon the death and subsequent reincarnation of the current dalai lama the 14th living in exile apparently mindful of its previous experience with the 11th panchen lama beijing late in 2007 took steps designed to solidify its future control over the selection process of tibetan lamas on august 3 2007 the state administration for religious affairs sara issued set of regulations effective september 1 2007 that require all tibetan lamas wishing to reincarnate to obtain prior government approval through the submission of reincarnation application in statement accompanying the regulations sara called the step an important move to institutionalize management on reincarnation of living buddhas 27 the dalai lamas special envoy lodi gyaltsen gyari described the new regulations as blow against the heart of tibetan religious identity the regulations also require that reincarnation applications come from legally registered venues for tibetan buddhisma provision seen as an attempt to illegalize the reincarnation of the current dalai lama who has declared he will not be reborn in china if circumstances in tibet remain unchanged in the aftermath of the new reincarnation law the dalai lama also has said that he is thinking of alternative ways of choosing his successor including selecting candidate before his own death chinese foreign ministry spokesman responded to these comments by saying that such move would violate religious rituals and historical conventions of tibetan buddhism 28 the new reincarnation law inserts the chinese government directly into what for centuries has been one

generally but some would argue at high cost to tibets traditions and cultural identity these policies reportedly have disrupted traditional living patterns and contributed to tensions between tibetans and chinese immigrants in an apparent effort to assuage tibetan resentment beijing has spent substantial sums restoring buddhist temples in tibet the majority of which were destroyed by chinese forces during the cultural revolution at large conference conducted on tibet in 1994 chinese officials adopted plans to increase economic activity in tibet by 10 percent per year and continue substantial economic subsidies to help tibets less developed economy since then the prc has moved ahead with number of major economic development and infrastructure projects having provided such extended economic assistance and development in tibet with central government money prc officials often seem perplexed at the simmering anger many tibetans nevertheless retain against the chinese the dalai lama and other tibetans have number of concerns about prc economic development activities in tibet at the top of this list is concern that this economic development primarily is benefitting not tibetans but han chinese many of whom are imported to tibet to work on the major infrastructure projects now underway such as the opening of new tibet railway linking lhasa to the rest of china as result this economic activity is disrupting tibets cultural identity in part by encouraging large migrations of nontibetans into the regionboth technical personnel to work on the projects themselves and entrepreneurs seeking new economic opportunities some in the exile community have even suggested that beijing has consciously pursued an economic development strategy in tibet as way to solve its tibet problemby ensuring that the tibetan economy is tied more tightly into that of chinas eastern provinces the tensions inherent in balancing the beneficial aspects of economic development with the imperatives of cultural preservation is one of the key points of concern to some members of congress

toward its ethnic populationsone less paternalistic with room for diversity and one that accommodates justifiable cultural and ethnic pride among ethnic populations without forcing these groups to see themselves solely through chinese lens but despite provisions for religious freedom in the prc constitution chinese leaders in the past have been extremely reluctant to allow robust religious cultural and political freedom among ethnic populations in china like the tibetans or the uighurs in neighboring xinjiang province beijing appears to equate such divergence from chinese norms as highly threatening to social stability observers also point out that prc unwillingness to address tibetan requests for greater autonomy have additional implications for chinas policy toward taiwan whose

negotiations despite other reports of negative developments in tibet discussed elsewhere in this report the most recent report submitted by under secretary dobriansky dated june 2007 found grounds for limited optimism on sino tibetan contacts but raised questions about whether the momentum could be sustained 34 in addition to this report the under secretarys office is responsible for submitting the annual state department country reports on human rights practices mandated by sections 116d and 502bb of the foreign assistance act of 1961 the section on china specifically includes separate accounts for tibet hong kong and macau while the latest report released in march 2008 judged the prc governments human rights record in tibet to remain poor it found the same limited grounds for optimism on sinotibetan contacts as did the latest tibet negotiations report cited above35 grounds for optimism in sinotibetan talks were raised slightly by number of developments after 20022003 including six rounds of negotiati ons between prc officials and representatives of the dalai lama for instance in 2002 the dalai lamas older brother gyalo thondup accepted prc invitation to spend several weeks in tibet on private visit the prc government also invited to china and to lhasa tibets capital delegations from the tibetan community led by the dalai lamas special envoy in the united states lodi

the likely outcome of these tentative ventures the new sara regulations requiring governmental approval for reincarnation are but the latest potential hurdle report in 2004 by two usbased tibetan scholars for instance ggested that the experimentation with direct sinotibetan contacts is tentative and not promising the two authors also noted that china has restructured some of its tibetan policymaking institutions in ways that have made beijings institutional management of tibetan affairs more complex and considerably less predictable 37 in addition chinas statements and actions to inhibit the dalai lamas visits overseas in brussels and australia in 2007 are seen to be more assertive than in previous years massive development projects in tibet such as the new qinghaitibet railroad that opened to service in the summer of 2006 have served to facilitate greater numbers of ethnic chinese coming to tibet they are seen as evidence that sinotibetan dialogues are having little

to the dalai lamas middle way policy suggest there is little room to hope that beijing will make significant changes china appears to have calculated that it can outwait the 72yearold dalai lama and that the demise of this compelling personality will result in the disintegration of the tibetan movement many westerners on the other hand see the dalai lama and his influence within the tibetan community as the key to unlocking chinas longstanding difficulties in tibet they see beijings continued rejection of the dalai lamas middle way approach as having undercut his ability to influence

of tibetan histor is the ambiguity and disagreement surrounding tibets long political relationship with china tibetans generally view tibet as an historically independent nation that had close relationship with succession of chinese empires succession of chinese governments on the other hand have claimed that tibet has been political and geographical part of china for many centuries 40 in

foreign affairs chose its own leaders wielded formidable military power and had highly developed and unique culture they further point out that in 1913 after the overthrow of the qing dynasty and establishment of the chinese republic the dalai lama declared tibets independence from china tibets long standing historical relationship with china they say was one of priestpatron rather than subjectsovereignin other words religious bond rather than political one43 competing claims about tibets past are one of the apparent sticking points in progress on sino tibetan negotiations while the dalai lama has stated many times that he is not seeking tibetan independence he has claimed that tibet once was independent one of the prcs demands is that the dalai lama acknowledge historical

boundaries of tibetthe very definition of what constitutes tibet members of the tibetan community consistently speak of tibet in its larger ethnographic and historical context including not only the entire current area referred to on chinese maps as xizang or the tibetan autonomous region tar but also parts of the chinese provinces of qinghai sichuan gansu and unnan which tibetans claim as the former tibetan provinces of kham and amdo beijing defines tibet as only the tar and when referring to tibet does not include those tibetan autonomous prefectures and countries in other provinces where there are heavy concentrations of ethnic tibetans the dalai lamas five point peace plan of 1987 proposes transforming the whole of tibet into zone of peace including these historical areas now in other prc provinces 44 beijings objection to this is another apparent obstacle in sinotibetan negotiations

dalai lama went to india to attend an important buddhist festival according to his own account the dalai lama met with prime minister nehru during that visit and said that he believed he should stay in india and not return to tibet both prime minister nehru and prc premier zhou enlai who also was visiting india at the time advised the dalai lama to return to tibet he did so three years later in march 1959 prc troops acting to forcibly put down demonstrations in tibet against chinese rule began shelling the dalai lamas summer palace in lhasa the norbulingka eventually destroying it but prior to these prc military operations on march 17 1959 at the age of 24 the dalai lama had left his palace in disguise and had fled toward india with group of his followers there he requested political asylum for himself and his attendants indias prime minister nehru granted the request for asylum and tens of thousands of tibetans since then have joined the dalai lama in exile 46 for years reports have claimed that third parties were involved in the 1950s dispute and confrontation between the tibetans and the chin communist governmentin particular india the us central intelligence agency cia and the kuomintang kmt party of chiang kai shek in taiwan according to one source cia involvement began in the mid1950s proximate to the dalai lamas visit to india and his subsequent return to tibet there have been unconfirmed reports for instance that in the 1950s the cia trained tibetan rebels at camp hale colorado that at least one ciatrained operative accompanied the dalai lama on his 1959 flight to india and that this operative was in constant radio t ouch with the cia station in dacca india which then conducted airdrops to supply the dalai lamas entourage the dalai lama and the tibetan exile community have denied third party involvement 47 much of the prcs tenure in tibet has been troubled particularly during the tumultuous cultural revolution 19661976 when most monasteries palaces and other aspects of tibetan buddhism and culture were either damaged or destroyed the international campaign for tibet claims that over 1 million tibetans died during the first 30 years of prc rule48 beijing refutes this claiming that the material life and health of tibetans in tibet has greatly improved under prc governance

cons ideration of matters relating to china in the late 1980s number of factors have contributed to members greater interest these include the dalai lamas and the tibetan communitys ongoing political activities reports of human rights abuses and chinas continuing repressive social and political controls in tibet and the lack of consensus among us policymakers over what us policy should be toward

although some dispute the historical consistency of this us position49 since normalization of relations with the prc in 1979 succession of both republican and democratic us administrations have favored policies of engagement with china in the process they frequently have sought to minimize areas of potential tension with beijing where chinese lead ers have taken strong positions such as on the question of tibets political status the dalai lama himself has been the most charismatic and renowned advocate for the tibetan people over the past decade he has number of supporters in the us congress50 the dalai lamas and his exiled communitys efforts to gain international support for tibets cause took major step forward in 19861987 when series of meetings between tibetan and western supporters in new york washington and london launched what has become known as tibets international campaign 51 the goal of this campaign was to garner western and principally us support for tibets situation and ultimately to bring this international pressure to bear on beijing to make satisfactory political concessions as part of this new strategy the us congress in 1987 began to put pressure on the white house to protect tibetan culture and accord tibet greater status in us law despite beijings strong objections two events of particular importance occurred in 1987 first on september 21 the dalai lama made his first political speech in the united states at the invitation of the congressional human rights caucus in that speech the dalai lama made fivepoint proposal for resolving the tibet question that was wellreceived in the united states and had significant consequences on congressional attitudes toward tibet 52 second congress put nonbinding measures into place in 1987 declaring that the united states should make tibets situation higher policy priority and should urge china to establish constructive dialogue with the dalai lama53 49 some assert that past us actions that treated tibet as if it were an independent state in effect signaled us recognition michael c van walt van praag for instance in the status of tibet history rights and prospects in international law westview press boulder colorado 1987 states that washington supported tibet and treated it as an independent state even recognizing its facto italics included independence p 139 in the daily press briefing of october 8 1987 responding to question concerning what year the united states formally recognized tibet as part of china the state departments public affairs office issued the following statement we have never recognized tibet as sovereign state independent of china we first made the statement that we considered tibet to be part of china in 1978 however our earlier formulations were not inconsistent with the statement and we have never challenged chinas claim third country recognizes tibet as state independent of china 50 these have included representatives ben gilman tom lantos dana rohrabacher charlie rose and nancy pelosi and senators dianne feinstein and claiborne pell 51 these three cities are all still centers for tibetrelated of fices and information networks according

regarding tibet54 marked the beginning of significant increase in congressional activity on tibets status55 from this point on congressional supporters sought to mention tibet separately whenever possible in legislation relating to china in 1990 in considering foreign relations authorization legislation that contained the socalled tiananmen sanctions congress singled out tibet for special mention in senseof congress language that closely resembled the five points the dalai lama had proposed two years earlier and in the same legislation mandated the v oice of america to begin broadcasts in the tibetan language 56 in 1994 congress enacted number of tibetanrelated provisions in the foreign relations authorization act of fy19941995 including provision mandating that tibet be listed separately in the state departments annual report country reports on human rights and provision mandating the state department to issue report on the state of relations between us and those recognized by congress as the true representatives of the tibetan people the dalai lama his representatives and the tibetan government in exile and on conditions in tibet57 congressional efforts to raise the profile of tibet since 1986 have been resisted or mitigated by successive us administrations but generally in low profile nonconfrontational manner as early as 1986 when congress passed legislation authorizing exportimport bank funding that listed tibet as separate country president reagan signed the legislation into law 58 in his remarks however the president said i note that tibet is listed as country in section 8 the united states recognizes tibet as part of the peoples republic of china i interpret tibets inclusion as separate country to be technical oversight 59 in other respects however consistent congressional pressure has contributed to us administrations acknowledging however subtly th position of the tibetan communityinexile thus president george bush in 1991 became the first us president to meet with the dalai lama while president bill clinton met with the dalai lama several times in casual dropby meetings although these meetings were deliberately lowkey and informal they nevertheless offended chinese leaders as did the clinton administrations decision after having opposed the special envoy position for four years to compromise by establishing the position of special coordinator for tibet 54 congress considered number of nonbinding measures in the 1980s concerning tibet in 1986 congress listed tibet as an independent country in hr 5548 legislati on dealing the

years of the clinton administ ration congress began considering measures to establish the position of us special envoy for tibet with ambassadorial rank in introducing such measure in 1994 senator claiborne pell stated he believed it was necessary to further focus white house attention on issues involving tibet i recall how difficult it was to engage previous administrations in serious knowledgeable discussions on tibet special envoy for tibe t would ensure that this important element of united stateschina relations was continually reflected in policy discussions on senior level 60 while legislation to create special envoy for tibet was never enacted provisions similar to those in the 1994 legislation were also introduced as sections of authorization bills in the 104th and the 105th congresses61 in each case the provision called for the special envoy to have ambassadorial rank and to actively promote negotiations between the dalai lama and the chinese government clinton administration officials opposed these provisions primarily because of concerns about the creation of an ambassadorial rank position for an entity tibet that the united states recognizes as part of china rather than as an independent country in its own right on october 31 1997 in move seen as compromise to appeal to proponents of the special envoy position secretary of state madeleine albright designated special coordinator for tibetan issues within the state department nd named gregory craig to serve in the position concurrently with his job as director of poli cy planning although the new special coordinator position did not come with ambassadorial rank its creation nevertheless suggested there would be higher level of official attention on issues involving tibet consequently the 105
