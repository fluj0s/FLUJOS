care spending context and policy summary the united states spends large and growing share of national income on health care in 2007 health spending is expected to approach 23 trillion and account for more than 16 of gross domestic product gdp we spend substantially more than ot her developed countries both per capita and as share of gdp however given our wealth such sp ending is not necessarily problem on the one hand depending on our preference for health care compared with other things we may wish to spend even more on the other hand regardless of the preferred level for na tional spending our nation might use available resources more efficiently and equitably health care costs put significant pressu re on the federal budget both directly through spending on medicare medicaid and other federal benefits and indirectly through tax expenditures for health insu rance and expenses the congressional budget office projects that spending for medicare medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program will total 634 billion and account for about 23 of federal outlays in 2007 federal tax expenditures for health benefits health coverage for military personne l veterans and federal employees and spending by public health service agen cies are expected to add 272 billion in costs given competing constituent interests and the complex interdependence of public and private benefits and actors policymakers face difficult challenges in helping to ensure access to health care and health insurance without exacerbating federal budget pressures or contributing to marketwide inflation three broad policy directions have both promise and limitations for addressing health spending 1 changing health car 2 changing federal programs and 3 changing tax policy the first changing health care considers the potential for influencing spending by improving the quality and delivery of health care services key limitation of this direc tion is uncertainty about wh ether any particular change will reduce or increase health spending the second direction changing federal programs focuses more narrowly on federal spending for federal benefits to influence sp ending policymakers can set budgets for programs services or beneficiar ies they can change eligibility rules or program benefits and they can change other program features including payment methods and amounts and how beneficiaries obtain coverage in this category the primary challenge is balancing explicit tradeoffs between competing goals regarding access and spending the final direction changing tax polic focuses both on making health care more affordable for individuals and families and on influencing consumers choices as they purchase health insurance and health care key benef it of tax subsidies including exclusions credits deductions and taxadvantaged accounts relates to flexibility in general these tools help consumers buy the health insurance and health care they prefer drawback is that tax subsidies may driv up consumer demand and spending on the one hand while failing to help ensure access to health coverage on the other this report will be

costs fuchs asserts s ee cite above that considerable amount of continuedvaluing spending on health care criticism of us spending levels generally boils down to the argument that americans benefit little from the additional money they spend on health care despite paying more than twice as much per capita as other oecd countries basic health statistics for the united stat are worse than oecd averages6 in 2004 the us infant mortality rate of 68 deaths 1000 live births was higher than the median rate of 43 deaths1000 live births for all oecd countries in the same year us life expectancy at birth also was below oecd averages us females were expected to live 804 years compared with median life expectancy of 815 years for females in all oecd countries for males the us and oecd numbers were 752 and 765 years respectively another argument regarding the uncertain value of health spending points to variation within the united states itself th at cannot be explained fully by differences in health status or prices and that is not correlated with better outcomes or satisfaction with care7 for example according to the medicare payment advisory commission medpac in 2000 medicare spe nding per beneficiary varied from about 3500 in santa fe new mexico to almost 9200 in miami florida8 many factors contribute to such di fferences in spending includi ng variation in the supply of medical resources in how physicians practice medicine and in the economic social and cultural characteristics of communities9 unfortunately variation in measures of health on the one hand and spending on the other are difficult to interpret in the former case many things besides health care affect infant mortality and life expect ancy including nutrition sanitation and hygiene housing and the prevention and contro l of infectious disease in the latter case although more spending on hea lth care is not necessarily better10 it also is nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32545crs4 10 continued the care in the

2003 pp 1525 based on simula tion analysis the authors conclude that health spending will continue to be afford able through 2075 if real per capita growth in health care costs exceeds real growth in gdp by 1 if the gap is instead 2 spending would be affordable only through 2039 necessarily worse some differences in spending may be the appropriate result of differences across markets in the cost of inputs for producing health services in addition although overuse of health care may be wasteful underuse of services also can be problem it may not be clear whet her any given spending level is too high too low or about right economics and valuing spending economics offers additional concepts for thinking about whether us spending levels are desirable or affo rdable despite high spendi ng we may conclude as society that it is worthwhile to devote the same or even more resources to health care this conclusion depends on preferences for health care relative to other things if we value health care more than what we would otherwise produce with the same resources diverting resources to health care from other uses will increase social welfare we also may conclude that spending levels are affordable based on the observation that it is possible in grow ing economy to spend more both on health care and on other goods and services as table 2 shows over the 19601999 period increasing national income was sufficient to support both rapid growth in per capita spending for health care and growth in spending for items other than health care whether our economy will be able to support similar trend in the future depends on the extent to which increases in health spending continue to outpace change in gdp11 table 2 us spending on health care and other items in 1996 dollars 1960 1970

ffordable for society the cost of health insurance and health care may be too much for certain individuals and families for example in 2006 178 of americans under age 65 went without health insurance for the entire year low income individuals were more likely to be uninsured about onethird of those earning less than 150 of the poverty level and more than one quarter of those with income between

health care16 key issue for the congress regardless of whether america can afford to spend more of its national income on health care health spending is key issue for the congress both because it constitutes substantial share of federal spending and because it affects all constituents in one way or another federal spending medicare and medicaid generally top the list of concerns bout federal health spending according to the congressiona l budget office medicare spending is projected to be 436 billion in 2007 and the fe deral shares of spending for medicaid and the state childrens health insuran ce program are expected to be 192 billion and 6 billion respectively the sum of these amounts 634 billion represents about 23 of estimated federa l outlays 27 trillion for 200717 costs for medicare and medicaid are expected to grow significantly as the population ages federal tax expenditures for health benefits are also substantial although difficult to measure estimates by the joint committee on taxation suggest personal income tax expenditures for health be nefits could approach 120 billion in 200718 most of this amount represents forgone revenue because empl oyerprovided health benefits are excluded from federal income and employment taxes other tax expenditures include the itemized deducti on for unreimbursed medical and dental expenses above 75 of adjusted gross in come the deduction for health insurance for the selfemployed and the deduction nd exclusion for health savings accounts federal spending on health benefits for military personne l veterans and federal

food and drug administration and 03 b illion for the agency for healthcare research and quality20 constituents and complexity influencing health spending is complicated broadly the congress faces the challenge of balancing fiscal constraints against the desire to help constituents beyond this general challenge the deta ils can be mindnumbing constituent groups often have competing objectives or at leas t different priorities public and private actions are highly interdependent and po licy actions inevitabl have both intended and unintended consequences for example health spending and cost trends affect taxpayers who pay for public bene fits and tax subsidies individuals and families who may receive coverage through public programs benefit from ta x subsidies for health insurance or find themselves uninsured or underinsur ed because of the high cost of health care employers who must balance providing an attractive compensation package including health insuran ce for employees against the need to keep labor costs under control states who share responsibility with the federal government to provide coverage for certa in vulnerable populations insurers and health plans who must balance offering attractive products at reasonable prices ag ainst profit goals and the risk of financial loss and health care providers whose income depends on insurance coverage and functioning market for health carehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32545crs8 together these actors make up complex market in which it is hard to discern the beginning or end of public and privat influences public programs depend on private providers to deliver health care services and they depend on private entities to administer benefits whethe r by processing claims or by providing private health plan options for beneficiaries the priv ate insurance market in turn depends on substantial tax subsidies to increase mand for coverage and make the price of insurance more affordable for purchasers public subsidies such as medicare and medicaid payment addons for hospitals th at train physicians or treat lowincome people help ensure access to care not onl for beneficiaries of public programs but also for uninsured and privately insured individuals ultimately all policies affecting public benefits influence the private market and vice versa given the complicated interdependence of actors unintended consequences are inevitable for example although dicare and medicaid have provided both financial protection nd access to care for millions of bene ficiaries the programs also contribute to health care in flation because insured cons umers are less price sensitive similarly expanding public benefits as the congress has done in enacting drug coverage under medicare and creating th state childrens health insurance program inevitably crowds out privat spending regardless of efforts by policymakers to prevent this substituti on maximizing the benefits while min imizing the costs of any policy action is difficult challenge three policy directions the following sections introduce three broad approaches for using policy to influence health costs and spending changing health care changing federal programs and changing tax policy these approaches are neither mutually exclusive nor exhaustive in addition controlling spending whether national spending or federal spending is not ssumed to be their only objec tive as discussed above devoting high share of national income to health care is not necessarily problem nevertheless policymakers generally are concerned about whet her health services are worth their cost as well as about how benefits and subsidies are distributed changing health care this broad direction changing health care to increase its value and potentially reduce its underlying cost focuses on the health system the basic idea is that policy might help improve quality and effi ciency in the production and delivery of health care and in so doing lower the cost of health services if realized lower costs would affect both public and private health spending research highquality health care depends on information about health and illness about medical treatments and bout patients fede ral policy has long influenced health care delivery by s upporting the developmen t and dissemination of information for example the national in stitutes of health s upports basic science and clinical research the agency for healthcare research and quality analyzes the effectiveness of different treatments and clinical practices and the centers for disease control and prevention monitors th incidence and prevalence of health riskhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32545crs9 21 for more information about this initiative spec ifically and health it more generally see crs report rl32858 health information technology promoting electronic connectivity in health care by c stephen redhead 22 see the thematic issue of health affairs vol 24 5 septemberoctober 2005 which includes series of articles on the economics of health itfactors and illness in commun ities government support of these research functions benefits both private actors who use th information and society more broadly because absent government support the private market would produce and share less information information technology beyond supporting research and surveillance the government can facilitate the use of information in health care by developing data and communication standards and by crea ting incentives for adopting information tools for example policymakers ve moved to support the use of health information technology it by establishing standards for data exchange among the departments of health and human services defense and veterans affairs i n addition to promoting information sharing across these federal departments that deliver health care the initiative is meant to serve as model for the private sector21 policymakers also have s upported financial incentives for implementing health it for example the medicare prescrip tion drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma pl 108173 authorized gr ants to physicians to help defray the cost of purchasing installing and using computer systems for electronic prescriptions health it offers the potential to improve health care quality by providing both specific information about patients and ge neral information about effective treatment strategies electronic health records nd clinical decision support systems can help physicians and other clinicians provi integrated evidencebased care computerized physician order entry systems can help prevent medical errors and interconnected systems can facilitate the ex change of information about patients and populations over time these tools might help reduce health care spending by encouraging costeffective care and str eamlining administrative processes but current evidence is inconclusive22 leadership more generally government influences the health care system by sometimes leading and so metimes reinforcing change policy support of research and health it are just two examples of this influence during the past decade both public and private efforts to rein in hea lth care spending have shifted from focusing on managed care and integrated delivery systems to focusing on changing incentives for health care consumers through soca lled consumerdirected strategies and providers through payforperformance th is evolution reflects mix of public and private initiative for example federal policy has supported the market for managed care plans through medicare payment rates and medicaid policy changes that make it easier for states to provide benefits through health plans and primary care case management arrangements similarly tax subsidies for health savings accounts and policy interest in tying medicare payments to providers performance are exampleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32545crs10 of federal efforts that both reflect and shap ongoing change in the market for private health insurance efforts to change the health care system offer both promise and risk investment in research policies to suppor t health information technol ogy and other efforts may improve the quality of care but their potential impact on spending is uncertain on one hand although new discove ries and technology tend to lower the cost of most products innovation in health care tends to have the opposite effect on the other hand inefficiency and waste in the us health care system like that implied by relatively poor health statis tics and regional va riation in health spending suggest opportunities for improvement whether this means slowing growth in health care spending or at least getting better value for what we spend changing federal programs whereas strategies to change health care focus on the health system generally second broad direction changing fe deral programs focuses on federal spending for federal benefits given growing costs and limited resources many policymakers note the need to control spending on federa l programs but other goals such as improving program benefits and ensuring ad equate payments for hea lth care providers are also important medicare illustrates the tension from competing objectives over the past decade repeated legislative efforts alte rnately have emphasized limiting spending or increasing spending with most bills including provisions for doing both whether the congress seeks to reduce spending or not policymakers have different types of options for changing federal programs including specifying budgets changing eligibility ndor benefits and changing features that define how programs work program budgets in way the simplest tool for influencing federal spending on health care is to set budget for example the congress limits outlays on health benefits for vete rans by specifying budget through the appropriations process by changing the appropriati on congress can reduce or increase spending for this population the appropriation for veterans health car is an example of programlevel budget but other possibilities include budgets for certain services or beneficiaries for example the congress attempted to control spending for physician services under medicare through the sustainable growth rate system whic h more or less sets budget for medicare spending on physician services policymakers also could limit federal spending for individuals in entitlement programs through capitation payments two examples of this type of approach include converting medicare to premium support system under which beneficiaries would purchase coverage much like federal employees do today nd changing medicaid from program with federal matching payments for services to program in which states receive fixed payments for enrolleeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32545crs11 the details matter setting budget can re strict spending but if set too high it also can lead to higher spending than would occur otherwise in addition mismatch between funding mand and supply can lead to access problems in the veterans case some argue that queuing for services is the result of appropriations that have failed to grow in tandem with rising enrollment and health care costs in the medicare case some physicians have threatened to stop seeing beneficiaries in response to recent and expected future payment cuts eligibility and benefits another tool for influe ncing federal spending is changing eligibility and benefits under entitlement programs the congress could use this tool to reduce spending but us ually it has done the opposite for example over the years policymakers have expanded eligibility for medicare and medicaid notably in the former case to certain disabl ed persons and individuals with endstage renal disease and in the latter case to ccessive subgroups of pregnant women and children the congress also has expanded benefits examples in medicare include coverage for hospice services and more recently for various clinical preventive services and outpatient prescr iption drugs in medicaid mo st new benefits have been optional for states mandatory additions have included limited coverage for professional services by nonphysician providers dentists nurse midwives and nurse practitioners coverage for care provided in rural health clinics and federally qualified health centers and coverage for family planning and pregnancyrelated services changing cost sharing is another way policymakers can modify benefits for example under the balanced budget ac t of 1997 bba pl 10533 policymakers in effect increased coverage for hosp ital outpatient services under medicare by reducing beneficiaries liability for coinsurance in contrast the congress slightly reduced medicare benefits when it required future increases in the part b deductible under the mma changes to eligibility and benefits have fairly straightforward tradeoffs in general expansions increase access but also spending restrictions reduce spending but may limit access distribution and incentiv matter while policy change to reduce covered services or increase cost sharing requirements might seriously limit access for some beneficiaries the same cutback likely would encourage others to be appropriately prude nt in seeking health services other program features the congress can influence spending under entitlement programs by changing program features other than eligibility or benefits key tools include changing payment methods and amounts and changing how beneficiaries obtain coverage for example over the years policymaker s have changed payment methods for most medicare services beginning in 1983 and accelerating with the bba cost based payment has been aba ndoned in favor of prospectiv ely determined rates for hospital physician skilled nursing facility home health and other services under prospective payment providers have great er incentive to be efficient because theyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32545crs12 23 for more information on this tax subsidy and others see crs report rl33505 tax benefits for health insurance and expenses overview of current law and legislation by bob lyke and julie m whittakerare at risk for costs above payments am ounts and can profit if costs are below payment amounts in addition to encouraging efficiency through payment methods policymakers can influence spending by changing paym ent updates for example under the bba congress restricted payment updates for mo st medicare services to control rapid growth in spending over several year s following passage of the bba congress essentially reversed course increasing medicare pa yments on multiple occasions under

health plans to provide benefits under public prog rams including medicare medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program so people emphasize the inherent value of offering different coverage options for be neficiaries others argue that greater reliance on private plans will reduce progra m spending because the plans can provide benefits more efficiently that outcome depends among other things on how much private plans are paid like changes in eligibility and benefits changes in other program features must balance competing goals regarding spendi ng and access to care payment amounts whether for particular services or for all services under health plan must cover the cost of efficiently caring for beneficiaries and paym ent methods should encourage the provision of adequate but not wasteful care changing tax policy third broad direction changing ta x policy focuses more on consumers compared with strategies to change health care or federal programs the tax code currently includes variety of subsidies to help individuals and families pay for health insurance and health care limiting tax expenditures generally has not been policy priority although some taxrelated policy pr oposals seek to influence consumers use of health care by making them more pricesensitive insurance subsidies the subsidy for employe rprovided health benefits is by far the largest tax expenditure for private insurance payments for health insurance are excluded from the income and employment tax base in effect lowering the price of insurance for those obtai ning coverage

educational trust employer health benefits 2007 annual survey annual premium costs include both employer and worker contributions12106 for fa mily of four in 200724 and with most households facing marginal income tax rates of 15 or 25 savings can be substantial although tax savings make insurance mo re affordable the subsidy encourages people to purchase more insurance than they would otherwise having more insurance drives up demand for health care which in turn drives up health care prices and spending in addition the tax exclusi on for employer health benefits provides the largest savings to those who least need assistance highincome workers who face high marginal tax rates to address issues regard ing demand and equity polic ymakers and analysts have proposed various changes to tax subsidies for insurance including limiting the exclusion for employerprovi ded benefits increasing tax benefits for highdeductible health plans and offering tax credits fo r the purchase of nongroup health coverage two of these approaches might influence health care spending by changing demand for health insurance and health care limiting the exclusion for employer provided benefits could affect the type of coverage em ployers provide and it could reduce employees demand for policies that are generous compared with the tax threshold similarly increasing tax benefits for highdeductible plans and associated savings accounts may change consumer preferences regarding health coverage in both cases the assumption is that people with ss generous coverage will use less health care the third approach offering tax credits for the purchase of nongroup coverage is more about making insurance affordab than it is about influencing health spending depending on the details ch credits offer potential advantages compared with the exclusion for employerprovided benefits first credits are less regressive because subsidies are not function of marginal income tax rates second because tax credits need not be tied to employment they provide tool for subsidizing insurance coverage th at can reach larger population potential disadvantages of tax credits relate to affordability and access even healthy people may find that credits of 1000 or more are not enough to make insurance affordable in addition because of their health or risk profile some people may not be able to purchase nongroup coverage at any price other subsidies in addition to helping cons umers purchase insurance tax subsidies including the itemized deduc tion for unreimbursed medical and dental expenses and several tax advantaged accounts help consumers pay for health expenses not covered by insurance like insurance subsidies these subsidies reduce the apparent cost of health care and ve the same unintended impact increasing demand prices and spending they also provi larger benefits to taxpayers in the highest bracketshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32545crs14 25 for more information see crs report rs21573 taxadvantaged accounts for health care expenses sidebyside comparison by bob lyke and chris l peterson the deduction for unreimbursed medical nd dental expenses is less regressive than the subsidy for employerprovided in surance because eligibility is related to income taxpayers who itemize deductions can deduct expenses exceeding 75 of adjusted gross income in addition b ecause the deduction covers catastrophic costs some might regard it higherpri ority use of limited public dollars variety of taxadvantaged accounts help consumers pa for unreimbursed expenses these accounts health care fl exible spending ccounts fsas health reimbursement accounts hras archer medical savings accounts archer msas and health savings accounts h sas differ on various dimensions25 but they are more similar than different offe ring account holders significant flexibility in using balances to cover health care expenses two of the accounts hsas and archer msas were crafted with an eye to limiting the impact of insuran ce coverage on demand because the accounts must be used in conjunction with high deductible health insurance plans some believe the combination will encourage consumers to be more prudent in seeking health services the underlying assumption that cons umers with savings accounts and high deductible plans will think twice before seeking discretionary health services is worth evaluation although incentives under this arrangement are not completely obvious if consumers accrue large account balances over time will they continue to be price sensitive or will they instead act as if they have firstdollar coverage and will highdeductible plans affect spending at all among consumers with health care expenses that easily exceed even high deductibles conclusion the good news is that policymakers have full toolbox for pursuing goals regarding health care costs and spending they can use government resources and leadership to help improve health care they can change federal programs to influence both access to care and federal spending and they can use tax policy to support and shape the market for h ealth insurance and health care the bad news is that both problems and solutions are complicated does the united states spend too much on health car or not how should society allocate its resources among members and how should policymakers set priorities among competing goals and interests even assuming agreement on these questions the congress faces difficult challenges in choos ing the best combination of policy tools for achieving whatever objective is adopted
