domain of the raja of atlan ta februa ry 20 2007 in attendance elaine traveling i vaidya tour raja we want to do everything we can to have vaidya tour but we have to make it feasible we should have people signed up since elaine is not here tonight we can talk little bit more next week about the mechanics we might want to take few notes about the vedic expe rts we never call them doctors certain states are more lenient about what people can do california for example is lenient we have to be careful not to do two things unless we have medical doctor sitting if person diagnoses or prescribes both then legally they are practicing medicine and of course our vaidyas dont have medical license what we do to work with this is we dont diagnose and we dont prescribe the first thing we do legally and this is not iron clad but general recommendation from lawyers we have worked with we have form and ask people wanting an evaluation to list the proble ms then have that way if the vaidya says oh you have liver problem or heart problemand generally better not to go to thatthey are not diagnosing because already on paper the vaidyas are there to give traditional ayurvedic evaluation of the doshas in light of ayurveda ayurvedic theory vata is out of balance pitta out of balance another important thing for everyone to know we dont treat the disease we treat the person the physiology treat isnt good word we evaluate according to traditional ayurvedic theory the imbalances of the doshas vata is air and akasha pitta is metabolism or fire kapha is structure water and earth which intimately makes mud in the spring that is why spring is kapha we dont diagnose we look at pulse to see vata pitta kaph prescribing how do we work with that if we dont have medical doctor sitting with vaidya we have copy of mapi catalogue vaidya goes over what person has written i have indigestion or stiff joints whatever is going on you can turn to that catalogue and because they are all written with disclaimers so that is legal we are not saying that will cure anything you can have something called sniffle free you have told you have stiff joints so you can take this for stiff joints we rely on protection from label and disclaimers form label next question how do people get stronger herbs like ma 631 rather than mens rasayana in reality those ma herbs are simply stronger more potent formulations to address the same imbalances as the labeled items with disclaimer so you let the person choose if you let the person choose you are not prescribing just as they go to the drug store and get either tylenol or advil vaidya simply advises we have mens rasayana but if you would like something stronger you might get 631 generally people start with labeled rasaya na this is an overall view of what we do to work with vaidya where everything is smooth and they are not breaking any state laws alcine if we have doctor trained in older training course would that be better raja always better to have doctor if possible alcine he is very busy he has done it before and he might have time to do it raja this is good this is the kind of thing we look for jeff would there be any compensation if he were to spend time with the vaidya raja many doctors like to do it because they are learning something mary if people come for particular disease that they have if we dont treat for disease how does that fit in they are going to ask questions raja they have already filled out form expert is not diagnosing disease they give about diet it is health consultation it is not medical event it is consultation about health proper diet what exercise is good for you it is not considered to be prescribing there are people all over the earth that talk to you about health that is okay does that answer your question mary they will probably go over vata pitta kapha raja umhunh yes food is medicines good rest is very healing so all of these things are okay but again we are careful we never promise that we are going to cure this or that if the vaidya were to start doing that raja konhous or i should know about that the vaidya has to work very innocently according to law of land healers are working in states like california where it is legal to say i can do this i can do that we dont make claims alcine what additional can vaidya do with doctor as opposed to without vaidya raja he can feel more free to go into more detail that herb is good for the eyes or the joints something like that it is just more relaxed open kind of session with him but in reality people are going to get the benefit if they do the proper diet routine proper rest proper exercise all of these things people are going to get the benefit we all want the details but as maharishi says keep it simple keep it simple keep it simple alcine can doctor explain and go into more detail raja yes that is always good thing i will check little bit more with what i have told you that is not as important maharishi definitely wants to protect the vaidya now there seems to be more leniency to send the vaidyas into the field the best situation is to have the doctor and have even have the vaidya tell the doctor if he knows the person is extremely agitated or confrontational it would definitely be best with the doctor vaidya and doctor go out of room then they come back and say vaidya said this and this and this raja there will be financial remuneration just like with the vedic expert all of it i think will be counted toward your netscape account when they come to visit alcine what do we do with the records where people write down their concerns are there forms that they fill out there are very strict privacy laws now called hipa raja i will have to look into that those privacy laws apply to doctors that is very good question alcine i will have to make note of that ii school project jane meeting tomorrow talked to dr hagelin today another nice donation to david lynch foundation the more the merrier
