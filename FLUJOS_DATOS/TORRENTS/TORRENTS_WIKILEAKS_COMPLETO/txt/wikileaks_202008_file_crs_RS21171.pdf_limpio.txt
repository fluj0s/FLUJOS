in the popular press one provision that received prominent coverage was the socalled tax rebate in fact the new tax law did not provide for tax rebate rather it created rate reduction tax credit rrtc in lieu of 10 tax bracket for tax year 2001 for most taxpayers most taxpayers received thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21171crs2 1 see the following httpwwwirsustreasgovpubirsnewsir0219pdfrrtc in the form of an advance check from the irs the advance checks which were distributed between july and october 2001 were based on inform ation contained in taxpayers 2000 tax returns the complexity of the rrtc and the advance check for the rrtc led to much uncertainty in the fall of 2001 the treasury department asked for and received guidance from congress concerning how the rrtc should be calculated in light of new rules for the chid tax credit also at the request of the treasury department the chairman of the house ways and means committee and the chairman and ranking member of the senate finance committee stated by letter th eir understanding that congress had intended to allow dependent file rs and nonresident aliens to be ligible for 10 tax rate bracket in 2001 in lieu of the rrtc the 2001 act excluded dependents nd nonresident aliens from coverage under the provisions of the rrtc but it was less certain whether or not they were eligible for the 10 bracket the treasury department designed the 2001 tax forms in manner that is consistent with the letter it had requested from the leaders of the congressional tax writing committees as formulated the provision accomplished the objective of providing immediate tax relief but the complexity and uncertainty regarding the advance checks and the rrtc led to numerous errors in the filing of 2001 federa l income tax returns the irs reported that more than 1 million returns filed through mid february 2002 had incorrectly reported the rrtc on their tax forms1 this report explains the advance check s the rrtc the postegtrra changes affecting the rrtc and why the rrtc was implemented instead of retroactive 10 rate bracket for 2001 explanation of the rrtc advance checks and 10 tax bracket the economic growth and tax relief reconcilia tion act of 2001 created new 10 marginal income tax bracket for the first 12000 of taxable income for joint returns 6000 for single individuals and 10000 for heads of households this new tax bracket is applicable for tax years beginning in 2002 for 2001 the act created rate reducti on tax credit rrtc in lieu of the 10 tax rate bracket for most taxpayers the rrtc for 2001 is 5 of the income that would have been subject to the new 10 marginal income tax bracket hence the maximum amount of the rate reduction ta x credit was 600 5 of 12000 for married couples filing jointly 500 for heads of households 5 of 10000 and 300 for singles 5 of 6000 egtrra excluded dependents and nonresident aliens from eligib ility for the rrtc but left unclear whether they would be eligible for the 10 tax bracket for 2001httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21171crs3 egtrra also implied that the rrt c should be app lied after all non refundable personal tax credits however because egtrra also changed the refundability of the child tax credit it was unclear whether the rrtc would be subtracted from tax liability before or after the child tax credit egtrra explicitly stated that the rrtc could be credited against the alternative minimum tax amt the rrtc was advanced to most taxpayers in the form of check the advance check from the us tr easury department in 2001 these advance checks were distributed pr imarily between july and october 2001 the advance check was calculate d based on taxpayers 2000 tax information taxpayers who d tax liability in 2000 along with dependents and nonresident aliens were not issued an advance check the advance checks were not reba tes for taxes paid in 2000 the advance checks were credits against 2001 income tax liability paid before taxpayers filed 2001 tax returns ho wever taxpayers were not required to repay excess credits the advance checks were issued based on the last two digits of the taxpayer identification number the taxpayers social security number the advance checks were issued beginning with the lowest last two digits of the taxpayer identification number taxpayers who received the maximum advance check for their filing status 600 for joint returns 500 for head of household returns and 300 for single returns did not have to reconcile their advance check with their rrtc when they filed their 2001 tax return taxpayers who did not receive an advance check or received an advance check that was less than the maximum rrtc for their filing status were required to reconcile their advance check with their rrtc when filing 2001 taxes after reconc iliation taxpayers that should have received rrtc greater than the advance check claimed the difference as credit on their 2001 tax return again taxpay ers were not required to repay the treasury if the advance check was greater than the rrtc to which they were entitled clarification of the rrtc for certain groups in september 2001 statement releas ed by the senate finance committee representative william m thomas and senator charles grassley noted that during the drafting of the new tax forms treasury and senate finance committee staff discovered that the statute could be interpreted in ma nner not consistent with congressional intent therefore the treasury department sought cl arification of congressi onal intent regardinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21171crs4 2 for more information on the child tax credit see crs report rs20988 the child tax credit after the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 by gregg esenwein how the rrtc should be applie d to dependents and nonreside nt aliens the treasury department also sought clarification on the calculation of the rrtc in relation to the child tax credit because the child tax cred it for families with two or fewer children was changed to refundable credit by egtrra2 in response to the treasury department re quest representative william m thomas senator charles grassley nd senator max baucus sent letter dated september 14 2001 to assistant secretary of the treasur for tax policy mark weinberger that clarified their understanding of the intent of congress concerning the issues the department had raised in designing the 2001 tax form s the treasury department interpreted the statute in manner consistent with the congressional intent expressed in the letter of september 14 2001 as result dependents and nonresident aliens who were not eligible for the rrtc and the advance checks would inst ead be eligible for the 10 tax bracket when they filed their tax returns for 2001 taxpayers who were entitled to claim child tax credits in 2001 were given the maximum benefits of the refundable features of the child tax credit thus the child tax credit would be subtracted from taxpayers income tax liability after the rrtc had been subtracted the rrtc is taken into account befo re the application of nonrefundable personal tax credits that provide fo r carryforward of benefits the adoption tax credit thus the adop tion tax credit would be subtracted from taxpayers income tax after th rrtc had been subtracted why rrtc instead of re troactive 10 tax bracket both the house and senate versions of the tax cut legislation sent to the conference committee included new 10 tax bracket the house version phased in reductions in tax brackets with the 10 tax bracket b ecoming fully phased in by 2006 the senate version established the 10 bracket retro active to the 2001 tax year the conference agreement established 10 tax bracket effective for tax years beginning in 2002 however the conference agreement included the rrtc instead of 10 tax bracket in 2001 proponents of the rrtc cited the need fo r immediate tax relief to stimulate the economy they argued that the retroactiv 10 rate bracket would not have delivered immediate tax relief as cleanly as the rrtc because of potential problems implementing changes in the withholding schedules unde r retroactive 10 tax bracket designed to deliver immediate relief in 2001 the new wit hholding schedules w ould have to under withhold the second half of the year at doubl the amount to compensate for the over withholding the first half of the year as result takehome pa would have appeared misleadingly large in the second half of 2001 then in 2002 the withholding schedules would revert to withholding schedules consis tent for complete year of income taxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21171crs5 3 mathew d shapiro and joel slemr od consumer response to tax rebates american economic review vol 93 1 mar 2003

2006 p 1606withholding as result withholding in 2002 would have increased the increase in withholding would have reduced takehome pay and it would have appeared to taxpayers that their taxes had increased relative to the accelerated rate of withholding during the last half of 2001 second option implementing changes in withholding schedules without compensating for the over withholding in th first half of 2001 w ould have delivered approximately half of the tax relief in 2001 so congress adopted the rrtc which wa s transmitted to most taxpayers via advance checks issued beginning in july 2001 an continued through october of 2001 the rrtc circumvented the problems associated with trying to provide immediate tax relief through income tax withholding howe ver according to the irs the new line on tax forms made necessary by the relatively complex rrtc led to numerous taxpayer errors impact of the rrtc after the rrtc checks were distributed economists evaluated the effectiveness of the rrtc in stimulating the economy the cha llenge of such an evaluation is isolating the effect of the rrtc from all of the other components of the stimulus package in march 2003 paper shapiro and slemrod ss surveyed house holds to determine how the receipt of the rebate checks would change be havior they found that 218 of those receiving the rebate reported that it would lead them mostly to increase spending3 ss report that 320 would save the rebate check and 462 would pay down debt both actions would do little to stimulate the economy in the short run4 another key finding in the ss paper is that lowincome households were not more likely to spend the rebate more recently in paper published in december 2006 johnson parker and souleles jps found that households spent about 20 to 40 of the rebate checks on nondurable consumption goods during the threemonth period in which the rebates were received and roughly twothirds of their rebates cumu latively during the quarter of receipt and subsequent threemonth period5 these findings seem to counter the findings of ss though jps explains that both studies discovered that most households did save the rebate check initially jps however tracked the households over longer peri od after the checks were mailed and found consumption expenditures eventually did spik upward jps conlude that their findings imply that the rebates provided substa ntial stimulus to the national economy in 2001httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21171crs6 6 johnson parker and souleles dec 2003 p 1606 7 for more on the impact of the rebate ch ecks see us
