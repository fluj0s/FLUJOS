library of congress global climate change us greenhouse gas emissions status trends and projections summary this report reviews us emissions of greenhouse gases in the contexts both of domestic policy and of international obligations and proposals on october 15 1992 the united states ratified the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc which entered into force on march 21 1994 this committed the united states to national policies to limit its anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases with voluntary goal of returning emissions of carbon dioxide co2 and other greenhouse gases methane ch4 nitrous oxide n2o hydrofluorocarbons hfcs perfluorocarbons pfcs and sulfur hexafluoride sf6 at the end of the decade to their 1990 levels subsequently in the 1997 kyoto protocol to the unfccc the united states participated in negotiations that ended with agreement on further reductions that could become legally binding the united states signed the kyoto protocol in 1998 but president clinton did not send it to the senate for advice and consent president bush has said that he rejects the protocol and former us environmental protection agency administrator christine todd whitman told reporters that the administration would not be pursuing the unfccc commitment either instead president bush has proposed to shift the nations climate change program from goal of reducing emissions per to goal of reducing energy intensity the amount of greenhouse gases emitted per unit of economic productivity under the proposal the intensity which has been declining for number of years would decline 18 between 2002 and 2012 as opposed to 14 projected business as usual decline meanwhile the unfccc end of the decade deadline has passed and us greenhouse gas emissions continue on an upward trend though with dips in 1991 and in 2001 attributed mostly to economic slowdowns based on historical data 2001 emissions were about 13 in excess of the unfccc goal overall from 1990 to 2001 us greenhouse gas emissions weighted by global warming potential have increased an average of about 11 per year projections suggest that us emissions will continue to rise for at least the next decade reversing the upward trend in greenhouse gas emissions would represent an extraordinary technical and political challenge to us energy and environmental policy this report will be updated as

global climate change us greenhouse gas emissions status trends and projections this report reviews us emissions of greenhouse gases in the contexts both of domestic policy and of international obligations and proposals on october 15 1992 the united states ratified the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc which entered into force on march 21 1994 by this action the nation made legally nonbinding commitment to national policies to limit its anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases which are believed to pose risk of global climate change1 the goal was to return these anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases at the end of the decade to their 1990 levels this goal was voluntary to demonstrate that developed countries are taking the lead in modifying longerterm trends in anthropogenic emissions consistent with the objective of the convention2 the convention established standards for inventorying and reporting greenhouse gas emissions subsequently the united states participated in negotiating the kyoto protocol to the unfccc3 under the kyoto protocol the united states would have made legally binding agreement that for the 5year period 20082012 it would reduce its average annual aggregate carbonequivalent emissions of six gases by 7 below specified baseline years4 however while president clinton signed the protocol in 1998 he did not send it to the senate for its advice and consent and president george w bush has said that he has intention of pursuing the kyoto protocol that it is fatally flawed5 nonetheless other nations continue efforts to implement the kyoto protocol and the united states remains obligated under the unfccc to inventory its emissions of greenhouse gases and to pursue voluntary reductions however as 1 this report does not address the underlying debate over global climate change and the potential role of humans in contributing to it on the science and policy of global climate change see crs issue brief ib89005 global climate change 2 unfccc article 4 commitments sections 2a and b 3 on the agreement see crs report rs30692 global climate change treaty the kyoto protocol 4 technically the net carbonequivalent emissions of the six greenhouse gases for the 5year period 20082012 are not to exceed 5 times 93 of the baseline emissions kyoto protocol article 31 this is equivalent to the average annual emission load during the 5year period being 7 below the baseline 5 white house office of the press secretary president bush discusses global climate change june 11 2001 crs2 described below president bush has announced voluntary program to reduce the intensity of us greenhouse gas emissions per unit of economic productivity6 based on this initiative according to former environmental protection agency administrator christine todd whitman the bush administration does not intend to pursue emissions cuts it committed to in the unfccc7 it is in this context then that this report sets out the baseline emissions that the united states has established and portrays trends in emissions over the past decade8 notes the current status of us emissions as compared to the unfccc goals and reviews projections and as point of reference compares them to the kyoto protocol emissions commitments assessing that prospective commitment does not imply that the united states should reduce emissions only what would be required if it were to join that agreement to reduce emissions in what follows figures for emissions are point estimates9 and rounded to millions of metric tons of carbon equivalents mmtce10 as will be discussed the data are of varying robustness and may be subject to adjustments the data for co2 which accounts for over 80 of domestic greenhouse gas emissions are the most robust being largely based on comprehensive fuel use data subsumed estimates and uncertainties in projected emissions have greater effect the further into the future one looks but even allowing for these imprecisions the trendline of aggregate us emissions of greenhouse gases is clear over the decade of the 1990s emissions trended upward and they are projected to continue to rise in the future us greenhouse gas emissions and baselines pursuant to the united nations framework convention on climate change the united states has published national inventories of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the montreal protocol using comparable methodologies agreed upon by the conference of the parties11

emissions an alternative measure of nations contribution to global warming is greenhouse gas intensity of the economy that is emissions per unit of gross domestic product gdp in effect this measure focuses on the efficiency of the economy in terms of greenhouse gas emissions the more efficient the fewer emissions per dollar of economic output and thus the lower the greenhouse gas intensity for the united states greenhouse gas intensity has been declining since at least the 1980s for the 1990s the decline in intensity was about 10 based on net emissions15 see table 3 emissions projections projecting greenhouse gas emissions involves modeling the nations economic growth and activity with special attention to variables affecting fossil fuel combustion the modeling also depends on assumptions about energy policy directions if reducing emissions becomes goal then projections become subject to the outcome of unresolved issues in how the emissions reductions goals might be met for example the major source of co2 emissions fossil fuel combustion is influenced by overall economic activity and growth as well as by energy policy decisions such as development of noncarbon based substitutes the rate of adoption of energy efficient technologies and the retirement rate of nuclear facilities among others these policy factors are difficult to predict in the absence of concrete climate change policy16 the climate change plan proposed by president bush in february 2002 provides some new policy directions but many elements depend on congressional action eg for funding or voluntary private sector initiatives making projections of their impact problematic 14 see changes in this years inventory report epa inventory of us greenhouse gas emissions and sinks 19902001 pp

number of state and local governmental initiatives as well as variety of private sector activities are underway to address greenhouse gas emissions effect on projections of varying assumptions car 2002 only makes point estimates but some sense of the implications of varying assumptions that affect the estimates can be gleaned from examining an alternative source of co2 emissions data the energy information agencys eias annual energy outlook series19 because of minor differences in data calculation and presentation eias annual emissions figures differ slightly from epas the eia reports projections of co2 emissions include sensitivity analyses to various changes in assumptions and since co2 from fuel combustion accounts for about 80 of us greenhouse gas emissions the analysis is reasonable test of the projections the assumptions eia examines include economic growth technological innovation oil prices electricity demand and others the first two economic growth and technological innovation have the greatest effect on variance in projections of co2 emissions see table 4 for 2010 compared to eias reference case which is equivalent to business as usual case low economic growth would reduce projected emissions by about 220 while high economic growth would increase projected emissions by about 3 compared to the reference case that assumes anticipated technological developments static technology would result in emissions rising about 2 while hightechnology case is projected to reduce emissions about 2 the point reference case cars point estimate effectively assumes the several variances affecting emissions cancel out but if all the variances increasing emissions prove true and cumulative then projected emissions for 2010 could be 5 or more higher than the point estimate conversely if all the variances decreasing emissions prove true and cumulative emissions could be 5 or more lower 17 car 2002 table 52 p 74 this excludes sequestration

greater variance in projections is possible for example that new energyefficient technologies could be deployed more quickly than generally assumed if appropriate policies were instituted november 2000 doe study commonly called the new 5lab study shows that energy efficiency gains in the transportation industry commercial and residential sectors could reduce emissions from the business as usual

department of energy doe have underway number of programs to foster the development and deployment of energyefficient technologies24 the presidents greenhouse gas intensity reduction initiative is new variable affecting projections it would have the effect of reducing anticipated emissions below business as usual levels in the future see figure 3 however the initiative does not reflect the level of aggressiveness assumed by the new 5lab study for policy interventions to achieve its advanced scenario for rapid penetration of energyefficient technologies status of emissions relative to goals under the unfccc the united states committed to the voluntary goal of holding greenhouse gas emissions at the end of the 1990s to their 1990 levels if the united states had met this goal its greenhouse gas emissions for 2000 would have been 1675 mmtce however us emissions in 2000 were 1921 mmtce not 23 ibid pp 1617 note that the carbon trading assumption has been effectively mooted since it was not

these figures indicate that in 2000 the nation was exceeding its unfccc greenhouse gas emissions commitment by 246 mmtce or nearly 15 if the united states had acceded to the kyoto protocol its greenhouse gases emissions target for the period 20082012 would have been 5 times 93 of the 1676 mmtce baseline or 1559 mmtce on average per year for the period this hypothetical goal would imply reductions equal to the difference between the goal and what would be business as usual emissions for the period 20082012 based on the car projection that emissions will be 2213 mmtce in 2010 the average annual reduction that would be necessary for the united states to meet the kyoto target of 1559 mmtce per year for 20082012 would be 654 mmtce per year or about 30 below the estimated level of business as usual emissions higher than base case economic growth or lower penetration of energyefficient technologies would mean that emissions would be even higher and reductions necessary to meet goal like kyoto greater slower economic growth or faster penetration of energy efficient technologies as suggested by the 5lab study would decrease emissions and hence reductions to meet goal the presidents greenhouse gas initiative has the goal of reducing through voluntary activities the intensity of net greenhouse gas emissions per unit of economic activity by 18 over the next 10 years this compares to projected business as usual decline in intensity of 14 for the period compared to decline during the 1990s of about 10 see table 3 according to the white house announcement this goal means that the current 2002 intensity of 183 metric tons of carbon emissions per million dollars of gdp would fall to 151 mmtce per million dollars of gdp in 2012 see figure 425 at the anticipated increased rate of intensity decline total emissions would decline 100 mmtce below business as usual emissions although the absolute amount of emissions would continue to rise it is too early to assess progress toward the administrations goal of diminishing greenhouse gas intensity 25 current data suggests that the 2002 carbon intensity baseline may have dropped below 180 mmtce see table 3 crs14 figure 4 greenhouse gas intensity presidents initiative source white house global climate change policy book feb 14 2002 at httpyosemiteepagovoarglobalwarmingnsfuniquekeylookupshsu5bnmajfilebush_gc cp_021402pdf these projected emissions levels and any implied reductions are gross estimates and do not take sinks into account except for the intensity projection as previously noted the baseline could be revised at least slightly more important such projections depend on assumptions about economic trends as well as about policy actions at the local domestic and international levels however whatever the assumptions the trend in total emissions experienced over the past decade and projected for the next decade is clearly upward while the unfccc goal was for stabilization and the kyoto protocol calls for emissions levels of developed nations to decline additional considerations in assessing possible reductions if one is concerned about assessing the implications of possible reduction requirements in the future two further factors must be considered one is sequestration which removes co2 from the atmosphere thereby reducing gross emissions the second is series of proposed trading mechanisms that could allow country to take credit for reductions it sponsors in other countries the united states was strong supporter of including both these variables in the kyoto protocol sequestration could directly diminish countrys reduction requirement trading does not change reduction requirement but it could affect costs and who would actually achieve the reductions carbon sequestration atmospheric greenhouse gas levels are affected not only by emissions but also by carbon sinks processes that remove and sequester carbon from the atmosphere activities that affect sequestration include farming and forestry practices for example positive net growth of trees removes carbon from the atmosphere clearing forests typically releases carbon table 1 us crs15 greenhouse gas emissions 1990 2001 includes figures for carbon sequestration from landuse activities and forestry which are the difference between total emissions and net emissions the unfccc states that signatory nations shall commit to promote sustainable management and promote and cooperate in the conservation and enhancement as appropriate of sinks and reservoirs of all greenhouse gases including biomass forests and oceans as well as other terrestrial coastal and marine ecosystems article 41d the kyoto protocol also would provide that sinks can be taken into account in calculating nations emissions and its reduction obligation the net changes in greenhouse gas emissions from sources and removals by sinks resulting from direct humaninduced landuse change and forestry activities limited to afforestation reforestation and deforestation since 1990 measured as verifiable changes in stocks shall be used to meet the 20082012 commitments article 33 in general then net increase in humaninduced carbon sequestration from forestry practices between 1990 and 20082012 would be subtracted from emissions during the period thereby reducing the amount of actual emissions that will have to be curtailed conversely net negative sequestration from forestry practices would be added to the emissions that will have to be reduced just how this calculation would be done is not prescribed in the protocol and disagreements on how much carbon sequestration could be counted toward nations reduction obligations were debated through several subsequent conferences in july 2001 the sixth conference of parties in bonn cop6 agreed to limits on sequestration activities that could be credited against the protocols reduction requirements although the united states chose not to participate in these proceedings the conference stated in footnote26 that under the methodology agreed upon the united states could take credit for net increases of sequestration of up to 28 million metric tons per year emissions trading emissions trading strongly supported by the united states in the kyoto negotiations derives from the principle of economic efficiency that reductions if necessary should be achieved at the lowest cost trading mechanisms thus are designed to allow lowcost reductions to substitute for higher cost ones the idea is that country could achieve its reduction goal not only by reducing its domestic emissions but also by reducing emissions elsewhere trading does not actually reduce nations reduction requirement but it does allow it to contract for and to count reductions elsewhere that are cheaper to achieve than domestic ones the kyoto protocol provides for emissions trading mechanisms27 that can be used to supplement domestic reductions this offers the possibility that actual 26 draft decision on implementation of the kyoto protocol on climate change adopted in bonn germany july 23 2001 footnote to appendix z 27 kyoto protocol articles 4 6 and 12 see also crs issue brief ib97057 global climate change marketbased strategies to reduce greenhouse gases crs16 domestic greenhouse gas reductions achieved by party to the kyoto protocol will be less than the partys actual commitment some portion of the reduction requirement could be shifted elsewhere the clinton administration argued that emission trading would be critical to us compliance with kyoto28 clinton administration economic analysis suggested that us compliance costs would drop from 193 per ton with international emissions trading to 23 per ton with global trading29 cop6 agreed that there would be quantitative limit on the amount of credit country could receive from trading but that domestic action must constitute significant part of nations reduction efforts30 with quantitative limit on trading any estimate of actual domestic reduction required to comply with the kyoto protocol or of the costs involved remains problematic and is moot as long as the united states declines to participate in the kyoto process conclusion the precise numerical projections of greenhouse gas emissions or of proposed reductions should be viewed as indicative see figure 3 they are less accurate than they appear given the potential for revisions in data and the uncertainties of projections but in assessing the status of us greenhouse gas emissions the trendline for aggregate greenhouse gas emissions is clear for the united states the overall trend is up none of the reviewed scenarios using assumptions that diminish emissions low economic growth putting off retirement of nuclear
