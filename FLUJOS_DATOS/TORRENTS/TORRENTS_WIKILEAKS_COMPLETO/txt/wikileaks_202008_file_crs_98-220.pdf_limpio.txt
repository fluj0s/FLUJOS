wayne m morrison economics division updated march 3 1999 abstract chinas response to the asian ﬁnancial crisis has important ramiﬁcations for us economic interests chinese currency devaluation could further destabilize other currencies of several east asian economies which could signiﬁcantly aﬀect us trade with the region china might also choose to respond to the crisis by putting hold on its plans to liberalize its economy and lower trade barriers this would likely further complicate chinas attempt to join the world trade organization and would further strain uschina economic relationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98220for background information on the crisis see crs report rl30012 global financial turmoil1 contagion effects and policy responses by dick k nanto updated january 13 1999 congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congressreceived through the crs web98220 updated march 3 1999 chinas response to the global financial crisis implications for us economic interests wayne m morrison specialist in international trade and finance economics division summary since 1997 several east asian economies notably indonesia thailand and south korea and since 1998 russia and brazil have experienced significant financia l difficulties including sharp currency depreciations plunging stock market prices an d declining economic growth the global f inancial crisis contributed to slowdown in the growth of the chinese economy in 1998 especially its export sector although it fared better than most of its east asian neighbors many of whom fell into recession however many analysts have expresse d concern that deepening of the global financial crisis may induce china to devalue its currency the yuan in order to stimulate expor t growth such move could lead to new destabilizing round of currency devaluations through out east asia which would further depress us exports to the region i n addition it would make chinese products cheaper in us markets and thus exacerbate the us trade deficit with china another concern is that china might also choose to respond to the financial crisis by putting hold on its plans to liberalize its economy and lower trade barriers this could further complicate chinas attempt to join the worl d trade organization and further strain uschina economic relations the global financial crisis and chinas response to date since 1997 several east asian economies notably south korea thailand an d indonesia have experienced significant financial difficulties in their economies as hav russia and brazil since 1998 such difficulties have included substantial currenc devaluations as investors have transferred funds overseas and significant declines i n stock market prices most of the other east asian economies including japan hon g1 kong singapore the phil ippines and malaysia have also experienced varying degrees of financial difficulties falling stock market pri ces andor currency depreciation the globalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98220crs2 in 1998 the economies of japan hong kong south korea indonesia malaysia and thailand were in2 recession in 1998 the chinese government issued 12 billion in bonds to fund new infrastructure projects3financial crisis has also seriously weakened or exposed weaknesses in the financia l institutions such as banks of several east asian economies the financial crisis s contributed to sharp economic slowdown throughout much of the region2 chinas economy does not appear to have been as severely affected by the globa l financial crisis as most of its asian neighbors this is likely due to number of factors chinas currency the yuan is not fully convertible china maintains over 145 billion in foreign exchange reserves its foreign debt is relatively small compared to other asia n nations its financial institutions banks stock markets etc are tightly controlled by the central government and foreign involvement is relatively minor and most foreig n investment in china i s direct such as joint ventures in china rather than portfolio such as stocks and bonds investment over the past year or so chinese government officials have made number f statements publicly through the press and in meetings with us officials and hav implemented various policies in response to the global financial crisis first chines officials have pledged not to devalue their currency during the crisis second china has offered standby loans as part of the international monetary fund imf financial assistance packages for indonesia and thailand to help stabilize their economies third chines officials have pledged that their government will spend 12 trillion over three years n infrastructure development which may have been meant as signal that china would use domestic spending rather than increased exports to promote future economic growth3 fourth several officials have stated that the crisis will not deter china from making further economic reforms fifth the government has attempted to clamp down on illega l smuggling and foreign exchange transfers finally the chinese government has expanded export credits and tax rebates to exportoriented industries w hich have been hit the hardest by drop in demand such as textiles concerns over possible future chinese reactions to the fin ancial crisis while chinas economy to date has been relatively insulated from the effects of the global financial crisis many analysts believe that the crisis could continue over the nex t few years and possibly deepen which might seriously weaken the chinese economy i n 1999 due to number of factors much of chinas economic growth has been fueled by exports which according to chinese government data grew at an average annual rate of 16 from 1979 t 1997 in 1998 exports grew by only 05 chinese exports to asia fell by 10 while exports to the united states and the european union eu rose by 161 and 172 respectively an economic slowdown in the united states and eu in 1999 could result in negative export growth for china in 1999 many analysts estimate that chinas real gdp was significantly below th governments 78 estimate for example standard poors dri estimate s chinas real 1998 gdp growth at 53 the slowest annual growth since 1990 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98220crs3 standard poors driworld markets report china december 1998 p 34 it is not clear whether or not devaluations of east asian currencies have yet displaced chinese exports5 to the unit ed states and other third markets however such devaluations have likely forced chines manufactures to lower prices on many items in which direct competition from east asia exists chinese exports to east asian economies which account for about half of chinas exports fell sharply6 in 1998 over 1997 levels including those to hong kong 115 indonesia 363 singapore 91 japan 67 south korea 313 and thailand 235 and projects that it will slow to 43 in 1999 this indicates that chinas economy4 may have s lowed considerably and that domestic spending alone may not b enough to achieve the governments gdp growth target of 70 in 1999 major factor in the chinese governments decision not to devalue the yuan i n 1998 appear s to have been the decline in chinese imports due in part to wea k domestic demand as result the sharp slowdown in chinas export growth did not result in deterioration in chin as merchandise balance of trade chinese trade data indicate that china incurred 436 billion trade surplus in 1998 up 77 from the previous year this enabled china to maintain high level of foreig n exchange reserves estimated to have totaled 145 billion at the end of 1998 chinese officials believe maintaining high foreign exchange levels is critical t maintaining the stability of the yuan deteri oration in chinas trade balance might occur in 1999 if demand for imports outpaces exports further major east asian currency devaluations should they occur could mak many of their exports cheaper in foreig n markets visavis chinese products which could displace many chinese exports to the united states and other markets in5 addition east asian currency devaluations would further depress their demand for chinese products 6 east asian currency devaluations have made many of their exports to chin cheaper to some extent thi s has likely benefitted some chinese firms which rely on imports from asia of raw materials and machinery used to make products fo r export on the other hand cheaper imports from east asia have put competitive pressure on many chinese firms raising demand from chi nese industries for greater restraints on imports such as steel according to chinese data foreign direct investment fdi in china which s been major factor in chinas economic development over the past several years fell slightly in 1998 from 453 billion in 1997 to 450 billion further decline in fdi could impede chinas ability to raise capital in the near term fo r infrastructure development and economic modernization chinese officials are deeply sensi tive to the prospects of an economic downturn due to concerns that if unemployment in china rises too quickly social unrest will result condition the government strongly wants to avoid many analysts argue that shar p downtu rn in economic growth andor sharp deterioration in chinas balance of trad could cause the chinese government to devalue its currency andor delay th implementation of economic and trade reformshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98220crs4 for example th wefa group an economic forecasting firm states that chinese devaluation could7 spark new and possibly catastrophic round of currency devaluation see the wefa group asia economic outlook february 1998 p 4 maintaining hong kongs economic stabili ty since its reunion with china in july 1997 has been major8 priority of the chinese government standard poors dri international financial bulletin december 1999 p 19 the wefa group china first quarter 1999 p 1010 wefa group asian economic outlook february 1997 p 4911chinese curr ency devaluation given the current shaky economic state of many east asian economies most analysts contend that chinese currency devaluation in the near term would likely further destabilize the economies of the region chines e7 currency devaluation in 1999 would also likely entail economic and political costs fo r china first chinese imports would become more expensive increasing inflationar pressures as well as raising costs for many inputs second devaluation might b interpreted in world markets as sign that china would not defend hong kongs pegging of its currency to the us dollar which could significantly undermine investor confidence in hong kongs economy third it would likely increase the level of chinese exports to8 the united states thus boosting the size of the uschina trade imbalance which reached about 57 billion in 1998 politically sensitive issue in uschina trade relations finally devaluation wo uld undermine chinas current image as stable and responsible economic power in the region and could adversely affect its relati ons with other east asian nations analysts differ on whether china will devalue its currency in 1999 for example standard poors dri estimates that competitive pressures from currency devaluations from the other east asian economies will force china to devalue its currency by 20 against the us dollar in late 1999 but only if the financial crisis in asia has stabilized so that th shock of devaluation will be minor the wefa group projects that th e9 chances of chinese devaluation in 1999 are low due to chinese concerns that such move would further strain uschina economic relations 10 effects on chinas economic reforms second major issue is how the asia n financial crisis will affect the future course of chinese economic reforms mos t economists argue that china needs to make several major economic reforms in order to maintai n rapid economic growth including reform of its stateowned enterprises an d financial institutions the asian financial cr isis could complicate chinas efforts to reform these sectors reform of stateowned enterprises stateowned enterprises soes whic h account for about onethird of chinese industrial production place heavy strain n chinas economy it is estima ted that 75 of chinas largest 100000 soes lose money and must be supported by state subs idies many of the tariff and nontariff trade barriers11 imposed by china on imports are intended to protect the soes from foreign competition in the past the chinese government has been reluctant to cut off financial support to the soes out of cern that it would lead to widespread bankruptcies and significant employment disruptions that could cause social unrest however in recent years th ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98220crs5 far eastern economic review world wide web page december 11 199712government has admitted that it cannot aff ord to support the soes indefinitely in march 1998 the chinese government announced that it would in effect privatize all but 1000 key industries over the next three years the government contends that exposing th soes to competition will make them more efficient and able to compete withou t government assistance thus freeing resources for more productive uses the global financial c risis may complicate chinas planned reforms of the soes in variety of ways first the c hinese government is counting on rapid economic growth to help find new jobs for workers displaced by soe reform s slower economic growth would make it much more difficult for displaced workers to find jobs in other sectors of th economy and hence raises the prospects for possible social unrest second it is likel that chinese officials are counting on foreign investors to play major role in restructuring the soes by becoming joint owners and thereby providing financing and managemen t assistance to such firms however the global financial crisis could slow down the level of foreign investment in china especially from asian countries most affected by the crisis as result less capital would be availa ble for restructuring the soes slowing economic growth less foreign investmen t and sharp increase in imports may prompt the chinese to slow or delay reforms to open its markets to foreign imports in order to maintai n protection of the soes financial institutions chinas banking system faces several major difficulties due largely to its financial support of soes and failure to operate sufficiently on marketbased principles the cen tral government uses the banking system to keep moneylosing soes afloat by pressuring state banks to provide low interest loans without these loans large share of the soes would likely go bankrupt currently about 70 of stateowned bank loans now go to the soes large share of those loans are not repaid the high volume of bad loans now held by chinese banks estimated to total more than 20 of china s gdp poses serious threat to chinas banking system to large extent chinas state12 banks make loans on the basis of p olitical not commercial considerations this promotes widespread inefficiencies in the economy however in january 1998 the chines government announced plans to impleme nt new reforms that would attempt to reduce the ability of local and provincial officials to use connections to obtain questionable loans the global financial crisis may complicate chinas plans to further reform the banking system china needs growing economy to help the chinese state ban ks reduce their debt in addition many analysts argue that chinas banking system cannot become purel commercial operation until it stops subsidizing the soes factor that becomes mor uncertain due to the recent slowdown in economic growth implications of chinas r esponse to the asian financial crisis for us china economic relations chinas response to the global financia l crisis has widespread ramifications for us china economic re lations as well as for us economic ties with other asian nations to date us officials have generally praised chinas response to the crisis especially it s pledge not to devalue its currency noting that it has helped to stabilize the effects of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98220crs6 however us officials have been critical of chinas increasing use of export credits and tax rebates 13 arguing that such policies constitute facto devaluation crisis however should china later reverse this policy it could lead to extensiv e13 devaluations throughout east asia which could further undermine the economies of the region should this occur us exports to the region would probably fall further while imports would rise and the us trade deficit with china and other east asian economies probably would increase sharply it is difficu lt to predict whether the global financial crisis will slow or accelerate the pace of chinas economic reforms on the one hand the crisis may cause the chines leadership to approach further reforms with greater caution in the belief that it was th opennes s of the east asian economies that made them susceptible to financial crisis chinese leaders may fear that chinas economy if reformed too quickly or extensively could make its currency and stock markets susceptible to disruptive speculative force s outside of china on the other hand the global financial crisis may cause the chines leadership to move ahead with planned economic r eforms especially if it is perceived that many of the causes of the financial crisis such as government industrial policies wea k financial systems and closed markets are so indicative of weaknesses within the chinese economy the crisis may also affect the way china approaches its goals of modernizing its econom such as whether to try to emulate japanese and south korean busines s conglomerates keiretsu and chaebols to promote the growth of advanced and hightech industries the pace of chi nese economic reforms in the wake of the global financial crisis will likely have major impact on chinas attempt to join the world trade organizatio n wto the international body that sets rules for most trade the united states view s chinas wto accession unde r commercially viable terms critical factor in expanding market access for us goods and services in china chinese fficials have stated that they will continue to reform chinas trade regime in order to gain wto membership despite the effects of the global financial crisis on chinas economy however us officials have raised concerns that china has recently imposed several new trade barriers such as quotas registration requirements restrictions on foreign investment on variety of sectors including agriculture telecommunications equipment and various services in addition new financial controls on trade imposed in july 1998 in order to crack down on illega l foreign exchange transfers have made it more difficult to export products to china should china continue to impose new barriers in 1999 or thereafter andor fail to make substantial new offer s to liberalize trade its accession to the wto will likely be opposed by the unite d states and other wto members failure on the part of china to mak progress on its wto application could also prompt the unit ed states to use its trade laws such as section 301 of the 1974 trade act as amended to force china under the threat of sanctions to open its markets chinas response to the global financial crisis will also likely affect congressiona l action on uschina economic relations for example chinese currency devaluation or delay in economic reforms could increase congressio nal opposition to renewing chinas normal trade relations ntr status
