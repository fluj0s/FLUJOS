case of moldov as reunification with romania figure 1 transnistria and gagauz regionsthe parliament the law will likely hurt the fragmented oppos ition government control of the electronic media will also likely help the cpm transnistria conflict between moldovan forces and those of the breakaway dniestr republic separatist entity pr oclaimed in 1990 by ethnic russian local officials in the transnistria region of moldova erupted in march 1992 over 300 people died in the violence ceasefire was declared in july 1992 that provided for russian dniestr republic and moldovan peacekeepers to patrol security zone between the two regions each of the peacekeeping contingents have roughly 400 personnel they are overseen by joint control commission which includes the three sides as well as the osce as an observer the causes of the conflict are complex involving ethnic factors and above all maneuvering for power and wealth among elite groups ethnic russians and ukrainians together make up 51 of transnistrias population of about 650000 while moldovans are the single largest ethnic group at 40 many analysts are convinced that key factor obstructing settlement is the personal interests of the leaders of the dniestr republic and associates in moldova russi and ukraine who control the regions economy they also allegedly profit from ille gal activities that take place in transnistria such as smuggling and human trafficking the 2007 state department human rights report sharply criticized the poor human rights record of the dniestr republic noting its record of rigged elections harassment of political opponents independent media many religious groups and romanianspeakers negotiations over the degree of autonomy to be accorded the transnistria region within moldova have been stalled for many years1 the two sides ve negotiated over transnistrias status with the mediation of russia ukraine and osce in 2005 at the urging of ukraine and moldova the united st ates and the european union joined the talks as observers in 2006 moldova ffered package proposals in which transnistria would have br oad autonomy within moldova moldova would reaffirm

would be withdrawn russian property rights in transnistria would be recognized nevertheless transnistrian and russian leaders apparently satisfied with the present state of affairs have blocked any agreement in september 2006 transnistria held referendum on indepe ndence and union with russia which passed with 97 of the vote economy according to the world bank moldovas per capita gross national income of 1100 in 2006 makes it the poorest country in eur ope living standards are poor for the great majority of moldovans pa rticularly in rural areas over 26 of the population live in poverty more than quarter of moldovas economically active population work abroad remittances from this group amount to about onethird of the countrys gross domestic product moldovas main natural resource is its rich soil agriculture especially fruit wine and tobacco plays vital role in moldovas economy most of moldovas industry is located in transnistria moldova has had mixed succe ss in economic reform it has succeeded in achieving measure of macroeconomic stability includi ng the stabilization of moldovas national currency the leu however moldovas sma ll economy is highly vulnerable to external shocks moldova has privatiz ed its small and mediumsized business sector and it has had success in privatizing agricultural land the sale of large fi rms has stalled under communist rule and foreign investment in moldova is low key problems include poor governance weak judiciary and corruption foreign policy perhaps moldovas most important foreign policy relationship is with russia most of moldovas exports go to russia and over 90 of its energy imports come from russia moldova has accumulated large debt s to russian energy firms some analysts charge that russia has used negotiations over transnistria to expand its political leverage over the country and to block any moldovan moves toward euroatlantic integration the transnistria issue is complicated by the continued presence of about 1500 russian troops in the breakaway region including the approximately 400person peacekeeping contingent in the security zone as well as huge stockpiles of weapons and ammunition russia has flatly refused to honor co mmitments it made at the 1999 osce summit in istanbul to withdraw its forces from moldova russian leaders have also attempted to condition the withdrawal of russian troops on the resolution of transnistrias status russia has provided financial s upport to transnistria including grants and loans as well as subsidized energy in return russian firms have assumed control over most of transnistrias industry2 on january 1 2006 gazprom cut off natura l gas supplies to moldova after moldova rejected gazproms demand for doubling of the price moldova pays for natural gas gazprom restored supplies on january 17 in exchange for slightly smaller price increase moldova also agreed to give ga zprom already the majority shareholder ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21981crs4 higher equity stake in moldovagaz which c ontrols moldovas natural gas pipelines and other infrastructure gazprom is also seeking to complete the purchase of transnistrias stake in moldovagaz some analysts charge that russia is using energy supplies and other trade as weapons to pressure moldova to dr op its prowestern orient ation and to turn its energy infrastructure over to moscow in 2005 russia restricted wine and other agricultural imports from moldova allegedly ove r health concerns dealing very heavy blow to the countrys economy russia fi nally permitted moldovan wine imports again in november 2007 but moldovas wine expor ts to russia remain reduced from former levels the russiangeorgian conflict of augu st 2008 may have an impact on moldova transnistrian authorities may become even more intransigent in talks over settlement they could press russia to grant them dipl omatic recognition as independent states as moscow has done for georgi as south ossetia and abkhazia regions possibly as prelude to incorporating transn istria into russia on the other hand observers note that the case of transnistria is different from that in georgia in that moldova is very unlikely to try to retake transnistria by military force moreover they point out that russia does not have common border with transn istria as it does with georgia russia could push for transnistria settle ment that would give the prorussian enclave effective veto power over the count rys foreign and domestic policies which could stymie any moldovan efforts toward eu ropean integration however even without recognizing transnistrias independence or exerting heavier pressure for settlement favorable to transnistria russia may still succeed in dissuading moldova from pursuing prowestern course even before the ge orgia war russia successfully pressed moldova to reduce its role in the guam regional group n amed after the initial letters of the names of its members georgia ukraine azerba ijan and moldova

union with romania in 1994 refere ndum over 90 of moldovans rejected unification with romania however it is possible that more inhabitant s of this impoverished country may begin to favor union with
