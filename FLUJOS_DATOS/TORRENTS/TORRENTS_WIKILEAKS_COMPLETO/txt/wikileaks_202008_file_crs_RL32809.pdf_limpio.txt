also called gm genetically modified crops or gmos genetically modified organisms became commercially available in the mid1990s us soybean cotton and corn farmers have rapidly adopted them as adoption has spread there have been policy debates over the costs and benefits of ge products issues include the impacts of ge crops on the environment and food safety and whether ge foods should be specially labeled underlying these issues is the question of whether us regulation and oversight of biotechnologywith responsibilities spread primarily among the us department of agriculture usda the food and drug administration fda and the environmental protection agency eparemain appropriate particularly as newer applications eg biopharmaceuticalsdrugs manufactured with th use of ge crops or animals emerge that did not exist when the current regulatory regime was established on august 18 2006 the secretary of agriculture announced that trace amounts of an unapproved variety of ge rice had been found in samples of the 2005 crop of us longgrain rice the secretary and other usda officials sought to reassure the rice trade and consumers that the findings posed human health food safety or environmental concerns nonetheless the findings unsettled rice markets threatened rice exports and rekindled longtime criticisms that us oversight of biotech should be strengthened some us agricultural export markets notably the european union eu have taken more restrictive approach to regulating agricultural biotechnology than the united states presenting obstacles for us farm exports this year world trade organization wto dispute panel ruled against the eus facto moratorium on approvals of new ge crops from 1998 to 2004 even though the eu says it has ended its moratorium with its may 2004 approval of ge variety of corn for import us agricultural interests are concerned that stricter eu rules for labeling and tracing ge products could continue to discriminate against us exports under us rules ge crops do not have to be distinguished from nonge crops also there is debate over whether agricultural biotechnology will improve according to proponents or undermine according to opponents food security in developing countries congress generally has been supportive of ge agricultural products although some members have expressed wariness about their adoption and regulation the 109 th congress continues to follow trade developments particularly the useu dispute the recent ge rice case and us regulatory mechanisms for approving biotech foods this crs report will be updated if

plants and animals to improve growth rates and yields create varieties resistant to pests and diseases and infuse special nutritional or handling characteristics such modifications have been achieved by crossbreeding plants and animals with desirable traits through hybridization and other methods now using recombinant dna techniques scientists also genetically modify plants and animals by lecting individual genes that carry the desirable trait eg resistance to pest or disease from one organism and inserting them into another sometimes very different organism that can be raised for food fiber pharmaceutical or industrial uses since genetically engineered ge sometimes called genetically modified or gm crop varieties first became commercially available in the mid1990s us soybean cotton and corn farmers have been rapidly adopting them in order to lower production costs and raise crop yields proponents point to socalled second generation of ge commodities that could shift the focus of biotechnology from the input side creating traits that benefit crop production such as pest resistance to the output side creating traits that benefit consumers such as lowerfat oils these second generation products could offer enhanced nutritional and processing qualities and industrial and pharmaceutical uses future products are expected to be livestock as well as crop based critics meanwhile complain that biotechnology companies generally have not yet delivered the consumer benefits they have been promising for years in august 2006 traces of an unapproved variety of ge rice were reported in commercial rice samples from parts of the southern united states see biotech ricebelow the incident has added to the ongoing interest in number of public policy questions what are the environmental and food safety impacts of ge crops and animals what obstacles and opportunities are exporters of ge crops encountering in the global marketplace is the current us regulatory framework

crop types dominated by soybeans cotton and corn3 eightynine percent of all us soybean 83 of all upland cotton and 61 of all corn acres were pl anted with ge seed varieties in 2006 according to usdas national agricultural statistics service nass see table 1 almost all current commercial applications benefit the production side of agriculture weed and insect control are by far the most widespread uses of ge crops here and abroad herbicidetolerant ht crops are engineered to tolerate herbicides that would otherwise kill them along with the targeted weeds these include ht soybeans ht upland cotton and to lesser extent ht corn many of these are referred to as roundup ready because they are engineered to resist monsantos glyphosate herbicide marketed under the brand name roundup insectresistant crops effectively have the pesticide inserted into the plants themselves to control insect pests for the life of the crop many of these crops have been genetically engineered with bt bacillus thuringiensis soil bacterium which has naturally occurring pesticide these insect resistant varieties are most prevalent in upland cotton to control tobacco budworm bollworm and pink bollworm and in corn to control earworm and several types of corn borers 3 sources information systems for biotechnology at virginia tech also usda ers the first decade of genetically engineered crops in the

that the varieties being grown were not of consistently high quality ge potato varieties may have peaked several years ago at 23 of the market they were discontinued by the seed developer in 2001 mainly after several fast food and snack food companies declined to buy them varieties of ge wheat and rice as well as ge sugar beets flax and radicc hio have received government approval but have not been commercially marketed andor research has been discontinued presumably due largely to perceived producer or consumer unease with them nonetheless usda reported that between 1987 and early 2005 aphis had approved more than 10700 applications to conduct field tests of various ge crop varieties out of 11600 received from companies and other researchers which the department characterized as useful indicator of rd efforts on crop biotechnology nearly 5000 applications were approved for corn alone followed by soybeans potatoes cotton tomatoes and wheat more than 6700 applications were for

lik ely contain some ge material that is largely because two such plants corn and soybeans where farmers have widely adopted ge varieties are used in many different processed foods us biotechnology rules do not require segregation and labeling of ge crops and foods as long as th ey are substantially equivalent to those produced by more conventional methods see regulation and oversight below soybased ingredients include oil flour lecithin and protein extracts cornbased ingredients include corn meal and corn syrups used in many processed products canola oil mostly imported from canada where gecanola is grown and cottonseed oil are used in cooking oils salad dressings snack foods and other supermarket it ems geproduced animals are yet approved for human consumption although cheeses may c ontain chymosin and dairy products may have been produced from milk containing gebst as noted earlier because most other governmentapproved ge crops are not being grown commercially few other gederived foods are reaching consumers analysts say some farmers are wary of planting ge crop varieties because their customers may be worried about their safety biotechnology supporters contend that such concerns are unfounded because scientific reviews have found approved ge crop varieties to be safe and that foreign governments are simply using such concerns to maintain barriers to imports

actually reaching the marketplace plants being developed but not yet commercialized could become factories for pharmaceutical compounds the compounds would be extracted and purified for human and

and canadian governments for their approval and other ge wheat varieties had been under development some producers wanted to plant the wheat as soon as it became available others feared rejection by foreign customers of not only ge wheat but all us and canadian wheat out of concern that even nonge shipments might unintentionally contain some ge grain the latter group wanted developers and regulators to wait for more market acceptance before releasing ge wheat varieties in early 2003 group of us wheat producers d petitioned the administration to conduct more thorough assessment of the environmental impacts of the monsanto request 27 farm religious and consumer advocacy organizations ndorsed the petition in early 2004 underlining these concerns japanese consumer groups in march 2004 reportedly told us officials in wheat dependent north dakota that their country woul d not import any us wheat products if the monsanto application was approved23 this resistance likely contributed to decision by monsanto to discontinue its efforts to win regulatory approval of genetically modified wheat variety monsanto announced its decision on may 10 2004 although monsanto withdrew its applications for regulatory approval from epa and aphis it did not withdraw its fda application fda subsequently approved the application in july 2004 however fda approval alone is not sufficient to bring the gm wheat to market g23g495g21g495g556g7g23g561g6g146g156g153g158g157g142g561 in may 2003 the united states canada and argentina initiated complaint before the world trade organization wto regarding the eus facto moratorium on approvals of new ge crops us agricultural interests contended that the moratorium not only blocked exports such as corn and other products to the eu but also was fueling unwarranted concerns about the safety of agricultural biotechnology throughout the world the united states and its allies further argued that the eu moratorium was violating wto rules stating that countrys actions to protect health and the environment must be scientifically based and approval procedures must be operated without undue delay the wto named panel in march 2004 to consider the case although the eu effectively lifted the moratorium in may 2004 by approving genetically engineered corn variety the three complainants pursued the case in part because number of eu member states have continued to block approved biotech products in february 2006 the wto dispute panel in its interim confidential report ruled that moratorium ex isted that bans on euapproved ge crops in six eu

made public in september 200624 the dispute panels interim ruling appeared to dismiss several other us and cocomplainant claims and did not address such sensitive issues as whether ge products are safe or whether an eu moratorium on ge approvals continued to exist the final ruling among other things reportedly directs the eu to bring its practices in line with wto rules eu officials have long asserted that their cautious approach to regulating agricultural biotechnology has been necessary to restore confidence among european consumers who have become much more wary of changes in food production after series of major food safety crises that were not related to ge crops at the same time eu officials contended that they in fact had shown good faith in moving as quickly as possible to restart the approval process at least one eu country germany has addressed the issue of potential liability from gm crops passing law in november 2004 that holds farmers who plant gm crops liable for damages to nearby nongm fields even if the gm farmers adhered to planting instructions and regulations some us interests countered that the moratorium will not effectively end until the eu clears more of some two dozen or more ge food and agricultural products still awaiting regulatory approvaland eu member states actually implement the approvals the wto case does not involve the eus new labeling and traceability regulations in effect as of april 2004 to require most food feed and proc essed products from gmos to be labeled meat and livestock products generally are exempt ge based products also must be segregated from nonge products with documentation us agricultural interests argue that even if the eu regularly approves gmos the labeling and traceability rules are themselves unworkable and unnecessary and can mislead consumers by wrong ly implying that gmderived products are inherently different than nongm foods or pose safety concerns 25

so it would be the first time ge plant was used widely as staple food and may influence the decisions of other asian countries with regard to accepting ge foods27 in the debate over the potential contribution of biotechnology to food security in developing countries critics argue that the benefits of biotechnology in such countries have not been established and that the technology poses unacceptable risks they also suggest that intellectual property rights ipr protection gives multinational companies control over developing country farmers proponents say that the development of ge technology appears to hold great promise with the potential to complement other more traditional research methods as the new driving force for sustained agricultural productivity in the 21st century they maintain that ipr difficulties have been exaggerated differences on this issue were featured in 2002 when the united nations world food program wfp announced an appeal for food aid to meet the needs of some 14 million food short people in six southern african countries lesotho malawi mozambique swaziland zambia and zimbabwe however debate over the presence of genetically modified corn in us food aid shipments made the provision of f ood aid more difficult and costly some of the countries expressed reluctance to accept unmilled ge corn on account of perceived environmental and commercial risks associated with potential introduction of ge seeds into southern african agriculture zambia refused all shipments of food aid with ge corn out of health concerns as well in march 2004 angola said it too would ban imports of ge food aid including thousands of tons of us co rn despite need to feed approximately 2 million angolans the united states has blamed eu policies for southern african countries views on food aid containing ge products president bush for example has stated that eu governments because of their policies on ge products are hindering the cause of ending hunger in africa28 the united states maintains that genetically modified crops are safe to eat and that there is little likelihood of ge corn entering the food supply of african countries for several reasons including the fact that bioengineered varieties of corn are not we ll adapted to african growing conditions the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations has offered qualified

prove allergenic introduce increased toxicity or otherwise be harmful to human health some critics express concern that fda is placing all the responsibility on manufacturers to generate safety data as it does normally under its premarket approval system and is reviewing only the conclusions of industrysponsored studies rather than conducting its own tests they also believe that the process lacks transparency and adequate public scrutiny of data others defend the current system they counter that additional testing and oversight are unnecessary because all foods must meet the same rigorous federal safety standards regardless of whether or not they are genetically engineered in july 2004 the institute of medicine and the national research council iomnrc of the national academies of science released report generally supporting the proponents view the iomnrc found that food safety should be assessed based on the composition of the altered food eg whether it contains new compounds unusually high levels of nutrients or other significant traits rather than how the food was produced by genetic engineering or conventional methods however the iomnrc determined that the safety of modified foods should be assessed on casebycase basis and cautioned that scientists current ability to predict adverse consequences of genetic changes is limited 30 us policy also does not require gederived f oods to be so labeled as long as they are substantially the same as their more conventional counterparts nonetheless some consumer groups continue to seek mandatory labeling of all ge foods these groups argue that us consumers like their eu counterparts should have an opportunity to see all relevant information on label so that they can make food choices based on their own views about its perceived quality or safety the food industry generally opposes compulsory labeling it contends that consumers might interpret ge labels as warning labels implying that the foods are less safe or nutritious than conventional foods when the industry believes the preponderance of science indicates otherwise the industry also has asse rted that mandatory labeling would require development of costly and possibly unattainable system to ensure that ge and nonge foods remain segregated from the farm to the store with added benefit to the consumer the industry has asserted that if consumers want to purchase gefree products the market will support 29 food and agriculture organization the state of food and agriculture 20032004 at httpwwwfaoorgdocuments

threshold minimis amount of ge material permissible in nonge material adventitious presence ap refers to any incidental appearance of very small amounts of foreign material in commodity food or feedstuff this can occur at any time during production harvesting storage or marketing another related question is how to assess liability if such mixing does occur or if ge plants prove harmful to the environment for exam ple to what extent if any should biotechnology companies share liability with producers and others who use their products presently in the grain business even shipments of the highest grades are permitted to contain some specified low levels of unwanted material such as weeds damaged kernels andor stems and leaves corn graded 1 for example may contain up to 2 foreign material as more crops and acreage are devoted to ge varieties it becomes increasingly difficult if not impossible to avoid their trace presence in nonge varieties internationally recognized standards have existed for what amounts if any of ge material should be permitted in nonge crop especially if that crop or food derived from it will be labeled as nonge in the absence of such standards individual countries are establishing their own often varying ap thresholds the lack of consistent scientifically sound standards is confusing consumers and disrupting trade the biotech industry has asserted for example the new eu regulation sets tolerance level for nongm foods feeds and processed products at 09 all products with more than 09 must be labeled as gm us agricultural interests consider the eu regulation in particular to be unworkable and discriminatory eu officials counter that their standards not only are reasonable but also are being demanded by consumers see also useu

produced organisms they note that the technology is more precise than traditional methods like crossbreeding the latter methods transfer unwanted and unanticipated characteristics along with the desired new traits from one organism to another biotechnology also has made it possible to apply fewer and less toxic chemical herbicides and insecticides and to reduce soil tillage thereby decreasing erosion and improving soil fertility supporters of the technology assert critics counter that genetic engineering is not like traditional breeding it creates crop and animal varieties that would not otherwise occur in nature posing unpredictable risks to the environment and to human health they point out because they are living organisms ge crops are difficult to control greatly increasing the potential for escapi ng into the environment crossbreeding with and overtaking wild species and generally disrupting the natural ecosystem critics believe for example ge herbicidetolerant seeds or pollen could inadvertently create superweeds that out compete cultivated or wild plants critics argue 2002 nasnrc report stated that it could find new distinctions between the types of environmental risks posed by ge plants and those posed by more conventionally bred crops and that in fact there is need to reevaluate the potential environmental effects of the latter the study concluded that the current aphis regulatory system for biotechnology has improved substantially since it was first initiated and is more rigorous than the environmental oversight for other agricultural products and practices the stud did find areas of concern including the need for greater transparency and public input into the regulatory process and for more ecological monitoring after ge plants are approved and enter the marketplace more recent nasnrc report cited studies to conclude that some ge organisms are viable in natural ecosystems and can breed with wild relatives the report urged developers of ge organisms to consider biological techniques such as induced sterility in order to prevent transgenic plants and animals from escaping into the environment because single bioconfinement method is likely to be 100 effective and because few are welldeveloped such developers should create redundant system by using more than one method of containment the report called for more research to improve both containment methods and public confidence in regulation 32 in may 2004 separate report by university of arizona and texas am university researchers confirmed the spread of ge corn into nearby

worldwide hundreds of ge plants are under development for use as factories for pharmaceuticals and other industrial compounds ge pharmaceuticals might include for example vaccines or medicines for forms of cancer infectious diseases cardiovascular and nervous system diseases metabolic disorders and agents of biowarfare proponents believe plant based pharmaceuticals will provide far more costeffective alternative to conventional pharmaceutical production which now requires major investments both in large volumes of purified culture mediums and in manufacturing plants plantbased pharmaceuticals on the other hand could be easily incorporated into the existing agricultural infrastructure providing significant new source of farm income they believe 35 critics are concerned about impacts on the food supply if crops like corn the most widely planted us crop an intensively researched plant for biot echnology and also an airborne pollinator are pharmed in 2002 for example material from gealtered corn plants that had been testplanted in prior growing season in nebraska for pharmaceutical use for prodigene inc was inadvertently mixed with some 500000 bushels of soybeans which had to be quarantined by usda to keep them out of the food supply usda officials observed that the soybeans never reached the food or feed supply evidence that current regulatory oversight is effective nonetheless concerns persist among both consumer groups and the food manufacturing industry about producing ge plantmade pharmaceuticals in food crops some want 100 prevention systems in place before the first product is commercialized some of these groups suggest that only nonfood crops should be used for ge plantmade pharmaceuticals or that at minimum pharmaceutical crops should be banned from agricultural areas where food and feed crops are produced other potential issues include whether manufacturers of plantbased pharmaceuticals will be able to maintain consistency in dosages and overall quality and unanticipated environmental problems eg threatening endangered species 36 responding to such concerns aphis published in the march 10 2003 federal register notice tightening permit conditions for its 2003 field tests of ge plants with pharmaceutical and industrial traits the changes included 1 doubling the minimum distance allowed between traditional corn fields and test sites of pharmaceutical or industrial corn 2 for all pharmaceutical crops corn and other doubling fallow zones around test sites 3 restricting what can be grown on test site and fallow zone in the next growing season 4 using dedicated machinery eg harvesters planters and storage facilities only for pharmaceutical productionadequate cleaning for other uses is longer acceptable 5 submitting for
