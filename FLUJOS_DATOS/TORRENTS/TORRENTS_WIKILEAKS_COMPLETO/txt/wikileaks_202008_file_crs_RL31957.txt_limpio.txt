amy f woolf specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division nonproliferation and threat reduction assistance us programs in the former soviet union summary congress passed the nunnlugar amendment authorizing us threat reduction assistance to the former soviet union in november 1991 after failed coup in moscow and the disintegration of the soviet union raised concerns about the safety and security of soviet nuclear weapons the annual program has grown from 400 million in the dod budget around 11 billion across three agencies dod doe and the state department it has also evolved from an emergency response to impending chaos in the soviet union to more comprehensive threat reduction and nonproliferation effort to broader program seeking to keep nuclear chemical and biological weapons from leaking out of the former soviet union and into the hands of rogue nations or terrorist groups the department of defense manages the cooperative threat reduction ctr program which provides russia ukraine belarus and kazakhstan with assistance in transporting storing and dismantling nuclear chemical and biological weapons us assistance has helped these nations eliminate the delivery systems for nuclear weapons under the start i treaty secure weapons storage areas construct storage facility for nuclear materials removed from weapons construct destruction facility for chemical weapons and secure biological weapons materials the state department manages the international science and technology centers in moscow and kiev these centers provide research grants to scientists and engineers so that they will not sell their knowledge to other nations or terrorist groups the state department has also provided assistance with export and border control programs in the former soviet states the department of energy manages programs that seek to improve the security of nuclear materials at civilian naval and nuclear weapons complex facilities it also funds programs that help nuclear scientists and engineers find employment in commercial enterprises doe is also helping russia dispose of plutonium removed from nuclear weapons and shutdown its remaining plutoniumproducing reactors by replacing them with fossilfuel plants analysts have debated numerous issues related to us nonproliferation and threat reduction assistance these include questions about the coordination of and priority given to these programs in the us government questions about russias willingness to provide the united states with access to its weapons facilities questions about the presidents ability to waive certification requirements so that the programs can go forward and questions about the need to expand the efforts into global program that receives funding from numerous nations and possibly extends assistance to others outside the former soviet union this report complements crs report 971027 nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction programs issues

reduction assistance us programs in the former soviet union introduction in the budget submitted for fy2008 congress authorized around 13 billion for us programs that provide nonproliferation and threat reduction assistance to russia and the other states of the former soviet union1 the administration has requested around 11 billion for these programs in its fy2009 budget including 4141 million for dods cooperative threat reduction ctr program 572 million for the department of energys doe nonproliferation programs in russia and around 110 million for state department nonproliferation programs in the former soviet union2 with these programs the united states seeks to help the recipient nations transport store and eliminate nuclear chemical and other weapons secure and eliminate the materials used in nuclear chemical and biological weapons and prevent proliferation of the knowledge needed to produce these weapons to nations or groups outside the former soviet union since fy1992 the united states has appropriated nearly 10 billion across these three agencies for these programs3 president bush has often voiced support for these programs in november 2001 the white house noted that the united states is committed to strong effective cooperation with russia and the other states emerging from the former soviet union to reduce weapons of mass destruction and prevent the proliferation of these weapons or the material and expertise to develop them4 at the usrussian summit in may 2002 the united states and russia pledged to continue cooperative threat reduction 1 this includes 4256 million for the cooperative threat reduction ctr program at the department of defense dod around 804 million for the department of energys doe nonproliferation programs in russia and the other former soviet states and around 916 million for the portion of the state department nonproliferation programs in the former soviet union 2 the doe budget request for nonproliferation assistance programs totaled more than 800 million and the state department budget in these areas totaled around 125 million but both include funding for programs outside the former soviet union 3 the term spent in this statement refers to the amount of money appropriated for threat reduction and nonproliferation programs the amount of money actually paid to contractors for the work covered by these programs is less than the appropriated amount because many projects take years to complete and payments may occur years after the money is appropriated 4 the white house office of the press secretary fact sheet us government nonproliferation and threat reduction assistance to the russian federation november 13 2001 crs2 programs and expand efforts to reduce weaponsusable fissile material5 at their summit meeting in bratislava in february 2005 presidents bush and putin again agreed to enhance their cooperation in securing nuclear weapons and materials6 furthermore in june 2002 the president joined with the leaders of the g8 nations to create the g8 global partnership against the spread of weapons and materials of mass destruction as is discussed in more detail later in this report under this partnership the united states has committed to provide up to 10 billion over 10 years to pursue nonproliferation and threat reduction programs in russia and the other former soviet states this amount of 1 billion per year roughly equals current us expenditures on threat reduction and nonproliferation programs congress has also supported us nonproliferation and threat reduction programs in the former soviet states although some members have questioned the value and effectiveness of some specific projects congress has authorized most of the funds requested by the executive branch in the years since these programs began congress has also helped shape the programs prohibiting funding for some types of projects and providing added funding for others many analysts have questioned however whether the united states is doing all that it can to prevent the leakage of knowledge weapons and materials from the former soviet states in its first budget submission in early 2001 the bush administration reduced funding for the dod threat reduction programs by nearly 10 and cut more than 100 million out of does defense nuclear nonproliferation programs funding category that includes us nonproliferation assistance to russia7 the administration increased funding for these programs in fy2003 fy2004 and fy2006 but its budget for fy2005 and fy2007 for the dod threat reduction programs again showed 10 decrease even with increases in doe budgets some analysts argue that when combined with declines in the dod budget the funding falls short of what is needed to address the continuing dangers of proliferation from the former soviet states further they note that the administration has begun to shift funding away from programs that secure weapons and materials in the former soviet states and into programs that provide border security and assistance to greater number of nations around the world consequently they argue if the funding level does not grow the united states will not be able to accelerate the programs with the former soviet union to ensure that they effectively stop the proliferation of russias weapons materials and knowledge these concerns are evident in the congressional action on the fy2008 budget which includes increases in several of the threat reduction and nonproliferation programs many analysts cite as further evidence of the administrations wavering commitment its failure to certify russia for threat reduction funding in fy2002 the 5 the white house office of the press secretary text of joint declaration may 24 2002 6 the white house office of the press secretary joint statement by president bush and president putin on nuclear security cooperation february 24 2005 7 congress eventually restored the funding for does defense nuclear nonproliferation programs and added 223 million more in the fy2002 emergency supplemental appropriations pl 107206 passed after the september 11 2001 attacks crs3 administration stated that it could not certify russias compliance with its obligations under the biological and chemical weapons conventions this finding delayed several ongoing programs8 the administration asked congress to allow it to waive the certification requirements this debate is discussed in more detail later in this report so that funding could continue but for many analysts this episode demonstrated that the administration had not placed the highest priority on nonproliferation and threat reduction programs in spite of its declarations about stopping proliferation to keep weapons of mass destruction away from terrorists at issue in the debate over us threat reduction and nonproliferation programs is not only the total amount of funding that the united states might commit to these programs in the former soviet states but also the priority and sense of urgency that the united states assigns to them further congress has identified the expansion of these programs as one of the key steps that might be taken to implement the 911 commission reports recommendations legislation prepared for consideration early in the 110th congress indicates that among the steps that should be taken to implement the 911 commission recommendations the united states should ease the process of expanding these programs to other nations outside the former soviet states both the house and the senate are also poised to eliminate the certification requirements entirely in their versions of the fy2008 defense authorization bills many studies have offered recommendations for the size shape and operation of these programs that differ from the approaches taken by the clinton and bush administrations this report summarizes many issues raised in these reports and in congressional debates on the future of us nonproliferation and threat reduction assistance however it first reviews the history of these programs describing their origins in 1991 their expansion and evolution during the 1990s and the changes in their direction during the first two years of the bush administration the report also provides broad summary of many of the program areas and projects supported by us funding background the nunnlugar amendment congress initiated us threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance to the soviet union in november 1991 failed coup in moscow in august 1991 and the subsequent disintegration of the soviet union had raised concerns about the safety and security of soviet nuclear weapons consequently senators nunn and lugar proposed an amendment to the implementing legislation for the conventional armed forces in europe cfe treaty pl 102228 the senate passed the legislation by vote of 868 the house adopted it through the conference report this amendment titled the soviet nuclear threat reduction act of 1991 authorized the use of 400 million in fy1992 defense department dod funds to assist the soviet union and its successor entities with efforts to 1 destroy nuclear weapons 8 the certification is only required for dod programs and some state department programs the absence of certification did not affect doe programs crs4 chemical weapons and other weapons 2 transport store disable and safeguard weapons in connection with their destruction and 3 establish verifiable safeguards against the proliferation of such weapons9 senators arguing in support of the program including senators nunn lugar and biden emphasized the potential risks inherent in the soviet collapse they noted that the disintegration of the soviet union created the danger that the ultimate disposition of nuclear weapons in the new political system will not be conducive to their safety or international stability particularly if the weapons remained in several of the former soviet republics these senators also warned of danger of seizure theft sale or use of nuclear weapons or components particularly if widespread disintegration in the custodial system should occur and third they argued that any weakening of control over weapons and components could spill outside the territory of the former soviet union fueling nuclear proliferation worldwide10 senator nunn further warned that we are on the verge of either having the greatest destruction of nuclear weapons in the history of the world or the greatest proliferation of nuclear weapons nuclear materials and scientific knowhow on how to make these weapons as well as chemical weapons ballistic missiles even biological weapons the world has ever seen11 senators who supported this legislation also emphasized that by targeting us defense resources at the prompt safe dismantlement of nuclear and chemical weapons in the soviet arsenal12 this assistance would embody new approach to enhancing our national security an approach which fits dramatically new national security environment13 senator biden further stated that through this legislation the united states would be assisting ourselves not the soviet union but others questioned this characterization they viewed the proposed assistance to the soviet union as foreign aid which they opposed and argued that the united states should instead use its defense resources to fund its own military and national security needs furthermore some argued that in providing assistance to the soviet union the united states would allow the soviet union to divert its own resources away from the protection and dismantlement of its older weapons and towards the development and production of new weapons that could create new threats to the united states14 members have raised these themes on numerous occasions over the years debating whether us nonproliferation and threat reduction assistance is foreign aid program 9 for more information on this legislation see crs

to both the united states and the former states of the soviet union initially congress used the dod budget to fund us threat reduction assistance to the former soviet states in 1993 dod began to refer to this effort as the cooperative threat reduction ctr program experts from other agencies such as the state department and department of energy participated in the projects when their expertise was required in fy1997 these agencies each took budgetary and management responsibility for the projects that relied on their expertise consequently although many analysts and observers still use the title cooperative threat reduction program when referring to the full range of us nonproliferation programs this is longer accurate this report only uses the term ctr when referring to the threat reduction programs funded by the department of defense it uses the phrase threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance to refer to the full range of programs in dod doe and state slow start when congress created the ctr program many members and experts outside government seemed to envision relatively simple program where officials from the united states would travel to the four former soviet states with nuclear weapons on their territories russia ukraine belarus and kazakhstan to quickly safeguard and help dismantle nuclear chemical and other weapons but the programs implementation was far slower and more complex than many expected first the need to develop and implement coordinated policies among several us government agencies primarily dod doe and the state department and within several organizations in the pentagon slowed program implementation furthermore the united states had to negotiate umbrella agreements with each recipient nation setting out the privileges and immunities of us personnel and to establishing the legal and customs framework for the provision of aid before it could spend any money in the former soviet states lingering mistrust between the parties along with the high level of secrecy surrounding russias nuclear and chemical weapons programs complicated this process in 1992 and 1993 during its first few years in office the clinton administration sought to resolve the bureaucratic issues that had delayed the program it offered broader political support to cooperative relationship with russia through high level commission chaired by vice president gore and russias prime minister chernomyrdin this commission identified many efforts that later received funding through the ctr program the clinton administration also provided significant policy and financial support to the ctr program overcoming the reticence that had been expressed by some officials in the first bush administration consequently it succeeded in sharply increasing the rate of expenditures on ctr projects by the mid1990s with the administrations support and with continuing congressional interest in the program us threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance began to expand and evolve it expanded to several agencies with doe and the state department each funding nonproliferation efforts in the former soviet union it also expanded to include broader range of programs where it had first focused on improving transportation security and helping with the destruction of strategic offensive nuclear weapons it grew to include wide range of efforts to secure and destroy nuclear crs6 chemical and biological weapons the materials used in these weapons and the knowledge needed to design and produce these weapons it has also expanded financially from an initial level of approximately 400 million per year to total of nearly 1 billion per year across the three agencies an evolving program initially many in congress saw us assistance under nunnlugar as an emergency response to impending chaos in the soviet union even after the sense of immediate crisis passed in 1992 and 1993 many analysts and members of congress remained concerned about the potential for diversion or loss of control of nuclear and other weapons russias economy was extremely weak and press accounts reported that nuclear materials from russia were appearing on the black market in western europe consequently many began to view ctr as part of longterm threat reduction and nonproliferation effort former secretary of defense william perry referred to ctr as defense by other means15 as the program helped eliminate soviet weapons that had threatened the united states and contain weapons and materials that could pose new threats in the hands of other nations by the mid1990s many observers also began to view us assistance to the former soviet states as part of the effort to keep weapons of mass destruction away from terrorists in 1996 experts testified to congress that russian nuclear and chemical facilities with their crumbling security and lack of accounting procedures could provide source for terrorists seeking nuclear or chemical materials in response congress expanded the programs that provided security at facilities with nuclear materials and suggested that more attention be paid to security at facilities with materials that could be used in chemical or biological weapons16 in january 2001 task force sponsored by the department of energy stated that the most urgent unmet national security threat to the united states today is the danger that weapons of mass destruction or weaponsusable materials in russia could be stolen and sold to terrorists or hostile nation states and used against american troops abroad or citizens at home17 since september 11 2001 virtually all analysts who follow us threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance have made the link between the possible quest for weapons of mass destruction by terrorists and the potential for thwarting them by helping russia protect its weapons materials and knowledge18 15 see for example us department of defense cooperative threat reduction april 1995 washington dc p 1 16 the march 1995 nerve agent attack in the tokyo subway system by the aum shinryo cult raised the profile of this type of threat 17 the report went on to state that unless protected from theft of diversion the former soviet arsenal of weapons of mass destruction threatens to become goldmine for wouldbe proliferators the world over baker howard and lloyd cutler cochairs russia task force report card on the department of energys nonproliferation programs with russia the secretary of energy advisory board united states department of energy january 10 2001 p 1 18 senator sam nunn has stated that preventing the spread and use of nuclear biological continued crs7 the bush administration has also linked us threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance to the former soviet states to us efforts to keep weapons of mass destruction away from terrorists in early 2003 it stated that it had expanded the strategic focus of the ctr program to support the war on terrorism19 in its budgets presented between fy2004 and fy2007 it increased funding for several export and border control programs for programs designed to stem the leakage of knowledge out of the former soviet union and for an effort to find and recover radiological sources type of military device that could provide terrorists with nuclear materials for use in dirty bomb20 all of these initiatives focus more on stemming proliferation than on eliminating nuclear weapons in the former soviet states but it did not completely lose the initial focus in february 2005 at the bratislava summit presidents bush and putin agreed to accelerate some of the efforts to secure sovietera nuclear weapons as is noted below this agreement has shifted additional funding into some of the dod ctr projects department of defense cooperative threat reduction program program objectives at its inception the ctr program sought to provide russia ukraine belarus and kazakhstan with assistance in the safe and secure transportation storage and dismantlement of nuclear weapons during the first few years the mandate for us assistance expanded to include efforts to secure materials that might be used in nuclear or chemical weapons to prevent the diversion of scientific expertise from the former soviet union to expand militarytomilitary contacts between officers in the united states and the former soviet union and to facilitate the demilitarization of defense industries21 in 1994 congress also indicated that threat reduction funds could be used to assist in environmental restoration at former military sites and to provide housing for former military officers who had been demobilized as result of the dismantling of strategic offensive weapons the 104th congress reversed this position however banning the use of ctr funds for environmental restoration or 18 continued and chemical weapons and materials should be the central organizing principle on security for the 21st century remarks by former us senator sam nunn chairman nuclear threat initiative carnegie endowment for international peace international nonproliferation conference november 14 2002 19 us department of defense fiscal year 20042005 biennial budget estimates former soviet union threat reduction appropriation february 2003 p 1 20 many analysts believe that this type of weapon which could disperse radioactive materials across wide area might be particularly attractive to terrorists for details see crs report rs21528 terrorist dirty bombs brief primer by jonathan medalia 21 for more detailed description of the changes in the legislative mandate for the ctr program see crs report 971027 f nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction programs issues for congress by amy f woolf crs8 housing for military officers it also denied additional funding for the defense enterprise fund which focused on demilitarizing former soviet defense industries by the mid1990s congress and the clinton administration had agreed on mandate for the ctr program that focused on the core objectives of securing and dismantling nuclear and chemical weapons along with protecting against the proliferation of knowledge and materials that might be used in the production of these weapons by other nations the clinton administration outlined this mandate in four key objectives for the ctr program destroy nuclear chemical and other weapons of mass destruction transport store disable and safeguard these weapons in connection with their destruction establish verifiable safeguards against the proliferation of these weapons their components and weaponsusable materials and prevent the diversion of scientific expertise that could contribute to weapons programs in other nations22 in the late 1990s congress added funds to the ctr budget for biological weapons proliferation prevention this effort has expanded substantially in recent years congress also expanded the ctr program to allow the use of ctr funds for emergency assistance to remove weapons of mass destruction or materials and equipment related to these weapons from any of the former soviet republics23 its first budget in fy2002 the bush administration reduced ctr funding by nearly 10 from over 440 million to 403 million it also began review of all us threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance to russia and the former soviet states stating that it sought to ensure that existing us cooperative nonproliferation programs with russia are focused on priority threat reduction and nonproliferation goals and are conducted as efficiently and as effectively as possible24 some analysts welcomed the review noting that it could provide an opportunity to revise and expand some programs but others feared the review would lead to reductions in funding and the elimination of some programs 22 us department of defense cooperative threat reduction april 1995 washington dc p 4 23 dod has used ctr funds for this purpose in several instances for example in november 1997 the united states purchased 21 nuclearcapable mig29 aircraft from the republic of moldova before moldava could sell these aircraft to nation seeking nuclear delivery capabilities in april 1998 using ctr funds the united states and great britain moved 88 pounds of highly enriched uranium and 176 pounds of highly radioactive spent fuel from nuclear reactor outside tbilisi georgia to dounreay scotland 24 the white house fact sheet administration review of nonproliferation and threat reduction assistance to the russian federation december 11 2001 crs9 when it announced the results of the review the administration stated that it found that most us programs to assist russia in threat reduction and nonproliferation work well are focused on priority tasks and are well managed25 but the review did signal shift in the focus of us nonproliferation and threat reduction assistance instead of highlighting projects aimed at the elimination of nuclear weapons the administration indicated that it would expand some projects that focused on chemical and biological weapons nonproliferation including increasing funding for the construction of controversial chemical weapons destruction facility in russia for many this change seemed to be natural response in the postseptember 11 environment to growing concerns about the potential link between terrorism and weapons of mass destruction others however saw it as retreat from the longstanding core objectives of the ctr program the administration confirmed this shift in focus with the release of its fy2004 budget request for ctr where the administration requested and received 50 million in fy2002 and around 133 million in fy2003 for the construction of the chemical weapons destruction facility in russia it requested and congress authorized 2003 million in fy2004 this is nearly 45 of the total ctr budget request the administration also increased funding for biological weapons proliferation prevention from 17 million in fy2002 to around 55 million in fy2003 and 542 million for fy2004 in contrast funding for strategic offensive arms elimination in russia declined from 1334 million in fy2002 to 701 million in fy2003 and 576 million in fy200426 furthermore in testimony before the house armed services committee jd crouch the assistant secretary of defense for international security policy stated that the administration had revised the four key objectives for ctr the program now seeks to dismantle fsu former soviet union wmd weapons of mass destruction and associated infrastructure consolidate and secure fsu wmd and related technology and materials increase transparency and encourage higher standards of conduct support defense and military cooperation with the objective of preventing proliferation27 25 ibid 26 the reduced request for fy2004 reflects in part the presence of unexpended balances from fy2003 the united states did not spend these funds because it could not initiate any new contracts during the period after the president did not certify russia for participation in the ctr program and before congress allowed the president to waive the certification requirement see statement of dr jd crouch ii march 4 2003 p 4 27 us house committee on armed services statement of dr jd crouch ii assistant secretary of defense for international security policy march 4 2003 p 4 the continued crs10 although most ongoing ctr projects are consistent with these objectives the absence of any specific reference to the destruction of nuclear weapons is notable in addition by stating that the united states seeks to encourage higher standards of conduct the bush administration has indicated that it will place higher priority on russian openness cooperation and compliance with arms control agreements this emphasis was evident in the administrations decision against certifying russia for ctr assistance in 2002 this also presents something of departure from the past when the united states raised issues of transparency openness and compliance with russia during private meetings but did not tie these issues directly to the goals of the ctr program ctr funding when congress first passed the nunnlugar amendment it authorized the transfer of 400 million in fy1992 funds from other dod accounts for threat reduction activities in the former soviet union few of these funds were spent in fy1992 so congress extended the transfer authority for fy1992 funds and authorized the transfer of an additional 400 million from other dod accounts in fy1993 in subsequent years the clinton administration requested and congress authorized new appropriations for the ctr program table 1 summarizes the amount of funding the presidents requested for the ctr program and the amount authorized by congress in each of the fiscal years between 1992 and 2006 congress has authorized just over 6 billion for ctr since 1992 congress has approved the administrations request for ctr funding in most years but has added or reduced funding in some in fy1996 the new republican majority in the house questioned many elements of the ctr program and the house armed services committee reduced funding to 200 million the senate had approved the administrations request and the conference committee agreed on compromise of 300 million the house also reduced the administrations request in fy1997 approving 3029 million for ctr but the senate added 37 million and the house eventually accepted the senates version in the conference committee28 27 continued administration has formally incorporated these objectives into its planning for and reporting on the ctr program see us department of defense fy2006 ctr annual report to congress december 31 2004 p 1 28 this trend with the house approving less than the president requested and the senate approving the presidents request continued for several years for details see crs report 971027 nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction

fy1992fy2007 690185 total fy1992fy2008 72848 in fy2001 the house reduced president clintons request for ctr to 433 million the senate approved the full request and the conference committee settled on 443 million this reduction was part of dispute between the house on one side and the senate and the clinton administration on the other side over funding for the chemical weapons destruction facility at shchuchye in russia the house armed services committee had reduced funding for that program in fy1998 and fy1999 in each of these two years the senate and the conference committee approved the administrations requests in fy2000 the house again eliminated all funding for the construction of shchuchye and mandated instead that ctr fund security improvements at russias chemical weapons storage facilities the conference committee accepted the house position but still approved the administrations request for 4755 million for ctr in fy2001 the senate again accepted the house position banning funding for shchuchye and this time accepted small reduction in total funding for ctr crs12 in fy1996 when the clinton administrations request for ctr funding declined from 400 million to 371 million total us spending on threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance to russia actually increased in that year the materials protection control and accounting program mpca moved from dods ctr budget to the department of energy the clinton administration requested and congress authorized 70 million for doe programs in addition 33 million in funding for the international science and technology center in moscow moved from the dod budget to the state department budget in subsequent years as is noted in more detail below funding continued to grow for the doe and state department programs as is evident in the table above the bush administrations request for ctr funding declined in both fy2007 and fy2008 and although the funding request for fy2009 is greater than the fy2008 request it falls below the amount authorized in fy2008 for the most part these declines reflect reductions in the funding requested for the chemical weapons destruction facility at shchuchye as it neared completion and to lesser extent declines in funding for weapons elimination programs the administration did not propose to offset these reduction with increases in funding for new existing projects or the initiation of new projects congress did not accept this new funding profile in fy2008 both chambers added funding for ctr programs the house has added 50 million with 427 million going to the plant at shchuchye and 7 million allocated to potential new initiatives in the ctr program the senate for its part added 80 million to the ctr budget request with 50 million of this added funding going to biological weapons proliferation prevention funds were also added to the accounts for strategic offensive arms elimination in russia and weapons of mass destruction proliferation prevention the conference committee hrept 100477 title xiii accepted the senates funding level authorizing 428 million for ctr with much of this added funding going to biological weapons proliferation prevention the legislation also authorizes 10 million for new ctr initiatives that are outside the former soviet union the conference committee did not retain the provision approved by the house that would fund new initiatives in ctr within the former soviet union it did however express support for such initiatives hrept 110477 sec 1306 and request study by the national academy of sciences that would assess possible initiatives and identify options for strengthening the program ctr projects in its early years the department of defense divided the ctr program into three distinct project areas chain of custody destruction and dismantlement and demilitarization29 although it longer makes these distinctions in its requests for or reports on ctr programs they serve as useful organizational tool when reviewing the history of the programs 29 this division and the description in the next few paragraphs come from us department of defense cooperative threat reduction april 1995 washington dc p 56 the fourth category other includes administrative expenses and special project on arctic nuclear waste crs13 chain of custody chain of custody activities are those designed to enhance safety security and control over nuclear weapons and fissile materials many of these were completed during the early years of ctr these programs were created in part in response to early concerns about the safety and security of weapons and materials in transit the united states and the recipient nations also found it easier to agree on the implementation of projects that focused on transit and storage of nuclear weapons and materials than to focus on destruction activities the brief descriptions that follow summarize some of the key chain of custody activities30 transportation security when the soviet union

keep track of warheads in storage according to the gao this effort was slowed by russias reluctance to provide the united states with information about the precise number of sites in need of security upgrades and its refusal to allow the united states access to sites to design appropriate upgrades for example dod purchased 123 kilometers of perimeter fencing for weapons storage sites the russian ministry of defense mod said it would install the fences itself but it has reportedly made little progress in doing so35 furthermore the united states purchased and tested equipment for comprehensive

shchuchye the house balked again and approved 50 million the house armed services committee argued that the program could not absorb such large increase in one year and because russia did not yet appear committed to the elimination of its chemical weapons that the united states should not accelerate its efforts the conference report 107772 also limited funding for shchuchye to 50 million but it stated that the administration could use the remaining 836 for other projects related to the storage and elimination of nuclear weapons or for chemical weapons destruction if russia provides full and accurate disclosure of its chemical weapons stockpile the bush administration requested 200 million for this project in fy2004 the senate approved this amount but the house in its version of the fy2004 defense authorization bill hr 1588 reduced the funding to 1715 million it also mandated that the united states could only release funds in excess of 71 million if russia and other nations contributed to the project specifically the us contribution could not exceed the other nations contribution by more than factor of two these provisions reflect concerns expressed by some in the house about lack of financial commitment from russia and other european nations to the shchuchye project the conference committee rejected the house position approving the full 200 million for shchuchye and eliminating the linkage of us funding to funding from other nations nevertheless by december 2003 six other countries had contributed 69 million to the project52 the bush administration requested and congress authorized 1584 million for shchuchye in fy2005 the reduction in funding for this project represents most of the reduction in the overall ctr budget between fy2004 and fy2005 this reduction in funding does not derive from any significant policy debates about the project instead it occurred because the fy2004 budget included funding for one time investment in capitalintensive construction equipment the united states does not need to repeat this investment in fy200553 the administration requested and received an additional 1085 million in its budget for fy2006 it requested only 427 million for this project in fy2007 congress approved this request the administration has indicated that the reduction reflects the maturity of the project and the lack of any further capital investment the administration did not request any additional funding for the shchuchye plant in the fy2008 budget this lack of funding has raised eyebrows among analysts outside government as work at

existing budget did not account for the rising costs of construction materials in russia the conference committee approved 6 million for this project area allowing some work to continue during fy2008 congress has also required that the secretary of defense submit report on the strategy and cost estimates for completing the shchcuchye project the administration again did not request any funding for shchcuchye in fy2009 in the past congress has subjected funding for shchuchye to number of certifications for example it stated that the president must certify that russia is committed to providing at least 25 million per year to help construct and operate the facility that russia was committed to destroying all its remaining nerve agent that other nations were committed to contributing to the construction of this facility and that russia is forthcoming with data about its chemical weapons stockpile the president requested that congress allow him to waive the certification requirement so that construction could continue even if russia has not met all the conditions congress provided the president with waiver authority but only for one year in the fy2003 defense authorization bill pl 10724854 it extended this waiver authority by one more year in the fy2004 defense authorization bill hr 1588 the administration submitted this waiver in early december 200355 for fy2005 the senate approved unlimited waiver authority for the president but the house again limited this authority to one year the house prevailed in conference with an adjustment to allowing the waiver authority through the end of the calendar year rather than the fiscal year see pl 108375 congress extended this waiver authority through 2011 between fy1992 and fy2007 dod allocated nearly 950 million for

employ biological weapons scientists during the late 1990s even though russia has not provided complete inventory of the sites or people involved in biological weapons work57 the ctr program supports four separate bwtr programs working at 49 sites that include many weapons facilities through the biological weapons infrastructure elimination program the united states is helping russia eliminate the infrastructure and equipment at those biological research and production centers brpcs that have the capability to produce biological weapons through the biosecurity and biosafety program the united states is helping to enhance safety and security at these centers to ensure the safe and secure storage and handling of biological pathogens this program has been combined with the bw threat agent detection and response program which seeks to develop modern surveillance warning and response networks and to help secure russias central storage facilities for bw pathogens finally through cooperative biodefense research the united states and russia are using cooperative research projects to increase transparency and discourage the leakage of russian biological weapons knowledge to other nations each of these programs is implemented through the international science and technology centers because dod has been unable to conclude implementing agreements with the relevant ministries in russia58 in addition ctr funding helped destroy the huge biological weapons production facility in stepnogorsk kazakhstan the potential proliferation of biological weapons poses one of the key challenges for us nonproliferation assistance to russia59 according to the general accounting office progress in gaining russias cooperation and implementing these projects has been very slow the united states has found it particularly difficult to gain access to four key military facilities the problem is further aggravated by the fact that russia is reducing the size of its complex

fy2004 defense authorization bill hr 1588 the house had sought to prohibit funding cooperative research at any site in the soviet union until the secretary of defense could certify that the site did not house any prohibited biological weapons research until the facility had conducted an assessment of its vulnerability to the loss or theft of pathogens and until it had begun to implement measures to reduce its vulnerability to the loss or theft of biological agents the conference committee modified this measure stating that ctr could not fund cooperative research at facility until the secretary of defense determines that prohibited research occurs at the facility and until the facility plans to implement appropriate security measures it also permitted the use of up to 25 of the funds authorized for the project to be expended on making these determinations the bush administration requested and congress authorized similar amount 55 million for biological weapons proliferation prevention in fy2005 however within this total the administration shifted funding away from cooperative biodefense research projects reducing this area from 366 million in fy2004 to 131 million in fy2005 towards biosecurity and biosafety efforts this shift reflected in part the congressional concerns with possible us support for ongoing russian biological weapons programs it also derived from

additional 608 million for bw proliferation prevention in fy2006 it requested an additional 684 million for fy2007 and the 109th congress approved this request in the fy2007 defense authorization bill

effort to eliminate libyas wmd infrastructure and to help redirect weapons scientists in libya and iraq the state department spent total of around 385 million from this fund between fy1996 and fy2002

department also manages and funds the international science and technology center istc in moscow and its companion science and technology center stcu in kiev ukraine in the fy2005 budget request it combined these centers and the biological weapons redirect program into new category called nonproliferation of wmd expertise the state department also manages the export control and related border security assistance exbs program the following discussion provides more detail about these two program areas68 nonproliferation of wmd expertise science and technology centers after the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 many experts feared that scientists from russias nuclear weapons complex might sell their knowledge to other nations seeking nuclear weapons many of these scientists had worked in the soviet unions closed nuclear cities where they had enjoyed relatively high salaries and prestige but their jobs evaporated during russias economic and political crises in the early 1990s even those scientists who retained their jobs saw their incomes decline sharply as russia was unable to pay their salaries for months at time in late 1992 the united states japan the european union and russia established the international science and technology center istc in moscow several other former soviet states joined the center during the 1990s and other nations including norway and south korea added their financial support in late 1993 the united states canada sweden and ukraine established the science and technology center in ukraine stcu several former soviet states have also joined this center and japan has joined to provide financial support in its review of us threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance the bush administration cited these centers for their achievements and indicated that it planned to expand them the state department has stated that between 1994 and late 2002 about 50000 scientists and engineers participated in research funded by these centers the moscow center funded nearly 1700 projects that engaged about 41000 scientists in 2001 the istc in moscow supported more than 22000 scientists with more than 29 million in direct grants69 in fy2005 the istc received new project funding of 513 million with 215 million provided by istc partners organizations or corporations outside government that help fund istc programs the istc made grants of 439 million to nearly 25000 scientists the centers fund scientists who have worked on nuclear chemical and biological weapons but they have historically focused on nuclear scientists with many projects going to those who work at institutes in the closed nuclear cities the state department estimates that about half of the participants are senior scientists which means the programs may have reached significant portion of the estimated 68 for more details see controlling nuclear warheads and materials report card and action plan by matthew bunn et project on managing the atom march 2003 69 ibid crs27 30000 to 70000 senior scientists and engineers in the soviet nuclear complex however most of these scientists spend fewer than 50 days per year on projects funded by the science centers in the remainder of the time most continue to work at their primary jobs in addition some of the grants go to research institutes in russia rather than directly to scientists and some of these funds may be used for administrative or management purposes nevertheless the income earned from even shortterm research projects may undermine incentives these individuals might otherwise encounter to sell their knowledge to potential proliferant nations the science centers also sponsor partners program through which private industry universities and other government agencies can provide funding for and establish contacts with former soviet scientists the program started small with about 30 partners and 5 million in projects in 1997 it had grown to 166 partners supporting over 100 projects worth 31 million in 2002 this represented one quarter of the grant funding provided by the science centers in 200270 in fy2005 the partner program supported provided 215 million as of early november 2002 the istc in moscow had received 481 million from its participating nations with the united states providing about 171 million of this total the stcu in kiev had received about 605 million with the united states providing about 45 million of this total the united states has also provided around 70 million to the istc since fy1998 to support the biological weapons redirection program71 this program provides research grants to russian biotechnology institutes to redirect scientists to commercial agricultural and public health projects the state department collaborates with several other us agencies in this program72 in recent years it has begun to shift grant funding away from russias nuclear scientists to biological and chemical weapons scientists thus re naming the program the biochem redirection program and to scientists from other former soviet states further it expects this decline in funding to force the istc to focus more on graduating scientists from us assistance to projects with more commercial viability73 the state department operates third program within this category known as the bio industry initiative bii this initiative which began in 2002 seeks to help russia reconfigure its largescale former bwrelated facilities so that they can perform peaceful research issues such as infectious diseases for fy2004 the bush administration requested 59 million for the science centers and bw redirection programs and received about 502 million it did not identify the precise funding for either of the two in its fy2005 budget it requested 505 million with about 305 million going to the science centers 17 million 70 ibid 71 ibid 72 for more details see crs report rl31368 preventing proliferation of biological weapons us assistance to the former soviet states by

the bii74 congress approved the bush administrations budget request for this program area in fy2006 appropriating 526 million however declining proportion of the budget is likely to be spent on programs in the former soviet union as this program is expanding to help redirect scientists in libya and iraq the bush administration requested 227 million for the science centers in its fy2007 budget it also requested 17 million for the biochem redirect program and 13 million for the bioindustry initiative this total of 527 million will be spent primarily in the former soviet states the administration has requested 25 million for the scientist redirection program in iraq and 1 million for the program in libya75 it requested an total of 535 million for these two program areas in fy2008 and 64 million in fy2009 analysts have raised numerous questions about the science center programs one of the first critiques came from the general accounting office in study published in 1995 gao found that some scientists who received grants from the istc may also continue to be employed by institutes engaged in weapons work76 gao interpreted this finding to mean that the centers had not succeeded in redirecting weapons scientists to peaceful endeavors other critics of the ctr program claimed that gaos findings indicated that by supporting russian weapons scientists us funds were supporting russian weapons programs the state department disputed both of these conclusions noting that the grants from the istc were intended to supplement not replace the scientists income from work in other institutes and in the years since this report the state department has enhanced its auditing procedures to ensure that istc grants support the assigned projects and do not support work on russian weapons analysts have also noted that the istc and stcu do not have enough money to support full pay for significant number of scientists consequently some have questioned whether the centers achieve their objective of keeping these scientists away from nations or groups seeking weapons of mass destruction others however note that even if the financial support is less than complete the cooperation with russian institutes and the promise of fairly steady stream of funding helps build relationships and draw these institutes into the western orbit77 to address this problem some have suggested that instead of providing shortterm grants the centers should focus on projects that will lead to the longterm redirection of scientists out of weapons work the state department seems to agree with this 74 us department of state fy2006 congressional budget justification for foreign operations p 135 75 us department of state us department of state fy2005 congressional budget

for smuggling or illegal exports of materials and technology from the former soviet union as key proliferation concern the collapse of political control along the soviet borders along with incentives created by the weakness in the economies of the newly independent states contributes to this growing concern the state departments export control and related border security assistance exbs program helps the former soviet states and other nations improve their ability to interdict nuclear smuggling and stop the illicit trafficking of all materials for weapons of mass destruction along with dual use goods and technologies the exbs program currently has projects underway in more than 30 nations and is expanding its reach around the globe78 when designing nationspecific plan for border control assistance the united states seeks to address four key areas first if needed it helps the recipient nation establish the legal and regulatory basis for effective export controls it then helps the nation develop appropriate export licensing procedures and practices third the united states helps the recipient establish and enhance effective enforcement capabilities when needed it provides the recipient with detection and interdiction equipment and training finally the united states helps establish procedures that promote effective interaction between government and industry so that business entities in the recipient nation will abide by the laws and regulations of the new export control regime the state department also provides support to border control efforts in dods ctr program and the does nonproliferation program it seeks to coordinate these and other us efforts to identify and stop the smuggling of nuclear chemical and biological weapons or materials analysts inside and outside the government have questioned however whether the coordination has been effective consequently the national security council is leading an effort to develop governmentwide strategic plan for interdiction assistance which includes but is not limited to export assistance that might help stop the smuggling of weapons of mass destruction between fy1998 and fy2002 the state department allocated 146 million to the exbs program for nations in and around the former soviet union approximately 100 million of this amount was allocated to georgia for its border security program funding for border security in the rest of the former soviet states was around 57 million per year until the state department added 247 million from the fy2002 supplemental appropriations in fy2003 the state department requested around 17 million for the exbs program with an additional 15 million allocated to the georgia border security program funding declined in fy2004 the bush administration

secretary of state for nonproliferation march 19 2003 crs30 administration requested total of 38 million for exbs although only around 19 million was allocated to projects in nations in and around the former soviet union an additional 115 million was allocated to global efforts with the remaining 7 million allocated to projects in other nations around the world this trend continued in fy2006 and fy2007 the budget request for the exbs program equals 444 million congress approved 434 million however only around 85 million of this amount will go to projects in nations around the former soviet union far greater amount around 19 million is allocated to nations in other regions such as south asia and the near east the remainder is allocated to global programs such as the provision of advisors and equipment and the development of global regional export controls for fy2007 the bush administration requested 45050 million for the exbs program less than 6 million would go to states that were once part of the soviet union for fy2008 the total request is 413 million but only around 45 million will go to states of the former soviet union for fy2009 the request is for 421 million with less than 4 million going to states of the former soviet union department of energy the department of energy has contributed to us threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance to the former soviet states from the start when ctr included small amount of funding for materials control and protection officials from doe participated along with their counterparts at dod in early efforts to outline projects and reach agreement with russian officials on assistance to secure nuclear materials but these governmenttogovernment negotiations proceeded slowly in part because russias nuclear energy ministry known as minatom at the time was less open to cooperation than the ministry of defense consequently projects at facilities that housed nuclear materials did not begin until 1994 in parallel effort that sought to reduce these delays experts from the us nuclear laboratories which are part of doe also began less formal contacts with their counterparts in russia to identify and solve safety and security problems at russian facilities together these governmenttogovernment and labtolab projects evolved into an effort to apply material protection control and accounting mpca techniques to russian facilities the mpca program began with less than 3 million in fy1993 this amount grew to 73 million in fy1995 in fy1996 doe assumed budgetary and management responsibility for the program doe also initiated second program the initiatives for proliferation prevention which sought to provide employment opportunities for scientists and engineers from russias nuclear weapons complex in the latter half of the 1990s doe expanded these efforts and added several other programs to its nonproliferation assistance these programs are now managed by does national nuclear security administration nnsa the discussion below summarizes the objectives and achievements of many of these efforts79 79 as was the case with the summaries of dod and state department programs these descriptions do not cover all doe programs complete description of the programs funded under does defense nuclear nonproliferation budget can be found in does continued crs31 international nuclear materials protection and cooperation the international nuclear materials protection and cooperation program seeks to secure nuclear weapons and weaponsusable nuclear materials by upgrading security at nuclear sites by consolidating these materials to sites where installation of enhanced security systems have already been completed and by improving nuclear smuggling detection capabilities at international borders80 the mpca program81 addresses the first of these objectives the materials consolidation and conversion program addresses the second and the second line of defense sld and megaports programs address the third each of these is discussed below mpca funding the budget for mpca grew rapidly during the 1990s reaching 169 million in fy2001 the last year of the clinton administration the bush administration in its budget request for fy2002 reduced funding for the mpca program to 1388 million in part because it believed that the program had enough unexpended funds from prior years to carry on with less funding its first budget also shifted money from defense nuclear nonproliferation programs to us nuclear weapons programs congress objected to this reduction and both the senate and house appropriations committees in the energy and water appropriations bills for fy2002 restored funding to the fy2001 level furthermore congress added 150 million in supplemental appropriations bill passed at the end of 2001 after the september 11 attacks had raised new concerns about the potential threat that terrorists might seek to acquire nuclear materials from insecure facilities in russia the bush administration allocated much of this new funding to the second line of defense and radiological dispersion devices but the bush administration did increase its budget request for mpca in fy2003 to 223 million so that it could accelerate the installation of comprehensive upgrades and material consolidation and conversion efforts82 the bush administration requested 227 million for these efforts for fy2004 congress approved 260 million adding 5 million for high priority activities and 28 million for an initiative under the second line of defense program described below the bush administration requested 238 million for mpca in fy2005 the reduction from fy2004 to fy2005 reflected in part the completion of physical 79 continued budget documents see us department of energy fy2006 congressional

fy2005 defense authorization bill hrept 108767 pl 108375 congress authorized the full amount requested by the president the house had reduced that amount by around 10 million citing delays in the program caused by russias refusal to allow the united states access to some facilities but the senate prevailed in conference the appropriations committee added 84 million to the mpca program for total of 322 million the conference report accompanying the consolidated appropriations act 2005 hrept 108792 pl 108447 notes that this added funding should be used to accelerate efforts to secure nuclear weapons sites and nuclear materials production sites in russia84 the bush administration requested 3434 million for these programs in fy2006 nearly 100 million of this total was allocated to the second line of defense and megaports initiative leaving approximately 245 million to secure nuclear materials in russia in the fy2006 defense authorization act pl109163 hrept 109360 congress added approximately 20 million to this total in part to accelerate warhead security work at the strategic rocket force facilities the energy and water appropriations committee added 836 million to this portion of the doe budget so that doe could pursue new opportunities in warhead security work with russia in the fy2007 budget the bush administration requested 4132 million for mpca although this exceeds the administrations request for fy2006 it falls below the appropriated amount of 4227 million in addition it includes 124 million for second line of defense and megaports leaving 2987 million to secure nuclear materials in russia within this total as is noted below the administration shifted money among the different project areas as some ongoing projects accelerate and others move towards their conclusion specifically the budget indicated that work at the rosatom complex which houses most of russias nuclear weapons materials would be reduced while sustainment activities would increase congress did not accept some of these changes appropriating total of 4727 million for this program area and shifting money among the budget areas as is noted in more detail below the fy2008 budget request sought total of 3717 million for the mpca program areas with 1193 million going to the second line of defense and megaports initiatives this leaves 2518 million for the efforts to secure nuclear warheads and materials in russia the doe budget request also reflects continuing declines in the mpca budget in the outyears as many of the mpca upgrades to storage facilities are completed and the program switches to sustainment activities doe also noted that russia has added some rosatom sites to its list of sites in need of upgrades if these are approved they would also be added to

november 19 2004 h10558 crs33 congress increased in some cases significantly funding for the mpca programs in the fy2008 defense authorization act hrept 110477 and the fy2008 omnibus appropriations bill hr 2764 for example the house version of the fy2008 defense authorization bill hr 1585 included 401 million for mpca which essentially incorporates 30 million from the fy2008 supplemental request into the authorization bill the senate for its part added only 10 million authorizing 3818 million the conference committee added 30 million with most of this going to the second line of defense program on the other hand the house energy and water development subcommittee of the house appropriations committee more than doubled the request for funding for mpca providing 8318 million hrept 110185 the committee noted that this program is on the front line in the global war on terror because it seeks to protect the united states against terrorist using nuclear device on us soil as is noted below the committee added funding in several areas to accelerate work at russias nuclear materials facilities and warhead storage facilities and to expand the second line of defense and megaports programs the senate energy and water appropriations bill in contrast added only 20 million to this program area srept 110127 the omnibus appropriations bill for fy2008 includes 624 million mpca with 136 million going to second line of defense and 1308 million for megaports these are described in more detail below the presidents budget for fy2009 requests 429 million for mpca programs as discussed in more detail below the budget request for most of the project areas falls sharply below the amount appropriated in fy2008 these declines in most cases reflect the fact that with the added funding appropriated in fy2008 many of the ongoing projects are nearing completion between fy1993 and fy2008 congress appropriated more 3 billion for the mpca program with the exception of approximately 380 for the second line of defense and megaports program all of these funds were allocated to efforts to improve security at nuclear warhead and nuclear material storage facilities in russia nnsa has identified 105 nuclear sites with 243 buildings that may need assistance in improving their security systems according to nnsa these sites contain approximately 600 metric tons of nuclear materials enough for around 41000 nuclear warheads within this total 63 sites belong to the ministry of defense 52 warhead storage site and 11 navy fuel storage sites 11 are part of the minatom now known as rosatom85 weapons complex and 31 are civilian sites more than 80 of these materials are located at the rosatomminatom sites86 mpca projects doe provides mpca assistance at russian

access to the storage facilities these may include the installation of hardened doors and windows locks and keys to control access perimeter fences and moveable barriers at entry points the second phase provides comprehensive upgrades that are tailored to meet the security needs at each individual facility these may include monitoring and detection systems the relocation of guard forces the consolidation of materials central alarm systems and electronic access control systems doe has helped improve security at sites that house considerably more than half of the former soviet unions 600 metric tons of weaponsusable nuclear materials87 in 2006 doe altered the way in which it measures progress in these programs focusing on the percentage of facilities that had received upgrades rather than the percentage of materials that were captured by the upgrades by the end of 2006 doe had completed rapid upgrades at about 81 of the 215 facilities housing this material and comprehensive upgrades at about 63 of these facilities88 doe reported that by september of 2007 it had completed upgrades at nearly 90 or 193 of the buildings when the upgrades are complete doe plans to continue sustainability efforts to ensure that the upgrades remain effective in the long term this program titled national programs and sustainability seeks to create regulations reporting requirements training and maintenance facilities and other infrastructure components to ensure that russia can continue to operate its new security systems89 in the fy2005 budget request doe reduced funding for this initiative from 41 million appropriated in fy2005 to 30 million continuing trend of preceding years doe noted in 2004 that funding in this area had declined because doe altered it priorities to support increased funding for mpca activities in countries outside the former soviet union90 the administration requested 481 million for this project area in fy2007 but congress appropriated only 297 million the administration requested 456 million in fy2008 and congress appropriated nearly 70 million the administration has requested 593 million for fy2009 navy complex doe has provided assistance to russias navy by improving security at 39 naval nuclear warhead storage sites and 11 nuclear fuel storage sites these sites house approximately 60 metric tons of weaponsuseable nuclear materials and

was completed in late october 2007 nearly two years ahead of schedule91 it is also upgrading security at nine sites under the command of the 12 main directorate the branch of russias ministry of defense responsible for warhead security and maintenance it plans to complete the work on upgrades at these sites in fy2009 doe requested 475 million to continue these activities in fy2006 the defense authorization bill pl 109163 increased this total by 10 million and the energy and water appropriations bill increased it by 86 million consequently the fy2006 appropriation for this project area was 1202 million the bush administration requested and congress approved 1293 million for this project area in fy2007 the fy2008 budget request included 915 million for this project area the decline in the request reflected the fact that the accelerated pace of the last few years had brought some of the sites close to completion congress however appropriated 1219 million for this project area the fy2009 budget requests only 536 million with the decline again reflecting the completion of most of the work on upgrades doe has stated that the fy2009 budget will support sustainment activities at all these sites rosatom weapons complex work at russias nuclear weapons complex managed by the newly organized rosatom consists of seven sites and four enterprises of the nuclear weapons complex in russias nine closed nuclear cities the buildings in this complex house around 500 metric tons of highly attractive weaponsuseable materials92 doe has completed rapid upgrades on buildings that house about 60 of these materials and comprehensive upgrades on buildings that house another 25 of these materials by the end of 2006 doe had completed work on 92 buildings in the rosatom complex the pace of work at these facilities has accelerated with increased funding and increased cooperation from russia during the past few years doe hopes to install security upgrades at all these facilities by

increase from the 187 million appropriated in fy2004 and slight reduction from the 88 million appropriated in fy2005 congress approved this request the fy2007 budget requested only 565 million for this program area doe noted that the reduction reflected the completion of many of the projects that were accelerated over the past few years the house and senate armed services committees both approved this request the house energy and water development appropriations committee however increased this request by 65 million for total of 1215 million for fy2007 the final appropriation was 85 million the fy2008 budget requested 601 million for this project area congress again increased the funding appropriating 791 million the fy2009 budget request shows steep decline with the administration requesting only 323 million this reduction again reflects the completion of many projects that were accelerated over the last few years doe has indicated that in fy2009 the majority of the continuing work will occur at the sites at mayak arzamas16 and chelyabinsk70 civilian nuclear sites doe has assisted with the installation of security upgrades at 31 civilian nuclear sites throughout the former soviet union these are mainly research facilities that operate nuclear reactors according to doe these sites contain around 40 metric tons of weaponsuseable materials doe has already completed rapid and comprehensive upgrades at most of these facilities it had planned to complete the comprehensive upgrades at facilities housing the final 5 of nuclear materials during fy2006 but this schedule slipped and they are now due to be completed in fy2008 it also plans to expand its efforts to secure weapons useable nuclear materials at civilian facilities outside the former soviet union doe has requested and congress approved 47 million for this effort in fy2006 substantial increase over the 146 million appropriated in fy2005 the bush administration requested only 212 million for this program area in fy2007 doe noted that the decrease reflects the completion of initial upgrades at facility outside the former soviet union congress however appropriated 527 million for this program area the bush administration has requested 222 million for this effort in fy2008 but congress again increased the funding appropriating 542 million the administration has requested 345 million for fy2009 doe indicates that this funding will help foster site capabilities to operate and maintain the equipment and will provide sustainability support at the 19 sites with

this program area in fy2007 doe reports that the decrease is due to slowdown in the availability of highly enriched uranium which is blended down to low enriched uranium with funds in this area the senate armed services committee approved this request but the house increased it to 218 million the final amount approved for fy2007 was 277 million reflecting increases in the appropriations process

11 attacks many analysts have expressed growing concerns about the possibility that terrorists might acquire nuclear materials that could be used in dirty bomb although such device would not explode with nuclear yield it could nonetheless spread radiological debris across wide area many nations around the world have nuclear materials at research facilities hospitals or power plants that could be used in dirty bomb but most analysts agree that the states of the former soviet union pose greater threat in this regard particularly since the soviet union left devices with radioactive materials scattered across its territory according to spencer abraham the secretary of energy more attention is being paid to the risks associated with the misuse of radiological materials because they are much more abundant and much less secure than weaponsgrade materials95 consequently doe developed program to identify these sites set priorities and begin security upgrades this program received its initial funding in fy2002 with 20 million allocated from the 150 million congress added to the mpca program in the supplemental appropriations pl 107206 passed after the september 11 attacks 95 remarks by spencer abraham secretary of energy carnegie endowment for international peace international nonproliferation conference november 14 2002 crs38 doe identified 35 nuclear waste sites in russia and the other former soviet states that posed threat for the theft or sale of nuclear materials these states also have radiological sources at agricultural research institutes research reactors medical facilities intelligence sites and defense facilities96 doe is also working with the international atomic energy agency iaea to identify and secure facilities that may house these materials in other nations in fy2005 doe received around 248 million for this effort in the fy2006 budget doe moved this program to the global threat reduction initiative portion of its program and requested an additional 24 million it requested 183 million for international radiological threat reduction in fy2007 and 6 million in fy2008 this program longer focuses exclusively on sites in the former soviet union second line of defense through its second line of defense program doe contributes to us efforts to help the former soviet states detect and intercept attempts to smuggle nuclear materials out of the country doe has begun to install radiation detection equipment systems at strategic transit and border sites by the end of fy2006 the program had installed equipment at more than 150 sites and planned to add 51 more sites in fy2007 according to doe it plans to add 49 sites in fy2009 however growing number of these sites are outside the former soviet union doe also plans to provide training and communications equipment to border control agents to help them implement the plan this program began in fy1998 and received less than 3 million per year for several years however the budget increased to 46 million and the effort expanded significantly with funding provided under the fy2002 supplemental appropriations pl 107206 doe requested and congress approved 24 million for the core program of second line of defense in fy2006 congress also added 28 million in fy2004 for project known as the megaports initiative this project is developing and deploying radiation detectors for use at the largest foreign seaports that handle about 70 of the container traffic headed for the united states97 megaports is designed to detect the trafficking of nuclear or radioactive materials in the worlds busiest seaports according to former secretary of energy abraham doe hopes to install detection equipment at seaports around the globe the administration requested 15 million for this program in fy2005 and 739 million for this program in fy2006 this funding is included in international nuclear materials and protection portion of the budget even though it is not intended for use in the former soviet union as result it is not included in this reports doe totals for nonproliferation projects in the former soviet union it is worth noting however that the increase in megaports for fy2006 exceeded the increase in the entire international nuclear materials and protection portion of the budget signalling shift in funding out of the former soviet union and into projects in other nations 96 us department of energy fy2004 congressional budget request detailed budget justifications february 2003 p 649 97 hoehn william update on legislation affecting usformer soviet union nonproliferation and threat reduction ransac november 17 2003 crs39 the bush administration requested total of 124 million for second line of defense and megaports in fy2007 this was an increase of 27 million over the combined budget for the two programs in fy2006 but it also contained significant shift with 84 million allocated to second line of defense and only 40 million allocated to megaports the increase in sld reflects the acceleration of efforts to install radiation detection equipment at sites in the caucuses region while the decrease in megaports is attributed to the completion of the installation of radiation detection equipment at five ports in 2006 the house and senate armed services committee approved the authorization request for sld the house energy and water appropriations committee added 40 million for total of 1239 million for megaports the senate armed services approved the administrations request the house added 15 million to the authorization request and the energy and water appropriations committee added 60 million for total of 1051 million the appropriators noted that this added funding should be used to expand work at high risk foreign ports it reflects growing concern in congress with port security issues the fy2007 budget requested 1193 million for the second line of defense program with 725 million allocated to the core program and 468 million allocated to megaports however congress appropriated 1919 million in fy2007 with 1161 million going to megaports in fy2008 congress appropriated 2669 million with 136 million going to the core program and 1308 million going to megaports these increases indicated that congress has placed high priority on detecting possible efforts to smuggle nuclear materials in its request for fy2009 the

fy2006 doe renamed the russian transition initiative referring to it as the global initiatives for proliferation prevention the program also moved to the nonproliferation and international security portion of the doe nonproliferation budget these changes reflect the fact that doe can now spend funds from this program in nations outside the former soviet union such as in libya and iraq the russian transition initiative had combined two previous doe programs the initiatives for proliferation prevention and the nuclear cities initiative that sought to stop the leakage of knowledge out of russias nuclear weapons complex to states or groups seeking their own nuclear weapons according to doe these programs were designed to help russia reduce the size of its nuclear weapons complex by removing functions and equipment and to create sustainable non weaponsrelated work for scientists through technology projects that have crs41 commerciallyviable market opportunities98 the bush administration has stated that it hopes to expand the program from engaging only nuclear scientists to also engaging biological and chemical weapons scientists it requested funding to expand the program to two chemical weapons institutes in fy2004 initiatives for proliferation prevention the initiatives for proliferation prevention ipp program began in 1994 ipp has matched us weapons labs and us industry with russian scientists and engineers in cooperative research projects with high commercial potential doe claims that this focus on commercialization will help make the projects selfsustaining in the long term the ipp program received 35 million in the fy1994 foreign operations appropriations act before its funding moved to the department of energy this initial funding helped establish nearly 200 research projects by 1995 between fy1996 and fy2003 iap received an additional 194 million in fy2004 the bush administration requested around 23 million for projects funded through ipp as part of the overall request of 393 million for the russian transition initiative congress approved this request the ipp program was the subject of review and criticism in gao study released in february 1999 the report noted that nearly half of the funds appropriated for the iap program had been spent at the us nuclear weapons labs and that after subtracting the taxes fees and other charges removed by russian officials the russian institutes had received only around onethird of the funds the report also questioned does oversight of the programs noting that program officials did not always know how many scientists were receiving iap funding the report noted that the projects had not yet produced any commercial successes doe responded by stating that iap had temporarily employed thousands of scientists in around 170 institutes doe also stated that the program did not subsidize scientists who were performing weaponsrelated work nevertheless in fy2000 congress reduced the clinton administrations request for funding for the iap program from 30 million to 25 million and specified that more than 35 of the funds be spent at the us labs it also mandated that the united states negotiate agreements with russia to ensure that funds provided under this program are not subject to taxes in russia furthermore it requested that the secretary of energy review iap programs for their commercialization potential the ipp program was once again the subject of critical gao report in late 200799 this report noted that doe had overstated the number of scientists receiving support from this program by counting both weapons and nonweapons scientists in its totals it also argues that doe has overstated the number of longterm private sector jobs created as result of this program mostly because it does not have an independent way to confirm the reported number further doe does not have an exist strategy for the program or way to graduate institutes once they are self sustaining or longer pose proliferation threat this report has raised anew questions about the current value and future worthiness of the program 98 us department of energy fy2004 congressional budget

2002 ipp had 176 projects ongoing at 56 institutes in russia with 64 of these projects at facilities in the closed nuclear cities ipp also had 14 projects at six institutes in kazakhstan and 13 projects at nine institutes in ukraine it has also been reported that 13 projects have become commercial ventures and that the program has created 850 high tech jobs in russia furthermore the ipp program has received around 125 million in private sector matching funds100 nuclear cities initiative nci in august 1998 vice president gore and thenprime minister carancha signed an agreement establishing the nuclear cities initiative this program is designed to bring commercial enterprises to russias closed nuclear cities so that russia can reduce the size of its weapons complex and so that the scientists and engineers will not be tempted to sell their knowledge to nations seeking nuclear weapons the united states and russia signed an implementing agreement in september 1998 and the program received its first funding of 15 million in fy1999 the nci program received total of nearly 87 million between fy1999 and fy2003 the bush administration has requested and received an additional 17 million for it within the funding for the russian transition initiative some members of congress and others including gao also raised questions about the value and effectiveness of the nci program in its first budget for fy2002 the bush administration sought to reduce funding from 26 million in fy2001 to 66 million limiting the program to 3 of russias 10 closed nuclear cities it also indicated that it might seek to eliminate the program merging its functions with the iap program congress accepted this latter proposal creating the russian transition initiative and it initially accepted the reduction in funding for the program however in the supplemental appropriations bill passed after the september 11 attacks congress added 15 million to the nci program nevertheless with limited funding and uncertain political support the nci program reportedly made limited progress in addressing the employment problems at russias closed nuclear cities some say that the merger with the iap will bring stability and progress to the programs efforts in late july 2003 the bush administration announced that the nci program would cease to operate by the end of 2003 the united states and russia were unable to agree on the liability provisions in an implementing agreement for the program ongoing projects continued through the end of 2003 but the program did not receive new funding or begin new projects in its fy2005 budget request the administration allocated 41 million to the russian transition initiative some of this funding supported ongoing nci projects in russias closed nuclear cities the administration requested 379 million for its new global initiatives for proliferation prevention program in fy2006 congress authorized this amount in the fy2006 defense authorization act and appropriated around 40 million in the energy and water appropriations act within this budget the administration planned to phase out the last of the nci programs in russias 100 controlling nuclear warheads and materials report card and action plan by matthew bunn et project on managing the atom march 2003 crs43 closed city of snezhinsk and to reduce its efforts in the closed city of sarov it would then focus funding on helping to redirect engineers and technicians associated with the shutdown of russias plutonium production reactors in seversk and zheleznogorsk this program is described below hence the budget reduction when combined with the shifting of funds to nations outside the former soviet union resulted in contraction of efforts to redirect russias nuclear scientists and to reduce the size of russias nuclear weapons complex in the fy2007 budget request these two programs moved again to does nonproliferation and international security account the total request for both parts of the program equaled 281 million doe reported that the decline was due to reduced activity at two sites that were part of nci and to the deferral of work at two commercial sites the house and senate armed services committees both approved the authorization request for these programs but the appropriations committees increased the funding to 396 million the fy2008 budget request sought 202 million for these programs doe has again indicated that the decline in funding reflects the termination of the nci portion of the program congress appropriated 301 million the fy2009 budget request includes 238 million for these programs elimination of weaponsgrade plutonium production in the early 1990s the united states and russia both pledged to end the production of plutonium for nuclear weapons russia however balked at suggestions that it shut its three remaining plutonium production reactors because it used the same reactors to produce light and heat in the cities of tomsk and krasnoyarsk in an agreement signed in 1994 under the auspices of the highlevel commission chaired by vice president gore and russias prime minister chernomyrdin the two sides agreed that they would work together to provide alternative energy sources for these russian cities this program began as part of the dod ctr program and moved to doe in fy2002 in the original 1994 agreement russia stated that it would shut the reactors by 2000 if the alternative energy facilities were developed in the same time frame initially the two nations planned to replace the reactors with fossilfueled power plants but early studies concluded that the construction of these plants could cost up to 1 billion consequently the two sides began to explore the possibility of converting the plutonium production reactors to type whose spent fuel did not require reprocessing these new reactors would longer produce weaponsgrade plutonium each side planned to pay half of the expected 160 million for this conversion project however over the next few years the expected cost of the core conversion more than doubled after its financial crisis in 1998 russia concluded that it could not pay its half if the project had continued the united states might have had to pay more than 300 million at the same time questions about the reactors safety raised the possibility that they might need to be closed shortly after the core conversion was complete in late 1999 minatom proposed that the two sides again pursue the replacement of the nuclear reactors with fossil fuel plants after reducing the estimate for the necessary size of the plants it estimated that the new project would cost about the crs44 same as the core conversion project in late 2000 and early 2001 the two nations agreed to replace the reactors with fossil fuel plants however in fy2000 and fy2001 congress prohibited the expenditure of any ctr funds for the construction of fossil fuel plants when it completed its review of us nonproliferation and threat reduction assistance to russia the bush administration endorsed the reactor shut down program and transferred the effort from dod to doe dod doe and the state department have all contributed to this project the state department contributed nearly 45 million in fy1995 and fy1999 to feasibility studies dods budget included 10 million in fy1995 and 16 million in fy1996 it also included 32 million in fy2000 but these funds were rescinded after congress prohibited their expenditure on fossil fuel plants congress transferred 32 million in fy2001 funds and 56 million in fy2002 funds from dod to doe and appropriated 49 million in the doe budget for fy2003 the bush administration requested and received 50 million for this effort in fy2004101 it requested similar amount 501 million to continue this project in fy2005 the united states and russia concluded new agreement to implement the reactor shutdown program in early 2003 according to nnsa the new fossil fuel plants will be completed and the old nuclear reactors shut down in 2008 and 2011 assuming there are further delays in the implementation of the agreement the united states and russia are also implementing efforts to improve safety at the reactors in the interim102 at the seversk site the program is shutting down two nuclear reactors and refurbishing an old fossil fuel plant from the 1950s this project is slated to be completed by the end of december 2008 at zheleznogorsk the united states is not only helping russia shut down the nuclear plant but also helping it construct new fossil fuel plant according to doe this project is more than one third complete and should be done by 2011 doe requested 132 million for this program area in fy2006 this was substantial increase over the 44 million appropriated in fy2005 doe indicated that this request reflected its plans to expand significantly the construction activities associated with the fossil fuel plants at the seversk site in the fy2006 defense authorization act pl 109163 congress increased the funding for this project to over 200 million both the house and the senate noted that they wanted to ensure that the shutdown of the zheleznogorsk reactor remained on schedule the energy and water appropriations act also increased funding for this program but to only 1762 million the fy2007 budget requested 2066 million for this program the increase in funding is again directed at the zheleznogorsk reactor with the intent to complete the shutdown by 2010 instead of 2011 congress appropriated 1744 million the fy2008 budget request sought 1816 million for this project area within this request funding for the seversk site declined sharply from 847 million to 194 million as the project nears completion and funding

the house energy and water development appropriations committee added 10 million to this request to further accelerate work zheleznogorsk the senate appropriators on the other hand reduced the request providing only 1526 million in the final budget zheleznogorsk received 1591 million and the total project area 1799 million doe has requested 1413 million for fy2009 there is funding for seversk and zheleznogorsk would receive 1393 million the remaining 2 million is allocated to crosscutting and technical support activities fissile materials disposition in september 1998 the united states and russia agreed to convert surplus weaponsgrade plutonium to form that could not be returned to nuclear weapons in the plutonium management and disposition agreement signed in september 2000 each side agreed to dispose of 34 metric tons of weaponsgrade plutonium and to do so at roughly the same time this agreement was designed to ease concerns about the possible theft or diversion of weaponsgrade plutonium by nations or others seeking to develop their own nuclear weapons according to the agreement the parties could use two methods for disposing of the plutonium they could either convert it to mixed oxide fuel mox for nuclear power reactors or immobilize it and dispose of it in way that would preclude its use in nuclear weapons some analysts have criticized the mox option on the principle of opposing any use of plutonium in power generation from this point of view nations that do not possess nuclear weapons could use plutoniumbase power fuel cycle as cover for developing nuclear weapons if weapons states such as russia and the united states used plutonium for power generation according to this argument it would be more difficult to persuade nonweapons states not to do so however russia has expressed little interest in the permanent disposal of plutonium noting that the material could have great value for its civilian power program the united states initially intended to pursue both options however after reviewing us nonproliferation policies in 2001 the bush administration concluded that this approach would be too costly instead it outlined plan for the united states to convert almost all its surplus plutonium to mox fuel congress appropriated 152 million for fy2003 to begin construction of three facilities in savannah river sc to pursue the mox option and the fy2004 request included 416 million for construction and 194 million for operation and maintenance for the us surplus plutonium disposal program the fy2005 budget request reduced funding for the us program by about 50 million the united states and international community agreed to pay large portion of the cost for russias plutonium disposition program according to the state department us allies including great britain france and japan pledged to provide 700 million103 congress appropriated 200 million for this program for fy1999 but most of these funds have not been spent the bush administrations fy2004 budget justification requested 47 million for russian fissile materials 103 us department of state fiscal year 2002 performance and accountability report p 62 crs46 disposition operations and maintenance and prior balances totaling 151 million will be spent in the russian federation in accordance with new detailed program execution plan to be provided to congress104 however in late july 2003 the bush administration announced that the plutonium disposition program would not pursue additional contracts in 2004 because the united states and russia were unable to agree on the liability provisions for new implementing agreement for the program the two nations reportedly reached liability agreement in 2005 although it has not yet been signed by russias president putin the fy2005 budget included 64 million for us assistance to russia on plutonium disposition under the assumption that the nations would resolve their differences and the program would resume congress authorized and appropriated the requested amount for fy2005 but questioned the administrations ability to begin construction in may 2005 an event which eventually did not occur the administration requested an additional 64 million for this program in fy2006 but congress appropriated only 34 million again questioning the timing for the start of the project the administration requested 347 million for fy2007 for this project both the house and the senate armed services committees have expressed wideranging and deep concerns about this program in particular russia has indicated that it may not pursue the mox program to eliminate its plutonium opting instead for the construction of fast breeder reactors that could burn plutonium directly for energy production the united states might not fund this effort as many in the united states argue that breeder reactors which produce more plutonium than they consume would undermine nonproliferation objectives as result of these concerns the house armed services committee deleted all funding for this program in russia in the fy2007 defense authorization bill the senate armed services provided the funding but fenced it pending report from the secretary of energy the conference committee adopted this approach congress has also questioned the value of continuing with the us mox program and has reduced funding for this effort as well the bush administration did not request any additional funding for this program area in fy2008 in late november 2007 the united states and russia announced that they had reached agreement of how they would proceed with this program105 generally the united states has agreed that russia can burn some of the plutonium in breeder reactors but that the reactors will be modified so that they will not produce more plutonium than they burn at the same time the united states will continue to fund construction of the mox fuel plant and russia will convert some of its plutonium into this fuel the bush administration has hailed this agreement as providing way forward to dispose of plutonium critics have complained that the agreement will sharply slow the process of eliminating russias weaponsgrade plutonium this agreement came too late however to change the funding profile for 104 us department of energy fy2004 congressional budget request detailed budget justifications doeme0016 february 2003

funding for this program area the administration has indicated that funding from prior years remains available to support this program it has requested only 1 million for fy2009 to support technical oversight of the program by the us nuclear weapons laboratories issues for congress congress has addressed number of issues during the years since it passed the nunnlugar amendment and dod established the cooperative threat reduction program many of these are discussed in detail in crs report 971027f nunn lugar cooperative threat reduction programs issues for congress some of these issues have grown out of concerns with specific projects as has been the case with the dispute over the chemical weapons destruction facility at shchuchye others have derived from broader concerns about whether threat reduction assistance to russia and the other former soviet states serves broader us national security goals the question of whether us threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance represents defense by other means as former secretary of defense william perry used to argue or foreign aid as some in congress often assert continues to echo in debates about these programs some program critics and some members of congress also continue to question whether us assistance allows russia to divert its own resources to the development and production of new weapons that could threaten the united states secretary of defense rumsfeld raised this question during his nomination hearing in january 2001 on the other hand as us threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance to russia moves through its second decade many of the issues discussed during the debates over the programs reflect new concerns raised during assessments of how the programs performed in their first decade and how they might improve in the second many of these issues also reflect the growing focus of the programs on the potential link between weapons of mass destruction that might leak out of russia and terrorist organizations that might seek these weapons to attack the united states and its allies the discussion below reviews many of these issues describing concerns raised by those who support and those who criticize the programs the discussion draws heavily on the findings and proposals outlined by several recent reports on us threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance these provide more detailed description of the status of the programs and proposals for the future106 106 see for example reshaping usrussian threat reduction new approaches for the second decade carnegie

need to negotiate umbrella agreements with russia and to establish culture of cooperation was key reason for the early delays but some analysts also cite the need to coordinate project planning among several us government agencies as problem many analysts contend that coordination problems remain today even though each of the three key agencies dod doe and state funds and manages its own projects these agencies still need to coordinate their efforts to avoid duplication and in some cases to share resources and expertise in addition with the programs spread among three agencies one in the us government takes the lead in setting policies and priorities for us threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance or in serving as an advocate for these programs in interagency debates some members of congress and analysts outside government have proposed two specific solutions that they believe will improve implementation of us threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance the creation of strategic plan and the designation of an overall program coordinator strategic plan many analysts both inside and outside the us government believe that us threat reduction and nonproliferation programs would benefit from the development of governmentwide strategic plan some officials and analysts expected the bush administration to develop more comprehensive strategic plan for these programs during its review of us nonproliferation assistance to russia in 2001107 that review just identified those programs that would receive greater resources and expanded mandates but according to senator pete domenici these programs frequently are intertwined and interrelated in various complex and difficult ways108 according to one analyst who has participated in both dod and doe programs the growth in us programs has been by and large organic with each agency pursuing its own contacts and relationships in recipient countries assembling and justifying its own budget implementing programs based on its own culture and approaches and interacting with its own congressional oversight committees109 106 continued flournoy protecting against the spread of nuclear biological and chemical

coordination among programs more consistent method to set priorities and measure progress and coordinated way to determine when and how the united states had achieved its goals and could complete program program coordination many analysts have also called for the creation of highlevel program coordinator or highlevel interagency committee chaired by representative of the national security council this program coordinator would set consistent direction by setting priorities resolving competing demands for budgetary resources eliminating overlap and redundancy and coordinating implementation across agencies this individual would also raise the political profile of the programs bringing consistent political leadership that many analysts believe is lacking they argue that continued coordinated success for the programs requires active political engagement at the white house cabinet and subcabinet political appointee levels in the us government110 neither the clinton nor the bush administrations accepted proposals for single highlevel program coordinator arguing that interagency coordination already occurs according to an official from the bush administration us policy implementation and oversight of nonproliferation assistance to the states of the former soviet union is coordinated at senior levels by the proliferation strategy policy coordinating committee or pcc chaired by national security council senior director with assistant secretarylevel representatives from state defense energy and other concerned agencies111 others have argued that new interagency committee would complicate the existing interagency coordinating process112 the possible need for highlevel coordinator or czar remains on the congressional agenda in late 2006

deputy assistant secretary of defense for negotiations crs50 reflect the priority of the problem the first piece of legislation introduced in the 110th congress the implementing the 911 commission recommendations act of 2007 hr 1 s 4 took up the same theme it would establish an office of the united states coordinator for the prevention of weapons of mass destruction proliferation and terrorism within the executive office of the president this advisor would among other things lead interagency coordination of us efforts to implement its wmd nonproliferation strategy and would oversee the development of comprehensive and coordinated budget for programs and initiatives to prevent wmd proliferation and terrorism ensuring that such budget adequately reflects the priority of the challenges and is effectively executed and carrying out other appropriate budgetary authorities most analysts agree that the budget responsibility addressed in this legislation would be critical to the success of this new policy position white housebased nonproliferation czar may be able to communicate highlevel interest and political commitment to the programs however unless this individual could control the budgets of the programs involved to ensure that funding levels matched stated priorities and unless the individual could implement corrective actions to ensure that programs achieved their objectives it seems unlikely that he or she would be able to establish priorities and enforce them across government agencies highlevel committee might have greater success creating consensus about priorities because each agency would have representative at the table but it might still find it difficult to match funding levels to these priorities because each agencys budget would still reflect the overall priorities and missions of the agency access and transparency many analysts and government officials note that the primary barrier to successful implementation remains the need to gain access and transparency from officials in the recipient nations particularly russia as was noted above russia was slow to provide the united states with access to nuclear weapons storage areas which delayed the implementation of security improvements at these facilities it has not provided complete information about or access to facilities in its biological weapons complex and in spite of more than seven years of negotiations the united states and russia still have not completed transparency agreement for the facility in mayak that will store fissile materials removed from weapons furthermore russia has not provided the united states with access to many facilities in russias nuclear weapons complex leaving large holes in the us ability to improve security for the nuclear materials at those facilities although many analysts note that russias interest in protecting secret details about its nuclear weapons programs is understandable most also argue that this secrecy and the resulting delays in program implementation serve to undermine support in the united states for threat reduction and nonproliferation programs while most agree that russia must step forward to solve this problem113 they also 113 the bakercutler report notes that russian official point out that transparency and access matters are far from routine in russian bureaucracy russia does not have continued crs51 note that the united states does not have systematic approach to identifying and addressing these problems114 each agency has developed its own solutions for example in some cases doe has used photographs and diagrams instead of onsite visits to identify security weaknesses and design security improvements at nuclear complex sites analysts have identified this ad hoc process as one further incentive for better coordination among threat reduction programs single program coordinator could help agencies identify problems and share solutions in the fy2006 defense authorization act pl 109163 congress called on the administration to submit report on the impediments to successful implementation of these programs the report is to both identify these impediments and outline us plans to overcome them problems with access to russian facilities is one of the impediments cited in the reporting requirement liability protections and the umbrella agreement in 1992 the united states and russia signed an umbrella agreement that outlined the rights and responsibilities assumed by each of the parties when implementing programs funded by us threat reduction assistance this agreement provides the legal framework that allows for program implementation if it were to lapse the united states could not award any new contracts for projects funded by us assistance the original agreement was set to last for seven years the two parties agreed to extend it for another seven years in 1999 it was again set to expire in june 2006 at the time it was signed this agreement applied only to those programs funded by the department of defense but the department of energy has adopted similar agreements to cover many of its programs in the former soviet union the most contentious elements of the umbrella agreement are the provisions that cover liability for accidents or incidents that might occur during project implementation in the original agreement russia assumed all liability freeing us contractors from the threat of legal action or the possible need to pay fines and penalties if accidents were to occur however in recent years russia has objected to these blanket liability provisions arguing at minimum that us contractors should be held liable for accidents resulting from sabotage as was noted above this disagreement impeded the conclusion of new implementation agreement for does plutonium disposition program when resolving this dispute the united states was reluctant to ease its stand that us contractors receive blanket liability protection in 113 continued

russian american nuclear security advisory council november 2002 p 4 crs52 part because it was afraid that this would set an unacceptable precedent during negotiations on the broader umbrella agreement however by the middle of 2005 the united states and russia both recognized that failure to resolve the liability debate stalling the plutonium disposition program could eventually lead to failure to resolve the dispute in negotiations over the umbrella agreement this in turn could stall or stop nonproliferation program that most experts agreed had made great strides to secure weapons and materials in russia conversely if the two states could find an acceptable solution for the doe programs agreement it might ease efforts to conclude new umbrella agreement during this process contractors participating in the doe program reportedly noted that they would not object to provision that placed liability for accidents resulting from sabotage onto the us companies they noted that this could expose them to russias legal system but they also noted that the united states might address this through separate international treaty or by focusing on russian liability law rather than by pressing for blanket liability protection115 the two sides reached agreement on the liability provisions for the doe programs during the g8 summit at gleneagles scotland in july 2005 reports indicate that in exchange for the us giving up its insistence on blanket liability protection in future contracts the two countries would set up separate process for addressing any situations that might arise as result of sabotage116 in midjune 2006 the united states and russia reached agreement on liability protections and extended the umbrella agreement for another seven years117 this concluded the agreement just days before the existing agreement was due to expire reports indicate that the new agreement retains the original agreements blanket liability protections for existing projects but will address russias concerns when implementing future projects hence us contractors could be liable for damages caused by sabotage or other accidents in some circumstances certifications and waivers the nunnlugar amendment contained six exclusions that set out conditions the recipients had to meet before receiving us threat reduction assistance the united states could not provide assistance until the president certified to congress that each recipient nation was committed to 1 making substantial investment of its resources for dismantling or destroying such weapons 115 fiorill

modernization program that exceeds legitimate defense requirements and forgoing the replacement of destroyed weapons of mass destruction 3 forgoing any use of fissionable and other components of destroyed nuclear weapons in new nuclear weapons 4 facilitating united states verification of weapons destruction carried out under section 212 5 complying with all relevant arms control agreements and 6 observing internationally recognized human rights including the protection of minorities118 congress expected the president to exercise his judgement when deciding whether to issue the certifications for example the legislation states that the recipient nations must be committed to the policies listed in the six exclusions standard which can be less demanding than one that requires precise behavior the clinton administration certified russia for several years even though the united states had questions about russias compliance with chemical and biological weapons agreements because russias president yeltsin had offered verbal assurances of his commitment to resolve the outstanding questions using the same information the bush administration withheld russias certification in addition the exclusions do not define many of their terms for example they state that recipient must make substantial investment of its own resources but it does not define level of investment that would be necessary they also state that the recipients must forgo military modernization programs that exceed legitimate defense requirements but it does not ban all military modernization or indicate how much would be too much congress has debated adding new or modified exclusions to the ctr legislation several times over the life of the ctr program in some years some members have sought to provide more precise standards of behavior for the recipient nations in others they have sought to add new requirements linking receipt of assistance to greater number of policy areas congress has rejected many of these efforts particularly if they appeared certain to cut off us threat reduction assistance to russia instead it has usually crafted requirements with language that provides the president with the flexibility to balance us concerns about the recipients policies against the us interest in continuing efforts to contain and eliminate weapons of mass destruction119 congress did add new certification requirements related to the construction of the chemical weapons destruction facility at shchuchye in fy1998 and fy1999 these stated that funds authorized to be appropriated under this or any other act 118 pl 102228 sec 211 paragraph b 119 for detailed review of the history of the ctr certification requirements see crs memorandum for congress certification requirements affecting the nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction program by amy f woolf december 23 2002 crs54 for fy1998 for cooperative threat reduction programs may be obligated or expended for chemical weapons destruction activities until the president submits to congress written certification that russia is making reasonable progress toward the implementation of the bilateral destruction agreement b the united states and russia have made substantial progress toward the resolution to the satisfaction of the united states of outstanding compliance issues under the wyoming memorandum of understanding and the bilateral destruction agreement and c russia has fully and accurately declared all information regarding its unitary and binary chemical weapons chemical weapons facilities and other facilities associated with chemical weapons however congress permitted the president to submit an alternative certification which stated that the national security interests of the united states could be undermined by united states policy not to carry out chemical weapons destruction activities under the cooperative threat reduction programs but when congress resumed funding for shchuchye in fy2002 after two year prohibition it restored the certification requirements without the alternative provision the united states could not provide funding for chemical weapons destruction activities in russia until the secretary of defense certified that there has been 1 information provided by russia that the united states assesses to be full and accurate regarding the size of the chemical weapons stockpile of russia 2 demonstrated annual commitment by russia to allocate at least 25000000 to chemical weapons elimination 3 development by russia of practical plan for destroying its stockpile of nerve agents 4 enactment of law by russia that provides for the elimination of all nerve agents at single site 5 an agreement by russia to destroy or convert its chemical weapons production facilities at volgograd and novocheboksark and 6 demonstrated commitment from the international community to fund and build infrastructure needed to support and operate the facility the bush administration announced in april 2002 that it could not certify that russia was committed to its arms control obligations under the chemical weapons and biological weapons conventions this decision stalled many ongoing ctr projects by precluding the signing and implementation of new contracts furthermore in an effort to balance its stated support for ctr with this decision the administration asked congress to provide it with the authority to waive the certification requirements so that it could continue to fund ctr programs in russia most members of congress agreed with the administrations view that the ctr programs continued to serve us national security interests and the house and crs55 senate each included waiver authority in its version of the defense authorization bill the senate provided the president with permanent waiver authority once passed the authority would remain available to the president in all future fiscal years the house sought less generous provision providing the president with the authority to waive the certification requirements only in fy2003 the conference committee in section 1306 hrept 107436 provided the president with the authority to waive the certification requirements for three years but this waiver only applied to the original six exclusions not the separate certification for shchuchye congress included one year of waiver authority for that project in the fy2003 defense appropriations bill pl107248 the fy2004 defense authorization bill pl 108136 and the fy2005 defense authorization bill pl 108375 the three years of waiver authority in the fy2003 defense authorization act expired at the end of fy2005 the house in its version of the fy2006 defense authorization bill provided the president with another three years of waiver authority the senate in contrast provided the president with unlimited waiver authority the conference committee adopted the senate position the president must still present waiver each year if he cannot certify russias compliance with the requirements but this authority is available to him every year in its version of the fy2007 defense authorization bill the senate approved language that would have eliminated the certification requirements from the ctr legislation the house rejected this approach although the final version of the bill continues to provide the president with unlimited waver authority the bush administration has indicated that it believes that the combination of certification requirements and presidential waivers is an essential part of its effort to use the ctr program to encourage greater openness in russia and to transform russian behavior they allow the united states to signal to russia that it will hold it to high standard and although the president can waive the certifications he does not have to if russian behavior does not meet us standards some in congress support this approach they agree that the ctr program should be afforded high priority but they note that it cannot proceed in vacuum without consideration for russian behavior in other policy areas some however disagree with this approach they believe that us threat reduction assistance to russia should be of the highest priority and although russian policies in other areas are important they should not interfere with the elimination and containment of weapons of mass destruction some of these members have proposed that congress amend the ctr legislation to remove the certification requirements altogether others believe that congress should provide the president with permanent waiver authority so that this debate does not stop the program as it did in 2002 again in the future some in congress however believe that russian policies in other areas such as russian nuclear cooperation with iran russian military modernization and the lack of russian compliance with arms control can create new threats to us security and therefore are of higher priority than threat reduction assistance they argue that the president should have only limited ability to waive the certification requirements crs56 the 110th congress has addressed this issue again both the house and senate versions of the defense authorization bill would eliminate the certification requirements from the ctr program the conference report accepted this provision and as result us assistance under the ctr program will longer be subject to the certification requirements that have been the cause of so much debate funding and focus of the programs funding the bush administration has indicated through the us commitment to the g8 global partnership described below that it plans to request around 1 billion per year for us threat reduction and nonproliferation programs in russia and the other former soviet states these programs expanded sharply in the latter half of the 1990s when the ctr program receiving little less than half of the total appropriation and the doe programs growing to consume majority of the funding yet many analysts argue that the united states should commit far greater sum to these efforts the bakercutler report for example released in january 2001 argued that the united states should spend up to 30 billion over the next 10 years on does programs to secure nuclear materials120 this amount did not include funding for dod or state department programs which could total another 5 billion over the next 10 years if spending continues at the current level most analysts agree that added funding will not necessarily accelerate all us programs they acknowledge that implementation problems such as the absence of access to many facilities and the us failure to certify russia for receipt of ctr assistance for most of 2002 slowed progress and left significant amounts of money unspent on the other hand they have identified numerous programs that might achieve greater results with increased funding these include the science centers in moscow and kiev where the united states and its partners have had to limit the number of scientists who receive research grants because of limits on the available funds this list at one time also included the program to dispose of plutonium in russia where added funding might have sped construction of the mox facility and hasten the elimination of weapons grade plutonium and the program to eliminate russias plutonium producing reactors where greater funding is now leading to the completion of replacement energy plants export and border control programs might also accelerate their progress with added funding leading to the installation of improved equipment and procedures at greater number of border crossing points the bush administration generally agrees with the need to add funding to some programs to accelerate their progress and it took this route with several programs such as the science centers and export and border control programs during its first term it has also called for added international funding to help accelerate the shutdown of russias plutoniumproducing reactors and to speed security improvements at storage sites for russian nuclear warheads however analysts note that with fixed budget of around 1 billion per year the united states will be able to expand these programs and introduce new programs only if it reduces funding for 120 us department of energy the secretary of energy advisory board report card on the department of energys nonproliferation programs with russia howard baker and lloyd cutler russia task force january 10 2001 p 20 crs57 other programs but other programs such as the effort to help russia dispose of its weaponsgrade plutonium could consume rapidly increasing sums in the future consequently the administrations plans for fixed budget could force tradeoffs between projects for example in its budget request for fy2004 doe sought to add funding to accelerate the blenddown of highly enriched uranium and to fund the new program to identify and secure radiological sources at the same time it has reduced funding for mpca projects in russias nuclear weapons complex on the other hand some current programs may finish their missions in the coming years allowing increased funding for other programs many of the capital intensive construction projects funded during the 1990s fall into this category as is evidenced by the reduced budgets for strategic offensive arms elimination and the construction of the chemical weapons destruction facility some have even noted that as these large projects conclude the united states might find it difficult to fulfill its commitment to spend 1 billion each year dods ctr budget is already declining and doe has noted that its funding for programs in russia is likely to decline in the next few years as it completes many of the security upgrades at nuclear weapons storage facilities these changes could pave the way for added funding for new projects in the former soviet union or they could release funds for use on other projects with an antiterrorism focus possibly outside the former soviet union if recent trends continue however it seems quite likely that while the us budget for nonproliferation and threat reduction assistance may hold steady or even increase little funding for programs in the former soviet union could decline in the near future focus us threat reduction and nonproliferation programs have pursued number of different types of projects trying different solutions to different problems however most have followed one theme these projects have sought to consolidate contain and destroy weapons and materials and to consolidate and contain weapons knowledge so that they would not leak out of the former soviet union in essence the united states has sought to identify materials and knowledge that might leak out of russia and to contain them at their source several of the new projects identified by the bush administration such as the wmd proliferation prevention project at dod and doe second line of defense take different approach instead of improving security at the source they seek set up barriers outside the nuclear weapons complex to prevent these resources from leaving the territory of the former soviet union these two approaches can be complementary and provide layered defense against the leakage of weapons materials and knowhow however in an era of constrained budgets they might also compete for funding and political support furthermore many analysts believe that the most effective approach to keeping nuclear materials away from terrorists is to protect them at their source at facilities in russias nuclear complex121 the bush administrations budget request reduces 121 the most effective approach to reducing the risk is multilayered defense designed to block each step on the terrorist pathway to the bomb but securing nuclear weapons and materials at their source is the single most critical layer of this defense where actions that continued crs58 or holds steady funding for mpca programs while increasing funding for other types of projects consequently congress may address the issue of focus and priorities in its debate over us threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance globalization and international cooperation there is nearuniversal agreement both within the bush administration and among analysts outside the us government that the potential proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to rogue nations or terrorist groups presents global problem that requires an international response while the legacy of the soviet unions weapons programs may create the most immediate and largest threat other nations also possess materials weapons or knowledge that could leak out beyond their borders to those seeking their own nuclear chemical or biological weapons122 in addition although the united states has spent more than decade trying to help russia and the other former soviet states secure their weapons materials and knowledge other nations can contribute to this effort with funding and cooperative programs the following section addresses three characteristics of the proposals for the globalization of threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance the first the g8 global partnership against the spread of weapons and materials of mass destruction is an initiative to expand the list of countries contributing to threat reduction and nonproliferation programs in russia the second is an initiative to extend us threat reduction assistance to nations outside the former soviet union the third is more general approach to encourage all nations to better account for and secure their weapons of mass destruction and materials that might become attractive targets for terrorists seeking their own weapons of mass destruction the g8 global partnership during the g8 summit in kananaskis canada in july 2002 the united states russia and other g8 leaders agreed to establish longterm program the g8 global partnership against weapons of mass destruction to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction and related materials and technology under this program known as 1010 over 10 the united states has pledged to provide 10 billion over 10 years to sustain ongoing threat reduction programs in russia this amount of 1 billion per year is equal to current us spending on threat reduction and nonproliferation programs in russia so the us commitment would not necessarily signal an increase in the us commitment the other g7 nations have also agreed that they will provide together up to 10 billion over 10 years russia has agreed to contribute 2 billion of its own money it has also agreed to adopt set of guidelines that will allow it to receive assistance 121 continued can be taken now will do the most to reduce the risk of terrorist acquiring nuclear weapons and materials at least cost controlling nuclear warheads and materials report card and action plan by matthew bunn et project on managing the atom march 2003 122 according to former senator sam nunn some 20 tons of civilian heu highly enriched uranium exists at 345 civilian research facilities in 58 countries yet there are international standards for securing these nuclear materials within country sam nunn cochairman of the nuclear threat initiative reducing the threats from weapons of mass destruction and building global coalition against catastrophic terrorism moscow russia may 27 2002 crs59 specifically it has agreed that it will provide for effective monitoring auditing and transparency measures and that it will provide for adequate access for donor representatives at work sites it has also agreed that the assistance will be free from taxes and other charges and that it will ensure adequate liability protections for donor countries and their personnel123 each of these issues continue to hinder nonproliferation assistance to russia and all potential donors have emphasized the need for their resolution before they provide additional assistance the g8 leaders agreed that this new program would initially focus on threat reduction and nonproliferation programs in russia but could eventually extend to other nations if they adopt the partnerships guidelines the united states considers its assistance to the other former soviet states to be part of its commitment under the global partnership ukraine has also expressed an interest in receiving assistance under this program the united states would also like the global partnership to contribute to programs designed to redirect scientists in iraq and libya during their 2004 meeting at sea island georgia the participants agreed to consider this proposal the g8 leaders also invited other nations or organizations such as the european union to contribute to the program norway and others in europe have already outlined cooperative programs with russia at the g8 summit in evian france in 2003 six other nations in europe sweden finland norway poland switzerland and the netherlands joined the partnership seven additional nations australia new zealand south korea belgium denmark ireland and the czech republic joined during the 2004 summit in sea island georgia president bush in speech on february 11 specifically emphasized that the g8 global partnership should expand its list of both donors and recipient nations124 some analysts have questioned how successful the global partnership will be in providing significant new funding for threat reduction and nonproliferation programs the partnership had received pledges for more nearly 17 billion including the 10 billion from the united states by may 2004 however pledges of support received since kananaskis may not necessarily extend into sustained funding over the next 10 years as senator richard lugar has noted many of our international partners will find it difficult to establish nonproliferation programs during period of stagnating domestic economic growth125 some have also questioned how the allies will set priorities and divide up responsibilities over different types of nonproliferation projects in the statement released after the kananaskis summit they listed several projects including the 123 the g8 global partnership against the spread of weapons and materials of mass destruction statement by the group of eight leaders kananaskis canada june 27 2002 124 the white house president announces new measures to counter the threat of wmd fort lesley j mcnair february 11 2004 125 senator richard lugar has noted that the g8 initiative is not assured see lugar richard g the next steps in us nonproliferation policy arms control today december 2002 crs60 destruction of chemical weapons dismantlement of decommissioned nuclear submarines disposition of fissile materials and employment of former weapons scientists as highpriority projects126 most analysts agree that added funding would help to expand and accelerate each of these project areas at the same time though the global partnership will not rely on single coordinating body to either identify new projects or set priorities among competing projects each nation will allocate its own funds to those programs that it views as highpriority endeavors with central authority this process could leave some programs with too little funding and others with too much funding extending ctr beyond the former soviet union in the debate over the fy2003 defense authorization bill the senate approved an amendment proposed by senator richard lugar that would allow dod to use up to 50 million in fy2003 ctr funds outside the states of the former soviet union to resolve critical emerging proliferation threats and to take advantage of opportunities to achieve longstanding united states nonproliferation goals127 senator lugar argued that this type of effort could provide assistance to nations seeking help in securing or destroying weapons or dangerous materials and could also create international standards of accountability for protecting and handling nuclear material and deadly pathogens this legislation would also allow the united states to undertake missions to secure dangerous materials or weapons that were at risk of falling into the wrong hands128 the senate and the bush administration supported senator lugars proposal the house however objected to this expansion of ctr and the language was removed in conference the bush administration requested similar authorization in its emergency supplemental appropriations bill for fy2003 the senate again approved the request and the house again rejected it it was removed from the final version of the bill the bush administration again requested the authorization to spend up to 50 million in ctr funds outside the former soviet union in the fy2004 defense authorization bill the senate again offered its unqualified support for this measure the house in contrast argued that these types of programs would be better managed by the state department than the defense department it authorized the transfer of up to 78 million in ctr funds to the state department nonproliferation and disarmament fund for use in threat reduction efforts outside the former soviet union the conference committee in its report on the fy2004 defense authorization bill pl 108136 approved the presidents request and permits the use of up to 50 million in ctr funds outside the former soviet union however in deference to the house concerns the committee language indicates that this funding could be used only for shortterm projects it also states that the president should determine whether 126 the g8 global partnership against the spread of weapons and materials of mass destruction

crs61 dod is the agency that is most capable of implementing the planned project the conferees stated that they would expect the president to assign the project to the most appropriate agency the bush administration exercised this authority for the first time in mid2004 when it provided assistance to albania for the elimination of chemical weapons129 in its version of the fy2006 defense authorization bill the senate sought to alter the provision so that the secretary of defense rather than the president could approve expenditures outside the former soviet union the senate argued that this change would streamline the procedure and make it easier for the united states to respond to sudden and emerging proliferation problems the house however objected and the conference committee did not accept the senate provision the 110th congress addressed this issue again both expanding the authority to spend ctr funds outside the former soviet union and to streamline the process of identifying and approving potential projects as was noted above congress added 10 million to the ctr authorization to fund these programs further it eliminated the requirement included in the fy2004 authorization act pl 108136 that limited the program to shortterm projects that addressed sudden emergency proliferation concerns instead the conference report hrept 110477 sec 1303 specifies that ctr programs outside the former soviet union are defined in similar way to those inside the former soviet union they would be programs designed to facilitate the elimination and the safe and secure transportation and storage of chemical or biological weapons weapons components weaponsrelated materials and their delivery vehicles facilitate safe and secure transportation and storage of nuclear weapons weapons components and their delivery vehicles prevent the proliferation of nuclear and chemical weapons weapons components and weaponsrelated military technology and expertise prevent the proliferation of biological weapons weapons components and weaponsrelated military technology and expertise which may include activities that facilitate detection and reporting of highly pathogenic diseases or other diseases that are associated with or that could be utilized as an early warning mechanism for disease outbreaks that could impact the armed forces of the united states or allies of the united states and expand militarytomilitary and defense contacts those who support the expansion of ctr beyond the former soviet union argue that the united states could apply the model of threat reduction assistance that it has developed during the past 12 years to help other nations secure and eliminate 129 warrick joby albanias chemical cache raises fears about others washington post january 10 2005 p a1 crs62 weapons or materials that might be attractive to terrorists they point to nations such as pakistan where insecure nuclear materials might be at risk of theft or diversion by government officials or representatives of terrorist organizations130 others however question whether program like ctr can be applied successfully to nations outside the former soviet union they note that these nations might not be willing to allow the united states access to facilities that house nuclear materials or weapons that they might prefer to enhance rather than reduce the threat posed by their weapons of mass destruction and that us assistance in securing weapons might actually make it easier for the recipient nations to deploy and use the weapons some have also questioned whether the united states can legally provide assistance under us and international law to nations that are not parties to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty131 global recognition of national responsibility one of the key themes in recent reviews of the proliferation threat and the potential link to terrorism is the recognition that nuclear chemical and biological materials reside in many nations around the world nations with research facilities for these materials often lack the basic accounting security export and border control systems that the united states has spent more than 10 years trying to bring to russia although few of these materials would be useful to those seeking to build nuclear weapons they could be of use to those seeking radiological dispersal device dirty bomb or chemical or biological weapon there is growing consensus that the international community and individual nations should take steps to address problems with these materials beyond those already in place under the international atomic energy agency132 the united states would not necessarily need to adopt new programs and appropriate new funds to address this problem some believe as was noted above that efforts to expand ctr programs beyond the former soviet union could help address the problem but many believe that the iaea with the support of the united states could take steps in this direction through its existing programs that help countries secure and account for radiological materials the chemical weapons convention also provides mechanism that might help nations secure and account for chemical agents and materials consequently at least initially the effort to address this global problem could be more diplomatic and political than technical with the united states and others using the bully pulpit to encourage other nations 130 see for example gottemoeller rose and rebecca longsworth enhancing nuclear security in the counterterrorism struggle india and pakistan as new region for

nonproliferation conference november 14 2002 crs63 to recognize the problem and take steps within their own systems to address their own vulnerabilities in essence this new global focus may serve to shape the second decade of us threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance during the first decade the problem was dominated by concerns over the potential for the loss of control over nuclear materials and weapons in the former soviet union and the solutions were dominated by us programs to bring technical assistance to the former soviet states in the second decade the problem is likely to be dominated by concerns about the potential acquisition of nuclear chemical and biological materials by terrorist organizations the solutions may be dominated by growing sense of global cooperation in identifying and addressing weaknesses in greater number of countries us funding and technical assistance may still play dominant role but other nations may also step in to offer their experience
