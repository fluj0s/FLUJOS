internal conflict has resulted largely from warfare among and within the five major cl an groups in somalia the dir the isaq the hawiye the darod and the rahanwey n external conf licts were partly attributable to nationalist desire for greater pansomalia encouraged by former dictator mohammed siad barre somalis ma ke up not only the bulk of the population in somalia itself but are also ke group

soviet union the us began providing military and economic assistance in exch ange for american access to naval and air facilities us s upport continued throughout the 1980s until congressional pressure forced the suspensi on and eventual complete withdrawal of aid because of massive human rights vi olations by the barre regime in 1988 civil war intensified in the northwest region in the

throughout 1997 partic ularly in mogadishu the region outside baidoa in southcentral somalia and the area around kismayo in southeastern somalia the violence still had minimal effect on the balance of

continued statements of support and commitment by the warlords and the igad governments the nationa l reconciliation conference was postponed several times during 1998 ali mahdi stated at one point th at the delay was to allow aideed to join the process he had begun making conciliatory overtures toward the ethiopian government and the other mogadishu wa rlords at the end of the igad summit in march 1998 the member governments issued statement noting that the proliferation of parallel initiatives can only undermine the central objective of accelerating the peace process in somalia and urging all concerned parties to bolster the igad peace process on somalia nd ensure that all assistance provided to somalia be geared to enhance the peace process and that it be channeled through the igad mechanism the parallel initiatives mentioned in the igad statement referred specifically to meetings in cairo sponsored jointly by the government of egypt and the arab league in december 1997 the igad govern ments particularly ethiopia accused egypt of deliberately undermining the s odere initiative in order to strengthen egyptian power in the region and weaken the ethiopian position9 tensions between the ethiopian and egyptian governments have been ongoing for decades largely because of power struggle over control of the headwaters of the nile river the nile is the lifeline of egypt and since the main source of the nile is ethiopia egypt has for many years maintained strong presence in the region egypt assumes that successful mediation effort by ethiopia will place the ho rn of africa country in stronger position in country egypt long considered its sphere of influence therefore mediation in somalia has come to symbolize increased influence in regional matters egypt denied the charges asserting that its talks were more inclusive because of the participation of hussein aideed after more than month of talks and just five days after faction leaders agreed on how many

location of baidoa since he refused to set foot in bosasso the conference originally scheduled for february 1998 was postponed several times over the course of the past year because of fighting betw

peacethere was feeling that the ri val warlords are losing influence and that in number of areas locallybased authorities had exerted control and kept some stability11 the emergence of local administration the inability and unwillingness of somali faction leaders to end their power struggle and cooperate for lasting peace remain the greatest obstacles to the establishment of working government in somalia observers note that key step in restoring stability is to convince rival f actions that they are in mutually hurting stalemate situation in which each faction can successfully stand up to the other and defend its own territory but one can ex tend control or make gains certainly arrangement can be successful without the transparent and goodfaith cooperation of each warlord

to the somalis themselves to decide whether they want unitary state or whether they want to continue with individual clans controlling chunks of territory12 although the intractab ility of the faction leaders themselves constitutes the most obvious barrier to negotiate d settlement many observers now argue that perhaps the peace process itself is flawed in that it seeks the wrong outcome they maintain that the peace process must recognize that centralized government is currently unrealistic and efforts should instead capita lize on the strengths of somali culture such as spirit of local autonomy hist oric arrangements for powersharing and decentralization nd strong desire for peace somali analysts suggest that negotiated agreement in so malia has the greatest hope of success if built from the ground up diplomatic efforts should first focus on establishing local arrangements for administration and security then move to regional structures and finally central government which could perhaps be simple loose federation of polities this emergence of local administration shoul d be fostered and encouraged with the longterm goal of central government in mind somalia may we ll represent failed nationstate in the traditional sense of the term but these observers assert that government structures are ind eed functioning in some areas13 the northwest region of soma lia is considered by many such analysts to be model for successful regional authority and administration the republic of somaliland seceded from the rest of soma lia in 1991 and now has its own flag and
