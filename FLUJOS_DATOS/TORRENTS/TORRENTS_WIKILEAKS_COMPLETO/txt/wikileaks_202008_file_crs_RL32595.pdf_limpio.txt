divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32595nuclear terrorism brief review of threats and responses summary it would be difficult for terrorists to m ount nuclear attack on us city but such an attack is plausible and woul d have catastrophic consequences in one scenario killing over halfmillion people and causing damage of over 1 trillion terrorists or rogue states might acquire nuclear wea pon in several ways the nations of greatest concern as potential sour ces of weapons or fissile materials are widely thought to be russia and pakistan russia has many tactical nuclear weapons which tend to be lower in yield but more dispersed and apparen tly less secure than strategic weapons it also has much hi ghly enriched uranium heu and weapons grade plutonium some said to have inade quate security many experts believe that technically sophisticated terrorists could without state support fabricate nuclear bomb from heu opinion is divided on whet her terrorists could make bomb using plutonium the fear regarding pakistan is that some members of the armed forces might covertly give wea pon to terrorists or that if president musharraf were overthrown an islamic fundame ntalist government or state of chaos in pakistan might enable terrorists to obtain wea pon terrorists might also obtain heu from the more than 130 research reactors worldwide that use heu as fuel if terrorists acquired nuclear weapon they could try many means to bring it into the united states this nation has thousands of miles of land and sea borders as well as several hundred ts of entry terrorists might smuggle weapon across lightlyguarded stretches of borders ship it in using cargo container place it in crude oil tanker or bring it in using truck boat or small airplane the architecture of the us response is termed layered defe nse the goal is to try to block terrorists at various stages in their attempts to obtain nuclear weapon and smuggle it into the united states th underlying concept is that the probability of success is higher if many layers are used rather than just one or two layers include threat reduction programs in the fo rmer soviet union fforts to secure heu worldwide control of former soviet and other borders th container security initiative and proliferation security initiativ and us border security several approaches underlie multiple layers such as technology intelligence and forensics many policy options have been proposed to deal with nuclear terrorism such as developing new detection technologies strengthening us intelligence capability and improving planning to respond to an ttack congress funds programs to counter nuclear terrorism and holds hearings and ssformal briefings on the topic several bills have been introduced in the 109th congress related to nuclear terrorism

weapon but such an attack is plausible and woul d have catastrophic consequences report of june 2004 by the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states found that even though an attempt by qaeda in 1994 to purchase uranium failed qaeda continues to pursue its strategic objective of obtaining nuclear weapon1 book by the center for nonproliferation studies emphasizes the urgency of taking steps to reduce the risk that terrorists coul d obtain nuclear weapons or materials2 may 2004 report by harvard univ ersitys project on managing the atom finds that nuclear ttack would be among the most difficult types of attacks for terrorists to accomplish but that with the necessary fissile materials capable and wellorganized terrorist group plausi bly could make deliv er and detonate at least crude nuclear bomb capable of incinerating the heart of any major city in the world3 an earlier report by the same group estimated the consequences of ten kiloton weapon

former coul d involve obtaining nuclear weapon or obtaining fissile material and making it into bomb delivery involves more common and less sophisticated skills to m ove the weapon covertly to its target weapon acquisition experts have raised concerns that terrorists might try to acquire two types of nuclear weapons in the simplest g untype weapon mass of uranium highly enriched in the fissile isotope 235 highly enriched uranium or heu is shot down tube resembling an artillery tube into another heu mass creating supercritical mass and nuclear explosion the hiroshima bomb used this approach its designers had such high confidence in it that they did not test this type of weapon prior to using it the second type an implosion weapon typically uses weaponsgrade plutonium wgpu composed mainly of the isotope 239 shell of wgpu is surrounded by chemical explosives arrayed to produce symmetrical inwardmoving implosion shock wave that compresses the plutonium enough to be supercritical the nagasaki bomb was of this type it is much more complex in design and manufacture than gunassembly weapon an implosion device wa s tested in new mexico prior to use on nagasaki national acad emy of sciences report sserts crude heu weapons could be fabricated w ithout state assistance6 some experts believe that terrorists could create an implosion weapon7 others disagree8 terrorists or rogue

that government were overthrown by fundamentalists the new government might make weapons available to terrorists or 3 such weapons might become available if chaos rather than government followed the overthrow other nations are seeking nuclear wea pons president bush in his 2005 state of the union address said today iran remains the worlds primary state sponsor of terror pursuing nuclear weapons it must give up its uranium enrichment program and any plutonium reprocessing 12 according to press report mohamed elbaradei director general of the international atomic energy agency says he is now certain that the nuclear material his agency once monitored there in north korea has been converted into fuel for four to six nuclear bombs13 and in statement of february 2005 north korea declared that it had nuclear weapons14 there is also evidence of transfers of nuclear weapon materials designs production equipment and expertise to ot her nations aq khan the father of pakistans atomic bomb

states also present terrorists with different risks and opportunities legal cr ossings are points such as seaports airports and border stations on roads entering the united states illegal crossings are lines the thousands of miles of unguarded stretches of coasts and land borders securing points poses different requirement s from securing lines points have an immense volume of traffic lmost all of it legal and corresponding concentration of people and resources of us customs nd border protection cbp the task of cbp is to find the needle in the haystack while expediting legal traffic attempts to smuggle nuclear weapon through legal crossing would run the risk that the weapon might be detected by computerized screening of cargo manifests imaging devices similar to xrays neutron activ ation devices or physical inspection as discussed below that risk is reduced by the need for cbp agents to process huge numbers of vehicles vessels and passengers leaving little time or attention for those not raising suspicions and by the low radioactivity of fissile uranium235 approximately one hundred millionth that of radioactive material that might be used in dirty bomb24 abc news attempted to highlight the difficulty of detecting smuggled material on september 11 of 2002 and 2003 that or ganization smuggled 15pound cylinder of depleted uranium du natural uranium minus most of its uranium235 into the united states in cargo containers cbp did not detect it abc news said that du is good surrogate for heu cbp said that was not the case and that there was reason for cbp to have detected the du because it is legal to import up to 15 pounds of du as long as it is declared the dhs inspector genera l found improvements are needed in the inspection process to sure that weapons of mass destruction do not gain access to the us through oceangoing cargo containers detection equipment and search protocols and procedures are the two areas where improvements would enhance the effec

are spread much more thinly along lines attempts to smuggle nuclear weapon across an unguarded section of border would avoid the risk that the weapon might be detected but cbp agents would only need to detect the smugglers not the weapon anyone or anything enteri ng the united states across lines is illegal on the other hand risk to smugglers is reduced because cbp faces an immense task in patrolling the vast stretches of borders26 terrorists could avoid the risks attenda nt to smuggling across both points and lines if they could place weapon on board an airplane or ship bound for the united states and detonate it before it could be inspected such as in the air above city or as it entered seaport scenarios for smuggling nuclear wea pon across unguarded coasts or borders are similar to those for smuggling bales of marijuana many of which are reportedly flown in brought by small boats or carri ed across land borders the difficulty of patrolling the borders makes such scenarios feasible key difference between smuggling marijuana and nuclear weapon is that in the former case smugglers expect losses due to interception by cbp nd view them as cost of doing business terrorists attempting to smuggle nuclear w eapon into the united states in contrast would presumably have only one or few weapons and would have to go to great lengths to succeed conversely because of the great value of nuclear wea pon to terrorists methods that create substan tial probability of det ecting an attempt to smuggle weapon into the united stat might deter such an

using oil tankers by jonathan medaliaanother scenario commonly discussed is smuggling nuclear weapon in shipping container27 these metal boxes typically 8 by 8 by 20 feet or 8 by 8 by 40 feet are used to transport vast quantities of goods ranging from clothes to computers to automobile engines nearly 9 million containers enter the united states by ship each year28 container ships may carry several thousand contai ners from seaports they are transported by truck or rail thr oughout the country the concern is that if terrorists could place bomb in container overseas they could ship it into the united states and transport it anywhere in the country under th container security initiative csi discussed below cbp agen ts and their foreign counterparts screen containers being loaded onto container ship s at certain foreign ports and the foreign agents inspect containers that the screen ing identifies as susp icious based on ports of call manifest data shipping compan etc terrorists however might try to circumvent csi by acquiring trusted shipping company to avoid suspicion falsifying manifest data infiltrating csi ports shi pping from noncsi ports nuclear explosion in us port from bom b in shipping container would have not only direct effects but could also ve farreaching effects on the world economy because of its dependence on c ontainer traffic an effect magnified by industrys use of justintime deliveries according to robert bonner commissioner of customs and border protection simply put the shipping of sea containe rs would stop the american people for one would not likely permit one more sea container to enter the united states until there was significantly greater ssurance such as 100 inspections that additional terrorist weapons would be smuggled into the country governments in other major industrial countries would doubt adopt similar policy thus bringing the global economy to its knees29 stephen flynn an authority on us vulne rabilities to terrorist attack cites john meredith director of hutchison port holdings which flynn describes as the worlds largest terminal operator as w orried about the cascad ing consequences should the us government close its ports for two to three weeks after terrorist attack meredith warned the entire system would go into gridlock30 another possible scenario is the use of an oil tanker to transport nuclear weapon31 the middle east is the dominant source of antiamerican terrorism the united states imports an average of more than 2 million barrels of crude oil dayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32595crs8 32 us

tanker operations handbook fo r the personincharge pic fourth edition centreville md cornell maritime press 2001 p 20from persian gulf nations32 this crude oil is transporte d by ship and it would be very difficult to detect bom b inside supertanker part of the difficulty of detecting bomb inside floating vat of crude oil would arise from the sheer size of supertanke rs which carry 100000 deadweight tons or more of crude oil33 for example two supertanke rs built in 2003 for cosco china ocean shipping group were 330 meters lmost quartermile long and 60 meters in beam and had capacity of about 300000 deadweight tons34 there are even larger tankers that carry 500000 deadweight t ons of crude oil and have length of 396 meters and beam of 71 meters35 on land some detection devices use gamma rays highenergy xrays to peer inside shipping container and create an xraytype image but the size of supertanker and the thickness of the steel especially with the use of double hulls make this technique unworkable another possible means of detecting nuclear weapon is neutron activation in which burst of neutrons is sent into the item to be examined such as shipping container neutrons that strike uranium235 or other radioactive materi will cause some atoms to fission releasing neutrons and gamma rays any ne utron coming back as result of neutron bombardment would be suspicious the ga mma rays produced by the disintegration of each isotope have unique set of ener gies creating fingerprint that permits identification of the isotope however ne utrons sent into the oil and any produced by fissioning of uranium would be abso rbed forming deuter ium or tritium or scattered by the hydrogen atoms in crude oil and the large volume of oil would attenuate any gamma rays pr oduced defeating this form of detection at the same time designing means to detonate bomb inside tanker could prove technical challenge for terrorists bomb in tanker could devastate an oil port by the blast and by secondary fires in nearby refineries and oil storage tanks tanker bomb might be used against other maritime targets such as the panama canal and if bomb in shipping container could lead to the shutdown of container traffic riously damaging the world economy tanker bomb might by the same token lead to the suspension of crude oil shipments with similar resultshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32595crs9 36 for discussions of layered defense see flynn america the vulnerable p 6871 and ferguson et the four faces of nuclear terrorism pp 8083 37 see crs report

available at httpwww ntiorgdbnisprofskazakstfissmatsapphirehtmresponses by now over three years after the att acks of september 11 the components of the us and global response have become clearer the response is often termed layered defense reflecting the idea that terrorists would have to proceed through many steps to acquire nuclear weapon nd smuggle it into the united states and that attempting to thwart them at each st ep has higher likelihood of success than trying to block one step only36 whether layered defense is an overarching strategy as is the case in ballistic missile defense or simply name given to what would have happened anyway as many agencies with different capabilities contribute in the ways each is able to or some of both is another matter in any event many programs have been established to deal with nuclear rrorism since 911 and others created well before then have acquired new urgency the following six categories of programs are presented in the order in which they bear on terrorist or rogue state effort to acquire and deliver nuclear weapon threat reduction programs in the former soviet union the soviet nuclear threat reduction act of 1991 pl 102226 title ii also known as the nunnlugar amendment authorized department of defense dod program to assist in the destruction of soviet nucl ear and other weapons the united states now funds threat reduction and nonproliferation programs through three agencies dod runs the cooperative threat reduction pr ogram to secure and dismantle former soviet nuclear and other weapons the department of energy doe runs several programs within its defense nuclear nonpr oliferation account such as international nuclear materials protection and coope ration and eliminati on of weaponsgrade plutonium production to secure nuclear w eapons materials and knowledge and the department of state runs such progra ms as science and technology centers in russia and ukraine to provide weapons scie ntists with grant funding or employment on nonweapons projects37 efforts to secure heu worldwide heu is used in many research reactors around the world the united stat and the soviet union provided this material to many nations years ago as noted above much is said to be poorly guarded it is concern because acquiring suitable quantity of heu would be the most difficult step for terrorists intent on making nuclear bomb efforts to secure some of this material have been ad hoc rath er than part of comprehensive plan for example in 1994 project sapphire repor tedly removed from poorly guarded warehouse in
