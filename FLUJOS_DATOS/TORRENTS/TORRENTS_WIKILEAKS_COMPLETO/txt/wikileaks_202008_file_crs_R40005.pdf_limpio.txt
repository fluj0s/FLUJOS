serious financial problems corporate executives from the big three general motors ford and chrysler have testified before congress about their need for federal credit direct loans and guaranteed ans this report examines the chrysler loan guarantee program for possible insights that could assist members of congress in evaluating proposals to provide federal credit assistance in 1979 chrysler applied for federal loan guarantees in 1979 and 1980 the economy was in recession and the price of oil had unexpectedly increased dramatically however at that time there was financial liquidity crisis as is the case today most of the arguments for and against the proposed chrysler loan guarantee program are relevant to current proposals for credit assistance to the big three for example in the 1979 debate proponents argued that the chrysler loan guarantee would save many jobs but opponents contended that the financial capital obtained for chrysler by the proposed loan guarantee would have been used by other firms to expand their productive facilities output and employment thus any chrysler job losses could be offset by gains at other firms provisions in the chrysler loan guarantee act of 1979 included the establishment of chrysler loan guarantee board extensive federal oversight of chryslers operations detailed reporting requirements by chryslers management shared sacrifice of parties benefiting from the loan guarantee and protection of the federal governments interest chrysler used federal loan guarantees to borrow 12 billion of the 15 billion available and redeemed its guaranteed loans in 1982 some critics argued that chrysler was only able to return to profitability because of the imposition by the us government of voluntary export restraints on japanese vehicles export restraints are equivalent to import quotas in 1980 the chrysler loan guarantee was treated as contingent liability with initial cost at the time the guarantee was provided because chrysler repaid all of its guaranteed loans the us government incurred budgetary cost furthermore the us government r eceived warrants to buy chrysler stock which it subsequently sold at auction to chrysler for 311 million thus it can be argued that the us government made profit from the loan guarantee program currently the federal credit reform act requires that the reported budgetary cost of credit program equal the estimated subsidy costs to the taxpayer at the time the credit is provided for proposed legislation establishing new credit program the congressional budget office is responsible for making the initial estimate of the subsidy cost once legislation has been enacted the office of management and budget estimates the subsidy cost on the credit program an appropriation for the annual subsidy cost of each credit program is made into budget account called credit program account thus under todays budgetary rule legislation providing direct loans or loan guarantees to assist the au tomobile industry would require the inclusion of the estimated subsidy cost which would require an appropriation of budget authority this report will be updated as issues develop andor in the event of new legislation

g561 in the 1960s and 1970s the chrysler corporation had history of financial instability during recessionary periods it had incurred large losses but during periods of prosperity the corporation had usually earned high profits yet between 1967 and 1980 the companys domestic market share had declined from 16 to 86 arguably due to managerial errors foreign competition regulatory controls and the energy shortage at that time chrysler failed to introduce small car in the late 1960s even though ford produced the pinto and general motors began manufacturing its vega chrysler refused to manufacture new small automobile until it introduced its plymouth horizon and dodge omni models in 1977 the rising cost of gasoline changing consumer tastes and environmental protection agencys epa s fuel efficiency standards contributed to chryslers troubles because it had not shifted its production to smaller vehicles some corporate financial experts assert that chrysler should have reduced its dividends in the early 1970s and used the funds to modernize its plant and equipment also chrysler made belated attempt to compete overseas with ford and general motors which was unsuccessful in 1979 huge losses compelled chrysler to sell off some of its subsidiaries close plants and reduce its employment in july 1979 chrysler requested and subsequently received federal loan guarantees to avoid bankruptcy losses continued throughout 1979 and chryslers total loss for the year was 1126 billion 1 ford and general motors were in better financial condition than chrysler but also experienced large losses in 1979 and 1980 because of the sharp rise in the price of gasoline and the worst economic downturn since the great depression in 1980 the big three general motors ford and chrysler lost record 42 billion as their sales in that year plummeted 30 below 1978 sales reaching their lowest level since 1961 2 as will be discussed in subsequent section of this report in 1981 the big three advocated and received the imposition by the federal government of voluntary export restraints on japanese vehicles export restraints are equivalent to import quotas these voluntary export restraints contributed to the return to profitability of general motors and ford as well as chrysler because the restraints led to reduction in the number of japanese vehicles exported to the united states 1 us

advanced four primary arguments first if chrysler defaulted there would be an enormous loss in employment many of these job losses would occur in firms supplying parts and materials to chrysler data resources inc conducted simulation of the chrysler collapse and concluded that there would be 500000 nearterm loss in employment and longerterm additional employment loss of between 200000 and 300000 second some of chryslers difficulties were beyond its control particularly large price increases in oil obtained by the organization of petroleum exporting countries third federal safety environmental and fuel efficiency standards had been disproportionately costly for chrysler compared to general motors and ford because the larger corporations had l onger production runs and thus could spread out their regulatory costs over more units conseque ntly chrysler deserved federal compensation for its costs incurred in meeting federal regu lations fourth chrysler manufactured the main battle tank for the us army hence if chry sler went bankrupt national defense would be weakened opponents of the loan guarantee to chrysler buttressed their case with five basic arguments first they contended that the analysis made by data resources inc was misleading the financial capital which chrysler would obtain with the loan guarantee could be used instead by other firms to expand their productive facilities output and employment in addition part of chryslers lost sales would be picked up by general motors and ford second the entire economy was experiencing high energy costs thus single firm such as chrysler did not warrant preferential treatment due to the energy problem third most of the regulatory costs incurred by chrysler were due to fuelefficiency standards yet chrysler would have been compelled to improve the average mileage of its automobiles anyway because of the rising cost of energy fourth if chrysler went bankrupt it would go into rece ivership under existing bankruptcy legislation profitable operations such as its tank production division would continue as subsidiary of another corporation or as new corporation fifth the chrysler loan guarantee might encourage other large corporations to obtain federal financial assistance this would lead to greater federal role in the economy and reduction in the efficiency of private capital markets in allocating credit

and the secretary of transportation served as ex officio nonvoting members of the board the board was responsible for determining the terms and conditions under which it would make commitments to guarantee the payment of principal and interest on loans to chrysler if the board determined that 1 chrysler had an energy saving plan satisfactory to the board 2 the loan guarantee was necessary to prevent serious negative effects of the economy 3 chrysler had submitted satisfactory operating plan and 4 chrysler had submitted to the board satisfactory financing plan to meet the financing needs of the operating plan and which included an aggregate amount of nonfederally guaranteed assistance of at least 143 billion from chrysler banks financial institutions other creditors suppliers dealers stockholders labor unions employees management state and local and governments and others directly deriving benefit from the production distribution or sale of the products of chrysler loan guarantee could be issued only if the board determined that 1 credit was not otherwise available to chrysler under reasonable terms or conditions 2 chryslers prospective earning power and the value of the security pledged had to furnish reasonable assurance of the repayment of the guaranteed loan 3 the loan to be guaranteed had an interest rate determined by the board to be reasonable 4 chryslers operating and financing plans continued to meet board requirements 5 chrysler was in compliance with its operating and financing plans 6 the board had received assurances that chryslers operating and financing plans are realistic and feasible 7 chrysler agreed to reporting requirements of revised operating and financial plan covering the period of the loan guarantee and within 120 days following the close of each fiscal year an analysis reconciling the corporations actual performance with the operating and financial plan was submitted 8 there was substantial likelihood that chrysler would be absorbed by or merged with an foreign entity and 9 chrysler was in compliance with the terms and conditions of the commitment to issue the guarantees required by the board any determination by the board that the conditions established by the act had been met would be conclusive the board would prescribe and collect guarantee fee sufficient to compensate the federal government for all administrative expenses related to the guarantee but in case could such fee be less than onehalf of 1 per annum of the outstanding principal amount of loans guaranteed the board was to ensure that the federal government is compensated for the risk assumed in making guarantees thus the board was authorized to collect an additional fee above the fee to cover administrative costs to enter into cts allowing the federal government to participate in gains from the financial success of chrysler or use instruments deeded appropriate by the board all amounts collected by the board would be deposited in the treasury as miscellaneous receipts the act described the proportionate share to be contributed by employees in order for chrysler to receive the loan guarantees the act required chrysler to establish an employee stock ownership plan esop the amount of loan guarantees could not at any time exceed 15 billion in aggregate principal amount outstanding

than december 31 1990 the board was authorized to inspect and copy all accounts books records memoranda correspondence and other documents and transactions of chrysler in order to protect the federal governments interest the board was granted extensive oversight authority including approval of the sale of any asset with value in excess of 5 million and labor contract having an aggregate value of future wages and benefits of 10 million or more debts owed the federal government would have priority but the board could wave such priority the secretary of transportation would submit to the board and to congress planning study providing an assessment of the longterm viability of chryslers involvement in the automobile industry the board would submit reports to congress semiannually for 1980 and 1981 and annually for later years the authority of the board to issue loan guarantees was to expire on december 31 1983 the administrator of the small business administration would investigate

three and the united automobile workers advocated for restrictions on japanese automobile exports to the united states supporters of export restraints in the reagan administration argued that the

the us government thus at the time loan guarantee was granted there was budgetary cost because chrysler repaid all of its guaranteed loans budgetary cost was incurred by the us government in addition in return for the loan gu arantee the us government had received from chrysler 144 million warrants to purchase chrysler stock at 13 per share until 1990 on september 12 1983 the us government auctioned these warrants and chrysler purchased them for 311 million 10 thus it can be argued that from budgetary standpoint the chrysler loan guarantee program made money for the us government

the government of direct loan or loan guarantee calculated on net present value basis excluding administrative costs this places the cost of federal credit programs on budgetary basis equivalent to other federal outlays this change means because the subsidy costs of discretionary credit programs are now provided through appropriations acts the discretionary credit programs must then compete with other discretionary programs on an equal basis funding for most mandatory credit programs generally entitlement programs is provided by permanent appropriations for proposed credit program the congressional budget office is required to estimate the subsidy cost if legislation is passed that includes this credit program the director of the office of management and budget omb is responsible for coordinating the estimation of subsidy costs an appropriation for the annual subsidy cost of each credit program is made into budget account called credit program account funding for the subsidy costs of discretionary credit programs is provided in appropriation acts and must compete with other discretionary programs for funding available under the constraints of the budget resolution most mandatory credit programs receive automatic funding for the amount of credit needed to meet the estimated demand by beneficiaries mandatory programs are generally entitlement programs for which the amount of funding depends on eligibility and benefits rules contained in substantive law the subsidy cost of federal credit is scored as an outlay in the fiscal year in which the credit is disbursed by either the federal government or private lender section 504d for mandatory credit programs any additional cost from reestimates of subsidies for credit program is covered by permanent indefinite budget authority this additional cost is displayed in subaccount in the credit program account also beginning with fy1992 each credit program has nonbudget financing account each of these nonbudget financing accounts receives payments from its associated credit program account equal to the subsidy cost at the time new loan or loan guarantee is provided they also acquire the value of the unsubsidized portion of the loans actual disbursements by the government minus the subsidy cost these amounts are borrowed from the treasury through the loan program 13 furthermore the financing accounts contain all other cash flows between the public and the government associated with each credit program section 5025e67 these flows include the disbursement and repayment of loans the payment of default losses on guarantees and the collection of interest and fees 14 because they are nonbudget the cash flows into and out of these accounts are not reflected in total outlays receipts or surplusdeficit the budget authority of credit program provides the means for the credit program account to pay to the financing account an amount equal to that programs estimated s ubsidy costs the off budget borrowing from the treasury for the unsubsidized portion of credit program is included in the national debt g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g156g561 this report examined the chrysler

currently exists most of the arguments for and against the proposed chrysler loan guarantee program are relevant to current proposals for credit assistance provisions in the chrysler loan guarantee act of 1979 included the establishment of chrysler loan guarantee board extensive oversight of chryslers operations detailed reporting requirements by chryslers management shared sacrifice of parties benefiting from the guarantee and protection of the governments interest chrysler borrowed 12 billion of 15 billion available and redeemed its guaranteed loans in 1982 some critics argued that chrysler was only able to return to profitability because of the imposition by the us government of voluntary export restraints on japanese vehicles in 1980 the chrysler loan guarantee was treated as contingent liability with initial cost at the time the guarantee was provided currently the fcra requires that the reported budgetary cost of credit program equal the estimated subsidy costs at the time the credit is provided for proposed legislation establishing new credit program cbo is responsible for making the initial estimate of the subsidy cost for example the advance technology vehicles manufacturing loan program atvmlp was authorized under section 136 of the energy independence and security act of 2007 pl 110140 congress provided the necessary funding for the loans in continuing resolution for federal appropriations pl 110329 approved sept 30 the continuing resolution contained provisions to enable automakers to access 25 billion in government loans to retool assembly lines to make more fuelefficient vehicles the resolution enacted to fund the federal government through march 2009 incl uded 75 billion to co ver the cost of the loan program as estimated by the congressional budget office 15 once legislation has been enacted omb estimates the subsidy cost on the credit program this reports examination of the chrysler loan guarantee program raises some concerns relevant to todays debate about credit assistance to the big three first current economic conditions differ for the automobile industry in 1979 the downturn in automobile sales for the big three appeared temporary today the downturn in automobile sales for the big three may be protracted and sales may not recover if brands are elimin ated and plants permanently closed second in 1979 the budgetary treatment of loan guarantees and direct loans was on cash flow basis loan guarantee was initially treated as cost free because it was contingent liability of the us government thus possible future costs of default were not considered direct loan was treated as direct outlay which did not consider the repayment of principal and interest today the cost of credit program is the estimated subsidy cost to the taxpayer at the time the credit is provided third in 1979 and 1980 if chrysler nded automobile manufacturing part of this decline in employment would have been offset by increased employment by general motors and ford but today this would not occur because all of the big three are in financial trouble and are requesting federal credit assistance 15 bureau of national affairs
