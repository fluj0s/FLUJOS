training in july 2008 congress enacted the foreign inte lligence surveillance act of 1978 amendments act of 2008 faa one of the primary purposes in enacting the faa was the creation of new way for the us government to compel providers of electronic communications services to assist the government in acquiring foreign intelligence information concerning nonus persons located outside the united states this process is described in s ection 702 of faa almost all of the 1978 law remained intact and section 702 of faa is best understood as an exception to fisa for such targets fisc orders for us persons or persons located inside the united states the definitions of electronic surve illance in fisa were not changed so any collection that uses methods th at fall within them and is directed at anyone inside the united states or at us persons abroad still requires court order the government must give the court probable cause to believe that each target is forei gn power or agent of foreign power before the court will issue an order compelling communications service provider to assi st with the targeting time sensitive targets and high volume of targets under section 702 of faa however the government may compel the same type of assistance in way th at is much more timesensitive and more suitable for collection directed at higher volume of targets the means used the means used by the government to compel this assistance is in the form of certifications issued join tly by the attorney general and the director of national intelligence that are approved by the foreign intelligence surveillance court f isc and directives to the providers ordering them to assist the government certification details in certification th dni and ag certify that specific requirements of the law have been met and descri be how this has been done when the collection is being done by nsa dirnsa also makes representations to support the certification if the court determines that the statutory requirements for certifi cation have been met it issues an order to this effect and the collection may begin i introduction to faa section 702 1 compel providers nonus persons b outside the united

top secretcomintnoforn20320108 4since this video was recorded in december 2008 faa certification 2009c wmdproliferation certification has been approved refer to pg 14 of this document for this reason nsa personnel who are going to be involved in the collection processing or disseminatio n of data gathered pursuant to section 702 of faa must unders tand the requirements and responsibilities associated with certification to ensure they are acting in accordance with the representations made to the fisc by the dni ag and dirnsa in other words the various parts of certification lay out the rules of the road for collec tion and handling of data pursuant to faa and this training is designed to assist you in becoming familiar with their terms certification ma also contain representations made by other federal agencies that assi st in the collection andor are authorized to receive the proceeds of what nsa is collecting pursuant to faa their terms are only of periphe ral interest to most nsa personnel so they will not be disc ussed in great detail although section 702 of the faa provi des framework of requirements for issuance of certification it doe s not say how that framework must be used to date the ag and dni ve issued certifications that are topically based cert ification that authorizes targeting directed at foreign governments factions enti ties and foreign based political organizations certification 2008a nd certification that authorizes targeting directed at groups enga ged in international terrorism or activities in preparation therefore c ertification 2008b each will be discussed in turn day to day analysts attention as described in the briefing on day today basis most analysts will need to be particularly concerned with the portions of the certifica tions that describe which foreign intelligence targets have been authorized for collection in general terms by the attorney general and dni typically exhibit f to certification the procedures for determining that there is reasonable belief that part icular target is nonus person located outside the united states typically exhibit to certification and the minimization procedures that govern handling of us person usp information acquired in the course of collection directed at nonus persons reasonably believed to be located outside the us who fit within the terms of the authorization typically exhibit b to certification thus at the end of this traini ng nsa personnel should know how to find out whether proposed target fits within the terms of certification i

understanding where to find nsas res ponsibilities and re strictions is every bit as important as becoming fa miliar with the specifics of their terms at the current time certification 2008a targeting directed at foreign governments and similar entities dirnsas affidavit dirnsas affidavit to certific ation 2008a states the following nsa has adopted procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that all targeting is directed at nonus persons reasonably believed to be outside the united states xhibit described below this collection will be accomplished by variety of means at switches and other parts of the infrastructure of companies that provide electronic communications services to people abroad from within the united states the collection will seek to acquire foreign intelligence information concerning foreign governments facti ons thereof and similar types of entities and also states that list of the entities that will be targeted is included as exhibit f described belo w it also states that if nsa wants to target foreign government or other similar ent ity that is not on this list it may do so but it has to notify the ag and dni within 5 days of implementing the targeting when nsa personnel come across in formation concerning us persons they will follow minimization procedures attached to the certification exhibit b described below nsa may disseminate to cia uneva luated data that comes from collection pursuant to this certificati on and that cia requests in order to carry out its clandestine espionage and counterintellig ence activities abroad nsa may

secretcomintnoforn20320108 top secretcomintnoforn20320108 6targeting procedures exhibit these procedures address one of th central requirements of the faa determination that the targeting is limited to nonunited states persons outside the united states it does so in four parts part 1 location part 1 discusses how nsa will make determination that person being targeted is located outside the united stat it notes that the determination is made in light of the totality of the circumstances nsa analysts look at lead inform ation they have received on the target they conduct research in ns databases available reports and collateral information and they c onduct technical analyses of the email addresses or other facilities to be targeted they can use information from any one or combination of these categories of information to determine that the pot ential target is outside the united states part 1 addresses each of these categories in greater detail with examples of how they are ap plied to targetin g of phone numbers and email addresses it also notes that when nsa is seeking to acquire communications about the target that are not to or from the target it will employ ip filters or similar technology to ensure that the collection is directed at party to communications reasona bly believed to be outside the united states part 1 also provides similar guidance on assessment of potential targets status as nonus person it notes that information on potential targets location is fre quently useful in determining his status as well it tes that in the absence of specific information regarding potential targ ets status if pers on is reasonably believed to be located outside the united states he will also be presumed to be nonus person unlessuntil he can be positively identified as us person or the nature or circumstan ces of his communication give rise to reasonable belief to the contrary because one of the things certified by the ag and dni is that the purpose of the collection is to gather foreign intelligence part 1 also addresses how nsa will assess whether the target possesses andor is likely to communicate information of foreign intelligence value concerning foreign power or forei gn territory nsa can not target someone merely because he is located outside the us there has to be some reason to believe that the targeting will acquire foreign intelligence this requirement and mo st of the factors listed in this 2 targeting procedures exhibit 2008a exhibit part i location i located outside of the united states ii totality of circumstances 1

secretcomintnoforn20320108 top secretcomintnoforn20320108 7section are intuitive to nsa analysts and include information that indicates the target s communicated with someone associated with foreign power or territory informa tion in public directories that link phone number to someone associat ed with foreign power or foreign territory part 2 detecting target cation or status changes part 2 describes steps that will be taken by nsa after targeting has begun to ensure that it detects when target has entered the united states despite reasonable belief to the contrary when targeting was initiated these steps are designed to prevent nsa from collecting domestic communications as well as any targeting of persons who are inside the united states nsa looks at registers of roaming cell phones ip addresses of internet communications and similar technical information but in many cases it will be the content of communication that indicates that target has entered the united states if nsa determines that ta rget has entered the united states or that target thought to be non us person is in fact us person it must terminate collection without delay and take additional steps described in part 4 below part 3 identifying the foreign power part 3 states that before collecti on can begin analysts must document one or more citations to the informa tion that led them to believe that target was located outside the united states they must also identify the foreign power or foreign territo ry about which they expect to obtain foreign intelligence so that people conducting oversight of nsas collection can see how the agency is meeting the requirements established by the ag and dni in their certification part 4 oversight and reporting part 4 describes oversight and comp liance responsibilities associated with collection done pursuant to certification 2008a the sid office of oversight and compliance oc together with the ogc is required to develop training on the rules associated with faa collection oc must also ensu re that raw traffic from faa collection is labeled and stored on ly in authorized repositories and accessible only to those who have had such training oc is also required to conduct periodic spot checks to ensure that nsa is meeting its responsibilities with regard to targeting dissemination and other activitie s associated with faa collection the department of justice doj an d the office of the director of national intelligence odni also conduct independent oversight of nsas activities with reviews at least once every 60 days 2 targeting

of domestic communications these reports must be made within 5 days of nsa learning of the incident any information acquire d by intentionally targeting us person or person nor reasonably be lieved to be outside the united states at the time of targeti ng has to be purged from nsa databases part 4 also repeats the requirement that if nsa targets someone in the reasonable belief that he is nonunited states person outside the united states and later finds out that the target is inside the united states or is in fact us person matter where he is located it must cease the ta rgeting without delay any information gathered prior to determining that the target was us person or located inside the unite d states has to be handled in accordance with the relevant mini mization procedures exhibit b discussed below in addition nsa must report the incident to doj the odni office of genera l counsel and the odni civil liberties officer within 5 days minimization procedures exhibit b the minimization procedures for certification 2008a are modeled on nsas standard minimization procedures annex to ussid 18 but contain some significant diff erences it is important to keep in mind that they govern the processingretentiondisseminati on of information concerning us persons that is collected in th course of targeting nonunited states persons reasonably believed to be outside the united states any restrictions on the handling of data that does not concern us persons come from another source eg concerns about the potential risk to sources and met hods all of the requirements in the procedures will not be repeated verbatim here but nsa personnel working with faa data should review their terms closely the definitions section is the first substantive portion of the procedures and should be reviewed carefully for obvious reasons restrictions on the handling of information concerning us persons can not be properly applied unless one understands what 2 targeting procedures contd

the united states and subsequently learns that either of these beliefs is incorrect it must terminate the targeti ng without delay any communications collected through such targeting prior to the determination that the persons status or loca tion was incorrect must be handled in accordance with the procedures governing domestic communications discussed in section 5 section 4 attorneyc lient communications section 4 states that privileged attorneyclient communications must be handled with particular care any proposed dissemination of information fr om privileged attorneyclient communications must be reviewed by the nsa ogc section 5 domestic communications section 5 governs the handling of domestic communications generally domestic communications shall be promptly destroyed

affidavit and the affidavit for 2008a is that it reflects that the certification concerns different set of targets the collection in this case will seek to acquire foreign intelligence information concerning groups engaged in international terrorism similar to 2008a the certification for foreign governments and similar entiti it states that list of the terrorist groups that will be ta rgeted is included as exhibit f described below it also states that if nsa wants to target foreign terrorist group that is t on this list it may do so but it has to notify the ag and dni within 5 days of

certification 2009c wmdproliferation dirnsas affidavit dirnsas affidavit for 2009c is quite different from those for 2008a and 2008b 2008a and 2008b contained lists of specific targets in an exhibit f attached to the certifications 2009c does not contain similar list instead dirnsas affidavit describes the entities th at can be targeted pursuant to this certification by giving exam ples of groups or persons that possess andor are likely to communicate information concerning one or more of the following activities 1 proliferating weapons of mass struction wmd to include nuclear radiological biological or chemical weapons their deliver means and related material s or technology by state or nonstate actors 2 operating s upplier networks used by state and nonstate actors to acquire wmd capabilities delivery means or related materials or technology 3 developing selling or purchasing emerging and disrup tive technologi that pose threat to the united states its people or its allies or 4 developing selling or purchas ing advanced conventional weapons that pose threat to the united state it s people or its allies the examples that are included in the affidavit are not the only types of entities that may be ta rgeted but should be reviewed by analysts who are interested in conducting targeting pursuant to this certification if potential target falls clearly within one of the descriptions it is clearly itable for tasking however the key determinations are that the potential targets are reasonably believed to be nonus persons cated outside the united states and that they possess andor are likely to communicate information concerning the 4 categories of activities listed above targeting procedures exhibit these procedures are the same as those for 2008a 1 dirnsas

ways from the minimization procedures for 2008a and 2008b both of these differences appear in secti on 8 first they make it clear that nsa may disseminate inte lligence reports that contain properly minimized us pers on information to foreign governments and that any dissemination of us person information to foreign government must be done in manner consistent with subsections 6b and 7 of the minimization proceduresessentially the same rules that govern dissemination of us person information to other federal agencies because nsa always interpreted this portion of the minimization procedures in this manner this clarification has meaningful practical consequences second they expand nsas capability to obt ain technical and linguistic assistance from foreign governments beyond the second parties the conditions and limitations under which such assistance may be soughtprovided remain unchanged but as long as they are met nsa ma obtain the assistance from other foreign governments as well 3 minimization procedures exhibit b focus on section 8 1 nsa may dissemination instruction 2 expanded nsa capability to obtain technical and linguistic assistance top

not appear on the list but that is not decision that can be made by an individual analyst questions about modifying the lis t should be addressed to the ogc the only other somewhat si gnificant difference between 2008a and 2009a is change in the calculati on of some requirements for notification in 2008a nsa was required to notify the ag and dni of additions to the list in exhibit f within 7
