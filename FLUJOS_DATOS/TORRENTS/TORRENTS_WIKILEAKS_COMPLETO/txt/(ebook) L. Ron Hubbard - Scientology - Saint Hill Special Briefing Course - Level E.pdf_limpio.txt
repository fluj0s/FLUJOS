corrected per flag issue 28173 sthil students assnorg sec hat hco sec hat case sup hat ds of p hat ds of t hat staff member hat franchise issued may 1965 note neglect of this pol ltr has caused great hardship on staffs has cost countless millions and made it necessary in 1970 to engage in an all out international effort to restore basic scientology over the world within 5 years after the issue of this pl with off the lines violation had almost destroyed orgs quickie grades entered in and denied gain to tens of thousands of cases therefore actions which neglect or violate this policy letter are high crimes resulting in comm evs on administrators and executives it is not entirely tech matter as its neglect destroys orgs and caused 2 year slump it is the business of every staff member to enforce it all levels keeping scientology working hco sec or communicator hat check on all personnel and new personnel as taken on we have some time since passed the point of achieving uniformly workable technology the only thing now is getting the technology applied if you cant get the technology applied then you cant deliver whats promised its as simple as that if you can get the technology applied you can deliver whats promised the only thing you can be upbraided for by students or pcs is results trouble spots occur only where there are results attacks from governments or monopolies occur only where there are results or bad results therefore the road before scientology is clear and its ultimate success is assured if the technology is applied so it is the task of the assn or org sec the hco sec the case supervisor the d of p the d of t and all staff members to get the correct technology applied getting the correct technology applied consists of one having the correct technology two knowing the technology three knowing it is correctfour teaching correctly the correct technology five applying the technology six seeing that the technology is correctly applied seven hammering out of existence incorrect technology eight knocking out incorrect applications nine closing the door on any possibility of incorrect technology ten closing the door on incorrect application one above has been done two has been achieved by many three is achieved by the individual applying the correct technology in proper manner and observing that it works that way four is being done daily successfully in most parts of the world five is consistently accomplished daily six is achieved by instructors and supervisors consistently seven is done by few but is weak point eight is not worked on hard enough nine is impeded by the reasonable attitude of the not quite bright ten is seldom done with enough ferocity seven eight nine and ten are the only places scientology can bog down in any area the reasons for this are not hard to find weak certainty that it works in three above can lead to weakness in seven eight nine and ten b further the nottoobright have bad point on the button selfimportance c the lower the iq the more the individual is shut off from the fruits of observation d the service facs of people make them defend themselves against anything they confront good or bad and seek to make it wrong the bank seeks to knock out the good and perpetuate the bad thus we as scientologists and as an organization must be very alert to seven eight nine and ten in all the years i have been engaged in research i have kept my comm lines wide open for research data i once had the idea that group could evolve truth third of century has thoroughly disabused of that idea willing as i was to accept suggestions and data only handful of suggestions less than twenty had long run value and none were major or basic and when i did accept major or basic suggestions and used them we went astray and i repented and eventually had to eat crow on the other hand there have been thousands and thousands of suggestions and writings which if accepted and acted upon would have resulted in the complete destruction of all our work as well as the sanity of pcs so i know what group of people will do and how insane they will go in accepting unworkable technology by actual record the percentages areabout twenty to 100000 that group of human beings will dream up bad technology to destroy good technology as we could have gotten along without suggestions then we had better steel ourselves to continue to do so now that we have made it this point will of course be attacked as unpopular egotistical and undemocratic it very well may be but it is also survival point and i dont see that popular measures self abnegation and democracy have done anything for man but push him further into the mud currently popularity endorse degraded novels self abnegation has filled the south east asian jungles with stone idols and corpses and democracy has given us inflation and income tax our technology has not been discovered by group true if the group had supported in many ways i could not have discovered it either but it remains that in its formative stages it was not discovered by group then group efforts one can safely assume will not add to it or successfully alter it in the future i can only say this now that it is done there remains of course group tabulation or coordination of what has been done which will be valuableonly so long as it does not seek to alter basic principles and successful applications the contributions that were worth while in this period of forming the technology were help in the form of friendship of defence of organization of dissemination of application of advices on results and of finance these were great contributions and were and are appreciated many thousands contributed in this way and made us what we are discovery contribution was not however part of the broad picture we will not speculate here on why this was so or how i came to rise above the bank we are dealing only in facts and the above is factthe group left to its own devices would not have evolved scientology but with wild dramatization of the bank called new ideas would have wiped it out supporting this is the fact that man has never before evolved workable mental technology and emphasizing it is the vicious technology he did evolvepsychiatry psychology surgery shock treatment whips duress punishment etc ad infinitum so realize that we have climbed out of the mud by whatever good luck and good sense and refuse to sink back into it again see that seven eight nine and ten above are ruthlessly followed and we will never be stopped relax them get reasonable about it and we will perish so far while keeping myself in complete communication with all suggestions i have not failed on seven eight nine and ten in areas i could supervise closely but its not good enough for just myself and few others to work at this whenever this control as per seven eight nine and ten has been relaxed the whole organizational area has failed witness elizabeth ny wichita the early organizations and groups they crashed only because i longer did seven eight nine and ten then when they were all messed up you saw the obvious reasons for failure but ahead of that they ceased to deliver and that involved them in other reasons the common denominator of group is the reactive bank thetans without banks have different responses they only have their banks in common they agree then only on bank principles person to person the bank is identical so constructive ideas are individual and seldom get broad agreement in human group an individual must rise above an avid craving for agreement from humanoid group to get anything decent done the bankagreement has been what has made earth helland if you were looking for hell and found earth it would certainly serve war famine agony and disease has been the lot of man right now the great governments of earth have developed the means of frying every man woman and child on the planet that is bank that is the result of collective thought agreement the decent pleasant things on this planet come from individual actions and ideas that have somehow gotten by the group idea for that matter look how we ourselves are attacked by public opinion media yet there is more ethical group on this planet than ourselvesthus each one of us can rise above the domination of the bank and then as group of freed beings achieve freedom and reason it is only the aberrated group the mob that is destructive when you dont do seven eight nine and ten actively you are working for the bank dominated mob for it will surely surely introduce incorrect technology and swear by it b apply technology as incorrectly as possible c open the door to any destructive idea and d encourage incorrect application its the bank that says the group is all and the individual nothing its the bank that says we must fail so just dont play that tune do seven eight nine and ten and you will knock out of your road all the future thorns heres an actual example in which senior executive had to interfere because of pc spin case supervisor told instructor to have auditor b run process x on preclear c auditor b afterwards told instructor that it didnt work instructor was weak on three above and didnt really believe in seven eight nine and ten so instructor told the case supervisor process x didnt work on preclear c now this strikes directly at each of one to six above in preclear c auditor b instructor and the case supervisor it opens the door to the introduction of new technology and to failure what happened here instructor didnt jump down auditor bs throat thats all that happened this is what he should have done grabbed the auditors report and looked it over when higher executive on this case did so she found what the case supervisor and the rest missed that process x increased preclear cs ta to 25 ta divisions for the session but that near session end auditor b qed and aed with cognition and abandoned process x while it still gave high ta and went off running one of auditor bs own manufacture which nearly spun preclear c auditor bs iq on examination turned out to be about 75 instructor was found to have huge ideas of how you must never invalidate anyone even lunatic the case supervisor was found to be too busy with admin to have any time for actual cases all right theres an all too typical example the instructor should have done seven eight nine and ten this would have begun this way auditor b that process x didnt work instructor what exactly did you do wrong instant attack wheres your auditors report for the session good look here you were getting lot of ta when you stopped process x what did you do then the pc wouldnt have come close to spin and all four of these would have retained certainty in year i had four instances in one small group where the correct process recommended was reported not to have worked but on review found that each one had increased the ta b had been abandoned and c had been falsely reported as unworkable also despite this abuse in each of these four cases the recommended correct process cracked the case yet they were reported as not having worked similar examples exist in instruction and these are all the more deadly as every time instruction in correct technology is flubbed then the resulting error uncorrected in the auditor is perpetuated on every pc that auditor audits thereafter so seven eight nine and ten are even more important in course than in supervision of cases heres an example rave recommendation is given graduating student because he gets more ta on pcs than any other student on the course figures of 435 ta divisions session are reported of course his model session is poor but its just knack he has is also included in the recommendation careful review is undertake because nobody at levels to iv is going to get that much ta on pcs it is found that this student was never taught to read an emeter dial and instructor observed his handling of meter and it was not discovered that he overcompensated nervously swinging the ta 2 or 3 divisions beyond where it needed togo to place the needle at set so everyone was about to throw away standard processes and model session because this one student got such remarkable ta they only read the reports and listened to the brags and never looked at this student the pcs in actual fact were making slightly less than average gain impeded by rough model session and misworded processes thus what was making the pcs win actual scientology was hidden under lot of departures and errors i recall one student who was squirreling on an academy course and running lot of offbeat whole track on other students after course hours the academy students were in state of electrification on all these new experiences and werent quickly brought under control and the student himself never was given the works on seven eight nine and ten so they stuck subsequently this student prevented another squirrel from being straightened out and his wife died of cancer resulting from physical abuse hard tough instructor at that moment could have salvaged two squirrels and saved the life of girl but students had right to do whatever they pleased squirreling going off into weird practices or altering scientology only comes about from noncomprehension usually the noncomprehension is not of scientology but some earlier contact with an offbeat humanoid practice which in its turn was not understood when people cant get results from what they think is standard practice they can be counted upon to squirrel to some degree the most trouble in the past two years came from orgs where an executive in each could not assimilate straight scientology under instruction in scientology they were unable to define terms or demonstrate examples of principles and the orgs where they were got into plenty of trouble and worse it could not be straightened out easily because neither one of these people could or would duplicate instructions hence debacle resulted in two places directly traced to failures of instruction earlier so proper instruction is vital the d of t and his instructors and all scientology instructors must be merciless in getting four seven eight nine and ten into effective action that one student dumb and impossible though he may seem and of use to anyone may yet some day be the cause of untold upset because nobody was interested enough to make sure scientology got home to him with what we know now there is student we enrol who cannot be properly trained as an instructor one should be very alert to slow progress and should turn the sluggards inside out personally system will do it only you or with our sleeve rolled up can crack the back of bad studenting and we can only do it on an individual student never on whole class only hes slow something is awful wrong take fast action to correct it dont wait until next week by then hes got other messes stuck to him if you cant graduate them with their good sense appealed to and wisdom shining graduate them in such state of shock theyll have nightmares if they contemplate squirreling then experience will gradually bring about three in them and theyll know better than to chase butterflies when they should be auditing when somebody enrols consider he or she has joined up for the duration of the universe never permit an openminded approach if theyre going to quit let then quit fast if they enroled theyre aboard and if theyre aboard theyre here on the same terms as the rest of us win or die in the attempt never let them be halfminded about being scientologists the finest organizations in history have been tough dedicated organizations not one nambypamby bunch of pantywaist dilettantes have ever made anything its tough universe the social veneer makes it seem mild but only the tigers surviveand even they have hard time well survive because we are tough and are dedicated when we do instruct somebody properly he becomes more and more tiger when we instruct halfmindedly and are afraid to offend scared to enforce we dont make students into good scientologists and that lets everybody down when mrs pattycake comes to us to be taught turn that wandering doubt in he eye into fixed dedicated glare and shell win and well all win humour her and we all die little the proper instruction attitude is youre here so youre scientologist now were going to make you into an expert auditor matter what happens wed rather have you dead that incapablefitting that into the economics of the situation and lack of adequate time and you see the cross we have to bear but we wont have to bear it forever the bigger we get the more economics and time we will have to do our job and the only things which can prevent us from getting that big fast are areas in from one to ten keep those in mind and well be able to grow fast and as we grow our shackles will be less and less failing to keep one to ten will make us grow less so the ogre which might eat us up is not the government or the high priests its our possible failure to retain and practise our technology an instructor or supervisor or executive must challenge with ferocity instances of unworkability they must uncover what did happen what was run and what was done or not done if you have one and two you can only acquire three for all by making sure of all the rest were not playing some minor game in scientology it isnt cute or something to do for lack of something better the whole agonized future of this planet every man woman and child on it and your own destiny for the next endless trillions of years depends on what you do here and now with and in scientology this is deadly serious activity and if we miss getting out of the trap now we may never again have another chance remember this is our first chance to do so in all the endless trillions of years of the past dont muff it now because it seems unpleasant or unsocial to do seven eight nine and ten do them and well win l ron hubbard founder lrhntrd copyright 1965 1970 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco policy

pressure exerted to speed up student completions and auditing completions was mistakenly answered by just not delivering the correct way to speed up students progress is by using 2 way comm and applying the study materials to students the best way to really handle pcs is to ensure they make each level fully before going on to the next and repairing them when they do not the puzzle of the decline of the entire scientology network in the late 60s is entirely answered by the actions taken to shorten time in study and in processing by deleting materials and actions reinstituting full use

letter of 14 february 1965 reissued on 7 june 1967 with the word remimeo instructor replaced by supervisor all hats bpi safeguarding technology for some years we have had word squirreling it means altering scientology offbeat practices it is bad thing i have found way to explain why scientology is workable system this does not mean it is the best possible system or perfect system remember and use that definition scientology is workable system in fifty thousand years of history on this planet alone man never evolved workable system it is doubtful if in foreseeable history he will ever evolve another man is caught in huge and complex labyrinth to get out of it requires that he follow the closely taped path of scientology scientology will take him out of the labyrinth but only if he follows the exact markings in the tunnels it has taken third of century in this lifetime to tape this route out it has been proven that efforts by man to find different routes came to nothing it is also clear fact that the route called scientology does lead out of the labyrinth therefore it is workable system route that can be travelled what would you think of guide who because his party said it was dark and the road rough and who said another tunnel looked better abandoned the route he knew would lead out and led his party to lost nowhere in the dark youd think he was pretty wishywashy guide what would you think of supervisor who let student depart from procedure the supervisor knew worked youd think he was pretty wishywashy supervisor what would happen in labyrinth if the guide let some girl stop in pretty canyon and left her there forever to contemplate the rocks youd think he was pretty heartless guide youd expect him to say at least miss those rocks may be pretty but the road out doesnt go that way all right how about an auditor who abandons the procedure which will make his preclear eventually clear just because the preclear had cognition people have following the route mixed up with the right to have their own ideas anyone is certainly entitled to have opinions and ideas and cognitionsso long as these do not bar the route out for self and others scientology is workable system it white tapes the road out of the labyrinth if there were white tapes marking the right tunnels man would just go on wandering around and around the way he has for eons darting off on wrong roads going in circles ending up in the sticky dark alonescientology exactly and correctly followed takes the person up and out of the mess so when you see somebody having ball getting everyone to take peyote because it restimulates prenatals know he is pulling people off the route realize he is squirreling he isnt following the route scientology is new thing it is road out there has not been one not all the salesmanship in the world can make bad route proper route and an awful lot of bad routes are being sold their end product is further slavery more darkness more misery scientology is the only workable system man has it has already taken people toward higher iq better lives and all that other system has so realize that it has competitor scientology is workable system it has the route taped the search is done now the route only needs to be walked so put the feet of students and preclears on that route dont let them off of it matter how fascinating the side roads seem to them and move them on up and out squirreling is today destructive of workable system dont let your party down by whatever means keep them on the route and theyll be free if you dont they wont l ron hubbard founder lrhntrd copyright 1965 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6311c28 shspec324 seven classifications of auditing scientology will go as far as it works not as far as it is administered therefore lrh has focussed on full technological development first with the administrative picture to come later when the technical data was completed the administrative pattern could not be let out without having the technical data together the tech data turned out to be an account of highly precise coordinated activity it turned out that people couldnt be audited at high levels unless brought there gradiently this turns out to be true at lower levels too people have to understand what is being asked there is always repercussion to any stimulusresponse cycle or causedistanceeffect cycle the response being new stimulusresponse causedistanceeffect cycle so every stimulus response cycle has return stimulus response cycle where the first response acts as the second stimulus the philosophic conundrum is that you cannot act without consequences in this universe the buddhist answer to this conundrum is cause nothing ie by not building up karma we have another solution audit it out but only trained scientologist will grasp this the questions of what is right conduct and can you ever really cause anything come up here if you try to trace back the cause of something you can get into difficulty say guy is shot with rifle you can try to trace back the cause to the finger tightening to the thought or intention behind this to the motive to early childhood to mother ad absurdum to solve the problem of where cause started you could say it started nowhere but that doesnt really solve anything people get so interested in the cause end of the causedistanceeffect line that they never look for the other end they never look to see what cause comes back from the effect point for instance oswald fired rifle and twentyfour hours later he is shot dead causeeffect cycle always leads to causeeffect cycle there is room for lots of think about it but one simple fact applies in this universe you cant cause something without receiving some sort of effect in return in this universe the magnitude of the effect may differ there is the question of how much you can confront how much you cause is monitored only by how much you can confront if you can confront getting shot shoot moral conduct would consist of only causing those things that could be confronted by those to whom it is caused that is route around the overtmotivator sequence cf the two rules for happy living in scientology new slant on life pp 2328 cause only what others can confront if you do this you lead rather unrestimulated life if you are causing things that others cant confront without great detriment such as starting war you can expect to get your head knocked off eventually even though you think you could confront it an overt is the generation of effects that are unconfrontable and the motivator will be someone causing an effect that you cant confront that is the story of this universe selfdetermined thought is not permitted in this universe the message of this universe is all thought occurs by association but this is not true what is omitted from this is that at any moment thetan can get an idea totally independent of all other ideas by an independent postulation not by stimulusresponse by prime motion that is what puts randomity into the whole picture psychologists and earlier philosophers didnt believe in independent postulation or they missed it lacking independent postulation there is trap they will argue that you cant think of an independent thought because whenever you do you will find that there is another thought with which it is associated in trying to disprove this you go into agreement with it so you cant disprove it this is the old hippopotamus mechanism dont think of the word hippopotamus was part of the alchemists formula for the transmutation of baser elements into gold cf the think thought process in pab 54 pp 23 people want to predict human behavior so they never look at the fact that human behavior can be unpredictable and take this datum into account as part of their predictions this denial of the human beings ability to be unpredictable takes away selfdeterminism of think in this universenow we get up to the question of how much think person can tolerate running overts on the man in the street we get motivators instead of overts all put forward as overts on self this relates to the concept of responsibility the man in the street thinks that it is all being done to him that is why book one has such appeal in scientology the emphasis is on you done it thus scientology has higher responsibility level than dianetics this makes scientology highertoned however it is harder to attract people to scientology on that account than to dianetics irresponsibility is very popular people prefer to think that they never started an action that they never really caused anything this relates to the thinkingness of criminal the criminal knows that nobody owns anything anywhere but they have entered into conspiracy by which they pretend that people think people own things and this is done for only one reason these other people pretend this to get him in trouble and to be nasty to him courts exist not because there is such thing as crime but so that they can pretend outrageous and unreasonable things so that they can get him so criminals have total reality of the uncriminality of criminal acts criminal acts arent criminal to the criminal the cops have picked up some of our think on this eg the idea that criminals cant work but they dont realize that the person they arrested for overtly stealing car knows that the police are bunch of frauds the car never belonged to anybody and the police are fraudulently pretending that cars are owned in order to get this fellow in trouble mest goes to pieces around criminals because they know one owns anything the criminals reality is basically neurosis which at lower levels becomes psychosis for instance another characteristic of the criminal is the notion i didnt shoot anyone because there is one there everything is figment of his imagination solipsism his imagination gives him universe which he knows is delusory even the guy in the street has the idea that something was done to him that accounts for his condition he feels that all responsibility for his state of beingness is exterior to him the common denominator of most thought is it was done to responsibility lies without not within this individual failed or wouldbe writers used to get lrhs goat by saying i always wanted to write but i didnt have the education they were saying this to lrh who was trying to get rid of the phobias had instilled in him when you disseminate scientology you err by not estimating the amount of cause that the person is willing to accept you are willing to assume some degree of cause but he is not and he will find the thought of overt causation and responsibility to be unreal he believes that he is the total effect of life there is some truth to this the pc can be the effect of tremendous number of things to the extent that he cant see himself as cause you might be able to reach him at this level at some time in life in some area if you look it over very carefully you may find that you had something to do with what happened for instance perhaps once you decided to read book and did it that he might agree with you give him rule he might apply eg communication or how to do touch assist right and he will find that he has caused something by experience this approach is more effective than that of giving him the theoretical philosophical data he realizes that he is causing the effect people mostly want the comfortable agony of being at effect catholics get to thinking heresy if you tell them that they can cause effects or create things they are the toughest nuts to crack people who are saddled with religious superstition are the hardest to bring out of this rut in ireland the lecture on creation laid an egg every week for this reason create is the wrong word to use cause would be better though even that is hard for people to admit the areas where one knows everyone fails are those of communication relationships with people and health those are desirable effects so if you give the individual tools and let him find that he can cause an effect in these areas you have snapped him out of the cycle of be nothing but an effect to cause is impossible etc it is not that the man in the street isnt interested in philosophy it is just that he has failed at it the savants have made the field seem unapproachable but what they are concerned with isnt live philosophy anyway the real philosopher is the little guy in the street who actually is concerned with questions like who am i what am i what am i doing here what are people what happens to when i die why dont people like etc in short the real philosophers are people like you and and those are the basic questions that philosophy hasnt answered but pretendsto have answered at an unattainable level for many this failed attempt to arrive at answers to these basic questions led to the service fac god made everything cf the why is god we come to full stop in this search until we realize that every being is an independent being who is himself capable of expressing thought or intention independent of any other thought or intention at any moment the idea that man is or can be cause cracks the back of philosophy when we recognize that every individual is capable of being causative we have scarcity of answers when we realize that it is the degree to which an individual can accept or execute causation independent of other influences that brings about his state of case we have then cracked the whole riddle of philosophy and training person gives him the idea that he can cause an effect as soon as weve got time stream then all befores influence all afters post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy then we can prove that nobody can be cause because the time stream exists this holds water until we realize that the time stream itself is capable of being influenced by postulate the time stream can both be caused and escaped from it this is possible then we have level of cause that is senior to the time stream in disseminating scientology if you only tell people things about it on which you yourself have excellent reality and which you have experienced you will find that you communicate like shot to everybody because the rfactor in you is so high that you cannot help but put it across to others complete truth from the point of origin does get across with effect it isnt the startling thing you say its the real thing you say and it isnt whether it is real to the other guy it whether it is real to you the classification scale is scale of willingness to accept cause over ones destiny and that of others it gives the degree of being at cause madmen get into obsessive cause as lower scale mockery but you could find where someone is on this scale every time by finding what he has done and withheld and feels responsible for ie what his ows are cause is not expressed in actions in life but in case responses it is cause over ones own case that is important where we are concerned people make progress in processing or they dont if they dont they set the same goals session after session if the pcs goals change violently from one session to the next there was an arc break cases dont leap from one case state to another they gradiently and smoothly become more at cause over more matter energy space time and other beings the person isnt necessarily becoming more causative he is more capable of cause he can handle his mind better he is therefore capable of handling other things better his responses in processing are your best possible indicator this is not quick test however so it tends to be neglected case progress is direct index of cause you dont realize how far you have come until you ask someone on the street whether he has any problems and you find that he is living in madhouse from his viewpoint the seven classes of auditor are really eight because they start at zero an unclassed class plus seven classes see hcopl 26nov63 certificate and classification changes everyone classified for description of the classes person could be class zero and have certificate without being of class that is important because there are always some people who work very hard and pass their checksheet but dont make the grade they get certificate showing that they were there classification means more than just getting the certificate class zero certificate is not sign of being classed there are all sorts of valuable processes lying back along the line and they fit into various slots for instance class ii will be studying comm lags of equal length as sign of when to end process this is all an effort to graduate cases on up the line lrh has found that they do not advance further than they are trained so this is the creation of bridge from lower to higher levels this increases information and skill and auditing availability right on up the way it is now people dont know where they are or where they are going or what is expected of them thereare professional pcs from 1950 waiting for someone to process them to ot whose cases havent improved much there will be chart with all the processes and training skills of each class on it all the way up at some late date there will be textbook all the way up6312c10 shspec328 scientology 0 it works out this way having completed scientology research all the way to the top lrh has had to undercut it all to find new series of processes and new processing theory on which to build the edifice that is quite trick knowing the upper strata only makes it harder to build the lower strata because you see it so clearly that it is hard to see how someone else lacking your knowledge could miss it you can know exactly what is wrong with somebody but if he knows differently you cant get him to see your solution or your view of the problem lrh finally has scientology 0 to undercut scientology i it was description of the environment and what is wrong with it it has nothing to do with the persons mind at all scientology i is the isness of things and it takes care of the mind as well but scientology 0 takes care of the environment it is summable up as the dangerous environment that sums up 1 what you are talking about 2 the frame of mind of the person talking with you look around and find something that isnt threatening you or pushing ptp on you or trying to exteriorize you this will help to pull your attention out of the threatening environment it allows differentiation to come about instead of identification many people are professional dangerous environment makers the chaos merchants push dangerous environments on people in sensationalized form this includes politicians newspapermen policemen etc they spread confusion and upset and breed fear of the environment this is the same thing that blackmailer or an extortionist does they make the environment seem more dangerous than it is they sell the dangerous environment 100 the avidity of their sell can be used by the scientologist by means of sort of thetajudo practiced on them understanding scientology 0 includes understanding how to use the enemies of scientology the chaos merchants toynbee working out of libraries came to tremendous understanding of life he says that the reason that the mexican for example does not succeed is that he has insufficient challenge in his environment toynbee has obviously never talked to any mexicans it is myth that primitive peoples get apathetic because of insufficient challenge in the environment the challenge of the environment is actually overwhelming to downtrodden peoples primitive peoples etc the environment is too dangerous for fellow to have ambition this is actually true of anyone who lives on earth the individual on this planet if he has not been able to achieve his destiny is in an environment that he finds overwhelming his methods of dealing with it are inadequate and his existence is as apathetic or as unhappy as his environment seems to him to be overwhelming get those principles down and you will have scientology 0 lot of people spend their time worrying the people around them to death they spread confusion and upset while wondering why their victims dont get ahead these are small scale chaos merchants compared with newspapers but they are more intimate doctors get paid not by the number of people who are well but by the number who are sick the police would go broke if the prisons didnt make more and better criminals police chiefs would be unimportant if they had few police under them newspaper reporters dream of big story meaning good disaster the environment is never as dangerous as it is made to appear solution to the threat of nuclear war could undoubtedly be found especially if there were profit in it but anything that tends to make calmer environment meets and makes ridge with anything that has vested interested in the fact and idea of threatening environment the expansion of scientology will lessen the amount of fear it will lower the stress perceived by people asemanating from the environment scientology would make for calmer environment it would not be less interesting environment but calmer one one that is in less turmoil this could permit resurgence of the individual because he would be less enturbulated you would get beneficial spiral where the threat of the environment would be dying out the chaos merchant doesnt like calming influences they threaten his livelihood and survival on an individual level domestic chaos merchant gets upset when his or her victim gets calmer with exposure to scientology it is very disconcerting to chaos merchant to be met with humor instead of seriousness the true story of scientology is simple phd develops philosophy people find it interesting people find that it works people pass it along to others it grows that is what the newspapers are trying to make story out of from their viewpoint there is story because there is conflict you can amplify the story and get some statistics but anything else is distortion and lies added on to make the story disturbing and sensational but all disturbance folds up in the face of truth in universe kept going and continually disturbed by lies all the basic facts have been covered up particularly those relating to life and death many contrary data have existed fundamental questions belong in philosophy but philosophy has become so decadent that it is longer source of truth it is at best limited truth and in going for truth you have to go all the way see 6211c01 shspec207 the road to truth above the clean blade of truth cannot be stopped but if you talk truth you had better have your hands on it socrates talked truth but didnt have good enough grip on it when you start to introduce scientology to anyone the first target would be the environment not the persons mind you could dream up processes based on the assumption that the person believes that the environment is too dangerous for him any relatively sane person will agree with you on that we know that it is being made to seem more dangerous than it is this is key point of scientology 0 so the person could be brought to perceive that this is so by his own perception it is also key point that the persons 1 health 2 sanity 3 activity level and 4 ambition are monitored by his concept of the dangerousness of the environment from these factors we can draw up an improvement program for any person we can therefore improve these things in the individual without reference to his mind we have dealt with this before under the heading of controlling environmental restimulation we know that to handle his problems terminatedly we will have to handle the mind nevertheless we can get very marked and noticeable gains and improvements by handling his environment since we know that most of the threat that he is worried about is imaginary the therapy could be as simple as dont read the newspaper for two weeks and see if you dont feel better at the end of two weeks have him read the newspapers for week get him to see whether he then feels better or worse so that he can decide if he gets too upset or confused tell him to look around the environment and find something that isnt threat to him good havingness process at scientology 0 is finding out what is threat to person and running it as negative havingness process this is actually very sophisticated it could be used at upper levels run against some particular fear it is an improved version of take walk and look at things this is positive education the reason take walk look it over works is that the individual sees that the environment isnt threatening him to the degree that he thought it was when he has inspected it so you could use process like look around you and find something that isnt going to fall on you atscientology 0 you are trying to get the individual to inspect the environment and find some greater security in it the general auditing approach would be look around you and find out if the environment is as threatening as it appears to be but each person would have to be handled individually you could get person to look at the papers on his desk that are threatening him and find something in them that isnt threat that is taking walk while he is sitting at his desk for person who feels that everyone is hostile to him you could use find something that people say or do around here that isnt hostile to you or find one person in the organization that isnt actively hostile to you or was there anything said today that wasnt immediately and directly hostile to you this could also be played in the direction of exaggeration but then it goes up to higher level in mental direction get the idea of chinese in every corner shooting at you with cong hatchets you could use look around here and find something that isnt trying to exteriorize you etc all this runs on the single auditing command look there is effort to get any itsa about it almost any inspection of the environment is helpful except negative one if the pc has secondary if he has lost an individual in an environment where he has been with the person lot eg in love affair you can use look around here and find something that isnt reminding you of the exlover the mechanism here is that the person has identified everything in the environment with his unrest everything in the environment has become identified with the threatening things in the environment the persons charge on the environment can be destimulated by indicating things that are not so threatening thus getting person to differentiate when identification becomes differentiation intelligence and judgment can return an interesting commentary on the character of man lies in the fact that if you really want to interest people at lecture or pe course you should give them something that they can use to help others rather than something that will help themselves man is basically good and this is proof therefore your supplementary advice should always go on the basis of who are you trying to help to discover that the environment is less dangerous than it seems you had better understand the data well enough so that you can give it to him well enough so that he can use it and see result and then use it on himself if you do this right you will often get the cycle 1 the person finds out something to help pete 2 it works on pete 3 he decides to try to use it to help himself take walk and look at things is about the mildest advice you could give someone it would be quite effective if he actually did it lrh did this and found that by putting tension on the beam with which he was looking at things he could pull himself forward without having to walk this got intriguing he went skimming his heels on the pavement until he noticed cop looking at him the master question is what part of the environment isnt threatening this question gets the person to differentiate you can also get him to arrange his life little if you can get person to just plan life in which everything is calmer and less threatening the life he is living becomes calmer and less threatening when you move this up into scientology i and introduce communication factors and show the person how to communicate with people he will find that he can produce an effect on people and that people are less threatening if you keep havingness in mind as you go up the levels you never lose the benefit of having the environment being less threatening which you started at scientology 0 all people are trying to 1 get out of the environment or 2 master the environment if they cant escapeany thetan has these intentions and has had them all the way up the universe these are the only totally common ptps of an environment the individual would also like to find something to help his friends what you need is level of help that requires practically education at all this would become real to the individual just the concept that he considers the environment dangerous and would like to find the source of threat is an enormous piece of wisdom to him since before you identified it for him he was being it if you provide therapy by telling him to stay away from the things and people etc that upset him and find and associate with the things that arent threat he will make amazing progress this pushes whole new philosophy under the structure of scientologyhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 14 december 1963 central orgs franchise case analysis health research i recently indicated that i was doing some research into alleviation of physical difficulties not because we are in healing but because the ama should be taught lesson for attacking us the research took sudden optimistic turn with the new subject of case analysis hco bulletin of november 26 1963 while case analysis is not used for healing purposes it can be varied at very low levels to produce some astonishing results in health the steps for case analysis are 1 discover what the pc is sitting in 2 get the lies off 3 locate and indicate the charge in 1 the pc is sitting in whatever the pc says he or she is sitting in ie i dont know means pc is sitting in puzzle and is used with steps 2 and 3 by finding what he has supposed and then with the itsa handled establishing the truth of it the following example severely follows the 1 2 and 3 steps of case analysis without seeming to and without the pc having clue about either case analysis or scientology for that matter this was done by dscn using the new fundamentals of case analysis as an independent action to help someone and very cleverly done it was i asked the auditor to write it up for you dear ron an account of an assist which i gave recently the pc aged 17 years was completely new to scientology he was suffering from chronic bronchitis which was currently particularly worrying to him as he had just been given serious warning by his doctor that this could become tb i used the caseanalysis assist first establishing he was sitting in chest trouble then getting him to tell all he could about the condition then i asked after the ta had slowed down what he considered was the cause of the trouble ie getting the untruth off and he said well i think it is caused by the climatethis was accompanied by big ta blowdown further considerations were forthcoming and more ta action so i then asked if this condition had anything to do with something that he himself had wanted to do ie an actual gpmno bd so then asked did it have any connection with something that someone else had tried to make him do ie implant gpm bd so then asked if this was connected with someone or something he had ever known ris this produced big bd and pc spoke of his grandfathers death further bd when i enquired if his grandfather had died of some chest trouble then i asked if any other person or incident was connected to his chest trouble big bd on nearly drowned in swimming pool just before grandfather died i let him itsa on both these incidents until ta slowed down then indicated to him that the trouble was connected to grandfathers death and the neardrowning incidentthis gave further bdin all this assist in model session took 34 minutes and made 7 divisions of ta bd pc made his goal to get to the cause of the trouble and the gain its got deeply interested in the work pc has virtually lost his cough and has applied for staff appointment at hco ww this pc had never heard of scientology prior to about one week before the assist best auditor note 12 days after this auditing the coughing was still in abeyance l ron hubbard lrhglrd

part one good indicators note auditor at this date is qualified to run actual gpms regardless of any former training the successful technology has not been fully released there are class vi auditors if you were trained run only implant gpms the technology for which has been fully released an indicator is condition or circumstance arising in an r vi auditing session which indicates whether the session is running well or badly and if badly what action the auditor should at once take there are good indicators and bad indicators but all of them are indicators the good indicators mean that the session is progressing properly and that the next routine action should be undertaken good indicators abound in properly run session here are some good indicators pc cheerful pc cogniting on items or goals pcs items found are the ones the pc thought they were on the list pc listing items briefly and accurately early items on list turning out to be the right ones the right item reading on the needle with chug as though through resistive wall and then heavily falling with blowdown items found not rocket reading goals found rocket reading short item lists 1 to 15 or 20 items on the list items being found rapidly without lot of hassle even though the right item hard to make read tone arm continuing in motion not stuck symptom of wrong goal or bypassed gpms or ris needle active not stuck symptom of rr gone off which means wrong goal or wrongly worded goal pc not troubled with new mass appearing when item is given ri given pc blowing tone arm down when pc asked if it is it further blowdown of ta with full dial needle slash when pc told it is his or her item distinct needle slash two inches or so when pc asked if new item solves or is solved by ri found just before full dial slash of needle when pc answers question as to what is the position of the newly found item in the bank heat on the item list heat on the goals list heat on the ri found pain on ri found tone arm riding between 25 and 375 acceptable or 225 and 3 excellentgood tone arm action on finding items about 125 ta divisions per gpm in fast running about 30 or 40 ta divisions down per 2l2 hour session minimum the right item reading with only some coaxing pc with ptp about which really went where concerning goals or ris found in earlier session pc with question as to what was the right goal or item after it is found pc not critical or arc breaky pc not protesting auditors actions pc looking younger by reason of r vi auditing pc without weariness pc without pains or aches or illnesses developing during auditing pc wanting more auditing pcs confidence in finding goals and items getting progressively better pcs itsa free but not so extensive as to halt session progress giving more than 30 seconds or minute usually less to itsaing goal or item auditor seeing how goals oppose goals auditor seeing how ris solve ris or are solved by them the goals plot making sense to the auditor the line plot looking proper with correct gradients to the auditor vast mental effort demanded of the auditor to follow pcs logic in why something opposes something or solves something pc not developing heavy ptps or somatics between sessions or in session the good indicator tells you things look the way they ought to look and are going the way they have to go to make an ot when these good indicators are absent then is the time to start doing searches repairs etc in actual practice you get so used to good indicators that you dont really think of them as indicators at all therefore you keep your attention alert for bad indicators and when these show up you have to act and promptly like many other things in this universe you dont concentrate on the smooth you stay alert for the rough but it is great mistake for an auditor to be so nervous about bad indicators that the pc is thrown into whatsit when nothing is wrong things will go wrong then for sure the rule is expect good indicators and go on with routine actions as long as they are present observe quickly and knowingly bad indicators and rapidly act with the correct response every bad indicator is precise easily observed and has an exact counteraction the speed with which bad indicator is observed and the certainty with which it is corrected prevents the session from producing more bad indicators observe the trouble sign instantly know what to do for that exact sign instinctively repair swiftly and in these points we have the whole secret of fast progress it is not the pc who slows the session it is the auditors lack of knowledge of bad indicators and their remedies the longer bad indicator goes unobserved and unrepaired the longer it will take to repair it in r vi errors consume time far far out of proportion to successes one overlooked bad indicator can consume month of auditing time in that month three whole banks would have been run but the month is consumed with unproductive wanderings the pc and auditor torn to bits with stress and arc breaksits all matter of indicators and knowing what to do if that knowledge is poor then well ot thats all the road is traveled with total correctness only it is never traveled at all when unremedied bad indicators are present the auditor is either totally competent or totally incompetent there are shades of grey one error unremedied puts the whole project on the dump heap so the auditor has to know his business and so does the pc and errors cant be let go by this is the routine of perfection sloppy hope it will get by well it doesnt matter attitudes will not make ots any error passed up and neglected will within minutes or sessions wreck the lot miss gpm or half dozen items and within two banks the pc will bog completely and hopelessly and never progress further until the earlier error is remedied its like having pc on rubber bands the pc will go down the track from an error just so far and then as though the bands tighten to drag him back will run slower and slower and then suddenly one is faced with pc who cant run at all but these errors are not undetectable the instant they occur bad indicator shows up the speed errors are remedied determines the speed of advance of the case the dontcare hopeitwillgetby whyrepair auditor just cant audit r vi and will only seriously mess up pcs this is the condition of the final road out i wish it were different but it isnt its that way an auditor can know his business there is finite specific answer for every bad indicator that shows up therefore an auditor to succeed in r vi must 1 know basic auditing and meters and itsa like an old smoothie 2 know the anatomy of gpms ris and the objects of the mind and all their possible combinations like card sharp knows cards 3 know the techniques of r vi like completely relaxed oneman band 4 know all good indicators at glance 5 know every bad indicator and its response with bangbang onetwo certainty that never permits moments wonder as to whats going on or what to do 6 know the rules of r vi ratatattat given those six things an auditor can make an ot in under thousand hours weakness on any one of them will not only not make an ot but will fiendishly mess up case for even if you know r vi cold you will make enough mistakes to keep you very busy the pity of it is that one must become an expert before he or she performs on an actual case but that must be overcome i learned it from scratch so can you with all the data now neat before us lrh drbh l ron hubbard copyright 1963 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6312c31 shspec1 indicators this was the year in which we achieved the technology of ot and in which we laid the bridge with all the older processes from dianetics on it is the year in which we had our hardest attacks since 1950 these attacks are losing or have lost the irs lost its suit on lrh and msh irs means infernal ravening the work for 1964 should include codification of materials writing textbooks for the different levels etc several techniques have been developed for higherclassed auditor to run on lowerlevel pc we are ready to open the door wide on the subject of psychosomatic healing we could put it on an ethical basis by saying that if you dont get results on patient you refund his money anybody who is receiving level vi auditing see above for description of this level from an auditor who flubs goes through more illnesses and psychosomatics than anyone can count lrh understands the phenomenon of psychosomatics and is consequently little contemptuous of doctors treatment of these conditions it is rather horrifying from an auditors viewpoint to see what is thought of the illness and how it is treated the auditor would like to be able to see what goal it is what ri what service fac etc when chaos reigns caused by misalignment of the psyche this is fascinating in its complexity and disillusioning in the simplicity of its cause the technology for handling the bank has finally been worked out it is complex it takes expert auditing and an educated pc but the result is an ot this is far higher result than was expected before 1962 to degree that it is unreal to most people at times it is even unreal to lrh even when the auditor and the pc have tremendous skill they can make huge mistakes for instance lrh has been looking for his pt gpm for months he has found seven so far each one thought to be the pt one he has been unburdening the track by running them as they were found he is aware of good case advance since starting out now his goals lists go for five or six items one rocketreading then it goes on by stacking it up putting the gpm on top of it listing in to the top oppterm to see if there was anything there to see if there was gpm closer to pt we handled four of them like they were old sacks of straw he finally got the pt gpm for the first time he looked forward and saw nothing there he woke up wondered if couple were backwards creak got his considerations creak this is far cry from few months ago when he was wrapped around telegraph pole with regularity you made the early gpms without having body so it is tough on bodies to run into ris etc it is nice to be outside not subject to the bodys intolerance of temperature extremes the problem lrh ends the year with is as an ot how do you drink cocacola it doesnt evaporate like liquor and lrh is too big to get into the bottle he thought of putting it in tub with ice if you have wondered whether you will ever make it all the way while you are making it all the way you will have many other periods when you will be certain that you will never make it all the way that is the greatest certainty that lrh can give you he has known many times that it was impossible for you to make it but he has recovered the final end product of scientology or of thetan in this universe has been achieved in 1963 whatever else can be said for the year indicators this is new subject routine 6 this is probably the procedure given in the last tape see hcopl 5may64 summary of classification and gradation and certification p 4 see also above for summary of this procedure cannot be run without knowledge of indicators and of the proper actions to do when certain things are present or not present indicators are present at every level there are good indicators and bad indicators to know about bad indicators you must know what good indicators are one needs to know both in order to have datum to compare with for instance you dont cut the pcs itsa because you want the good indicator of smooth needle and cheerful pc not because of fear of instructors in the field of saymusic one has some standards and expectations of how it should sound on hifi equipment etc that is the comparative datum the good indicator the standard test for hifi equipment is how should it sound poor hifi equipment sounds like you are in the lobby of the theater when the aisle doors are closed if you walk down the aisle to about the center of the theater and listen that is what good hifi equipment should sound like people watching lrhs auditing on demos have shown that they dont have standard to judge the session by lrh worked out good and bad indicators to make the standards known and explicit if you know what is right with session you can tell what is wrong with one good indicators people should be happy in session the only frame of mind that you can asis in is cheerful hightoned one the pc should be cheerfully itsaing to the auditor if he runs secondary he runs grief off of it and comes out of it etc we get picture of what the session should be with good indicators if they are not there then bad indicators are there these bad indicators should be handled so as to get the good indicators back gis mean that the auditor should continue what he is doing bis show that the auditor should so something else the particular bis that are present determine what the auditor must do eg if the pc makes critical remark about the auditor pull missed withhold do session arc break assessment or run ow how the pc should look and sound how the bank should respond how the meter should behave all these are the good indicators note that at levels v and vi the male and female clear reads longer apply since thetan doesnt have sex the time to do something about bad indicator is when you cant go on with good indicators not just whenever bad indicator shows up the broad range of optimum ta range is 20 to 40 the common range of ta excursion is 275 to 35 there are three grades of bad indicators light medium and heavy they compare to the suddenness with which you must take action 1 the light indicator shows you that something is wrong so that you can be alert for need for action but nothing necessarily needs to be done 2 on moderate bis action must be taken as soon as it can be comfortably done 3 on heavy bis emergency crash action must be taken right now an example of grade 3 bi would be the pc not wanting auditing 4 grade 4 bi would be something like car going over cliff you hear dwindling scream this pc is never going to be audited again gis mean expected not extraordinary wanting auditing is more common than you would expect it is gi we take for granted if lot of gis are present few bis dont matter too much an ordinary bi not vbi would be the fact that the pc has ptp you tend to it promptly since pc with ptp makes progress pc with an arc break gets worse with auditing so that is vvbi that is the only time that auditing worsens case so the gis are pc in session with ptp and arc break this is something that one should know for auditing supervision you cannot supervise by bis only by gis because when gis cease to exist your action must be directed towards recreating them not just at eradicating bis you could base your expectations of case progress on how many gis are present for every gi not present some bi is present do the appropriate thing to remove the bi and get the gi back know gis more by heart than bis since if there is bi you can always go to the textbook to figure it out for instance you notice that the pc keeps having ptps you eventually think of the datum that when the pc keeps having ptps his goals must be totally divergent from the auditors goals and the session itself becomes the ptp dont act whenbis are not present only correct what needs correction dont let win on repairing one pcs bis become the stable datum for all pcs who dont have the same bis this disposes of the idea that some pcs are auditable and others arent you are an auditor and the standard procedures on which you are being trained are the way in which you materialize gis in session they are all calculated to bring about gis in the pc the gains of auditing are astonishingly automatic these days you just audit the pc on standard program if bis pop up always take care of the worst one first naturally you want to get the heaviest bpc out of the way first and keep patching up the case only until you can get back on the road the gi on an auditing question is 1 the pc has received something to inspect 2 he inspects it 3 he tells you what he has inspected he answers the question fully as far as he is concerned 4 then you acknowledge it doesnt matter if you gave him one command and he inspected fully and took half an hour to answer or if you gave him many repetitive commands and he fully answered the question he is going through an electronic circuit and he comes out the other end free of it having inspected it if you cut his itsa along the way he gets lost in the middle of the labyrinth of electronic material this gives rise to dirty needle just keep the pc going with gis building his confidence and not cutting his itsa moving him along up the line6401c07 shspec2 good indicators some of the material in this tape is also contained in hcob 28dec63 routine vi indicators part one good indicators the good indicators listed in hcob 28dec63 dont all apply to all sessions but most do they dont just apply to r6 sessions for definition of r6 see above if you learn what good indicators are you can spot bad indicators an auditor tends to look for wrongnesses that is the nature of scientology because if there werent something wrong with man he wouldnt be here unlike other ologies we see an individual as basically good able and powerful this is the reverse of most peoples approach so the way have to improve man is also different we have tremendous evidence that our concept is true and that the opposite one is erroneous for instance we found that childrens iqs drop more and more the longer they spend in school because the longer they stay there the more false stable data get shoved down their throats truth is demonstrated by workability though some dispute truth because its workability challenges their favorite theories all present sciences have built up to their current state on the basis of workability the idea of deleting something in order to bring about recovery from bad condition is not new with us but the simplicity of asking someone for solutions that he has had to the condition is new departure you can ask what solutions and decisions person has had relative to his lumbosis and get recovery from deletion of additives this is all part of the idea that adding something to being makes him feel worse take being who is feeling blah when we put in midruds we are subtracting actions we are subtracting the livingness of some period and he will feel better lrh has made more extreme test of this theory he subtracted an insane beings body from him by exteriorizing him when exteriorized the being was immediately sane back in his body he was insane again this is not therapeutic it is just an experimental technique the good things of life are havingness at ones own choice the individuals power of choice is the only thing he had to begin with which gave him power capability etc that power of choice has been consistently and continually overthrown by giving him things he didnt want and taking away from him things that he did want someone who solves something and fixes the solution instead of just confronting the thing is putting himself down in power in scientology the only right we have to educate anyone is that we are teaching things that are as close to fact as they can be made and the technology of how it is put together is so close to how it is put together that it runs itself out this is the reason why scientology education doesnt have to usual bad effects of education scientology education runs itself out because it is so close to the truth whenever you have solution to problem it gets stuck except in the case of scientology scientology is the only solution in the universe that erases itself you can do almost anything with scientology because of this when scientology solves something it solves what has solved it its truths are shown to you so that you can reach other truths the data of scientology is so minor so sweet and so pure compared to all the other types of solutions gpms ris service facs electric shock treatment etc that we dont come under the heading of adding aberrative data to the individual as solution to his difficulties even if scientology data sits there for awhile on top of some aberration it will eventually reach through the thing on which it is sitting uproot it and the truth of the data will cause it to blow asis along with what it solved you are all sitting in some ri that could behave in this way an individual becomes aberrated by additives his experiences in this universe are calculated to degrade and depower him all you have to do is to pick up to asis the mess and you will return him to power if you handle his school education for example his iq will rise the data of scientology is restimulation of more basic and fundamental truths which restimulated tend to blow later data some people can just study scientology and leap out of bed well this adds up to the fact that man to date is an addedto being everything that hasbeen added to him has decreased his ability to cope we have gotten him dependent on tools and that sort of thing the more you give person to work with eg the more machines etc he is supposed to work with the less he works his ability to work is reduced by these additives primitive cultures with minimal tools work long and thoroughly to create aesthetic elements as part of ordinary workaday objects someone with lots of tools doesnt get much done for instance the esquimo with very simple tools elaborately decorates his spear whereas the person with drill presses lathes etc says i cant do this thing because i have to have that other thing first theres relationship between having to have and getting things done the more you have the less you tend to get done have to have becomes never do the fellow who has to have and have in order to get anything done does very little the chinese carpenter working with handmade fish bone dowels and bowdrill didnt have to have anything elaborate to drill hole etc yet he was able to get more done by good deal than his western counterpart with his elaborate tools you could have added to the universe of this chinese carpenter the postulate that you cant do without certain tools think about that wording to the point where he could longer do that is an aberrative side to some thetans bent for collecting havingness eg lrh and his cameras in collecting cameras he has paid less attention to any one of them so now he gets fewer pictures with more cameras there can be minimum amount of equipment needed to get job done but an overwhelmed being has to have and cant do the more you add to the workman the less he can accomplish because we are in the business of deleting wrongnesses from the individual we seldom look at rightnesses that is what is wrong with most auditors the recognition of the fact that truth is present to be amplified or increased is vital part of auditing if you dont notice the rightnesses present you dont see the truth present that can then be used to promote more truth so nothing gets done if you only recognize wrongnesses you wont be able to pull anything up gradient because you wont think that you have any rightnesses to work with our only purpose in finding wrongnesses is to increase rightnesses you have to look at wrongnesses to remedy them but you have to look at rightnesses to increase them progress is built on gradient scale of rightnesses by which you delete wrongnesses and they drop away processing is an action by which wrongnesses can be deleted from the case to the degree that rightness is present in the session you cannot take case that has rightnesses present and delete any wrongnesses auditing is the process of maintaining rightness so that you can delete wrongness you are trying to get right being if you dont continuously encourage right beingness you will never get right being to correct wrongness you have to have at least as much rightness present if rightness and wrongness are equally balanced it is dangerous situation you are better off if the rightnesses far outweigh the wrongnesses this will give you an easier job of auditing the pcs ability to asis is rightness of varying magnitude pc who is pretty overwhelmed cant handle or asis large wrongness if you delete good indicators from the session the pc wont be able to asis anything pcs ability to asis or erase in session is directly proportional to the number of good indicators present in the session and his inability to cope in the session rises proportionally to the number of bad indicators in the session if the good indicators have dropped out of the session the pcs ability to handle wrongnesses is much less you have got to get gis back in before you can expect the pc to handle what you want him to handle you have to retrograde the process to match the state of the pc if he becomes bis for instance you may have to run the pc on touch assist or havingness you must watch and if good indicator goes out you look for the bad indicator if you are slow find out what happened and correct it bad indicators dont necessarily appear when good indicators disappear they are separate breeds of cat the auditor must always find out what is wrong in session before the pc finds out that is how you maintain altitude to maintain optimal altitude handle the scene when the good indicator goes out but before the bad indicator comes in spotting the absence of good indicator and remedying the situation with remedy of appropriate magnitude will avoid the expense of auditing time on expensive repairs light indicator means that you should be alert medium indicator requires correction heavy indicator means emergency any process has its own series of bad indicators bad indicators come in when good indicators go out dont spend your time looking for badindicators just know the good indicators so well that when one of them goes out climb on and handle be alert but dont always be looking for wrongnesses good indicators in routine 6 and lower levels 1 pc cheerful in r6 misemotion is allowable at lower levels for instance the good indicator would be the pc getting more cheerful in r3r misemotion should be diminishing but at level vi the pc should be running like grinning idiot 2 pc cogniting this should happen sometimes on any level lack of cognition indicates that the pc has ptp or an arc break or that he is running at level above his reality at lower levels the good indicator would be the pc cogniting at level vi the pc should be cogniting on ris and goals 3 pcs items found are the ones that the pc thought they were at lower levels it often turns out that what the pc thought was wrong is what was wrong the pcs fundamental rightnesses assert themselves 4 at level vi pc listing items briefly and accurately at lower levels the good indicator is giving things to the auditor briefly and accurately the pc is finding things accurately and speedily 5 properlyreading meter at level vi items found are not rocketreading at lower levels things found give the proper meter responses 6 at level vi short item lists at lower levels it doesnt take long time to get things done 7 items found without lot of wrassle at lower level this translates as being able to get data from the pc without big hassle 8 ta continuing in motion ta not stuck this good indicator can be overridden by the good indicator of the pc easily and rapidly flattening processes 9 active needle the needle is fluid or fluent moving not stuck mark v meter can be set at too high sensitivity giving the appearance of more fluidlooking needle than you really have it moves around on the other hand you may need high sensitivity for pulling withholds etc where it doesnt matter if you clean clean once in awhile on the other hand if you leave the withhold by using too low sensitivity you have had it for r6 sensitivity 8 is maximum for listing and 16 for midruds you can have ta action with gummy needle watch for that this is still missing gi the needle should be swinging cleanly 10 pc not being troubled by pains and somatics when answering auditing questions or any somatic the pc runs into discharges very rapidly somatic that stays there and gets heavier is bad indicator you want change somatics 11 ta goes down when pc cognites you should get further blowdown of the ta when the pc talks about something 12 pc gets warm and stays warm in auditing or gets hot and unheats in auditing the pc doesnt get chilled getting chilled is bi 13 pcs somatics turn on occasionally this is gi at lower levels it is bi in r6 14 ta range 25 to 375 ta range 225 to 30 is excellent this applies at any level 15 good ta action on spotting things the expected ta action for any level is the best indicator16 getting reads on what you and the pc think is wrong 17 pc has ptp this is good indicator unless the pc is in total propitiation the bad indicator would be the pcs developing ptps about the session in session 18 pc satisfied after auditing and staying certain of the auditing solution 19 pc not critical or arc breaky always gis 20 pc happy and satisfied with the auditor regardless of what the auditor is doing 21 pc looking younger by reason of auditing this is not common but it is good indicator 22 pc without weariness 23 pc without aches pains or illnesses developed in auditing 24 pc wanting more auditing 25 pc confident and getting more confident 26 pcs itsa free but only extensive enough to cover the subject under discussion if the pcs itsa is too extensive he is trying to stop the auditor from auditing the pc should itsa but not too much 27 auditor understanding why it is the way it is when the pc explains it or how it was the way it was the pc is saying things that make sense the auditor should be able to understand the pc 28 pc there under his own volition taken from next tape if all these good indicators are present you know that you are doing good job6401c09 shspec3 bad indicators in trying to relay truth it is always necessary to break it down into system by which it can be communicated the system that breaks auditing down into basic auditing technique and case analysis is useful one see the tape 6 11c05 shspec321 three zones of auditing case analysis now breaks down into the general subjects 1 case analysis 2 good indicators 3 bad indicators case analysis consists of keeping continuous eye on the pcs indicators case analysis is 1 noting when the gis are still present 2 being alert and noting when one has dropped out 3 looking to see what bi has appeared 4 programming to remedy the bi with some appropriate technique actually there is shifting back and forth between technique and case analysis case analysis contains programming see the book of case remedies bad indicators include the fact that the pc is in body not an ot the corresponding good indicator would be that he is there of his own volition the first bad indicator is that the pc looks like he doesnt want to be in session anymore that is good indicator is gone namely the pcs being there of his own volition the bad indicator is unwillingness to be there that is our first hurdle free choice not there of his own volition that ends the case analysis the above is simple example of case analysis from there on it is matter of selecting process to fit the case level what technique to use to handle this bi depends on the level of the pc and the auditor so case analysis starts out with the observation that the expected indicator or behavior ie the natural behavior of being the good indicator has gone out good indicators are actually the natural behavior of being the world particularly since freud with his idea of the censor has been crashing along on this lie that inhibited behavior is social behavior and that any uninhibited behavior is antisocial so the criminal is uninhibited so you have to punish him and put him in cell and if you inhibit him enough you will make social being out of him actually superinhibition brings about social catastrophes if you cant fix behavior you can always inhibit it you are suppressing it though and thetans forward actions and desires do not fade away they only submerge impulses do not fade away they only submerge this is axiom 0 thetan never gives up trying to create an effect holding grudge is 11 characteristic eg henry viii got even with the pope by creating the church of england this gives you better understanding of people in general seeing what happens when impulses meet with inhibition people get even you will understand history teen agers criminals and everything lot better if you realize that thetan never really gives up this is the secret of behavior this is why teenagers so commonly reject their families the child never forgives the parents for certain things often tiny things you have to find the source of rejection or revolt auditing easily brings this to the fore the child rejects his parents toget even besides forgiveness per is propitiation the source of mans ingratitude and the secret of leadership is just the fact that thetan never gives up as an auditor you are just auditing all the nutty aberrated inhibited times when the pc never gave up when he postulated something silly when he tried to do something stupid you can actually graph how some innocent goal or impulse goes through this process of degradation 1 it becomes inhibited submerged and warped 2 it emerges at lower level as an overt 3 below that it emerges as withhold you could graph that on any ambition 4 below that is unawareness which submerges down to 5 unconsciousness 6 humanoid that is how goal becomes an overt withhold unawareness unconsciousness and below that humanoid so when being comes in for auditing his being there of his own volition is the biggest good indicator there is he is surrounded by bad indicators which you are going to eradicate the hope factor is put in by validating whatever good indicators are present the next best indicator is that the pc is getting better betterness to us means less present in the sense of my ankle is getting better the pain confusion etc is less present betterment is the lessening of bad condition so the pc getting better wrongnesses less present is good indicator this is negative gain if all you did in session were to validate the good indicators that were present and attack and handle one by one the bad indicators that were present thereby restoring more good indicators you would get amazing results you would be enormously successful the pc would approach native state dont try to train or audit someone against his own volition assuming that you have tried and failed to change his mind it is bad indicator all you need to be able to do is to spot gis and when gis are not present to spot the bad indicator that is present and to go ahead and handle it if case goes on talking about something he hasnt gotten rid of it and you havent yet achieved negative gain in the area all your lowerlevel gains are based on destimulation and removal of bis progress on case is measured by the number of gis that you are restoring this applies to level iv or below note that this is the precursor of grades auditing bad indicator 1 pc nervous about auditing level 0 at the lowest levels you assume that the pc is not there on his own determinism and work on fixing this up you want to have pc who is not nervous about getting auditing at level 0 discuss scientology with him let him know what it is about try to get him there under his own determinism get him to decide level i discuss auditing healing therapies etc get his ideas about these things reassure the pc that you are not auditing him to make him guilty you are only concerned with making the able more able get what others ideas or opinions are about treatment and what it might do to him try to cope with the pc intellectually get into general discussion of his being audited level ii here you could run repetitive process which could go as follows what have you had to do which you didnt want to do or what orders have you had to follow about your health general ow would also be runnable at this level level iii pull missed withholds on auditing past auditing or treatment prepcheck any of those or something like on auditing goals or on being forced to be audited you could run r2h now renamed r3h you could do arc break assessments or find the pcs basic ideas about being audited how he originally felt about it level iv here youve got service facs arc breaks with auditors practitioners arc breaks that the pc has had in past processing etc etc at level iv we can find one session that the persondidnt want in the past because of withhold or something that would be key point to knock out of the way you could run how would refusing to be audited make you rightothers wrong why shouldnt you be audited is crude but workable process at this level bad indicator 2 pc unfriendly or cool towards the auditor unappreciative of the auditor or auditing this opens the door to large area of withholds overts cut comm cut itsa etc you can run out of itsa by specializing in solutions only not problems even though the ta motion comes from solutions thus you sacrifice some present ta motion for greater amount of future ta motion you could spend fifty percent of your time on problems and fifty percent on solutions and get more ta by not running out of itsa it is fiftyfifty proposition this is because gpms are fifty percent terminals fixed solutions and fifty percent oppterms fixed problems both give good ta unfriendliness to the auditor could stem from the auditors keeping the pc from itsaing as area of interest including problems you must get into problems somewhat so that the pc has something to talk about at all the pc will get unfriendly if the auditor never gives him anything to talk about level 0 get the pc to discuss what damage the auditor might do to him or her this is lousy solution since it asks for more critical but it is better than nothing get the pc to explain why he shouldnt be audited this can get him quite friendly and right into session level i another lowlevel remedy would be how could you help this raises the arc of the pc you could also get the pc to explain any trouble he has gotten into by imparting confidences or talking too freely that also gets off few missed withholds you could use what are you willing to talk to about level ii you could use similar processes here as well as general ow on auditors level iii you could pull withholds missed by auditors you could prepcheck auditors practitioners help or failed help as indicated level iv you work on help and failed help on service fac basis using if you were really helped by auditing how would that make you wrong if you werent helped by auditing how would that make you right when pcs at levels v vi and vii are unfriendly to auditors there is some foulup in the root of the bank bad indicator 3 pc nervous about being audited in particular auditing room thats the auditing environment these things always run down to some horrendous ptp or arc break level 0 discuss the dangerousness of the environment level i discuss dangerous environments in general the trouble he has had in auditing rooms in practitioners rooms get solutions off how he has solved it level ii finding things that are safe level iii havingness level iv get associative restimulators here is suggested exercise make list of bad indicators that could be present if homo sapiens were dragged in chains into your auditing room then figure out what you might be able to do about these things given enough time perhaps over course of months you should be able to turn him into highflying pc by1 seeing good indicator missing 2 noting all the bad indicators 3 selecting the one that is most in the road of auditing 4 eradicating that one first 5 continue handling the bis one by one by getting considerations off etc until more bis are present using this procedure you could get anyone matter how initially hostile he was to want auditing on his own determinism and not by overwhelming him auditing is converting bis to gis as you work the case remember that the person has had some impulses somewhere along the line that got inhibited and submerged handling those by getting back to them will give

been researching r6 see p 568 above during january on the theory that it is better for him to get the body knocked off than for the rest of you to get it r6 is incredibly complex but totally necessary you need very smooth basic auditing in order to make r6 work selfcriticism simply means taping your session listening to it and spotting what needs improvement one gets amazing responses to the question what happened in the session selfcriticism of auditing is vital from level iii on up the deeper you go into case the more reach the processes have the more nearly perfect your basic auditing must be flubs impinge to the same degree that the auditing does at levels 0 and i the auditor isnt impinging very much hence his flubs dont impinge much either at level ii with repetitive processing there is more impingement and less tolerance of flubs at level iii you are using the meter to reach deeper than the pcs unaided itsa here we have moved into an area where we can get hold of things that the pc wasnt ready to give there is more impingement so the auditing must be better since the flubs impinge more too the greater the charge you are dealing with the greater the bypassed charge can be the meter mines subitsa it increases the impingement of processing there is one thing that always happens when you run somebody above his level and get him into areas that he finds hard to confront you will get more bpc and arc breaky sessions the level of impingement of an error is greater than pc can tolerate when the pc is audited above his level so up to level iv the best handling of an arc breaky pc is to reduce his level this certainly doesnt apply at levels v and vi where the bpc comes from wrong goal wrong item or whatever at these upper levels reducing the pcs level will just leave the wrongness and the pc will go into sad effect if you give person wrong goal he will dramatize it more than the right goal this happens consistently in psychoanalysis the only thing you get off psychoanalyzed pc is psychoanalytic computations bunch of bunk invented items wrong goal doesnt as is it beefs up find the persons right goal and he will dramatize is less which makes somewhat goofy test for rightness of goal person tends to dramatize validated error more than genuine aberration someone who has had errors validated also tends to be very careful all the time this comes from some old advice he got you can find the error by finding out what the person is being careful of if you scan someone through his psychoanalysis you will turn on all his old symptoms if you keep it up they will turn off by erasure analysis cured its patients by inventing new evils the id etc it is an alteris negative itsa then analyse and examine things that never existed an auditor can wrongly date somatic then later auditor can date that somatic getting the same wrong date and he can in fact get some improvement of the somatic by getting off some of the charge of the somatics being wrongly dated but he may be deceived into thinking that he has the right date person dramatizes validated error more than an actual aberration that has been contacted if you find that the pc is selling something to you do case analysis 1 find out where he got the idea where he is sitting 2 get his considerations off 3 find out where it really is or whether it is really true the reason why one attacks process errors in upper level processes instead of since midruds is that everything that happened between sessions is sitting on top of the r6 error and it is much quicker to find and correct the error than to do the midruds at level iv you are dealing with service facs assessments etc the pc has to be able to spot and asis his own wrongnesses and overts by that time by level v auditor errors impinge and any piece of bpc left lying around will get restimulated at level vi the amount ofcharge you are handling ri by ri is huge and ferocious now that the precisely correct commands have been formulated you have gotten away from some arc breaks but if the auditor fails to clear the command it can act as giving the pc wrong goal or item or if the auditor fails to understand what the pc said you can get immense arc breaks for instance the pc said the second ri from the bottom the auditor thought it was the seventh ri that the pc was talking about he asks about the seventh ri to repair it the pc has huge arc break new demands are placed on ones basic auditing as one moves up to higher levels so as he moves up the levels this can make the auditor feel as though he is auditing terribly the division into levels is primarily based on what is demanded of the pc and secondarily on what is demanded of the auditor but the two are almost parallel it is not possible to selfaudit r6 r6 requires the impingement of an auditor calling the items to get the charge off there is point where person becomes total cause over his own mind up to that point an auditor is necessary if you have an arc breaky session you can straighten it out by running ow on the auditor to yourself you are in perfect order to use assisttype processes on your own mind but solo auditing doesnt produce ta action because of the twoterminal nature of the universe in this universe one terminal all by itself is inert thetan has become so enmeshed in this universe that he has taken the physical universe laws to apply to himself there are two things that chain thetan down 1 mass including space energy and time 2 significance since 1950 we have known that someone could either dramatize nuttiness physically or in thought the mass gives you somatics and the significance makes you think that you are nuts gpm contains both thought and mass when you get the right mass and significance aligned with other masses and significances it vanishes amazingly enough as the thetan stops creating it it doesnt dissipate into energy although you do get heat it vanishes as create without fireworks if you keep changing only thought and not mass you cannot make change in someones condition you cant handle the mass which is causing eg an illness the levels are approaching the gpm by cleaning up charge on all the locks and ramifications that are hung up on gpms the levels are familiarization with what could blow your head off at the very least the levels familiarize the pc with heavy somatics the auditing cycle is the basic discovery of dianetics and scientology all the way from level 0 to level vi you are using the same auditing cycle this is twopole universe and without an auditor or if you dont use the auditing cycle properly you dont get ta action adequate to case resolution in comm courses the comm cycle does things to people all by itself it is so powerful that by itself it produces results the auditor should recognize it as his main tool it has to be as polished as you have charge that can be bypassed on the case it has to be better and better as the auditor audits higher and higher levels the auditors auditing must be adequate to the level he is running his handling of the auditing cycle is the only thing which is creating tone arm action only somewhere in level vii does the auditing cycle cease to be necessary if you havent got an auditor you dont have ta action if you havent got enough charge off your case you wont be able to do anything with it if an auditor is aware that his handling of the auditing cycle is the only thing that gets charge off the pcs case because the auditing comm cycle is what makes him an auditor then he also knows that his auditing comm cycle must be adequate for the level he is auditing auditor selfcriticism allows him to see whether it is adequate you have tendency to overcomplicate the auditing comm cycle for the level you are running tr2 is the most important if not the only important tr for raw pc since ifyou can let someone know that you have heard him that you have really received his comm you could get big result the other trs have to come in as the pc progresses up the levels here is the auditor selfcriticism procedure 1 do normal session 2 record it you should have 1 12 hours of tape with the voices well discernable this is because the auditors error is always earlier than rough spot in the session so you want to be able to listen to good stretch of time 3 as the session goes forward the auditor notes bis in session very carefully meter misbehavior any criticism by the pc dirty needles any worry etc 4 after the session the auditor notices in the session record when in the session the bis dn etc appeared 5 listen to that area 6 go backwards bit by bit few inches at time to find the breakdown of basic auditing that caused the bi or dn this should be few minutes or seconds earlier 7 find what the auditor failed to communicate or carry out 8 do that with every rough spot every noted bi if you follow this procedure you will find the errors and see that you didnt get away with the breakdowns in your auditing cycle although at the time you may have thought that you did you will find that if the pc snaps or snarls there is rough auditing comm cycle just before that pc never has reaction in the session independent of the auditor anything that happens in session good or bad happens with the auditor as cause the auditor is the source of the session 100 lrh found that as he moved up in levels of auditing his auditing had to improve so other auditors can improve too knowing what is wrong one can put it right both with ones auditing cycle and with the pc at the time before the arc break hits youre as good an auditor as you can handle the communication cycle and you are as skilled an auditor as you can choose the right process to put onto the auditing comm cycle6402c06 shspec5 comm cycle in auditing the magic of communication is all that makes auditing work if you sat down at onehand electrode emeter you would be amazed at this fact you would get tone arm motion beyond perhaps brief residual flurry at the very start with another auditor you would get 175 ta divisions with yourself you would get two it works this way because the thetan in this universe has begun to consider himself mass so he is subject to the laws of physics consequently he cant asis much mass he has to have second terminal to discharge the mass or energy against if an auditor thinks he is mest he is apt to get the condition of the pc because he mocks up or envisions the pcs charge in himself making himself matched terminal but that is not what makes auditing work it is all consideration backflow actually hits the auditor the ability to hold position in space or to hold two terminals apart is definition of power in the auditing situation there is an apparent exchange of energy from the pcs point of view which doesnt hit the auditor but because thetans think of themselves as terminals you get an exchange of energy going on nothing hits the auditor and it asises as far as the pc is concerned but you have set up twopole system and that will bring about an asising of mass it isnt burning the mass it is asising the mass that is why there is nothing hitting the auditor the magic of auditing is contained in the comm cycle of auditing you are concerned with the smooth interchange between these two poles which is necessary for as long as the pc considers himself to be matter and therefore considers that he must discharge against something eventually the pc will get up to point where he longer considers himself matter when lot half of the bank is gone the meter will longer read on sneeze when pc cognites that he is not mest the auditor cant knock any energy off and the meter goes dead running r6 the meter only reacts when the pc decides what something is you have to ask the pc if that is it when the pc looks and decides if that is it or not only then does the meter read the pc is advancing away from the automatic physical energy manifestations of the physical universe you get to point where you have intention gpm is just method of limiting the persons ability to intend that is the whole idea behind implanting to foul up intention by fixing it so that every time thetan intends positive he gets negative and vice versa so he cant decide if you talk to person and every time he says yes you say he will get to an indecisional state of mind where he can longer intend yes fully this wears him down it breaks his spirit this is the whole idea behind implanting to get being unable to effectively intend or determine anything successfully he intends to write but something is intending that he not write therefore he cant write all ideas of power of choice selfdeterminism etc stem from the ability to intend something the more enmested someone is the more trouble they have with intention with the twopole arrangement person can be influenced without his knowledge the difficulties of auditing are just the difficulties of the comm cycle you can hit the parts of the comm cycle as buttons the auditor must permit smooth flow between himself and the pc if matter is to be asised by the pc using the comm cycle when you dont permit smooth flow between yourself and the pc as terminals you get noasising of matter part of the trick is knowing what has to be asised but that is matter of technique if the auditor is capable of getting the pc to be willing to talk to him he wouldnt have to hit particular button in order to get ta action basic auditing and the comm cycle is senior to the technique the fundamental entrance to the case is not in tech but in the comm cycle in case supervision you can look at the points of the comm cycle that are missing in the pcs case and heal those points up there can be the comm cycle between the pc and the auditor and between the pc and the auditing room you can address the pcs comm between himself and the environment by looking at what he is worried about with an unconscious person pick up his hand and have him touch the pillow your arm etc giving the command at the same time you are just getting him in comm with the auditor and his surroundings but now you are into techniquecommunication is simply familiarization process based on reach and withdraw when the auditor speaks to the pc he is reaching when he ceases to speak he is withdrawing when the pc hears you he is bit withdrawn he reaches towards you with the answer he is in withdraw as he looks for the answer he reaches the answer and reaches the auditor it is communication exchange that asises energy and registers on the emeter meter action occurs in the absence of that exchange namely the comm cycle if the comm cycle isnt in the pc selfaudits and you get case gain and ta that is the fundamental discovery of dianetics and scientology it is so simple that everyone has overlooked it because mest is very complex stuff being composed of atoms molecules wavelengths etc it is so complex that nobody can understand it people who are ploughed into matter who think as matter think very complexly they cannot observe the simplest things with which they are confronted they observe none of this the ease with which you can handle comm cycle depends on your ability to observe what the pc is doing your inspection of what you are doing should have ended with your training now all observation should focus on the pc the comm cycle you watch is the pcs the true touch of genius that makes an auditor that can crack any case is the auditors ability to observe the comm cycle of the pc and repair its various lacks this consists of asking question that the pc can answer observing that the pc has completed the answer to it acknowledging the pc and then giving the pc something else to do that is the auditing comm cycle see also p 450 above for an illustration this includes clearing the auditing command so that the pc can answer the question ask the question in such way that the pc can hear it and know whether the pc is answering that question you can tell when the pc is finishedit is piece of knowingness an instinct you should know without having to ask the pc if he is finished then knowing that he is finished you use the acknowledgment to tell him that he has said it using only the right amount of stop to stop that cycle not the whole session then you give him something else to answer when you dont see when he is finished and therefore fail to acknowledge he thinks he is not done and looks for more he even takes up humming if you dont give him something else to answer he will go on automatic he will selfaudit with ta action the degree of lack of ta action measures the degree of selfaudit that the pc is indulging in get your comm cycle good enough so that you dont have to pay attention to it and give your attention to the comm cycles of the pc spend your basic auditing doing nothing but repairing the basic communication inabilities of the pc and you will be genius you will crack 99 of the cases that walk in for instance the case that goes on and on with his comm you may think that you are acknowledging him but he never gets it it is up to you to get that communication acknowledged so he knows that it is heard or take the pc who takes twenty minutes to answer the auditing question and then in that answering doesnt answer it the very smart auditor knows that he would have to do three processes because 1 the pc cannot have an auditing question he didnt answer it so he never got it this gives you the first process what auditing question wouldnt you mind beingshould you be asked 2 since he cant have auditing he is wasting it so after you have comm line going you can run wasting auditing run it as concept since you cant expect such case to recall anything you could use get the idea of you wasting auditing or what could you do here that would waste auditing or what could an auditor do here that would waste auditing and maybe get him to waste communication elementary havingness is the ability to do 3 run who would i have to be to audit you 4 after that perhaps you could work on his memory you would see the whole case change take pc who is sitting there not saying anything find what the pc is doing and dream up something accordingly eg what could you say to you get long comm lag then he says something build it up until youve got him in communication with you then inspect therest of his comm cycle for other wrongnesses maybe now you have to find out whether he can have an auditor it is what the pc isnt doing that the auditor might be able to get him to do that determines the auditing question if you are alert you will see these little disabilities showing up for instance someone stammers obviously he is having trouble communicating dont ask the pc to do things the pc cant do for instance the auditor asks from where could you view catfish the pc says uh im sorry ive never viewed any catfish the auditor has asked the pc question he couldnt answer he is guilty of not having cleared the question clear questions beforehand to make sure the pc can do it before asking it always respect the pcs saying that there arent any more answers otherwise you give the pc loses your entrance point to the case is where the pc breaks down in his comm cycle with the auditor and with the environment for instance if the pc cant look at the auditor you could run if you looked over here what would or might you see these are the ways you crack cases there are tons of processes that you could use suppose you are running scs on pc who you find cant stand still dont ignore the disability take something else to remedy it eg stand stilldont stand still which gets rid of automaticities if the pc knows that he has the disability he can itsa about it because it is real to him but often what the person is worried about is not what he is bugged with you could still trigger the bank and run it out on an automaticity as in dianetics but then you would get pc who gets better and doesnt know about it pcs will run off total automaticity of what is wrong with them and they wont even listen to themselves talk an auditing session is highly artificial but it is only artificial because it approximates to such harsh staggering reality the exact points of contact with beings and existence like lycoming engine in model t ford auditing highlights the exact important points of communication here is capsule version of what is wrong with the mind the only thing really wrong with people is that they have withdrawn from communicating the individual has gone out of contact he has stopped looking the last time he looked there were three sabretooth tigers ready to bite him of course he believes that there are still three sabretooth tigers there he does this throughout enough trilennia and hes got an awful big stack of tigers all of which have left but he doesnt know this fact he cant be sure that they have left person who withdraws from contact with tigers all the time and refuses to contact the area doesnt see whether the tiger is still there or not but keeps mocking it up just to be sure the tigers actually are gone but this individual is in condition of total withdrawal he is safeguarded with automatic bank with automatic beingness valence stands where he ought to be total withdrawal is capsule summary of aberration thetan has as his remedy for safety shortening his reach when he gets to the point of zero reach he inverts it into an inverted withdrawal and you get the cycle of the dynamics coming on down he comes away from actual reach to zero reach but he still has to reach so he figures out some other way to reach zero of what he is doing always has remedy that is lower so you can get an inversion of an inversion of an inversion of withdrawal this shows up in an auditing session right away in the pcs inability to talk to the auditor about pertinencies so you must remedy his communication by reaching him in order to get him to reach with person who is on compulsive outflow you have to get him there before you can run anything eg by touch that chair you have to have session before you can have technique this is how to get one you use observe and remedy the communication cycle and after you have remedied it notice that it has been remedied note that the pc is now able to communicate with the auditor and notice what else needs to be done sometimes the remedy of the outpoint happens so fast that you are astonished dont overrun it if things are going all right dont remedy them if things are going all wrong find what you can fix up and fix it up if the pc is fully in session you can run almost anything and he will sail but technique by itself will put the pc in session the auditor has to do it6402c25 shspec6 what auditing is and what it isnt lrh is the first survivor of the battle of the goals plot gpms contain trickery and treachery that is why one hitherto has figured them out routine 3 didnt bite deep even running oppose didnt get much depth of bite when you move it into solve you are beginning to get into dangerous areas the tiger can bite your head off but you cant get back at him in r6 you are handling pure starving tigers for definition of r6 see p 568 above someone who could handle the oppose line easily will find enough aberration to make powerful being unpowerful on the actual gpm line quantitatively and qualitatively the data of this lecture is valuable at all levels but it is vital at levels v and vi it is so simple that you may think that there is nothing there to grasp there is also confusion that blows off as one attempts to grasp it the following is pure piece of data that is incredibly difficult to tr3 over to somebody i am going to tell you 1 the difference between auditing and assessing 2 the difference between destimulating and erasing 3 the difference between ptp and an arc break 4 the targets of the auditor which are the pc b the bank the auditor speaks either to the pc or to the bank auditing and the auditing cycle is addressed to the pc assessing is addressed to the bank when the auditor talks to the pc he often restimulates the bank he has an influence on it but he is still talking to the pc sometimes during an assessment the pc talks and the auditor must acknowledge the origination but these are separate actions auditing has only two products destimulation and erasure see also pp 486487 above for illustrations of destimulation and erasure or discharge you can get the pc out of it or you can use the pc to wipe it out the first is destimulation the second is erasure destimulation gets the dogs that are barking at the pc to lie down and be quiet and the pc to come away from there auditing wipes out the dogs dont try to erase ptp that requires auditing and ptps prevent auditing you destimulate ptps so that you can audit you can get the pc to dust himself off destimulation or you can use the pc like an ink eraser erasure some auditors specialize in trying to erase everything but never really get anything erased it is ok to erase anything as long as you complete your cycles of action but the lower levels of auditing are practically all destimulation not erasure if an auditor cant destimulate pc he can never take up his own cycle of action because the pcs restimulation takes charge if the pc is elsewhere when you start the session and the cycle of action you will never complete the cycle of action that you start destimulation is the only action that you can undertake to get pc located and oriented dont try to audit when all you should or can be doing is destimulation where did it happen where are you now is destimulation so is prepcheck since an auditor cant complete his cycle of action unless he first destimulates the pc destimulation is very important skill running engrams ris implant gpms etc are all erasure even in destimulation tiny amount of erasure takes place just the pcs attention on the subject for short time brings about erasure of bit of it the fact that certain amount of the incident runs out during destimulation is shown by the fact that pc experiences somatics during assists we just hit the keyin and erase that you can also destimulate something and then run out the incident you could use effort processing or run the engram cf running locks secondaries and engrams on subjects if you do this though complete the cycle of destimulating first or you will leave some attention stuck onwhat you were destimulating which in the course of destimulating you also restimulated somewhat not completing the destimulation cycle will make it that much harder to erase what you wanted to erase you dont want the pc to come out of destimulation attempt involving mata hari with his feet still all tangled up in silk stockings and old german documents complete cycles of actions once started if you start to erase something erase it dont abandon it in order to go erasing something else in level vi ideally when you get gpm you erase it this is complicated by the fact that that gpm is connected to the one above it and the one below it but you could erase the middle in practice you consider the whole first series of goals one action and erase that or half the first series then the rest of it see below for an explanation of the goals series the heart of certainty is arrival at the end of cycle of action the anatomy of uncertainty is failure to complete cycle of action rapid methods of destimulation are necessary for instance sincemidruds are needed to keep incipient bpc cleaned up and out of the road for the rest of the session life is restimulative the purpose of ruds is destimulation when the pc brings up something that is not in the auditors main line of action the auditor destimulates it and goes back to his main action case analysis is the tech that destimulates unwanted resurgences of case its purpose is handling ptps as they arise the activity of figuring out where gpms fit which has been called case analysis we now call track analysis case analysis is widelevel activity that can be used at any level it is just finding what the pc is sitting in and getting his considerations so while you are working on one gpm if the pc gets his attention on another one destimulate it with case analysis and go back to the first action otherwise leaving him stuck in one mass you let him go to another mass and he will get overrestimulated the rule applies to all levels make up your mind about what you are doing and complete your cycle of action what is auditing auditing is the action of asking pc question which he can understand and answer getting an answer to that question and acknowledging him for that answer and then also when the person originates auditing involves understanding and handling that origination that is all auditing is it is tr0 1 2 3 and 4 when that occurs ta action occurs and sanity occurs auditing is not assessing auditing may have the purpose of making someone feel better but that has nothing to do with the definition of auditing or with what auditing is the fact that someone feels better after an assessment does not mean that it was auditing therefore from the above definition you cant have selfauditing the technique is scientology but auditing is this one action if you understand the above to apply to all auditing you will be fantastic as an auditor you will find gold at the end of the rainbow nothing is very difficult about getting result if you just do what is in that definition what makes the pc better is not the technique you use it is simply the auditing comm cycle auditing is cycle of action and that twoterminal aspect which is what this physical universe consists of is what gives you tone arm action and is what makes pc better its not technique that makes pc better and it never will be auditing is the carrier wave that handles anything and everything for the pc there is another activity an auditor can do besides auditing assessment auditing goes mainly to the pc assessment never goes to pc it goes to the bank therefore by definition it is not auditing you can never assess pc who thinks that he is being addressed if you are trying to assess and the pc is trying to communicate with you or if he thinks that you are trying to communicate with him you will get messed up when the auditing cycle is out assessment cannot occur in that the pc hasnt understood that it is not an auditing cycle that he is engaged in and he cant just sit there and be assessed he is nervous and restimulated and his mind is darting all over the place even so if you ask the question just where the mind is it reads through all his mental busy workr2h is not really an assessment even though you go down prepared list because you are really asking the pc those questions and setting up 2wc about things that have occurred in the comm cycle if pc gets arc broken during an assessment it is because he has originated something which you havent acknowledged he does not get arc broken because you are assessing sometimes you sandwich auditing in with the assessment but they are still two separate activities the ta action that you get when you find an actual ri occurs when you have an auditing cycle going it does not occur without the auditing cycle an assessment even of correct ri is not what gives ta action it is the auditing comm cycle that gives ta that is why when you ask is that your item you get ta action in the form of big blowdown it is not because the pc contacts the item he is already in the middle of it so on solo auditing the pc would get needle actions but not ta action assessment doesnt give you ta action an arc break assessment is given when the pc has an arc break this assessment list has other uses but the arc break assessment simply consists of assessing the list getting the read and indicating it to the pc during an arc break you must not audit an arc break is when the auditing comm cycle cannot take place it isnt anything else the pc is upset and accusative he wont talk to you if you force comm cycle at that time you will only deepen the arc break at that point you do nothing else but an arc break assessment when you have real arc break you assess it always know your tools so that you can do the right assessment whether it be session arc break or an arc break from the particular action that you are on as long as you are addressing with auditing an area of disability in the pc you will get tahubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 1 march 1964 cenocon meter reads size of it occasionally comes to my attention that auditors entering classes v and vi do not believe meter can be made to read big they settle for ticks tiny falls etc of the sort that can be found usually in getting mid ruds in in all auditing up to class v the usual meter needle read is around an eighth to quarter of an inch long at sensitivity 16 the mark v is designed to give good serviceable reads for the lower classes of auditing and is quite wonderful at it but the moment you enter the wide vistas of class v the whole character of meter needle behaviour changes you go from tiny read to big read in classes v and vi tiny reads are used only for mid ruds as they were in lower levels but in all work in goals case analysis plotting finding items checking things out etc reads are enormous new horizon of metering dawns and an auditor coming up through the lower levels entering class v and vi work just doesnt believe it most of his early mistakes in checking out goals or finding the wrongnesses are entirely based on this he thinks tiny read is enough and he uses it whereas he really must never use small read for this work if goal is real gpm it will read with great intermittent inconsistent slashes if an analysis of situation is brought to the right answer the meter needle falls hugely the trouble is that the auditor just doesnt press on looking for the right answer and settles for ticksbecause he cant think up the right combination the right combination gpm or lock on an implant will send the needle racing all mistakes on goals or situations in classes v and vi can be traced to failure to appreciate that metering is different at these levels the sensitivity at class vi has to be kept around 4 you only use sensitivity 8 or 16 to get in since mid ruds on all r6 work you shut the meter down you cant keep the needle at set if you use sensitivity higher than 4 heres class v or vi student fiasco based on using class iii expected meter behaviour on high level work auditor finds goal on list that ticks 18 asks if its the correctly worded goal gets tick 116 runs it on the pc pc collapses heres the real way it should have been auditor finds goal on list that only ticks gets in suppress and invalidate on the list renulls finds another goal gets in suppress on it gets third of dial instant slash all goals and items must instant read checks it out until he gets 3 prior slash on actual gpm gets 2 slightly latent or prior slash on correctly worded gives it to the pc and pc thrives its not asking the right question what it really is that gives you ticks in fact tick with sharp edge at class v or vi really means wrong question asked big reads are the only reads you buy at class v and vi learn the right questions to ask about the character or nature of what youre examining and you get the big falls rrs etc so its lack of knowledge of track analysis that makes the auditor fall back on small reads and hell fail the second stage of desperation enters at class v and vi when the student hammered by the instructors still cant get big reads through lack of knowledge of the track and what things can be the student then abandons all he knew about body motion causing needle reaction the quickly exhaled breath the shuffled feet the can fling about the stretch the can bang all cause big surges so the auditor encourages the pc to shout goals and items or fling himself about so the meter will react big this of course will spin the pc getting charge off running wrong goals and ris by the time the student auditor is trained not to take body motion shout or breath reads his track analysis has also improved and he starts to ask the right questions and gets his big reads with the pc quiet as lamb i never touch ta during the pcs body movement this loses ta of course since pc is most likely to move when an ri starts to discharge i never buy goal unless ive seen it instant read bang on the last letter i never ask the character of anything to instant read ie is this an implant gpm because it may go on anticipate or arrive latent and do i get ta on the pc in goals finding and plotting you dont expect much ta yet in six consecutive sessions i built ta few divisions more per session from 70 ta down divisions to 103 ta down divisions in 2l2 hour session and all by never buying tick only big rrs or falls gradual build of ta shows all is well so classes v and vi are not only big read classes but they are big ta classes as well as you are handling the basic sources of charge on case in classes v and vi you expect big meter behaviour and you get it only ignorance of the track keeps the auditor in the small read small ta departments if you keep on trying to get what it really is until you have it you will always see big read on what it is you wouldnt expect to handle high voltage wires with tiny sparks you would expect huge arcs to crackle similarly with the materials of classes v and vi if you dont believe meter will read big at classes v and vi then you havent learned yet to find the right things and ask the right questions and if you settle for ticks or have to make the pc yell items to get big reads youll soon have very messed up case on your hands so its different meter behaviour at the higher classes expect it look for it and make it read lrhdrbh l ron hubbard copyright 1964 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6403c03 shspec7 auditing and assessment the most complete body of knowledge there is is at class vi it took fantastic amounts of auditing to get it and codify it fortunately it is codified unlike other levels for instance prehav levels are mostly items out of actual gpms or locks thereon you are used to regarding assessment as something you use to find something to audit more recently you have regarded assessment also as way to find the source of an arc break assessment is an activity which is totally independent of auditing as you move up from class iv you find that assessment commingles with auditing arc breaks can occur because of the auditors failure to recognize the difference between assessment and auditing and failing to shift his gears from one to the other or schizophrenically trying to do both at the same time you must keep them separate for instance if the pc originates during your assessment you must instantly shift into an auditing cycle to handle it then you return to the assessment assessment is addressed to the pcs bank it is not addressed to the pc when auditing occurs during the assessment it is because the pc got restimulated by something assessed so the pc is now in need of an auditor to duplicate it so that it can asis the auditor must really understand duplicate and acknowledge so that the pc knows that he has been understood all bad assessing where the meter isnt operating properly comes about because the auditor cant shift gears smoothly and rapidly enough between auditing and assessing an auditor can get the idea that assessment is impossible if he has made mistakes in assessing that resulted in the needle tightening up the failure in this case is really an auditing failure eg the auditors inadvertent question of the pc is it all right if we assess this list an auditing question since it has not been fully handled will now get in the way of successful assessment in some cases the question went to the pc an analytical being the pc now expects to answer he may also be insufficiently indoctrinated not to think that he should answer the assessment questions too but if you dont complete the question cycle you tend to direct the rest of the assessment at the pc not the bank now the pc feels as though he should be answering each item assessed you will be assessing through the pcs withheld comm when the auditor starts to assess many pcs go on an automatically withholding state of mind they got into this state of mind because the auditor disobeyed certain tenets eg the rule that when you ask the pc question before you assess you should be sure that the pc has answered it to his satisfaction and that he gets acknowledged and that everything is handled first before you start the assessment and when you have assessed and have gotten an item and you ask the pc is that your item this is an auditing question which may take awhile for the pc to answer you have just put him into the middle of his longstanding whirlpool so dont be amazed if it takes awhile for him to complete the cycle he could be going yeah yeah thats why etc etc etc without having answered the question is it your item assessment must never interrupt the auditing cycle but the auditing cycle may at any time interrupt the assessment therefore the auditing cycle is the senior action that doesnt mean that you necessarily spend more time auditing than assessing in any given session especially in r6 auditing is senior because auditing errors can wreck assessment the auditor has two lines going out one to the pc and one to the bank when these lines cross you get sparks in assessing you might use the form is it which has the form of question but dont expect an answer during the assessment there is one home in the bank dont fool around with entities using questions in assessments can bother pc sometimes it works better to use statements so as not to make the pc think that he should answer you wont get any reaction from the bank if the pc intervenes but you dont want the pc on withhold or decision not to be involved or something that gets in the way the pc has to sit there with his ruds in and cooperative assistance and in good comm with the auditor if his bank is to be addressed keep in comm and keep your cycles complete ifthe pc is in good comm with the auditor you can then address the bank easily therefore the way to put yourself in good comm with the bank is to put yourself in comm with the pc but the pc being in good comm doesnt have to mean that the pc is talking the auditors who assess pcs well are those who are in good comm with the pcs repairing assessments when what is wrong is outcomm will make things far worse it invalidates things found on assessment etc if assessment goes out repair the comm cycle dont just look for bpc in general clean up the comm cycle on any case there is always bpc to be found that doesnt mean that you should spend much time looking for it you could spent lot of time trying to clean the question have i misassigned the bypassed charge because the read you would keep getting is from your assigning the bpc to bank phenomena not session outnesses it could go on reading for twelve hours in the presence of session arc break you can go on finding other bpc continually without the pc feeling any better and you will invalidate and suppress all sorts of auditing work that was done so arc break assessments should begin with is it session arc break is it an r6 arc break or is it an r4 arc break it can be as crude as what list do i use presenttime upsets always seem more important to the pc than past events however tremendous the past events may be never use heavy steel electrodes ninetynine percent of your assessment trouble is really auditing cycle trouble assessment errors themselves can be so productive of upset that the fact that there can be another source of arc breaks can easily be ignored even with the comm cycle in perfectly with the auditor and the pc in complete rapport the session can go up in smoke because of an assessment error especially on wrong goal for instance if the pcs item has been bypassed all you should do if the pc arc breaks is to assess dont try to wc it with the pc you must not audit or address remarks to the pc in the presence of an arc break you never ask the pc single question nor do you acknowledge anything the pc says experience has taught that you cannot communicate with somebody who is out of communication dont audit in the presence of an arc break dont ask question dont acknowledge what the pc says you assess if you get confused and go into shock when the pc suddenly throws the cans at you take break that is better than sitting there slackjawed dont stay near the pc dont try to talk to the pc get your wits sorted out find where the arc break started and go assess find the bpc indicate it get back in comm with the pc and go on doing what you were doing the meter will read during an arc break but only on what is causing the arc break if you find some bpc on case arc break list and the pc doesnt go vgis know that there is something else there is session arc break or some different case arc break r2h can be done either as an arc break assessment or as an assessment for bpc where you stay in comm with the pc during the assessment everything from level iv on up depends on accurate assessment so the auditor must be able to shift rapidly and smoothly from assessment to auditing just because r6 is mostly assessing dont think that you can delete auditing from the session if you try you will have disaster you assess when you assess you audit when you audit dont ever do them both at the same time assessing is straight from auditor to bank6403c05 shspec8 case analysis healing ian tampion audited pcs on tv for the benefit of the victoria legislature at some hearings in australia this is the ultimate tvd the legislators were very interested lrh has started running his goals plot the research activities have left holes in his bank there are about 350 different goals series in sets of 42 since the same things went in over and over if you run one too deeply you can drop through into the next series you also get awful somatics if you do this the goals series are consecutive and it just goes in over and over again with different gpms same line plot same goal series they just go on and on so if you run out one you are convinced that you couldnt possibly have run it out because it is sitting on one of the same gpms of an earlier series so it looks like all the goals are still alive there so if you run one too deep you fall through into an earlier goals series so you can leave bpc by going on to the earlier one which gives you bad somatics youve got 42 goals in series for total of 15000 gpms they get bigger and bigger as you go back early track ris are about the size of mountain if you dont get the first pt series right the pc will go into sad effect of great magnitude with great speed it will take only four or five seconds from where where you found the wrong gpm to start from to the toboggan this can happen because you may well not have completed the current series only some of the 42 goal series closest to pt is formed because the current series has not yet been completed therefore it is easy to fall back into the next series also the pt gpm itself is truncated so you can get the first actual goal but it is hard to get the first actual gpm everyone has the same actual line plot in common we learned our lesson well before the track began the consequences of running these gpms out of order and with wrong line plots are pretty horrendous which is why we are not broadly releasing the line plots incidentally there are 2d goals on the actual gpm line plot as far as lrh has been able to tell there are plenty of implant goals on the 2d however case analysis tells you how to become healing wizard and upset the ama man has real tradition of healing there is lot of charlatanism the ama is into plumbing not healing anyway of course doctors are necessary like plumbers they never reveal their stats or not often enough you hear that 600 people have received kidney transplants what you dont hear is that all of them were dead within two years previous attempts to heal overts have consisted of things like calling for repentance this is not an adequate process man got healing closely associated with structure and became successful where structure is concerned he knew nothing of disease infection may or may not have to do with bacteria there are too many variables to say for sure the fact that you can see the bugs under microscope is insufficient lrh has found that infection many be the result of gpm healing is done by the body the doctor merely arranged the parts so that they could go back together and hoped that the individual would do the rest until you have solved the problem of how the individual influences his own healing process you can do nothing broadly about healing so the healing professions have tended to be monopolists or frauds the modern medicos and psychiatrists have gone towards monopoly they have also made research lucrative profession but they tend to keep the door shut on real search into healing by others not part of their club authority has become fact in courtrooms we dont communicate with the medicos not so much because they are evil as because they have certain stylized ways of thinking into which we do not fit they use research as way of raising money which is another incomprehensible we would have been incomprehensible anyway because we have gone forward on the basis that there is such thing as truth and that using what we know of it we can help our fellow man our real goals as scientologists are unreal to the public so there has to be bridge we do want some way to bridge in to the fellow on the street healing can be part of the lower part of such bridge because it is real to people freedom from psychosomatic illness is something that we can produce easily at lower levels even though healing isnt our maininterest this makes the monopolists attack us the second thing that we need to know about healing is if you are going to heal heal dont heal in order to _______ you would gain great acceptance in community if you worked on that avoiding or handling the attacks of the monopolists and escaping the wrath of the frauds if you do go in for healing someone make sure that you also teach him little and broaden his horizon beyond his goal of getting rid of his lumbosis you do have technology for healing any chronic disease or illness provided that you can read meter and keep the auditing comm cycle going chronic disease is disease that exceeds its expected duration but dont assume that because you can see that someone is sick from something you should heal it to say what someone is suffering from is very adventurous the persons mental mechanisms can bring about and perpetuate virtually anything actually all illness is psychosomatic even broken bones it shows poor judgement to put ones body in position where its bones can be broken after all the genus of psychosomatic illness is in suggestion the hypnotic variety and suggestion comes down to postulation nothing can be suggested to the individual with any effect that he has not earlier postulated himself thus an overt would be to key in something that the person had already postulated for himself the person must have willed the destruction of bodies before he could get his body in bad shape it really isnt what has happened to person that brings about psychosomatic illness it is what the person is willing to have happen eg to another but it is neither possible nor necessary to trace psychosomatic illness back to the individuals basic intention to have it to cure psychosomatic illness though all psychosomatic illnesses are selfcaused and stem from early thetan postulates the keyin of such an illness can be otherdetermined he doesnt have to have keyin to make his postulates come true but when one of his early postulates sometimes mysteriously materializes in the physical universe and he doesnt know anything about it it is necessary for something else around him to key it in he did it himself and knew he did but if it is happening and he doesnt now know that he did it himself it must be the result of key in hypnotism for instance is merely keyin of persons earlier postulates cf hcob 10aug73 pts handling to keep an environment calm you must be careful of what gets keyed in for instance war environment is restimulative enough to cause the keying in of lot of brutality thetan is unbelievably numerously prepostulated with 15000 gpms each containing 16 ris with locks galore there is lots to be keyed in so when you heal psychosomatics you are not dealing with the thetans basic postulations unless you are auditing at levels v and vi below level v basic postulates are out of reach of the thetan they are neither necessary nor possible to use in handling psychosomatic illness it is fortunate that you dont require them here are the steps in the formation of psychosomatic illness 1 the thetan postulates it ie he postulates that it could be done or that it could happen this was trillenia ago probably 2 then he did it to someone else 3 then he could and did have it keyed in on himself and he got the experience the keyin could be anything it could be something quite mild symbol for instance step 1would be taken up at level vi if anywhere but trying to handle illness at level vi is too restimulative someone who is sick is probably not up to any part of it and you dont do level vi partially anyway handling step 2 getting the basic overt on the track is equally matter of going way back and is therefore probably impossibly difficult to get at but you can easily handle step 3 picking up the keyin in pt which is some tiny motivator or small overt that keys in the big overt and you can make the person well by using it to cure somebody find the most recent keyin that you can get your hands on or the latest overton that subject again cf hcob 10aug63 pts handling dont try to heal with heroic methods take care of the keyins even though you know correctly that there is far far more behind it you want the lightest keyin that you can approach by the nature of the case you wont be able to reach that big postulate until the case as whole is up to level vi try to pick up the keyin that is as close to present time as you can get not as far back as you get if the recent keyin is too heavy to confront eg if it is something three lifetimes ago you can even pick up the keyin of the keyin go easy use feather duster the lightest of methods is what succeeds in healing curing bunions is not the same game as restoring to being his full powers but it is useful skill and very lightlylightly one you are not trying to get to basic the heroic measures indulged in by desperate doctors are just physical dramatizations of needless search for basic cutting out the brain to handle things is the effort to arrive at prime postulate dramatized as physical action the mystery is how something can be keyed out but it can and it heals the pc to do so he is likely to get the somatic back when he gets up to level vi but there you will be running it out6403c09 shspec9 summary of lower levels there has to be bridge between level 0 and level v level v is becoming catchall level of everything necessary before level vi we are in danger of getting up to the esoteric levels of vi and leaving bridge resulting in thirty to forty ots and nothing else someone off the street is in position to recognize any part of an actual gpm scientology progresses on reality the lower levels are the contest of achieving reality you have to achieve reality before you can make anyone better there has to be bridge to clearing its done by gradients the pc must be walked from position of norecognition of reality through recognition of some reality eventually to an ultimate reality by gradients if you skip step in gradient you get an unreality unreality is associated with charge they are the same thing an ri that is too overburdened with charge inval suppress etc will be unrecognizable to the pc matter how obvious it may be to the auditor person with too much charge on his case cant understand or achieve reality he must have reality and understanding to go free understanding is related to reality per the arc triangle therefore understanding is related to charge which you have to get off case first in order to clear it someone who has got lots of charge will do very silly things stupidity comes about from charge ie unreleased unresolved stored masses of energy for this reason you cant get person to solve his problems by mere significance the significances dont enter into it it is persons overcharged environment that makes person too stupid to solve his problems the way out of the problem of not having bridge is to attain consistency of result it breaks an auditors heart for results to vary from pc to pc to get consistent result and to get reliable bridge to clear you have to attack the common denominator of aberration in all pcs not the particular quirks of particular pcs otherwise results wont be consistent and the least common denominator of all aberration is charge if charge is what causes stupidity then obviously what we should attack is charge so the lower levels levels 0 through iv have to be aimed at getting off charge in the absence of any ability on the part of the pc to face the actual source of the charge and erase it we cant get anything but trouble from trying to put the pc into the actual cause of the charge so at the lower levels you dont erase much charge you get the pc out of the charge destimulation is what we must aim for at levels 0 iv so that the pc will be moved out of masses of charge we destimulate by attacking key ins we are not trying to get rid of the charge we are trying to pull the person out of it the person cant recognize the actual goal until he is separated from the keyins that stupefy him to get the pea under the mattresses ie the bank under the keyins and upsets you have to move the mattresses out of the way another analogy there is drain at the bottom of murky pool the pc cant see it or find it but he can drown trying what you have to do is to clean away most of the water and guck then the pc can find the drain and let the water and muck drain off you have to understand an ri for it to blow since it is thought not the symbols that represent it in english that is why session arc breaks inval or whatever can prevent ris from blowing life is all jammed up for person with ris and gpms the guy with his attention gruesomely and howlingly concentrated on some little tiny piece of mattress ticking see above must be shown that he can do something about the mattresses he can do something about it and he gets big reality and hope factor and his confidence resurges on this basis if he could get his attention off just one piece of mattress ticking for few minutes it would make him feel so different and so interestingly alive compared to how he has felt that now he gets big upsurge in reality and you can get him to tackle lot more youve got gradient in some cases the environment is so charged that the person cant take any attention off of it in this case you have to give the person change of environment to non restimulative environment here is an analogy say you have lion tamer faced with four ferocious lions and all he has is weak chair and he is running out of blank cartridges you are trying to interest him in biteproof suit but he cant put any attention on it you have tohandle the lions first lion by lion and then sell the overwhelmed trainer the lionproof suit this would be type 3 pts handling the next level up above total overwhelm level i is the person who is so engrossed in his ptps that he is obsessively solving everything solving his pt such person goes around with wild strings of sol5tis i hi1 haadann the time if i do i could and soandso wouldnt and then id and theyd etc his solutions are so pyramided that you dont dare touch any corner of the pyramid or the lot will collapse you can handle this pc by using your lowest level of actual processing with itsa on solutions which takes over the automaticity of it see above on auditing problems and solutions as well as 6404c21 shspec17 problems and solutions below level ii is the first processing level it contains repetitive processes and objective processes here there is danger of restimulating gpms unless you use only things that are not in actual gpms is there something that isnt in an actual gpm and can therefore be processed with impunity yes nouns and most pronouns some pronouns are in goals but at level ii you are far enough from the gpm that pronouns are generally safe but farther along you had better avoid such pronouns as myself i appears as rare item in gpms also but nobody has goals in the form to be noun nowhere in gpms do you have noun terminals and oppterms there are only nesses ities and tions adjectival and adverbial forms so you can process noun terminals with impunity think of communication would perhaps lead you straight into gpm think of communicator would not that is the missing secret of why the twentieth acc made clears nouns were processed in brackets nouns can only be locks therefore when you process them you get keyouts you would key out actual gpms by keying out locks on ris adding pronoun or noun can make an unsafe process safe what is an actual gpm or an actual ri it is mass with significance that is what you need to know at level iv therefore keyin is and will always be mass with significance almost anything in short that you could think of so masses with significances key in actual gpms which is why an environment is restimulative pt is one huge mass of restimulators present time is haunted area it is not the significance that keys in the gpm or the ri so to key one out you have to get masses plus significances if you have an actual ri with significance and someone keeps throwing the significance at you it will key you in so process like how could you helphow could i help would throw the pc into the ri to make it safe you have to put in help you or so that youve got mass plus significance running masses with significance is important because since masses with significance key in actual gpms running them keys out actual gpms at level i the mass with significance that the pc gets accustomed to is the auditor recall terminal would be good process arc straightwire works because and as long as you have terminal pronoun like someone or something in it and for the same reason you can prepcheck mass that has significance as long as its there and you are running it you can run it in brackets etc at level ii you have the pc do objective processes this fact plus the fact that control communication and havingness contain basic laws of life make 8c highlevel workable process the laws of life like control communication and havingness are senior to gpms but it is the wall that makes 8c workable it was the wall which since it was mass with significance had keyed in actual gpms so when you get the pc familiar with the wall the wall keys out and the gpm destimulates the auditing cycle itself is helpful and beneficial as well the auditing cycle is probably the basic process that makes level ii the pcs awareness of the auditor as friendly helpful mass with significance is also destimulative this awareness of the auditor tends to destimulate masses in general for the pc furthermore the auditor is not just mass with significance but also involves hope factor this is twopole universe as bucky fuller once taught lrh in elizabeth nj the twopole nature of communication showed up when lrh tried solo auditing himself on line plot hecould go through it but there was ta one terminal gives ta one terminal plus thousandth of terminal gives bit of ta etc the auditor has to be real to the pc for there to be session and ta early on this isnt true so it is up to the auditor to remedy the unreality of the auditor to the pc ie to help the pc to find the auditor reality should increase with auditing new process introverts the pc enough so that at first the auditor is less real to the pc so at first you could get less ta than when the pc gets used to the process early on the pc is so charged up that he has reality on any other terminals and there is terminal for him to discharge against he is mobile standing wave such an only one gets ta since there is one else around charge has accumulated on this pc to the point where other terminal exists he is trapped in the standing wave of noflow this is an animated standing wave that blocks all incoming and outgoing flow the pc is stuck in series of wins or loses he has lost terminal that he could talk to so he solves it by being in continuous communication with that terminal now if people arent that terminal they are nobody or he wasnt in comm with that one either he mustnt be there and he mustnt communicate there are tremendous keyins involved here to get ta we would have to rehabilitate otherterminalism at level ii we would do it with pronouns since we cant assess for terminals at level iii you would assess by observation discussing things on list with the pc and getting all his considerations you dont do much with the assessment this applies to r3sc slow assessment and r2c assessment by dynamics etc along with terminal we get period of time time is very important to the degree that you can destimulate somatic by dating it this works because all restimulation depends on mistake in time the pc thinks that the time something occurred is now his head hurts in 1964 because he got clobbered in 1944 the basic lesson that you are trying to teach about engrams is that the pcs time is awry the only thing that fouls you up in handling an incident by just dating the incident and having it blow is the fact that it has already been wrongly dated eg the pc already wrongly dated it you can find the date of the wrong dating you can find what the wrong date was there can be several wrong dates then you can find the actual date on which the incident occurred in view of the fact that you cannot easily run terminals that have not been accurately assessed we can use this time factor at level iii especially if an assessment has been done by higher level auditor to get something to run in problems intensives which involve getting the time of the incident terminals etc problems intensive is explained above and in hcob 9nov6l the problems intensive use of the prior confusion we have made class iv clearing level it is an assessmenttype process to make keyedout clear using prepchecks you use r3 do list of the pcs goals find one that stays in so what if it is an implant goal or wrong goal it stayed in do terminals list for that goal both goal and terminal lists should be short lists listed to clean needle you dont get somatics from wrong goals you get them from right goals that are suppressed or invalidated so you list for the terminal with who or what would have the goal find terminal that is noun then prepcheck it up to point of highlevel cognition or more ta then do another goals list and find another terminal this cycle repeated will give us clear by keying out the actual gpm keep the goals lists for later on you could use higherclassed auditors to do the assessment steps the only thing that can key in an actual gpm is mass with significance so prepchecking the mass plus significance tends to key out the locks that keep the gpm connected to pt keep it light in agreement with the pcs reality so that you dont get him protesting or invalidating the actual goal if you sum up the terminal into service fac you probably have another family of processes to use the terminal was what the pc was using as makeguilty mechanism this is cousin to ow so if the terminal wont prepcheck you could use service fac brackets on it howcould you make yourself rightothers wrong about it however it is not likely that you will have to do this you can key out actual gpms actual gpms are keyed in only by masses with significance and oddly enough there will be only one mass with significance in the environment that is really raising the devil with the pc when you get that one you can key him out you can fish him out of the bank so that he can go back and clean up the actual gpmshubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 15 march 1964 class vi central orgs scientology vi overwhelming the pc since there is so much charge available in actual gpms several thousand times the charge in any other process the auditor must be very smooth he or she must not overwhelm the pc if the pc is overwhelmed these immediate consequences occur 1 pc will not cognite 2 pcs judgment will vanish 3 meter will read on anything with long protest surges 4 charge will transfer to other goals or items making them read 5 pc may arc break 6 pc may go into sad effect 7 pc may go below arc break into propitiation with consequent cooperation but apparently ok examples of overwhelm violations of the auditing cycle can bring about overwhelm auditor is that your item pc comm lags auditor doesnt wait it out well is it your item pc still comm lags auditor gets very impatient well thats your item any part of this can overwhelm the pc always wait out the comm lag the pc is under the pressure of charge he is slow the auditor not in that charge can think faster therefore the auditor fails to see why the pc is taking time auditing sessions look like just two people are sitting there an unschooled auditor fails to realize he is looking at pc who is miles away and deep in the pc is in the room isnt he therefore the auditor assumes as in any social conversation the pc is there well the pc isnt the pc is buried under charge charge slows down responses when you pile charge up on the pc slightly misworded item or two the pc ceases to be capable of clear thought and will reject even right items the auditor sees this gets impatient starts to overwhelm by informing the pc the correct step is to do some case analysis and get the charge lessened then the pc can think example auditor sees clearly how blah brings about blah pc doesnt auditors wrong action is to explain it correct action is for auditor to get charge on pc lessened by case analysis the pcs judgment is the finest asset the auditor has in session by overwhelm contradiction small breaks of the auditing comm cycle echo metering charge is added to pcs casecharge becomes cognite cognite adds more charge by failing to asis by pc understanding cognite soon becomes overwhelm the less pc cognites the more charge is accumulated it is the charge that overwhelms auditor errors add charge pc then is overwhelmed example pc originates he thinks item is woof auditor checks garf now pc eventually given woof even when he said it was his in the first place fails to understand it you can get pc protesting silently and have everything on list start to read then you cant find the item or goal everything reads rough auditing auditor contradictions and comm cycle failures bring this about example pc says i think my item is woof it isnt but pc thinks so auditor not even bothering to check woof im sorry it didnt read when i called it while ago there goes the list everything may start to read and it wasnt even pcs item but the auditor overwhelmed the pc by direct refusal of the pcs idea so the list went wild on the pcs unspoken protest the right action the very least the auditor could have done was recheck the item that action at least acknowledged the pc then the auditor can say im sorry it doesnt read and suppress on it doesnt read either now the pc is happy and the auditor can go on nulling in class vi the pc is right lot more times than at lower levels you start arguing with the pcs heatonitems or goals and youll soon have messed up meter and an overwhelmed pc of course you must never give pc goals or items that dont read thats simply criminal but you must do everything you can to get what the pc thinks is right to read if you cant then tell the pc you cant and all will be well even so whole list or several parts of it will go alive on overwhelm by overwhelming the pc you can get wrong goals and items galore and you get nocognite pc and after that youve had it auditor can find anything without the pcs cooperation preserve it l ron hubbard lrhglrd copyright 1964 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 15 march 1964 issue ii class vi central orgs scientology vi meter everything reading there are only few things which cause everything to read on list of goals or items 1 meter ability first amongst these as in any level is the inability of the auditor to read meter in class vi work the inability to read meter is very subtle it is usually that the auditor has not learned the difference between surge and real goal read or item read on live item list everything has some charge on it only the right item reads in its own peculiar way right read is definitely itself and the auditor must learn it an actual goal chugs it is clean read it may not even blow down it is sporadic but it is definitely highly charged read most implant gpms read with long clean enthusiastic rr lovely but it isnt an actual gpm the actual gpm chugs its clean sweep of needle and its mere tick an actual ri reads with blowdown of the ta and heavy needle action the action is so heavy that the sensitivity must not be higher than 4 in class vi work surge looks like an ri if you run sensitivity at 16 or 32 the auditor new to class vi work is cocky about his metering yet he or she has to learn to recognize the character of thing by its meter action an auditor who cant tell an actual ri from lock ri on an items list with glance at the meter response will give the pc lot of bum items an auditor who cant tell an actual gpm from an implant gpm or gpm merely by meter behaviour and further questions will make lot of mistakes in addition to how it read on the meter you do full checkout of course and in checkouts you must know as well by meter behaviour during checkout what you are checking out even before you get the final answer by the checkout patterthere are two ways then of recognizing the character of what youre checking one is by the reads you get from questions about it the other is its character of read on the meter both are needed to get accuracy an auditor new to class vi will buy tick the only ticks in class vi are on mid ruds and dogs joke if you cant get long fall in response to one of your offered identities implant ri lock on an implant and so on down the whole list of questions then youll still get one on it isnt ticks need apply the auditor who buys an actual gpm because of tick on its an actual gpm and better read would praise psychiatry class vi is all big read stuff if there are big reads on anything including buttons then whatever it is just isnt it must read big if only on suppress or wronged if its anything at all if everything on list is reading it may just be that the auditor doesnt know read when he or she sees one an item list should give 1 or 2 surge on every item the first time through only the actual ri on it reads its head off and blows down and keeps reading while those other items surges just die out on goals list the list ought to be complete enough that goal on it except actual goals moves the needle the actual goal when read gives chug goals list is very easily suppressed the actual gpm may be dug off it only by asking on each goal has goal being tested been suppressed or wronged the same thing can occur with an items list its been flattened out of existence but the right item will still read on suppressed or wronged with long fall and so can be found again but all such actions are made infrequent by an auditors knowing how the real thing looks and spotting it the first time locks and actual ris read quite differently lock goals and implant goals and actual goals all read very differently and all at glance checkout on items becomes unnecessary when the auditor knows how they should look and can see what happened on the meter one of the funniest auditor flubs but not to the pc is the auditor who not being able to get anything to read while trying to learn the character of an item or goal merely keeps repeating the same question trying by will power to make it read an item or goal is what it is and dozens of repeats of the same question will not make it into something it is not all things are something the trick is to ask if it is what it really is only then does one get proper long fall on assessing identifying what things are is game of charades and if one doesnt guess the right answer one doesnt get the nod from the meter the nod is big read always if the thing being identified is anything at all and the nod also says by the way the needle nods if the guess is true2 the abandoned item or goal another way everything reads given an auditor who knows the different reads on the meter there is just one other way one can be fooled if the right item or goal on list has been read and abandoned all its locks will begin to read like real items or goals this is fabulously important datum the too cautious auditor can wreck everything by reading the right item getting the right read and then abandoning it to try to see if anything else is it example on an item or goals list the auditor has found bark it has read well when called the auditor feels insecure so he or she then goes on to check woof woof now reads well pc is restive so auditor tries another item on the list growl this too reads well but wont bring about auditor now tests arf this reads fine too but everything is now up the spout pc is miserable and arc breaking auditor is frantic an arc break assessment would show item abandoned but what item was abandoned there has been woof growl bark and arf which is right they have all read now you must get the exactly worded item or goal near misses will do the exact wording the right up or upon exact if the wording is not exactly right the mass of the item or gpm will not asis the pc will be left in heavy charge so almost right is wrong always the goal to catch is going to cause arc breaks and somatics if called to grab the goal to be creative will give you sick pc if found as to be artistic and worse if an item has one s missing its wrong moaning is wrong as moanings the bank is demon for exactness the mind is not confusion its martinet of too much order so almost finding it is not finding it at all nothing is ever almost right in class vi the meter does not almost read so you have to find the exact goal wording or item wording now back to bark this was the first one read it was then abandoned this charged up its locks so now woof arf and growl are all capable of making bark read it is bark that is still reading even when you call woof and growl and arf you have broken down the divisions amongst them now what to do how to find what is really reading ask has growl been suppressed or wronged small read has woof been suppressed or wronged small read has bark been suppressed or wronged big reads clean up bark by getting pc to get off the suppress etc and bark now reads and woof growl and arf do not so bark is the item moral when nulling if you see real big read mark it as first read or 1st rd and be safe its all right to null onward but you may now find everything reading pc announcing bark is my item if ignored without immediate checkout gives the same effect since if bark was the pcs item and was abandoned all else can start to read as the charge will transferhence the rule an actual ri or actual goal abandoned on list can now cause other lock items or goals to read well the nervous auditor gets into this trap endlessly and so never learns that an actual goal or actual ri has its own peculiar read such an auditor loses all confidence in nulling accuracy and the pc goes wild 3 wrong goals if you ever run wrong goal on pc again everything tends to read as we now have the pattern the rr probably wont go all the way off but the needle will get tight and good indicators will flee the pattern is close enough to keep the rr on somewhat but anything the pc gave you by way of items would read wrong goals are harder to detect than they were the pattern is too good guide almost any goal will run on it but black mass and pressure will appear good indicators will vanish bad indicators will appear and mass asises any actual ri has enough power to make lock or wrong goals based on it read for instance an actual ri speeding will cause the goal to speed to check out as an actual gpm so beware of wrong goals and do careful checkouts and buy only good forceful reads in answer to your assessment questions implant ris are incapable of giving lock goal charge enough to check out but an actual ri has enough charge to do so ive had four different goals check out for the same position but only one gave good indicators and consistent responses abandoning right goal can make pc very very sick so theres limit on banging goal around experience tells one at length what right goal or item reads like how it checks out and when one is going up the garden path but experience is based on sound beginnings so know the above well and then you can build up to good certainty on how its done the first thing to know of course is that there is right way to do it if you dont realize that and try for it then youll never learn and class vi will remain closed mystery to you but it need not for we do know l ron hubbard lrhdrrd copyright 1964 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6403c17 shspec11 the road to perfection lrh has had gamble on time going since january of 1963 the question was could he complete the job before the roof fell in he neglected organizations and scientologists until february of 1964 in order to research full time msh caught the brunt of it august marked the point at which he found out that it could be done the materials were there from then until january of 1964 the material was labelled codified and put together so that it could be communicated at the same time bridge had to be created from the man on the street up to reach for the upper levels one that would be real to the man on the street that was more difficult operation person has to be walked forward with wins at every step that are real to the person so that he will keep going forward and not get discouraged some pcs in fact most pcs cannot have win that amounts to anything at all the tiniest of wins is all that would be tolerable to such person at apathy there is low acceptance level of win eg nothing terrible happened to today would be the highest acceptable level of win to such person so you may have to rehabilitate the pcs ability to have win too for this reason it is more difficult to get someone from level 0 to level iv than to get him from level v on up he has certainty yet it is easier to climb mont blanc with an experienced mountaineer than it is to climb foothill with girl in tight dress and spike heels there is political problem in that we are faced with world that is getting more and more pessimistic and bent on giving people wins the acceptance level of win dwindles away to practically nothing anyway lrh did the job in time so now he is working out organization classification etc basic auditing has been put into good condition it has been rough but it has made seasoned individuals things dont have to be smooth if they are certain giving someone gradient series of wins can be interfered with by his having minor arc breaks and stopping auditing for awhile or there is someone who is openminded win isnt available and you get discouraged and give up seeing that win is available you dont create one dissemination hangs up on this one point the available win you write off someone if you see win available but that is monitored by your acceptance level of win you have to be able to accept level of win that is so low that it is real to the public person the scale of win is gradient scale it is important to anyone trying to get somewhere with scientology it has two sides an outward win of assisting someone and an inward win of being assisted it is win for someone if he assists and lose if he fails to assist based on his intention to assist if an auditor helps pc and the pc doesnt recognize the change in order to feel good about it the auditor must have certainty of observation that requires agreement from the pc that something has been done you have to be able to see and be certain of having seen win in pc whose acceptance of wins is so low that he doesnt know that he has had one your certainty level has got to be high that is an almost impossible level to attain but if you dont attain it you will go into agreement with the pc on acceptability of wins comfort relaxed frame of mind and some serenity about things requires that you know the exact situation and know that it is the exact situation true selfconfidence and poise as opposed to the ability to endure or suffer depends on the ability to conceive the truth of any situation knowing the truth of the existing situation is the only thing that supports self confidence most departures from the truth come about as an effort to attain safety and self security from fear of what might happen to him mans civilization forces lies on him at many points by making telling the truth uncomfortable or even fatal it promulgates the idea that if you said nothing but the truth for 24 hours you would lose everything but if one fails to announce truth one is to that degree protecting lie at this point person begins to surround himself with lies so society brings the individual to tolerate lies it sees virtue in lies it aids lies recognition of the truth is therefore converted into enduring the truth this is downscale mockery of an upscale item recognition of the truth in situation is the only way to asis the situation however one can be confronted with so much truth that one cannot asis it and one gets swamped by it thisdiscourages person from recognizing truth also it leads to notis of truth it is lack of gradient that brings person away from recognition of truth and makes him less clearsighted there is gradient and youve got to have one time enters into it since it is part of gradient for instance the french revolution was the result of ramming in couple of major truths too fast political freedom is ok people could be educated to advantage but there was gradient so the french people ended up more debased after the revolution than before the truth of the situation wasnt gradiently recognized or approached there was evolution from darkness to dazzle the true believer has real reality with the truth that he espouses truth requires reality which is the ability to assimilate truth if someone reaches with gradient with reality they wind up with reality on truth it is not ever assimilated assimilation depends on causedistanceeffect on communication and on an even balance of mind affinity while assimilating truth without arc is denied to the individual and can wrong and harm him truth must go hand in glove with understanding if there is understanding truth is not truth to anyone it is just truth all truths are attainable transcendentalism the notion that the truth transcends our ability to understand is lot of baloney there is point in studying the route to truth if you dont know what the truth is studying the truth when one has idea of what the truth is when one has idea of what one is looking for is like looking for memphis without having any idea that there are any towns called memphis or even that there are any towns it is an idiotic activity lets all sit down and study how we can get to gmpsxgrtz and then nobody ever asks what is gmpsxgrtz what do you mean how to get there is it road across space is it measured by time is it spacetime journey that we are making what kind of journey is this to gmpsxgrtz the answer is we11 lets just discuss how to get to gmpsxgrtz the above totally bogs down philosophy kant solved it by saying that you could never find out what gmpsmgrtz is he cut off speculation the work of all current gurus adepts and of lao tze etc is all concerned with how you approach truth with idea of what truth is this is ridiculous lrh performed the flatworm experiment in 1938 and found that memory was transferable in monocell lrh points out that current experimenters in the area will quit soon because their results will shortly get bizarre enough as with the advent of past lives in the wichita foundation so that their appropriations will be cut off since their researches will be too unreal to their money sources we are in an optimum condition with regard to knowing what truth we are trying to approach since we can demonstrate by exteriorization separation between the person and the body we know that we are going towards the free individual we know that our road to truth is the creation of such an individual we know that there is difference in orders of life between man and vegetable we know what truth we are trying to attain everybody has some sympathetic harmonic with that truth what is their reaction to it it depends on their reality on the approach to this truth we know that life is right there where the pc is sitting so to get to truth journey across time and space is not really required the journey consists of undoing the lies by which the person has walled himself in all we have to do to recover the individual and his ability is to undo the turns for the worse that he has taken we are traveling road that has been followed only backwards the way the tao whatever we know what it is it is the road that the individual has followed from degree of perfection and beingness and self ness on down to disintegration forgettingness bluntingness until hes in the state you find him in all the auditor has to do is walk him back that road its all there its all meter marked we are taking each lie in turn that landmarked further degradation and undoing it we are recovering the individual and his potential so the road to truth adds up to 1 the individuals potential2 the situations in which the persons potential got lessened and what has happened to this individual 3 how this individual is related to the rest of the universe 4 what we can do to restore the potential of that person that is all part of the truth truth from the viewpoint of the auditor is what actually happened or the situation that actually exists at any moment in the state of beingness of an individual it is not the ultimate that we are seeking to attain it is not something transcendental truth is that which exists the road to truth might be better called the road to perfection or to an ultimate truth truth is usually all hedged up in so many pitches and so many directions that people want you to go so many curves on the line that you cant separate the wheat from the chaff we know where we are going and how to get there what it takes but we have not mastered an estimation of the individuals ability to conceive of truth you may be talking to grocer about scientology but actually you are talking to him about the road to perfection the composition of himself who are you what do you consist of what potentials do you have what potentials have you robbed yourself of where are you going what is life what is your relationship on any dynamic you may be using the word scientology but these are the things you have embarked upon to discuss and the unanswered question is what can he recognize we need to master the estimation of persons ability to assimilate truth it is not hard to overwhump someone with big chunk of truth eg by exteriorizing him you have had the experience of exteriorizing someone and then having him say omigawd im and its it and then two hours later what exteriorization i wasnt exteriorized well possibly something happened but i dont know youve shot the guy momentarily into the rarefied air of being able to see it but he couldnt have it so you can show people things they cant have and thats how you generate an unreality if we had gradient between wog and ot we would soon get very unreal to everybody but ourselves you can show people things they cant have thus generating an unreality the common denominator here is hit with too much truth the individual degrades you hit this guy he exteriorizes bang he says im im spirit i dont have mass body is body im different than it two hours later hes harder to process his ability to win has been exceeded and he has lost it puts you on withhold not to lay the truth before people so lay out the truth but provide the road by having levels of acceptable truths or realities that an individual can attain establish and rehabilitate his ability to win so that eventually he can have truth and that way you wont just throw the person into complete frothing ecstatic worshipping apathy this is the condition of the true believer in the past when people got some truth they built up secrecy about it but the route must exist and must be wide open not cloaked in secrecy training and skill do have to be there but there is other effort at secrecy the main point is to provide gradient scale to get people up to higher reality the route must exist wide open even if 100 of the people dont travel ithubbard communications office saint hill

something else and then wonder why he is having trouble flattening process is such fact there are two aspects to ending process both having to do with what you are doing with the process 1 fixing the pc up so that he can be audited rudiments 2 auditing the pc this gives you two different endings in rudiments you are doing just enough to cure the elsewhereness of the pc you dont want any ptp to get in the road of auditing use the ruds kit to brush off pt hassles destimulate the pc and get on with what you started as major cycle not knowing this you will never complete cycle of action on pc you will keep on having to audit outruds never finishing cycle because you dont use tools of destimulation to push the outrud out of your road the other extreme is to abandon prepcheck or some major action because the pc had little cognition about something dont use rudslike whisk broom on major action you dont end off in three minutes with little bitty cog you use the ta and you get action off the area you have to unflatten subject before you can flatten it running all the ta out of it that is mainbodyofthesession auditing mainsession auditing is all done with the ta never as with the rudiments if you use the wrong approach you will get the wrong ending and the pc will go nowhere you have to restimulate the pc to audit him you only leave major actions when the ta is off you dont chicken out and say oh it is seeming bit better now is it fine thats cog so we will end off now flunk auditing by list is like r2h you could use sec check list carefully not impinging on the pc not restimulating anything to audit but that is not the way to handle the body of the session where you really want to handle things the approach you use in the ruds is to restimulate nothing so that you can get in and audit something else later auditors who treat bodies of sessions like rudiments damage the pc because they leave processes unflat all sorts of charge will have been left bypassed if this happens the effect of this is dramatic and fast acting in r6 it is less so at lower levels but the long term result is the same you could run what process has been left unflat and get considerable gain what happens if you start prepcheck on one thing and shift to another thing before you finish for one thing the pcs ability to be prepchecked will suffer he will be harder to prepcheck also if you prepcheck with bad comm cycle the tool would get blunted you could even prepcheck prepchecking or prepcheck each prepcheck button the basic reason why prepcheck button goes out is an incomplete cycle of action thetans have bug on continuing they like to see cycles continue that gives the longevity and mass of the physical universe at low level any case is subject to the cycle of action fatalism is total subjugation of the individual by the cycle of action what will be will be the individual is at total effect people are in agreement with the cycle of action but not because it is ultimate truth however it only fades out way up there at higher levels you can widen your timespan and do various odd things with time everybody is used to and in agreement with the cycle of action so it is reality but not truth that you use in auditing violations of it bring about an unreality that is what happens if you start an auditing cycle with pc and dont finish it the pc is parked in the middle of some incompletely asised mass which he carries on into the next process and so on things start looking more and more complicated to the pc as these incomplete cycles stack up freedom is real to him as completing cycle of action so there is both the mass that he hasnt asised and the incompleteness of the cycle the idea of win usually goes along with the cycle of action one wins when one accomplishes something even if it is just the accomplishing of still being there the upper echelon of this comes under intentionintention is part of but senior to the comm cycle it has in it every power the thetan has including the power to throw lightning bolts to hold position to make something continue to do away with something strength accomplishment and wit when you are halfshot as thetan when you are pretty bad off but not yet in body when you are pretty gummed up with mass your intention is still quite good enough to intend the emeter across the desk or crayon into the air or the telephone receiver off the cradle the ability to intend is all there is to thetans power all you have to do to weaken thetan is to foul up his intentions which you can do by blunting or giving him loses on his intentions weakness is the only thing that traps the thetan that holds him down etc so the main thing we have to watch in auditing is that we dont weaken the pcs own intention never blunt the pcs own intentions to avoid doing this we must differentiate between the pcs intentions and his bank dramatizations dramatizations are not intended validate the pc not the bank you dont ruin pc by blunting his intentions but you can key in incidents where his intention was blunted if you interrupt cycle of action half way through failure to complete auditing cycles validates the bank and blunts the pcs intentions getting the pcs goals for the session if possible is important in this regard you should at least get them cared for as ruds before getting the body of the session going so that his gis are in and his attention is free so that he has had win in every ptp the pcs intention has been blunted person makes progress when he has ptp because his intentions are blunted he has an intention which something else counters with equal force so that it hangs up in time level v demonstrates this marvellously oppose was the way the power of the thetan was knocked out by taking his goals and intentions and implanting an automatic blunting mechanism the implant gpms themselves oppose each other opposition is the keynote of an implant and it is the only way in which they are aberrative they have too little mass to be really upsetting by themselves it is what has been done to intention that is upsetting children get spoiled not because the get all the want but because they get their reactive intentions validated eg they get rewarded for tantrums and they get their analytical intentions opposed ie the child is not allowed to do what he wants analytically the auditor who only pays attention to pc when he arc breaks is doing the same thing pcs dont turn nasty they get overwhumped by the bank when their own intentions are blunted and the bank dramatizes person who is weakened is unable to hold anything at distance so everything collapses on him if you dont so anything about the pcs intentions you get the pcs dramatizations the auditors intention is valuable to the session because he is less susceptible than the pc to dramatization in the pcs bank his intention is senior to the pcs but if the pcs intention is neglected it weakens and we get an increased chance of dramatization the pcs analytical intentions are also valuable to the session down deep the pc intends to get freedom and return of power ie return of intention he can now go all the way if he works along certain path the intention for him to arrive is sotto voce in the pc and more explicit in the auditor since the auditor isnt getting distracted by the bank the pc can mix up freedom and escape and not want to confront things person is weak to the degree that he has allowed his intention to be blunted and strong to the degree that his intention is free thetans become worried about and hold back their intentions because they have been convinced that their intentions are out of their control and that they can cause bad effects as result if you asked pc what intentions do you have to keep under wraps you would get roaring automaticity scientology can get ahead partly because people attacking scientology have idea what our intentions are world of wars insanity etc is very unreal to them they think that couldnt be their real intention so they attack nonexistent intentions which is why they come off looking like asses if case is recovering he is really just removing his blunted intentions ie he is removing the obstacles that he has put there or agreed to doingness intention has time added to it therefore it is tied into the cycle of action pure intention doesnt necessarily involve time or cycle of action or space you could make an intention in the past present or future time and space are the result of intention which issenior to them as pc comes downscale to normal levels though his agreement with cycle of action results in the disappearance of his intention out of the cycle of action if you take someone who is having terrible time you can show him cycles of action with short sessioning cchs etc eventually his own intentions start to free up out of the mestiness of it all the only way the auditor can foul this up is to leave his own cycles of action incomplete if we are going to have wins we must validate analytical intention knock out dramatizations and complete cycles of action by flattening processes within the reality of the process involved and in accordance with how much is there to be flattened if you can get an auditing cycle completed you will get win if you dont you will get lose it is that simple6403c24 shspec13 international city communication is necessary to stop fights as well as to start them the communications that start fights generally occur over distances that are quite great the distances set up high voltages and the terminals have to shout too loudly so the communication is imperfect great distance in communication enters confusion and misunderstoods they have to shout at each other so they consider that they are mad at each other the leaders have the illusion that they are far enough apart to shoot at each other with impunity one can blow up moscow without destroying washington it is an illusion of security lent by distance but this is longer true none of these national governments can really operate broadly for everyones benefit but they try to go out and influence areas beyond their borders the result is continual brushfire wars eg vietnam where washington and moscow fight by proxy the ultimate result is to bring about dangerous environment in its obsession with defense the government absorbs tax money and spends it on arms so we get economic upset and inflation because of shortage of goods peace doesnt pay literally if money wont buy things it inflates we are told that there are plenty of products in the us but the inflation continues because the us dollar has gone international and there is too little production elsewhere inflation leads to communism and money it leads to slavery because one can keep up with it so everyone therefore has to turn to communism russia however has never succeeded in feeding its own people one reason for this fact is russias defense budget and the large army that they maintain another is the fact that the communistic worker is perpetually on strike because he gets reward for his labor politics has entered into economics where it doesnt belong national degradation results from things like draft laws which put people in choice scene being where they dont want to be and doing things that they dont want to do this leads to apathy the governments are at war not the individual american and russian farmers when in comm get along very well only when depersonalized as soldiers can people act for the organizations of earth and slaughter each other the planet is going to blow up or otherwise become very unpleasant unless some changes are made to bring about peace this has been long think this question of how to promote peace ever since egypt in political spheres perhaps impractical but interesting solution is based on the fact that the two sides of the body would perhaps be at war except for the fact that the left side of the brain controls the right side of the body and vice versa so if washington governed the us from moscow and moscow governed russia from washington the chances of war would be immensely reduced advancing the cause of peace pays nobody as things stand now and war does pay the more trouble there is the more importance the political figure has man deifies what causes trouble marie of rumania had very peaceful prosperous government but she didnt get lots of publicity or admiration in the us the war presidents are the ones who get remembered not the peace presidents the common citizen however doesnt make his personal fortune out of such chaos if man is to make any real forward progress he must have peace the only way that government would lay off income tax for instance would be if it werent being faced with demands for military appropriations length of time since the last war determines the state of calm of country the easiest program for international sanity would be one of reducing strife and dissonance in the environment making less threatening environment with less fixation on an unconfrontable future person with future acts weird man is tied to the idea that he lives only once this gives him certain irresponsibility for the area he lives in cf neville chamberlain i bring you peace in our time man wont buy the idea that he will live again there is too much responsibility in this idea to have an effective world peace program the following problems have to be solved1 the importance of the politician must be maintained he has to keep his importance or he wont support the program 2 continued activity for manufacturers and industry so that the economy wont collapse without war industries 3 shortening of the comm lines among the capitols of the world so that there is greater understanding 4 reduction of individual nations initiatives for waging war 5 reduction of the danger in the environment 6 offering some startling dramatic objective that is very complicated to bring about you need some attractive constructive and hardtoachieve goals the solution would have to be big enough to make the problem of war seem soluble lrh put this together initially as an exercise on capacities of ots one of the things that we have to remember is that we have base called earth we dont want the base any more enturbulated than it has to be nor do we want the base so aware of itself as base that it will resent being one also there are exercises that one should be able to do to improve ones skill they should not be of hostile nature at least towards this planet i am being very vague purposefully so but i think you understand it takes long time to develop technology we have the assets of our technology so our interest in peaceful earth is not only altruistic but also first dynamic interest in its continuance so that our technology can survive earth also has value as base because for one thing it is in nice quiet backwater of the galaxy and likely to be overlooked by others in the galaxy so lrh dreamed up project on which thetans could work together its name became the international city project lrh reached the conclusion that if all the nations capitols were in one geographical area all the major problems mentioned earlier would be solved the governments would be far less prone to go to war they would be close enough to each other to communicate easily there would be false security from distance there would be pleasant social atmosphere with constant parties with heads of states not just diplomats the bombing of such city would become rather remote possibility particularly if you never let people who seemed to be angry at each other leave the capitol at the same time this would create problem of long comm line to the home country you would have to prevent the development of new capitol in the home territory by having the comm line go directly to separate states or counties the comm lines from the governments would not go on via to one major city or central point inside their countries but would go to all the states prefects counties or whatever this would also prevent revolution in the home country it would require building lots of comm lines also building the new capitols in new place would take an immense amount of building additionally you would have an international parliament of earth housed in completely bombproof bunker under mountain it would have appropriate representation based on population production etc there would be plenty of politicking to keep the politicians happy the oneworldtogetherness idea is popular one on earth if elementary steps are taken the rest might follow easily one preliminary step would be 1 all governments turn over nuclear weapons and supplies to the immediately2 have the and all governments select site for and construct an international city preferably in north africa on the mediterranean coast where land reclamation can expand its area and its comm lines can be easily centered 3 persuade all governments to move their capitols to international city complete with heads of governments confesses and parliaments prohibit secondary capitol or even comm relay center within the country itself 4 secure comm lines and command lines from international city to each internal county or state regard each of these counties or states as an autonomous unit under control of the government in international city 5 reorganize the on formula recognizing land area population figures and production value remove all favored nations categories and the exercise of special privileged and the veto by few form the into judiciary division two houses and an executive branch key officials are to be popularly elected within the nations that they represent and by voting by both upper and lower houses for the head of the reform the charter into an instrument specifically engaged in governing the heads of nations and international affairs forbid in the charter all interference with individuals or smaller communities 6 forbid all warlike treaties of mutual assistance 7 create small effective military force for the abolishing all other war facilities 8 persuade international monetary activities to stabilize economics 9 limit what national government should be up to in the we go ahead with this plan on the basis that general agreement among scientologists would push all the individual efforts into coordinated activity so that they would count here is big plan that is sufficiently sloppy so that if it went pretty far awry if everybody were moving in that direction you would have some possibility of attaining the final objective it has good figurefigure value it is sufficiently interesting plan that it would cause lot of conversation it also has kind of lonely individuality in that one else is doing anything at all for world peace it coheres what could be lots of individual actions it is feasible because it doesnt have to be done perfectly to be done ideas from scientology occur and appear in the world to surprising degree so there is more chance of this plan coming to pass than one might think if scientologists were involved in bringing about what amounts to complete political revolution of earth there would be good dissemination in it scientologists would be available to handle personal upsets etc so their influence would get expanded keep the word scientology parked somewhere on the fringes of this thing and we would get monopoly on mental healing within the boundaries of international city the main virtue of this plan is that there has been complete void of ideas for world peace and this is an intriguing one it is something which if adopted would certainly make the planet less dangerous it has its liabilities but they are outweighed by its advantages someone could perhaps try to take over the central government and become dictator but this would be pretty hard to do hitler failed to take over the world true the international city arrangement does put all the political control in one place but it also puts into that place lot of wily guys not being able to attain their political objectives by war they will try to attain them by diplomacy and they would welcome the proximity of other capitols and large legislature to lobby in they are not about to give this up for dictatorship they wouldnt cooperate with such dictatorwhat about national revolts well that possibility would be equally apparent to the head of every state in international city and i think he would tend to govern in such way that it wouldnt happen the political government of international city itself would be independent of the it would have enough force to balance any house guards or bodyguards that might be around the product of this city government is the safety and security of individuals in international city it would be kept as itself by being made very profitable not political international city would originally be financed in such way that it itself becomes property which becomes very profitable to some people it doesnt matter who they would consider it governmental responsibility because it is profitable the russians would hate this last bit but then they are always goofing up in that area anyway the way to have calm international city is to make sure that the ownership of the land and property of international city brings in money to small group who sit as council in international city and make sure that things remain nice and peaceful and profitable politics would be involved this makes international city hell of piece of bait for some construction company after it has built its buildings it is going to draw rent on them from here on out member of that construction company is going to sit on the governing board of that city with government over its head and all it has to do is sit there and keep the peace in international city youve put very hard core of very hardheaded guys who want to make awful sure that they keep dragging down the rent you see from the white house you are also splitting up political control if you want to see lousy capital take look at capitol that is owned by the government governments take very bad care of things they own because theres profit in it for anybody our direct public interest in international city would be limited to acting as clearing house for information concerning it overtly it is something for scientologists to support help out on and talk about just like everybody else covertly it is training ground for the budding ot nice exercise for him it becomes very fruitful it gives him something useful to do perhaps the main thing that this plan offers is some hope for people it gives the scientologist town it puts piece of this planet into his hands to be interested in i chose the location i did because it is where the oldest comm lines on the planet were located there is lot of coast and country in the area between tunis and tripoli many old comm lines have gone through that area it should be fun for scientologists and ots it should create fantastic amount of new wealth in desert it is busy its broad fourth dynamic method of dedangerizing the environment as process just saying that feasible plan does exist puts in some hope and to that degree it dedangerizes the environment there is more future in it it is method of disseminating to the heads of nations in one small area all at once we have had trouble with governments recently they have been disrespectful we shouldnt stand for it the way you can really upset government is to move its capitol the fact that you are talking about moving all the earths capitols depowers the nations of earth with regard to scientology even if they agree that it is good thing to do removing the nations capitols from their positions makes the nations weak terminal is as powerful as it can hold its position you are threatening them with not being able to hold their position it puts scientology in position of being of comparable magnitude the governments of earth rather then just being of comparable magnitude to single government since it would be controlling the positions of all the governments of earth they dont know the tech so they couldnt explain the odd feeling that they would get at the idea of moving they dont know that it is very important to hold position if you want power just espousing such plan would lead to shift of relative power between you and the government they would feel as though they were slipping if we hold to this as central agreement it will eventually come about it depends for its power on interest there is moneyed group behind this but there is huge vacuumprovided that would pick up such people and put them into it but then they are not now ie wont then be in back of it behind it theyre in it we are in back of ithubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco information letter of 2 april ad14 magazine article bpi two types of people completing research on the highest levels of clearing now being taught as the upper course at saint hill class vi ot i made very fundamental discovery about man and life that id like you to know about you probably have speculated on this many timesare there two kinds of people good people and bad people society is more or less organized on the basis that there are and certainly one sees that some are successful and some arent some are good to know and some arent even in modern tv fiction one has the cowboys in the white hats and the cowboys in the black hats indeed one probably couldnt have stories at all to mans way of thinking unless there were heroes and ogres and even fiction is rigged as moral lesson in good and bad people philosophers long before greece pondered moral conduct in terms of good and bad and diogenes was looking for an honest man implying some werent more recent speculation in the 19th century termed all men evil unless forced to be good some schools of thought tried to avoid the point by saying early childhood formed character yet other schools maintained man would always be evil unless personally threatened which gives us the presence of police in the society but even police sometimes work on the idea that there are good and bad people from all this one could judge that man had problem about whether people are good or bad probably at this minute you could think of some examples of good people and bad people you know those who rave and gnaw the rug at the very thought of scientology helping anyone so therefore there must be people of evil intention toward their fellows and there are the research results you would be interested in show clearly that there are two types of behaviourthat calculated to be constructive and that calculated to be disastrous these are the two dominant behaviour patterns there are people then who are trying to build things up and others who are trying to tear things down and there are other types actually there arent even shades of grey the disaster type can be repressed into inactivity and illness and the constructive type can also be repressed and made ill thus there are two basic actions each with many other subsidiary actionsthere is also cyclic or combined type who is alternately constructive and disastrous so there are cowboys in white hats and cowboys in black hats and the cowboys in the grey hats are too sick to be in the game one scholarly chap very sick fellow hopefully told once that there were true villains purely evil people he was whistling past the graveyard there may not be evil people but there are people currently devoted to doing evil actions all such conduct is apparent and dominant we see such people all the time we just dont want to see them the underlying reasons for this are in the absence of processing fixed and unchangeable in any one lifetime as man knows man only in one lifetime the basic cause or changes have not been observed thus to all practical purposes for man some are good and some are evil and if we didnt have scientology it would not only not be observed but couldnt ever be changed that this condition existsthat half are good and half are bad according to their personalitiesoddly enough does not alter basic scientology concepts it explains why certain persons appear to be evil and some appear to be good examining the actual goals of an individual shows us why about half the goals of any one individual are constructive the remainder are destructive it takes being very long time to live completely through the cycle of one goal much less series of goals therefore any one individual at any given long period of his existence is only fixated on disaster and at subsequent long period is fixated only on being constructive so the same being at different lifetimes is good and evil given sudden overwhelming experience good person may be shifted violently in his own goals pattern and become evil and bad person acted upon powerfully by life will become good but they also become sick their illness stems from being moved out of present time into past heavy energy patterns it is cure to so move them despite the assertions of 19th century mentalists and their shock treatment this shows why shock sometimes works and why changes of character come about and it also shows why such changes are accompanied by severe illness and early death the person is thrown violently out of present time into painful past the problem is not problem of sanity and insanity it is problem of disastrous motives and constructive motives and the degree to which either is suppressed by suppressing the damaging motives of being who is currently inclined to disaster one can make that being behave but by suppressing the constructive motives of being currently inclined to constructiveness as in the military one can make that being behave also but both will become physically ill neurotic or insane in the absence of processing so the same being in one long period is constructive and in the next long period disastrous as man measures time in small bits such as youth old age or lifetime he could conceive of being as either only constructive or only disastrousfortunately for us this also solves the ancient riddle that one cannot be granted power without also having good intentions the only way final and powerful abilities can be returned to an individual is by ridding him of all these hidden compulsions task now accomplished at level vi this gives the scientologist useful insight into character sick being is one who has been bent upon violence and was suppressed or one who was bent upon constructiveness and was suppressed it also gives us whole span of new processes for level iii called auditing by lists available in hgcs or from informed field auditors this is quite in addition to what it does at level vi and it also tells us that one with obsessive intentions will ever make it to the highest and most powerful levels with disastrous inclinations but at the street level with processing involved we have these two basic typesgood and evil and these subdivide into the good who couldnt be good and became sick and the evil who couldnt be evil and became sick but these facts are more than philosophic observations they deliver to us understanding and more chance to be right about people and they give us as well the wide open door to making people well at level iii one cannot push research as i have done in the past year into the stratosphere without learning more at sea level also and this is what has happened here the basic travail of man is that he is divided into those who build and those who demolish and in this conflict of intentions his fight whichever side he is on is always lost or was lost until the scientologist came along l ron hubbard lrh glrd copyright 1964 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 7 april 1964 cenocon all levels q and great number of auditors q and this is because they have not understood what it is nearly all their auditing failures stem not from using wrong processes but from q and accordingly i have looked the matter over and redefined q and the origin of the term comes from changing when the pc changes the basic answer to question is obviously question if one follows the duplication of the comm formula completely see philadelphia congress 1953 tapes where this was covered very fully later definition was questioning the pcs answer another effort to overcome it and explain q was the antiq and drill but none of these reached home the new definition is this q and is failure to complete cycle of action on preclear cycle of action is redefined as startcontinuecomplete thus an auditing comm cycle is cycle of action it starts with the auditor asking question the preclear can understand getting the preclear to answer it and acknowledging that answer process cycle is selecting process to be run on the preclear running the tone arm action into it if necessary and running the tone arm action out of it programme cycle is selecting an action to be performed performing that action and completing it thus you can see that an auditor who interrupts or changes an auditing comm cycle before it is complete is q and aing this could be done by violating or preventing or not doing any part of the auditing cycle ie ask the pc question get an answer to different idea ask the different idea thus abandoning the original question an auditor who starts process just gets it going gets new idea because of pc cognition takes up the cognition and abandons the original process is q and aing programme such as prepcheck this pcs family is begun and for any reason left incomplete to go chasing some new idea to prepcheck is q and unfinished cycles of action are all that louse up cases since time is continuum failure to carry out cycle of action continuum hangs the pc up at that exact pointif you dont believe it prepcheck incomplete actions on pc what incomplete action has been suppressed etc cleaning the meter for real on every button and youd have clearor pc that would behave that way on meter understand this and youll be about ninety times as effective as an auditor dont q and means dont leave cycles of action incomplete on pc the gains you hope to achieve on pc are lost when you q and lrhdrrdcden l ron

who throw lots of complication and questions into learning the materials the instructors attitude should be very tough and very helpful he should be able to discriminate between student who is genuinely confused and is putting in some arbitrary of his own and student who is merely being an obstructionist the instructor must not be concerned with the students knowledge of inessentials but

sussex hco bulletin of 13 april 1964 sthil class vi scientology vi part one tone arm action summary of previous hco bulletins the state of case of the pc has nothing to do with getting tone arm action an auditor is in absolute control of the bankit always does what you tell it to do case must not be run without ta action or with minimal ta action if it didnt occur tone arm action has to have been prevented it doesnt just not occur the skill of an auditor is directly measured by the amount of ta he or she can get pcs are not more difficult one than another any pc can be made to produce ta but some auditors cut ta more than others the most vital necessity of auditing at any level of scientology is to get tone arm action not to worry the pc about it but just to get ta action not to find something that will get future ta but just to get ta now many auditors are still measuring their successes by things found or accomplished in the session though this is important too mainly at level iv it is secondary to tone arm action 1 get good tone arm action 2 get things done in the session to increase tone arm action and body motion doesnt count as ta without tone arm motion charge is being released and actual case betterment is observed beyond few somatics removed the pcs session goals stay the same the pcs life doesnt change the most correct track significances run but without ta action will not change but can deteriorate case it takes the right process correctly run to get ta action so dont underrate processes or the action of the auditor ta moving signals auditor not to act ta not moving signals auditor to act your enemy is overrestimulation of the pc as soon as the pc goes into more charge than he or she can itsa easily the ta slows down and as soon as the pc drowns in the over restimulation the ta stops clank unless destimulated case cant get rocket read or present the auditor with valid goal in doing r6 the silent auditor lets the pc itsa all over the whole track and causes over restimulation which locks up the ta but in lower levels of auditing inviting an itsa with silence is an ordinary actionas soon as you get into level vi auditing however on the pcs actual gpms the auditor has to be crisp and busy to get ta and silent idle auditor can mess up the pc and get very little ta level vi auditing finds the auditor smoothly letting the pc itsa ris and lists but the auditor going at it like small steam engine finding ris ris ris goals ris ris ris for the total ta in an r6 session only is proportional to the number of ris found without goofs wrong goals or other errors which rob ta action so the higher the level the more control of the pcs attention only in r6 where youre dead on the pcs gpms and the pc is allowed to say it is or isnt can you get ta good action out of listing and nulling and even then failure to let the pc say it is it can cut the ta down enormously in confirmation of auditors being too anxious to get in the itsa line themselves and not let the pc is the fad of using the meter as ouija board the auditor asks it questions continually and never asks the pc up the spout go divisions of ta is this item terminal the auditor asks the meter why not ask the pc if you ask the pc you get an itsa i think its an oppterm because_____ and the ta moves auditor failure to understand if pc says something and the auditor fails to understand what the pc said or meant the correct response is i did not hear you understand what was said get that last to do anything else is not only bad form it can amount to heavy arc break invalidation to say you did not speak loud enough_____ or any other use of you is an invalidation the pc is also thrown out of session by having responsibility hung on him or her the auditor is responsible for the session therefore the auditor has to assume responsibility for all comm breakdowns in it evaluation far more serious than invalidation above is the accidental evaluation which may occur when the auditor repeats what the pc said never repeat anything pc says after him matter why repeating not only does not show the pc you heard but makes him feel youre circuit but that isnt the main reason you do not repeat what the pc said after the pc if you say it wrong the pc is thrown into heavy protest the pc must correct the wrongness and hangs up right there it may take an hour to dig the pc out of itdirty needles if your pc has dirty needle its cause is cut itsa or an l1 session arc break other source such as wrong item or goal or earlier engrams or service fac bypassed charge can cause dirty needle if its dirty needle its cause lies in basic auditing not in technique errors this rule is invariable the apparent exception is the session arc break that keys in by passed technique charge all dirty needles are caused by the auditor failing to hear all the pc had to say in answering question or volunteering data charge is removed from case only by the comm cycle pc to auditor the auditors command restimulates charge in the pc the only way this charge can be blown is by the pc telling the auditor cleaning cleans the auditor who cleans clean meter is asking for trouble this is the same as asking pc for something that isnt there and develops withhold of nothing echo metering the pc says you missed suppress its_____ and the auditor reconsults the meter asking for suppress that leaves the pcs offering an undischarged charge never ask the meter after pc volunteers button example youve declared suppress clean pc gives you another suppress take it and dont ask suppress again thats echo metering if pc puts his own ruds in dont at once jump to the meter to put his ruds in that makes all his offerings missed charge echo metering is miserable auditing dont echo invalidate echo invalidation the pc gives an item the auditor calls it back to the pc and says it doesnt rr if this is kept up the pc will be put into state of sen that is appalling the right way to do this is as follows pc gives item auditor writes it down all items are written down that the pc gives an auditor never repeats items to the pc after the pc says them if the auditor doesnt understand he asks pc to spell it or if it is singular or plural dont fake an understanding the list must be accurateecho invalidation in which pc names an item and auditor says that isnt it is not just bad form but very vicious practice that leads to games condition the invalidation of each item makes the pc very dizzy and very desperate the pc sick and confused starts plunging in desperation for the right item and goes swiftly down tone and out of session high pc morale is vital to blowing charge and finding ris uphold the pcs morale dont begin echo invalidation meter invalidation an auditor who just sits and shakes his head didnt rocket read can give pc too many loses and deteriorate the pcs ability to run gpms in conflict between pc and meter take the pcs data why because protest and assert and mistake will also read on meter you can get these off but why create them your data comes from the pc and the meter always for anything and if the pcs data is invalidated you wont get meters data if the pc says he has ptp and the meter says he doesnt you take the pcs data that he does you take the pcs data never take his orders also minimize pcs dependency on meter dont keep confirming pcs data by meter read with that reads yes thats there yes theres rocket read the meter is not there to invalidate the pc the emeter registers charge very high or low tone arm sticky or dirty needle all are registrations of this charge the chronic meter of case is an index of chronic charge the fluctuations of meter during session are registering relative charge in different portions of the pcs time track more valuably the meter registers released charge you can see it blowing on the meter the disintegrating rr the blowing down of the ta the heavy falls the loosening needle all show charge being released the meter registers charge found and then charge released it registers charge found but not yet released by the needle getting tight by dn by climbing ta or ta going far below the clear read then as this cleans up the charge is seen to blow charge that is restimulated but not released causes the case to charge up in that charge already on the time track is triggered but is not yet viewed by the pc the whole cycle of restimulated charge that is then blown gives us the action of auditing when prior charge is restimulated but not located so that it can be blown we get arc breaks auditing selectively restimulates locates the charge and discharges it as seen on the action of moving tone arm the meter in actual fact does nothing but locate charged areas below the awareness of the pc and verify that the charge has been removed the meter cures nothing and does not treat it only assists the auditor in assisting the preclear to look and verify having looked meter dependence pc can be made more dependent upon the meter or can be made more independent of the meter all in the way meter is used by the auditormeter dependence is created by invalidation by or poor acknowledgement of the auditor if the auditor seems not to accept the pcs data then the pc may insist that the auditor see it read on the meter this can grow up into formidable meter dependence on the part of the pc pc must be carefully weaned of meter dependence not abruptly chopped off if pcs case is improving the pc becomes more independent of the meter this is the proper direction build up the pcs confidence in his own knowingness and continuously and progressively reduce the pcs dependence on meter as the pc gets along in running time track and gpms with their goals and reliable items he or she often becomes better than the meter as to what is right or wrong what is the goal what ri still reads charge charge the stored quantities of energy in the time track is the sole thing that is being relieved or removed by the auditor from the time track when this charge is present in huge amounts the time track overwhelms the pc and the pc is thrust below observation of the actual track the mechanism of permanent restimulation consists of opposing forces of comparable magnitude which cause balance which does not respond to current time and remains timeless such phenomena as the overt actmotivator sequence the problem postulate counter postulate tend to hold certain portions of the time track in permanent creation and cause them to continue to exist in present time as unresolved masses energies spaces times and significances the intention of the physical universe and those who have become degraded enough to further only its ends is to make thetan solid immobile and decisionless the fight of the thetan is to remain unsolid mobile or immobile at will and capable of decision this in itself is the principal unresolved problem and it itself creates timeless mass which accomplishes the basic purpose of trap bypassed charge bypassed charge does not always arc break but arc break always bypassed charge bypassed charge always exists in sessionit isnt until it is keyed in by some communication failure in session that it causes an arc break the source of all arc breaks is bypassed charge there is other source of arc breaks people do not arc break on known charge it is always the hidden or the earlier charge that causes the arc breakthe pc never knows why the arc break he may think he does and disclaim about it but the moment the actual reason is spotted the real missed area the arc break ceases all bypassed charge is in some degree missed withhold missed by both auditor and pc in session or handling the living lightning we handle people can be hit by forceful charge of which they are only minutely aware but which swamps them their affinity reality and communication life force is retarded or cut by this hidden charge and they react with what we call an arc break or have an arc broken aspect everything on the whole know to mystery scale that still lies above the pc finds the pc at effect these are all on automatic therefore the pc in an arc break is in the grip of the reaction which was in the incident now fully on automatic the pcs anger in the incident is not even seen or felt by the pc but the moment something slips the pc is in the grip of that emotion as an automaticity and becomes furious or apathetic or whatever toward the auditor as soon as the actual bypassed charge is found and recognized as the charge by the person up goes affinity and reality and communication and life can be lived the arc break the cycle of the arc break stage one the arc break starts always in the same way the pc finds something wrong with the auditor the subject or tools of auditing or the auditing room he does this in varying intensity arc break to arc break stage two this is followed by misemotion also directed at the auditor subject tools or room stage three if the auditor continues on with auditing the pc will drop into grief sadness or apathy this is an inevitable cycle and may be followed by the pc with greater or lesser intensity of emotion or loudness or lack of response in r6 when the pc criticizes or attacks the auditor or goes into grief or apathy an r6 error has just occurred the auditor must ignore the pcs statements as to the cause of the arc break and quickly remedy the r6 and do nothing else the common denominator of all r6 arc breaks consists of missed or wrongly designated gpm goal or reliable item there are other sources of r6 arc breaks bad sessioning poor auditing ordinary life missed withholds are only contributive to r6 arc breaks and are incapable of doing more than keying in and intensifying the magnitude of the arc break which has already been caused by errors in r6arc break rule 1 if the pc arc breaks issue further auditing commands until both pc and auditor are satisfied that the cause of the arc break has been located and indicated do not issue more orders do not run process do not offer to run process do not sit idly letting the pc arc break follow this rule arc break rule 2 when pc arc breaks or cant go on for any reason do an arc break assessment and locate and indicate to the pc the bypassed charge if you know youve missed goal or ri just saying so prevents any arc break dont bypass charge unknown to the pc arc break assessment the meter is invaluable in locating bypassed charge and curing an arc break the trick is to find and indicate the right bypassed charge to the pc and to handle it when possible but never fail to indicate it it is then up to the auditor to locate it more precisely as to character and time and indicate it to the pc the pc will feel better the moment the right type of bypassed charge is identified by assessment and indicated by the auditor if the pc does not feel better but further arc breaks then the assessment is either incomplete or incorrect if the pc blows up in your face on being given type of charge keep going as you have not yet found the charge you can however undo session arc break assessment by continuing beyond the pcs cognition of what it is continuing an assessment after the pc has cognited invalidates the pcs cognition and cuts the itsa line and may cause new arc break several bypassed charges can exist and be found on one list sometimes in trying to locate the bypassed charge causing an arc break the pcs needle is so dirty that it almost cant be read however there is way to read it when the correct bypassed charge is located and indicated the needle will go beautifully clean but it can be done without meter just by letting the pc think over each line read to him or her from the arc break assessment and say whether it is or isnt and if it is spotting the thing bypassed dont ever be reasonable about an arc break and think the pc is perfectly right to be having one because if that arc break exists the pc doesnt know whats causing it and neither do you until you and the pc find it if you and the pc knew what was causing it there would be further arc break arc breaks are inevitable they will happen q and arc breaks q and causes arc breaks by bypassing chargehow the pc says something the auditor does not understand or acknowledge therefore the pcs utterance becomes bypassed charge generated by whatever he or she is trying to release as the auditor ignores it and the pc reasserts it the original utterances charge is built up and up finally the pc will start issuing orders in frantic effort to get rid of the missed charge this is the source of pc orders to the auditor understand and acknowledge the pc take the pcs data dont pester the pc for more data when the pc is offering data learn to see if the pc has said everything he or she wants to say before the next auditor action never do new auditor action while or if the pc wants to speak and youll get superior ta action cut the pc off get in more actions than the pc is allowed to answer and youll have dirty needle then stuck ta and then an arc break realize that the answering of the process question is senior to the asking of another process question watch the pcs eyes dont take auditing actions if the pc is not looking at you dont give acknowledgements that arent needed overacknowledgement means acknowledging before the pc has said all pc tone the pc rises in tone up to the lower levels of the tone scale he or she comes up to degradation up to apathy and it often feels horrible and unlike an arc break and the sad effect is not cured except by more of the same processing then suddenly they realize that they have come up to being able to feel bad they even come up to feeling pain and all

meter and note the level of the pcs havingness dont run hav here 4 put in r factor by telling pc briefly what you are going to do in the session start of session 5 is it all right with you if i begin this session now start of session tone 40 has this session started for you if pc says say again start of session now has this session started for you if pc says say we will cover it in moment rudiments 6 what goals would you like to set for this session please note that life or livingness goals have been omitted as they tend to remind the pc of present time difficulties and tend to take his attention out of the session 7 at this point in the session there are actions which could be undertaken the running of general ow or the running of mid rudiments using since the last time i audited you or pull missed whs as indicated but if pc cheerful and needle smooth just get down to work one would run general ow if the pc was emotionally upset at the beginning of the session or if the session did not start for the pc the latter being simply another indication of the pcs being upset or arc broken but these symptoms must be present as sometimes the session hasnt started merely because of poor tone 40 or because the pc had something he wanted to say before the auditor started the session running owif it is all right with you i am going to run short general process the process is what have you done what have you withheld the process is run very permissively until the needle looks smooth and the pc is longer emotionally disturbed where are you now on the time track if it is all right with you i will continue this process until you are close to present time and then end this process after each command ask when that was the last command is there anything you would care to ask or say before i end this process end of process running the mid rudiments one would use the middle rudiments with since the last time i audited you if the needle was rough and if the tone arm was in higher position than it was at the end of the last session order of buttons here is the correct wording and order of use for the big mid ruds has anything been suppressed is there anything you have been careful of is there anything you have failed to reveal has anything been invalidated has anything been suggested has any mistake been made has anything been protested is there anything you have been anxious about has anything been decided in using the first three buttons suppressed careful of and failed to reveal the rudiment question should be asked directly of the pc off the meter repetitive when the pc has more answers check the question on the meter if the question reads stick with it on the meter like in fast rud checking until it is clean the last six buttons are cleaned directly on the meter as in fast ruds pulling missed withholds use since the last time you were audited has withhold been missed on you since the last time you were audited is there anything someone failed to find out about you since the last time you were audited has someone nearly found out something about youbody of session 8 now go into the body of the session end body of session 9 is it all right with you if we end the body of the session now is there anything you would care to ask or say before i do end of the body of the session smooth out session 10 smooth out any roughness in the session if there has been any favouring suppress failed to reveal protest decide overts assert using prefix in this session_____ goals gains 11 have you made any of these goals for this session thank you for making these goals for this session or thank you for making some of these goals for this session im sorry you didnt make all of them or im sorry you didnt make these goals for this session have you made any gains in this session that you would care to mention thank you for making these gains for this session or im sorry you didnt make any gains for this session havingness 12 after adjusting the meter put your hands in your lap please squeeze the cans if the squeeze test was not all right the auditor would run the pcs havingness process until the can squeeze gives an adequate response ending session 13 is there anything you would care to ask or say before i end this session 14 is it all right with you if i end this session now 15 end of session tone 40 has this session ended for you if the pc says repeat end of session if the session still has not ended say you will be getting more auditing end of session tell i am longer auditing you please note that havingness is run after goals and gains as this tends to bring the pc more into present time and to take his attention to degree out of the session wording for the above follows the tradition of earlier model sessions adhere severely to this session form it is nearly an irreducible minimum and is very fast but it is all necessary the random rudiment here is what happened session mid ruds are simply protest

auditing by lists the earlier genus of this process was sec checking on the joburg with reference to these i recently developed for level iii process called auditing by lists any list can be used as preview to the process i asked staff member roger biddell to use list one and list four normally used for arc breaks at level iv their questions were generalized instead of have i _____ has there been _____ was used otherwise the question remained the same as given in the hco bulletin for l 1 and l4 he ran the process for some hours on preclear with excellent results and summarized my verbal and written instructions as applied auditing by lists l 1 and l4 use meter at sensitivity 16 use arc break assessment lists 1 and 4 the questions asked are generalized and without time limiters ie has withhold been missed have you been given wrong goal etc begin with list 1 ask the first line of this list while watching the meter for an instant read if the line does not read say thats clean and move on to the next line of the list and do the same action with this new line if the pc has something to say about line that is clean let him say it acknowledge it and then you ask the next line dont q and if the line when asked has an instant read say that reads then what do you consider this could be or what considerations do you have about this let the pc answer all he wants to while he is giving his considerations mark down any blowdowns of the ta and what he was talking of at the moment of the blowdown when the pc has given all his considerations say thank you ill check the line on the meter and call the line again if it instant reads say theres another read here then again ask for considerations etc continue these actions until the line goes clean when clean say thats clean then of what you have told on this line what do you consider the main thing to be here awhen pc has answered say thank you then i want to indicate that the meter gave us our biggest blowdown on_____and that charge had been bypassed on this and in the blank state the subject that gave the biggest blowdown when the pc talked about it if blowdown then it seems that the main thing here is _____ and give what pc stated in answer to then move on to the next line when list 1 is completed do list 4 then list 1 then list 4 and so on if running correctly the ta total should increase from session to session the pc should get more and more blowdowns on his considerations then he should get blowdowns on what he considers the main thing is and finally get blowdowns on your indication of the bypassed charge dont q and dont take up or do anything with the pcs considerations dont ever say that still reads its always another read as it still reads makes the pc feel he has not answered

standing apart from and monitoring the body of scientology having to do with how you figure it out excalibur was whole bookfull some of these maxims are in dianetics the evolution of science these maxims give the rationale and the how of how you figure it out every once in awhile one of them gives you grip on existence for instance one maxim was take body of knowledge that has produced bad effects and results you move it out and pay further attention to it you can eventually corral the truth by elimination by this approach you use this all the time when analyzing cases you see what didnt work so you dont run the pc on that the reverse maxim doesnt happen to be workable something having been true in one instance doesnt prove that it has any wide workability auditors who dont realize this get stuck in win with some offbeat process or approach and wind up with failures in trying to pilot way through the goals plot when items read one day and not the next when they checked out and then turned out to be something else lrh had datum to cover the situation problem is as complex as it presents potential solutions it is the number of solutions not their complexity that determines the complexity of problem this defeats the idea of the one shot clear beautiful though the dream may be the problem of government must be terribly complex since it has had many many solutions it is not that big solution equals big problem it is that complex problem equals many solutions this could be the situation that you are faced with when pc doesnt respond well to processing it could be that you have complex case on your hands that will only be resolved by complexity of processes if persons problem in life has required many solutions then it must be very complex and will require complexity of processes to resolve simple solutions dont work on complex problems you dont resolve all political problems by voting democratic there is another maxim solution must be as complex as the potentials of the problem in this context potentials means threats along the dynamics here you are talking about dangerous problem for instance problem that has the potential of knocking out survival along various fronts is big problem you will get defeated if you offer simple solution if person has dangerous problem and you give him simple solution he will reject it problems that are simple dont become dangerous only complex ones do they require complex solutions if this were not the case the person would have solved the problem already problem wouldnt be dangerous if the problem hadnt been allowed to coast along pretty far the proper course of action in handling problem is to find out all aspects of the problem that must be solved there are bound to be some that are not apparent at first find how many solutions will be needed you could look it over by dynamics the procedure is 1 get what the immediate pressure is indicate that there has to be solution 2 get the situation differentiated out into its component problems indicate the necessity for solution for each this takes the confusion out of the situation just getting the guy to sort it out makes him feel better because he can now at least see the area better also you have put the buffer of needed solution in front of every element of it the pc will be half way handled just by that action then you can find solutions on gradient he could start gradiently to see which problem could be solved now this makes level 0 breeze when it is usually rough level 0 is rough because most peoples problems are so big that they dont know they have them they dont look at the importances in their vicinity at all man is in this condition because solutions have been possible simple solutions to complex problems fail the international city idea isgood and complicated it has to be because of the size of the problem that it is trying to solve the usual solution vote republican is utterly useless as you go up the levels it may appear that you are confronting more complex problems but actually both problems and solutions become simpler as you go up the levels as you go up you are actually confronted with fewer problems and fewer demanded solutions the psychologist and psychiatrist think that you go down through mans psyche to the bottom they are wrong you are there you have to go up to heightened awareness person on his way up has to get more and aware of kinds of awareness and of existence his only route is up psychiatrists think that you have to go down in mans psyche to get to rockbottom motivations etc through three or four subvolitional layers this is untrue you dont go down in mans psyche you are there there isnt any hidden deep motivation all you have left is the individual and he is motivated you have to go to higher levels this fellow hasnt got an unconscious to be probed he is unconscious the psychiatrists are looking for the wrong thing they are looking for the hidden depths below guys level of awareness those deeper levels of unconsciousness that they are looking for are sitting in the chair right in front of them it is not the recesses that are hidden you cant get the individual further down with drugs etc and learn anything in order to discover anything about the individual youve got to make the individual more aware not make him less aware in order to find out more about him psychiatrists are asking the fireman in ship to help them find the fireman and the fireman having lost his identity and beingness will willingly try to help out by looking for himself you are looking for mans spirit but he is the spirit thetans increasing awareness of his beingness his awareness of existence and the problems and solutions of life are what delineate the seven levels of processing you could draw up the levels just by asking people at various levels what is problem to you if persons awareness of his relationship to existence is increased you can bring about heightened condition of livingness performance ability etc and that is the only way to do it regardless of claims for drug enlightenment or high performance on drugs drugs reduce awareness people can think that they perform better when drunk or drugged that is because they are less aware of their condition the logic that if we became little less conscious we would be lot better off has been extant since the beginning of this universe the final solution to problems has been to become unaware of them the penultimate solution is im doing right the assumption that whatever you are doing is right so if someone wants to improve himself he has two courses 1 to become more aware 2 to become less aware and hope that you dont get run over the latter is treacherous it is hoping that everything will be all right hope substitutes for control confront awareness and certainty ill just forget about it and hope that it doesnt bother ill become less aware is the idea for instance women in the 19th century fainted as solution this is like the black panther mechanism only worse because one is not simply ignoring the black panther one is becoming unaware people get somewhat terrified when you reverse the flow on them and get them to confront all the things of which they have become unaware the trick of becoming unaware is that you never actually get there this universe is progress towards less and less awareness its the route to total sleep and the trick is that its so rigged that you never get to sleep the lower you go the more problems youve got because now the littler problems seem bigger becoming unaware of the big problem brought the thetan less power or force it reduced his confront so now he is less able to confront little problems so the little problem now seems as big as the big problem seemed one stage back it seems far more threatening the power and threat of the big problem is vested now in the smaller one there was bigger problem of the same gradient that he had ceased to confront say gale he became unaware of it almost purposely and this put him into confront only of slight wind but the big problem was full of terror so the breeze is full of terror there isthe trick of uncovering hidden memories occasionally you can uncover memory by trickery and increase the pcs awareness slightly and he will lose little fear but it doesnt improve his condition much he just shifts to another fear symptom substitution all little fears are irrational and are based on bigger fear freud pointed this out this happens because the individual solves the bigger fear by becoming less aware you can find the bigger fear that caused the lesser fear this is what freud was looking for but you can also throw the pc into the bigger fear and knock him for loop by not bailing him out you mustnt increase persons awareness beyond his ability to confront he has the choice either to cognite or to bolt he is very likely to bolt that is why analysands commit suicide in analysis when they do dont process by reaching into the deeper states to find the fears that motivate this individual there is deeper subconscious for the individual to go into if you exteriorize person without taking off the charge of why he was in his head if you take him out of his head and make him confront problems that he had gone into his head not to have to confront you will find that now you cant get him out again with can opener you can put someone into higher level of awareness he now becomes aware of the problems that he has not handled this alone makes it necessary for him to progress by gradients you will make it as long as you let him sit down for awhile and enjoy the view he is victim of selfcreated charge great masses of it when he gets more aware he backs off from it you have to take charge off by getting ta action then he can easily move up to where you can get more charge off it is not spectacular activity as the pc moves up the line his problems look bigger but only because he can see more reduce the complexity of the problem by reducing yesterdays solutions this is the key to processing person at level 0 has dangerous problems and must have complex solutions how do we get around all this the old solution is what he is sick from cures cures cures it is use to solve somebodys problems for him what gets us away from this is that we arent giving people solutions the basic error is the most fundamental part of the problem that can be asised because of the chain of solutions as an auditor you are not giving the pc new solutions for his livingness you are taking out of existence old solutions which now exist in the form of problems youre asising what has been solved in the past and caused the person to become more unaware youre asising old problems you are asising past solvents you are backtracking the way he came down running solutions is running yesterdays problems you are taking out the old think that made him drop doing and be unaware on r1c and r1cm this is r1c with the meter you follow the bd after you complete the cycle of action you were on see p 623 below you are backing the pc through yesterdays problems by getting his solutions if you run such thing as problem you are running it below its proper level of awareness here is the trick problem by definition is something that you cant confront and solution is way by which you dont have to confront something so your effort to handle the problem is to solve it and if the way in which you solve it is to become less aware of it you have moved into lower awareness levels you are looking at yesterdays solutions whether you are running problems or solutions you are actually running solutions when you ask for problems you are asking for something that the pc couldnt confront when you ask for solutions you are asking for something that the pc could confront running problems requires you to confront only the pcs noconfront therefore you dont run problems you run solutions which latter really are problems but which can be confronted its the difference between running noconfront and confront though you are actually running the same thing from different point of view if you call them problems then you are saying the individual couldnt confront them if you call them solutions then you are saying he could so when you run solutions you get rid of the problems that he sets up to avoid confronting things by backtracking his solutions when you do this the pc becomes more aware and more capable of confronting up to the point where he can confront the problems that made him decide to become unaware in the firstplace and he finds that those in turn were solutions so he finds out what that was solution for etc and he is all set to move on out to freedom this way out is route 2 this principle holds true all the way up gpms were very complex solutions which must have had complex problems behind them the main problem was an unwillingness to confront so you dont ask the pc to confront it all at once you do it gradiently that is why levels are there they are there on the basis that the individual at any given time is at his lowest level of awareness you bring him up from there not down you reduce the complexity of the problem by reducing yesterdays solutions youve got to walk him back up into further awareness for him to hold his own in the environment he has now entered that is how to process someone that is why manic sometimes turns on where the pc gets boosted up bit too high for him at particular time so realize that you are getting off the charge that debars the individual from confronting the problems that he has the most complex being you will confront is the lowestlevel pc if you reduce the complexity of the problem by asising yesterdays complex solutions you can get charge off and the pc can act better now because his awareness level came up when you first ask for datum you wont get it but you will get off charge then when you ask for the datum again since you have gotten charge off the area you will get it this is how processing works the road into this universe is successive unawarenesses and the road out is successive awarenesses he got himself into trouble by solving himself into trouble there are lower levels of awareness for you to explore there are only upper levels the road out is not spectacular you take the pc out via the road he came in successive unawarenesses undonet h u d i t r the saint hill journal of the auditors division issue 1 may 1964 the workability of scientology by l ron hubbard its the little things that make scientology work not the big crashing reasons why the preclears mind isnt perfect it isnt finding whats wrong with the preclear that really counts its the auditors craftsmanlike attention to the little points of auditing that makes for big gains just one effective received acknowledgment that makes the preclear know hes been acknowledged may be worth dozen processes an auditor becomes an auditor when he or she finds out that its the basics that count and this can be very hard to teach the auditor who is so sure that all the errors are explained by the condition of the preclear seldom gets results and its results that count you can get results with scientology and get them rather easily too so long as you know that the way the auditing is administered to the preclear is more important than the process run an auditor who consistently fails to get results is always the auditor who is most sure that all the errors for failure lay with the preclear or scientology and never with the auditors own basics how difficult it is to see oneself how easy it is to blame the other fellow when i first started to teach by selfappreciation of ones own auditing here on the saint hill course even the most veteran auditors were completely baulked they have surmounted this now but it was mighty high hurdle for while the saga of it was quite funny i had the auditor give session which was recorded on tape then i had the auditor listen to his own session to find out his or her errors in basics well you should have seen some of the early reports i got i even did an hco bulletin to show what to look for but to avail some reports gave the session command by command some gave all the preclears errors some went russianesque in how horrible i am but at first nobody just nobody caught on let give you the example of the first test made to show what i mean i taped session noting needle action and condition of the preclear during session then i listened to the tape and i found that every time the auditor had gotten dirty needle or bad reaction from the preclear the auditor some minutes or seconds before had slipped up on his basics in other words i found that these basic errors were causing all the bad preclear reactions i found that the auditor made the session always and the preclear never the preclear got better because the auditor audited with smooth basics or got roughed up because the basics skidded bita slipup on an acknowledgment an overhasty command failure to let the preclear fully answer the question seconds or minutes later bad reaction appeared in the preclearas result of such studies of taped sessions my complete conclusion is that it is only the auditors handling of the session that makes the session there is nobody and nothing else to blame because the preclears bad reaction comes later than the auditors skid in the basics the auditor often does not connect his error with the preclears reaction and thinks it is just the way the preclear is youd think this would be easy to learn but student reports continued to come in about their taped sessions that completely avoided the point these reports described anything and everything except the auditor as cause examples the session went badly because the preclear had had sleep the session was slow because the preclear had present time problem it was late in the evening and the preclear always has high tone arm after 9 00 pm the instructor had given another process so when i tried to change the preclear got upset this preclear is always critical of auditors i had to end off because the preclear was upset horrible in case was the auditor making the session the session always depended on outer influences next thing id have heard we didnt have good session because the stars were not in the preclears favor then some light began to dawn here and there and they started to make it the students began to see that the failure of the preclear to progress was due to auditor errors not preclear meanness and these are the things the students learned the preclears upset is traced back to failure to acknowledge well to chopping the preclears communication to failure to give the preclear something to answer to evaluation to invalidationnot to the late hour or the position of saturn an auditing session is made it doesnt just happen arc breaks are constructed out of bad basics failures to improve preclear begin with failures to do good trs an auditing session gets wins only when the auditor is right there running it and running it smoothly the whole essence of auditing is not finding what is wrong with the preclear and hammering at it thats medicalsurgical approach not way to betterment the essence of auditing is arc handled and controlled by the auditor the auditor gives the preclear something to answer the preclear answers it and when the preclear has answered it to his or her satisfaction the auditor acknowledges it thats auditing thats why auditing works thats why the tone arm moves thats why the preclear gets better but that simple cycle can have thousand ways to go wrong the auditor gives the preclear something the preclear doesnt understand and cant answer the preclear isnt permitted to complete his or her answer the preclear answers fully and then never gets acknowledged for it and rambles on those are the things selfappreciation of ones auditing should reveal scientology has been getting fine results for dozen years in the hands of good auditor there are big case failures so it isnt the techniques its this what is good auditor good auditor is one who knows scientology and its techniques and who audits with all basics in thats primary thing we stress in training here at saint hilla good auditor gives the preclear something to do that the preclear can do lets the preclear do it and when the preclear has acknowledges well that the preclear has done it and promptly gives the preclear something to do good auditor never evaluates or invalidates good auditor understands what the preclear has said and never goes on until he or she has understood what the preclear said technically skilled auditor can choose the very best processes but unless these are run with all basics in the wins are few thats why i started the saint hill courseto make good auditors become good auditors who could also make good auditors its been successful in the extreme here at saint hill but its still battle with basics for whatever else an auditor must know about the mind however valid the technology it takes plain downtoearth good auditing to pull preclears through for the only reason any process works is the auditors handling of the session and the basics of the auditing cycle record some of session you give on tape note the rough spots for the preclear in the session while you give it play back the tape in private and spot exactly where and how each subsequent rough spot was caused by the failure of the auditor to observe basics suddenly it shows up like crashed airplane at picnic the auditor caused those rough bits the preclear went throughand the auditor caused them by failing to observe the simple basics there may be lots of other reasons too but these dont give the preclear rough time they only make the pcs progress fast or slow preclears dont fail because scientology doesnt work preclears fail only when scientology isnt administered with all basics inhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 19 may 1964

deter the completion of auditing cycles already begun 6 failure to complete the auditing comm cycle on any part of model session l ron hubbard lrh jwrd copyright 1964 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6405c19 shspec20 the pc and getting auditing to work any auditor who is having hard time making auditing work has mystery about how auditing can occur whether he knows it or not he has assigned some value to auditing that is different from and extraneous to the actual value of auditing he looks for something more complicated than what is there if student is having trouble third of the time it will resolve if you ask him why auditing doesnt work and remove that barrier to his understanding of why it does work the session will be unmanageable to the auditor if he has trouble with his comm cycle doesnt understand why auditing works and the pc introduces normal or extreme amounts of randomity into the session with his own outcommcycle as an instructor you have to get as much confusion out of this as possible person who cant get auditing to work is likely to have hidden standards you can ask why doesnt auditing work and why does auditing work and 2wc it person cant understand why it works because he understands why it doesnt work and he is caught in this discussing why auditing doesnt work is not quite auditing because you are taking ta blowdowns on what he has told you and getting him to relate these blowdowns to the question of why auditing doesnt work you are steering him towards cognition that will straighten out his auditing another third of the time you can fix the erring auditor by getting him to discuss help you do rot get him to discuss failed help because you will run into the line plot he may spot some weird stable datum on help that impedes his ability to help or be helped take up whatever bds you get independently and clean them up so he will start using the comm cycle the comm cycle is almost too easy to use as long as the auditors intention towards the pc is good and he is trying to assist the pc the things that make person unable to use the comm cycle are those things that make person believe that he cannot or should not assist pcs who get ta action also have one of these buttons awry so this procedure works well on pcs too the third category is more esoteric it is very interesting it could be called life among the lowly this was the subtitle of uncle toms cabin people who are being hounded by life who are under duress tend to offer up supersympathy and grief at the same time that they are knocking someones head off there is mechanism here by which the lowly hold the lowly down which is pretty vicious it is the poor you mechanism how you he or they were wronged it is the victim syndrome you are victim this is the common denominator of sociology it is why someone can never get out of the slum it is how people get trapped we had this ourselves in the early days of dianetics lrh got away from it seeing that if you cant take responsibility for your own actions if you cant recognize the cause of your own difficulties then you are in trap and will continue in trap forevermore for any war against poverty to be effective it would have to contain an understanding of why people in groups remain poor an individual must accept his own responsibility and his own ability as cause before he can run off his overts you cant get off overts if you cant recognize yourself as cause you cant get out of rat race unless you recognize your overts you keep someone in rat race if you dont let him recognize his overts eg by saying poor you look how you have been wronged you are telling the person that he was incapable of cause you are directing his attention to moments when he was not at cause and pointing out to him that he doesnt cause things they just happen to him you put him into the dwindling spiral and hold him on the bottom of the heap forever by convincing him that he has been wronged and that he himself never wronged anybody you never had chance how does person become obsessed with problem obsessed with problem describes 90 of your pcs they are stuck in some problem via the om sequence they never recognize their own overt in the area so they get stuck in it there are several systems that can be used to unpin them chief among these is the ow system you cant get your hand cut offin buzzsaw without reaching for the buzzsaw and somehow putting yourself in the vicinity of the buzzsaw invented overts as in guilt complex that is just another alteris so watch out for this and be sure that the pc doesnt give you untruths all dwellingness on subject is associated with overts against that subject you cure it with one or another version of ow this is something that is part and parcel of life which is senior in its power even to gpms you could be free of gpms and still be subject to the consequences of your overts so it is always safe and indicated to audit ow auditors do this industriously but not always well they can make complete mess of it chopping comm cycles buying trivia as overts having mutual outruds etc the reason tacit consent enters auditing when it does is because of the victim syndrome mentioned above it has entered the session to some degree when this happens there is some thread of poor you youve been wronged in the session if the auditor sits there and buys motivators he is not auditing the pc at cause he is auditing the pc at effect and so the pc will not get better nothing can hold onto thetan if he gets caught he must have grabbed hold and forgotten that he has grabbed hold to be trapped what he grabbed hold with is overts it is his own actual gpms that are holding him if you dont get him to spot his overts you are dramatizing life amongst the lowly the reason why people cannot get out of slums the victim syndrome slums operate on the basis of you cant do anything about it luck is all that can help how you have been wronged etc that is why you see numbers rackets and lucky charms in slums you cant do anything is the message of social welfare labor relations the war on poverty etc thetan basically doesnt want to commit overt acts when he does commit them he pulls himself back and withholds himself how does this affect the auditor who cant audit it is not as simple as they believe that they have been wronged so you have to get their overts off it is that this person has been so wronged that he has longer any concept of an overt the christian ran into this from another angle with the idea of repentance he wanted people to admit guilt which is an inversion people get off false overts in an effort to repent enough this doesnt free them the guilt complex leads to an inversion where the person isnt getting off actual overts but is really bragging about overts that he would never have the guts to commit dont let the pc do this check for untruths if guy is in victim valence you get him to define an overt act and then get him to tell you why it isnt an overt you will get an automaticity there is reality on it as an overt act so you have to follow the reality scale and find something possibly quite mild that he knows and feels is real overt act do this on discussion basis getting why it wasnt an overt act not as an auditing action once you get something the person really considers to have been an overt act you might run out his justifications for having done it see hcob 7ju164 scientology iii and iv justifications and hcob 8ju164 scientology iii and iv more justifications you then proceed on gradient nobody in prison has ever committed crime6406c09 shspec22 the cycle of action its interpretation on the emeter the most confused maligned area around is the auditor and the cycle of action it is difficult subject because it is all over the gpms it is not natural you scientologists being cut above the naturalness of normality of course see something slightly wrong in the whole idea of time and its forward progress in his auditing lrh found himself in an interesting state looking at zero or absence of time he found it not wholly pleasant because without time there is lot of other stuff missing he had pressure on the face that turned out to be not from something but from utter nothingness there this was very peculiar it was an escape from the timestream which at the same time was more natural than being in the timestream at one time thetan was quite capable of moving back in time to straighten out goofs then he slipped into the time stream and has been moving along with it ever since you therefore have natural antipathy for the idea that time is there or that something has beginning middle and an end because this cycle is an authoritative action laid down by time but you are processing in the physical universe through and across the agreement of the physical universe you are apparently going along with the timestream and processing bank that lays the time stream in with an axe you are trying to resolve subject the bank that is cycles of action to terrible degree mary baker eddy erred by shooting for too high gradient as long as you are processing through mest you must take account of the cycle of action even though it is not true at the highest levels unless you pay attention to this you jam the bank and the pc will get into horrible difficulties high ta etc the proper precise order of things is very important particularly at lower levels of things especially with regard to the bank the bank is fiendishly precise the pc has to come up through confusion to confront this much order one of the keynotes of order and the bank is that things have beginning continue and have an end there the cycle of action is violated in the pc the order of his bank is violated and therefore it doesnt asis so the road out follows the cycle of action where the auditor has nothing to do with the cycle of action he has trouble because he has thrown the pc below the fiendish demands of the bank we have found empirically that what you have to do is to parallel the cycle of action there is detriment involved in doing so every time you process pc without paying attention to the cycle of action you are processing the pc against the bank as result the bank will jam which will be manifested on the emeter as high ta and badly acting needle pc who is not running well has first and foremost violated the cycle of action this is broad enough statement to be fairly meaningless unless you get more details you could also say that the reason case isnt living right is that the cycle of action is being violated there are two ways in which cycle of action can be violated in life 1 too slavish an obedience to it where the individual was out of agreement with it in the first place but is forced to follow it 2 ignoring it all the blessings of the machine age lie in the first zone dont follow cycle of action to the extent of overwhelming someones power of choice oddly enough there is one zone where persons power of choice can be overthrown and he can be improved by following cycle of action repeatedly to point where the person is used to it you will then begin to asis enough bank to compensate for the loss of power of choice that you started with which will when return you could force pc through sop 8c against his power of choice but only so long as you repeated the cycle of action it isnt the persons power of choice that gives him reactivity power of choice and selfdeterminism get imprisoned in reactivity cycle of action is the prison so following and running and running out cycle of action will bring about nothing but freeing of power of choice whether the pc consents to it or not you have the determinism of the thetan his power of choice versus the fiendish cycle of action and precision of the bank and this universe the biggest overwhelm and loss of power of choice inthis universe is in time this universe is trap because having started here you inevitably get to there that is an overwhelm because there is nothing that you can do about it the thetan knows that wherever he may be in space at 855 in ten minutes he will be at 905 matter how much he protests you can do something about being moved in space so space is less overwhelming hence movement in space from point to point b is smaller gradient you can approximate the action of time with the cycle of action progress through time is paralleled by the cycle of action it is very close to process you might call make some time this is very funny process you can start the pc at point and move him to point b and have him run into confusion between distance and time he has the illusion of moving through time in doing this drill one differentiates space from time and thus obtains new level of observation and freedom this improves the individuals power of choice at least to the degree that he has increased freedom to observe as person gets out of overwhelm relative to something he can perceive what is happening to it instead of what it is doing to him ow in its essence has never been understood ow is not lesson in morality it is lesson in causality it is really lesson in what power of choice have you exercised in life however it is hard to get someone to admit that he has done something wrong because society tries to get him to restrain admission of overts which is big overwhelm justifications refute the cause of the individual to justify is to state that one had power of choice and therefore not being responsible committed overt in running justifications you are getting the pc to own up to having been cause when you go for overts you are going up against the social mores as the point of overwhelm you just choose this as the point of overwhelm society tries to get the individual to withhold overts in an effort to suppress him in lower level processing youre choosing society as the point of overwhelm of the pc and you are running ow you want the individuals revolts against this overwhelm as an expression of his power of choice some point of agreement with society can be found in the course of running ow that will undo attention from society the mechanism is 1 one does things 2 one cant own up to them 3 one then gets caved in on because of this you could ask what third dynamic activity have you gone along with weirdly enough this would eventually lead into overt acts the individual gets free to the degree that he can step back and look at the situation when we apply this sort of process to the sixth dynamic we get much more subtle level one that is much less easily perceived freedom from the timestream freedom from the cycle of action time and the cycle of action are so woven into the pc regradless of what level he is at that even your address to the third dynamic junior though it is to the sixth dynamic is involved with the sixth dynamic the pc is shooting someone across space standing on matter in an action across time there is sixth dynamic agreement that is overwhelming this is going on matter what the pc is doing so in processing person if you violate that to an enormous degree by outcyclesofaction the person wont know what it is that is being violated but his tolerance of that violation is terrible there are quits few cycles of action that you could violate one is the auditing comm cycle that is the first one that shows up on meter even on lowlevel pc the dirty needle you get expresses the jamup of energy in the pcs bank because of the violation of that cycle of action there is disagreement with the reactive bank when the cycle of action is violated the meter measures energy manifestations taking place in the pcs bankif the pc has one erg of attention or awareness and you are asking him to confront 8000 gallons of reality he wont be able to do it for instance if you take nonscientologist and tell him that he is the source of all his problems he cant confront it on the other hand if guy has tons of awareness or attention available and you ask him to confront one pint of reality he is going to view it as pretty unimportant just look at the horrible conflict between russia and the us yes well what about it so what when the individuals attention level and the reality to be perceived are more or less balanced cognitions occur you could violate some things which wouldnt be expressed on the meter because they would be above the pcs reality but violating the comm cycle will be real to the pc another cycle of action that you could violate is process cycle of action this one is expressed not on the needle but on the ta so 1 the auditing comm cycle is expressed on the needle 2 process cycle of action is expressed on the tone arm if you get ta motion on something you have found an overwhelm that the pc can potentially get on top of providing that you dont leave him in state of halfoverwhelm but complete the process cycle if you get ta going on some subject or area and keep on the subject until there is more ta action you have done completed cycle of action on the subject at that point the pc will longer be overwhelmed by the subject if the subject is real to him at all it will register on the ta at least slightly and the pc will be able to overcome the overwhelm that he has experienced in that area he will process to wins as long as you dont leave him in state of halfoverwhelm on the subject by failing to complete the cycle of action he will object to not being brought through it and the meter will react by freezing up it wont freeze up immediately but it will freeze up as you continue to leave unflat processes behind you can go on past the point where ta action has ceased people dont usually err in this direction more often they take an hour to get the subject in full view and the ta well started and then they quit this goes against both the pcs selfdeterminism and the cycle of action of the bank which is what locks up the ta the trick is to find the point at which ta action ceases if the pc is stuck you can go back through his folder and complete the old cycles of action that were incomplete when you do this the bank will unjam dont ask yourself what will produce ta action on this pc that is an easy question what you should be asking is what has produced ta action process in the direction of arc let the pc tell you about his problems long enough to find something that moves the ta and then get into that with an inarc process or something about solutions always flatten what has moved the ta matter how long ago it happened flatten what you get ta motion on this cycle of action is the only zone or area where you can overwhelm the pcs power of choice legitimately dont evaluate for him but finish your cycles of action you can be smooth and slippy about it direct the pcs attention back into the area and run the process to flat point find out what is real to the pc before you start by getting him to itsa on anything and watching for ta eg on the white form if you are having trouble getting ta on new pc and you cant find any unflat processes from his earlier auditing you still want to know what has given ta action if it wasnt an earlier process or something in life suspect immediately that the pc was involved in some other practice analogous to scientology that did get ta but was left unflat now crank up the sensitivity to 128 and ask what other mental practice have you been in and watch the needle like hawk be specific ask all kinds of things and sort out what cycle was incomplete there flatten the earlier practice when you find it get the ta off of it all you have to do if you dont get ta action on the pc is find out what gave him ta action that wasnt completed if he is an old pc suspect not an earlier practice but objectivetype processeswhen looking over auditing for unflat processes you may find lot of them and have to choose which one to start with in this case you have to be careful especially if you are advising someone else what to audit case supervising where you have less control and ease of observation on the things you check you want to be more certain and take fewer risks under these circumstances and one thing that you can be certain of is that any objective process that gave ta will give ta if it is unflat the objective process is the one thats most likely to have stuck the guy because its right here in the physical universe and its closest to the sixth dynamic subjective processes are the least likely to have hungup ta the pc could have cognited later on subjective process in the course of running something else in advising auditors case supervising give advice that is very downthemiddle and certain and if the auditor tells you that it didnt work find out in what way he failed to take your advice meter manifestations at level vi are different from the level iv ones you are used to ta action taking some time to occur or run out below level li but two to three sessions worth of ta at levels 0iv occurs in ten to fifteen seconds at level vi and thats all the ta action there is to be had you dont even see all the ta action that occurs some of it doesnt go through the meter the ta action flattens fast at higher levels dont overrun the guy you will drag in ta from somewhere else if you do if you let the pc go on and on you will get ta action from the next item or bank which violates the cycle of action all the bank objects to at level vi is overrun the cycle of action being extended beyond its end if you overflatten ta action you get an exaggeration of the dirty needle that looks like small rock slam sharpedged dirty needle tocky needle the dirty needle expresses ta action prevented from being completed the tocky needle results from taking more charge off an item then is really there it expresses the fact that the ta action is all completed if you continue you can finally drive it to stuck needle and stuck ta when you ask am i invalidating correct lineup the needle smooths out if you are dealing with the thing that enforces cycle of action on the pc and on life it objects to cycle being overrun it resists created cycle of action that isnt really there if an item has been left charged new item wont read properly until you clean it up suppose you havent left anything charged but the new item is suppressed or something in this case when you look for an earlier charged item the needle will go tocky all the bank objects to at level vi is the cycle of action being extended beyond its proper end the bank raises hell when you create cycle of action that wasnt there the needle will show you that this is happening by getting tocky and you can indicate the overrun and continue to the next cycle6406c16 shspec23 communication overts and responsibility people who have been in processing for some time can forget the degree to which other people are wrapped up in and in contest with their environments this is the direct key to the case your first job as an auditor is to find out what the pcs environment is you should also be able to recognize that pcs can get down to the level of where their only concern is to handle some problem in their environment this pc is not going to ot just to sigh of relief contest is not necessarily fisticuffs it is just that there are different ways of reacting to the environment at lower levels anything the pc is doing is an effort to handle the environment this effort could even amount to catatonia or complete immobility the method is not necessarily smart but down to the lowest rung the person is still in contest with his environment and trying to handle it thetan never gives up the methods he uses are solutions their frailty is so great that you can unsettle them quite easily the more irrational the solution the more easily it is unstabilized it is amazing that this fact hasnt been realized much sooner by earlier practitioners an irrational solution has more points to it therefore it is harder to maintain madman works at staying mad the only requisite to unstabilizing this solution is communication there has to be contact to do it probable reason why earlier practitioners didnt see how easy it was to unsettle the irrational solution was that the first step getting into communication was so difficult person could have so much trouble with this point that he forgets that if he could communicate would be simple to unsettle the aberrated solution psychotherapy parks on the subject of communication therapists get so frantic that their efforts to achieve communication get more and more frantic and brutal culminating eventually in electric shock and prefrontal lobotomies part of the trouble is that the psychotherapists think that they can reach the patient by doing something to his brain gestalt and touchiefeelie therapies satisfy this same need of the therapists to reach the patient in less destructive but equally ineffective way to do anything for person you must be in communication with that person you must be reaching him and receiving comm from him dont assume however that communication solves all communication is necessary but not sufficient condition for helping someone in the lower levels where scientology breaks down it is in the area of effort to communicate to the being that is why the auditor gets weird notions about what he should do to and for the person that is where every psychotherapy breaks down and it is true for scientology too you have to keep acknowledging the pc and giving the next auditing command that is what you have trouble getting across to lowerclassed auditors and that is why you work on keeping the comm cycle in you are working along communication channel in order to accomplish result with the pc so you must keep the channel in good repair what makes level in scientology is gradient scale of what communication can be entered in upon with the pc for instance at level 0 pc cant yet be talked to once you are reaching the pc and he is responding to you you can take up the goofiest solutions he has for his environment you are trying to alleviate his contest with his environment the fact that he is in contest with his environment barriers communication from his environment person solves his environment by withholding from it he will eventually solve the fact that he is being communicated to from his environment during auditing by moving you out of his environment the pc is having trouble with his environment he is not having trouble with you therefore you cant be part of his environment you are thus longer part of his normal environment hence he will talk to you even if to one else he says there are human beings and i dont want anything to do with them and then there are auditors they are different so the auditor takes on holy proportions this seems to be the real explanation of transference similarly attacks on scientology make scientology supernatural to justify their overts on us scientologists cant be considered normal people or the overts would not be justified the melbourne inquiry goes along this way the organization has taken on supernatural aura if you can reach and talk to people when others cant you will immediately assume some special status with the pc who is aware of thisdont bother to deal with this issue with the pc unlike psychoanalysis which dwells on the transference once you have your communication line in use it to handle whatever contests the pc has going with the environment you can use whatever you know of the communication formula to get some communication established then gradiently improve it and move into other processes just getting into comm with the pc is likely to give him some benefits but dont stop with that communication isnt the endall it is merely the channel now you are set up to do something for the case scientology is the only discipline that can uniformly 1 accomplish comm line 2 use it to increase communication and then 3 do something for the individual dont stop when you establish communication even though the mere establishment of comm line is beneficial the pc will look better around you because he is in arc with you so dont forget that he may still be batty around others if you dont do something for the pc you may find that while he is calm and sane in your vicinity he is just as nutty in his environment as ever you may feel that you have cured his battiness when it is only resolved around you so you dont believe him when he talks about how bad life is dont make the mistake of saying ive cured him because i can now talk to him all you have done is to set him up to now do something for him communication is the beginning not the end now after establishing communication you must find out what in his environment is dangerous and menacing and what means he is using to combat these elements you shouldnt use problems and solutions too long beyond the opening part of the case or you will restimulate the problems and solutions in his gpms problems and solutions isnt the basis of his activities with his environment at all it is what the pc does to solve his environment that keeps him obsessed and pinnedin against the hostile elements in his environment how do you know that you havent handled the pcs ptp he is going to do something about it so it is not handled that is the biggest index you have so you want to find what the individual is continuously doing in his environment this falls under the heading of ow not problems because the more he does about the problem he is stuck in the more he will be obsessed by it and the more he will be stuck what brings about an undue concentration on subject and conviction that person has tremendous conflict with his environment it is because he doing something about it all the time for instance person who is hung up on the must be doing something to or about the this lifetime persons way of fighting some part of the environment can take innumerable forms he feels that he had better not communicate with the environment because he is going to commit overts he is mucking up his communication with the environment therefore because his communication with the environment is series of overts so therefore he has to not communicate with the environment because it is an overt against the environment so he had better have some kind of wild solution so he wont have to communicate with his environment in summary 1 an individual keeps doing things to solve his environment this doingness amounts to continuous series of overts 2 so the individual considers that his communicating with the environment is an overt 3 therefore he has to stop communicating with the environment 4 so he develops wild solutions so that he wont have to communicate with the environment like not lookingthis is not at the communication level it is just riding on the comm line the individual has put up screen against tigers so he cant see the tigers he just knows that he has to fight in that direction this may take different forms eg never looking in that direction someone who doesnt look at something has something there that he is doing something to or about he does lowlevel overts because he is afraid that he will do highlevel overts the bank is manufactured in such way that 1 the individual is forced to commit overts 2 he gets in trouble after committing those overts people are kept insane because the bank enforces commitment of overts and insures insanity if the individual does commit overts even if the individual didnt have bank he would get into trouble by committing overts because committing overts violates the communication formula this is above the bank there are two mechanisms above the bank 1 the communication formula cf axiom 51 2 ow that puts the auditor in the driver seat early on because he has two things that are superior to all the aberration that the pc can muster ow is one of the frail spots of auditors you would expect the perpetuators of any trap to talk lot about invasion of privacy and how people should keep their withholds so they seize emeters the most craziness is at the door to sanity auditors reticence in pulling withholds is based on fear of breaking down the communication channel they preserve communication so well that they never do anything with it an auditor can pussyfoot on getting overts from pc because he wants to preserve the comm line but he hasnt done anything with it the fact is that if the pc is pinned into something he must have originated something that got him connected to the thing then once he is pinned to it he gets into an obsessive do to straighten it all out this gives him more worries when person is pinned he thinks that he can unpin himself by more doing actually he can unpin himself by stopping obsessive doing anyone can get caught in this mechanism since it is the basic mechanism of entrapment what the individual originally did may not have been intentional but he starts having to do more and more to handle it sometimes the doingness in resisting thing is to blow having failed to handle it so if the person cant leave physically he may for instance get groggy or show people that he shouldnt be allowed to stay around there are innumerable ways in which thetan can leave without leaving physically all the way down the neuroticpsychotic spiral for instance if one cannot leave marriage physically one may leave nonphysically complication stems from the number of ways in which thetan can leave without leaving physically for instance thetan can make others sorry they didnt let him leave he can appear nasty where he was happy before psychotherapy could be called study of ways of leaving without leaving physically so the sequence is 1 an individual commits overts asserted thereness 2 he commits more overts to get out of previous overts 3 he invents solutions to not leaving asserted notthereness all this occurs on comm channels being on comm line it is resolved by communication ow regretted reach or action and the communication formula are senior to the bank the bank boobytraps this the word withhold is in the bank so you shouldnt use it it is too restimulative and gives false ta ie ta unrelated to discharge by virtue of just moving banks around in running withholds therefore substitute for withhold what the pc didnt say use what havent you saidone of the principal factors that you bat your head against in case is the inability of case to admit any action or take any responsibility for action if case can take responsibility for any action ever committed that case has had it thats any act not just an overt act lost soul thats being shredded between the worlds with soundless wail is the person who can take responsibility for any action he has ever done that is where case ceases to be in range of any assistance the case must be able to take some responsibility for some action in order to be salvageable this makes those things that you cant talk to pretty irresponsible doesnt it well they are i can imagine conversation if you could achieve one with spider the utter irresponsibility of any action ever undertaken by the spider would be amazing inability to communicate is an index of irresponsibility as the ability to communicate drops out responsibility for action as factor falls and vice versa they rise and fall together stutterer has some deteriorated area of communication and therefore deteriorated area of responsibility madman is as mad as you cant get into communication with him the biggest problem with the madman is how you can get in comm with him what gradient of comm to use and how you put it to him that you want to find out what part of his environment he can be responsible for you could get in comm with him one way or another he would eventually differentiate you from the rest of the environment then you would have to find out where guy is stuck and what he is stuck in then find what responsibility can he take for his own actions in that zone or area expand that perimeter and you would return his sanity all you are interested in at lower levels is responsibility for own actions or responsibility for lack of actions the real difficulty is the getting into comm and really finding what he would take responsibility for an undercut would be to get done by reason of placement where have you been that you know you have been even though communication is in the bank the formulas of communication are superior to the reactive bank responsibility is also superior to the bank it is the woof and warp of being thetan the questions are can you decide to do something and do it can you be somewhere at will can you be in or out of something on your own determinism the overt motivator sequence is not an ultimate truth but it goes out as consideration higher than any other consideration it is still truth after other things have become lies before it becomes lie it gives you all levels of processing and cases from level iv on down if youve got those two factors communication and responsibility youve got all lower levels of processing there is real reason for you to be in the dark about why you are not making progress with case whatever other factors are present these factors are more present there is one thing that gets in your road someone can have gpm keyed in to such degree that it is driving him round the bend at lower levels you had better leave it alone lrh has tried reading pc list of words that might be causing the condition if one read lrh told the pc that that word was an integral part of the reactive bank that was influencing him and the pc ceased to be obsessively worried this is bit dangerous though if person is glibly telling you what he has done in an area it may be that he is not really taking responsibility for that the rebuttal in this case is to get the pc to explain at length how he has not really done this thing eventually it begins to dawn on him how he did have something to do with it this is an indirect approach to lowerlevel case you cant run it too long because it is an outofarc process at little higher level you could run what reasons did you have for doing that as long as you dont let him get into inventing them6406c18 shspec24 studying introduction if you cant learn anything you cant find out how to do anything if an auditor cant learn anything he will never know how to audit this is very fundamental but all great successes are built on fundamentals better than fifty percent of scientology consists of the discipline technology and knowhow of application you could give the commands of scientology processes to another group of mental technicians and they would get results failure to duplicate failure to understand failure to apply lrh and reg dreamed up course having to do with business and commerce with scientology applied to them reg executed the course and it has been very successful it is goodwill gesture the only trouble is that everybody tried to get into the act teaching their own courses to the same end reg wasnt worried about others duplicating the course people are aware even with perfect duplicate course that they are not taking the real course in salesmanship even on the copyist this enters enough in the way of an overt or something like this so that he then goes into an obsessive alteris and then it is true that they cant duplicate it professors in universities cause the loss of technology by writing their own books on their subjects instead of teaching the real source material which they alteris there were thirteen heavierthanair methods of flight the fixedwing configuration wasnt necessarily the best though it was one of the easier ones to manufacture the fixedwing system won out the other twelve have lost even though some were more efficient than the one that was easy to do in civilizations it is customary for body of knowledge to come into existence then for some part of it to be duplicated and developed and other parts of the tech to get lost civilizations die out because they lose their technology apart from one gimmick that has nothing to back it up technology gets lost because people cant study civilizations tend to rise to peak then under stress of combat or whatever they lose their technology because one studies it for instance the technology of the british silversmiths got lost when the labor government taxed silver out of existence one problem with study is the amount of false knowledge around if person studied without any judgement of what he was studying or any evaluation of it he would study very poorly study has to do with one thing basically willingness to know in order to study one must first be willing to know without willingness to know you can get systems that add up to knowledge in scientology we have one thing that is not easy to put into texts the discipline of how you do it it is easy to transmit by example and is at least fifty percent of what we are doing this is frailty for the future success of what we are doing it is the most likely thing to get lost what needs to be learned is not the commands of processes it is how to apply them in scientology one is learning the doingness not the processes the processes wont work in the absence of the doingness trs comm cycle metering etc lrh decided to learn about study by doing course in photography he had done the course up to the third lesson already and wondered why he stopped there and why he occasionally bogged down eg in the parts about optics and chemistry he realized that he didnt know anything about photography despite having done it since age twelve he realized that he had entered the course in tolerant state of mind willing to learn few gimmicks and he realized that this attitude was incredibly arrogant he had always thought that the trouble he had had with photography was that they kept changing the methods he realized that the basics and fundamentals in the subject which he didnt know had been present in the subject since 1860 at that point knowing that there was something to learn he really started to study from three books in 3 12 years he sped up to eight books in two weeks arrogance and tolerance theattitude that i know all about it but im willing to learn few tricks prevents person from studying lrhs standards of criticism have shifted what he was willing to take pictures of changed utterly he mastered fundamentals and reached position of judgment and opinion on it previously he had had judgment only fixed ideas there is big difference between an opinion and fixed idea or prejudice one has fixed opinions when one lacks understanding of an area in the absence of knowledge judgment becomes fixed ideas lrhs former ideas on photography had not been resulting in finished picture also before this realization he was the victim of external conditions if there was sun he could not take picture after this realization knowing your tools and darkroom tech you are not monitored by conditions around you the breakthrough was there really is something there to learn this is prime condition necessary for study so the first barrier to learning is the consideration that you know all about it and you wont let your certainty that you know be affected by the fact that you are not getting result judgment depends in freedom from fixed opinions and on need to protect yourself from your lack of knowledge in some area judgment is impossible in the presence of fixed opinions to judge one must know what one knows and what one does not know judgment depends on knowledge it is not what person knows it is what he can do an auditors ability to learn then depends first on his willingness to learn i know all there is to know and i get results shows lack of judgment on ones own skill it is silly statement status has lot to do with this one considers he must appear wise or clever or whatever and pretends knowingness to give this appearance but in the presence of genuine knowledge real esteem takes the place of false selfgenerated esteem it comes down to test of what person can do there is argument with competence psychiatry serves as wonderful example of this to be good critic of some area you would have to know what could and what couldnt be done in that area person who already knows something about an area can learn more about it without feeling challenged threatened or insulted by the suggestion that he learn it unlike someone who doesnt know all about it but wants to think that he does the only place our technology might break down is from unwillingness to learn it stemming from the belief that one already knows it all this is one of those stupid fundamentals that stays in because nobody bothers to asis it there is always first lesson to teach basic entry point to learning subject on the subject of study itself this datum is fundamental where you fail in instruction you always omitted the first datum to teach6406c30 shspec25 cause level ot and the public what is wrong with you is this you are so birddogged onto the glories of ot that you are going to leave the rest of the world suspended between the lower rung of ot and the ground the bottom rung of ot does not sit on the ground there is large gap so there has to be another ladder there the lower ladder could be called cause level person cant vanquish the sun and stars who is having hell of time with his wife we have had the definition of causativeness for long time if you could imagine an expansion of reach from an inverse self notimagined unbelieved self which he cant reach because it aint because he doesnt know he actually sort of has to reach in in order to reach out if you can imagine reach that is this confused that person doesnt even know which direction to go to get it youve got level and 99 of the human beings on the planet they are following the pied piper of science the blind alley of science is that man is intelligent meat machine this leaves out the being himself according to this view man is thinking brain nothing more there are two kinds of sciences 1 classification or naming things 2 extrapolative science that derives answers modern science is just classification science eg biology is nothing but classification it doesnt let you learn anything to modern science the science of man is just another classification science when they dont know anything they name everything if you dont know the right name for the nonexistent parts of the brain then you know nothing about the mind they go on the basis that man never creates they try to understand the mind on the basis of the law of conservation of energy ie that nothing is ever created or destroyed from that viewpoint man doesnt make any sense something would have to be done to him before he could do anything to anybody else this isnt true so neither is stimulusresponse theory since man isnt really understandable on the basis of his never creating the stimulusresponse mechanism is likewise untrue after making wrong assumptions about the mind modern science cant understand it so they sweep it aside as an incomprehensible subject the humanities so we just classify and appoint authorities is it and say that it is an unworkable field then the scientologist comes along and says heresy man is not machine hes thetan being weve taken that as our basic assumption because we can demonstrate it this violates the idea that the scientist has that nothing is ever created or destroyed the fact is however that man mocks up his own mind this disagrees with the law of conservation of energy when you say mind the scientist receives brain when you say that you can run out troublesome part of the mind he thinks that it would be easier to cut out part of the brain he has already accepted two falsehoods 1 man is machine 2 man never creates anything you can prove the scientist wrong by getting result on preclear that is difference between us and the humanities form is more important to the nonscientologist than the result they have end results so theyve begun to believe there are end results in the field of the mind you say an end result can occur in the field of the mind you have to follow very exact discipline to get this end result and they dont believe that the end result is more important to us than how you arrive at it they lost interest in end results because theycouldnt produce any they couldnt produce any end results because they couldnt accept these basic premises 1 man is being independent of his body 2 he is capable of creating his private universe including his mind complete with mass and spaces we cure leukemia case and the doctors say they couldnt have it must have been misdiagnosed in the first place you ask why couldnt he have had leukemia and the answer is he couldnt have had it because it is incurable ie leukemia is incurable by definition they are trying to protect authority in an unworkable rationale that they themselves down deep know has failed their question is how long can we put up the big bluff all analysts know that they arent getting results to get workable results one must accept two things 1 being is an independent thing that can exist independent of body 2 being is capable of autocreation all by his lonesome by doing this he builds mind persons own universe or his bank is not stuck in his skull but is plastered all over the physical universe the scientific premises about the origin of man require at least as much assumption as our premises about mans nature the life springing from an electrified sea of ammonia bit is at least as bizarre as the virgin mary story science starts assuming that man is an inflow mechanism the reverse is actually true the former assumption wont cure anyone the latter assumption will always if you want to help man dont get him to inflow get him to outflow that is why scientists cannot make man well or solve the problems of the mind man is actually an outflow mechanism you solve his problems on the basis of outflow if you want to prove this watch what happens if you run someone on an inflow eg think of motivator this will give you high stuck ta and pc who feels worse and worse sicker and sicker fuzzy and foggy etc actually mans basic action is outflowing and his basic error was an outflow he is restraining himself from outflow because of his experience of causing bad outflows he learned not to outflow so he decided to inflow only then he thought he could only inflow then he caved in we get an end result by operating on this assumption we rehab the ability to outflow and win however society and religion train people to operate on this reverse basis we are really in the line of religion rather than science if science means conservation of energy science has only recently ie in the past hundred years presumed to have anything to do with the field of the mind in spaceopera of course science took over the mind but without comprehension so you got oddball damaging actions however spaceopera science was capable of more damage than modern science our assumptions about the nature of man are violently opposed to the assumptions of science that is the first ladder that you have to jump with people they have to get past the current belief that if you stuff something in the body something beneficial will occur this is something that has confronted us in the past few weeks with violence practically one comes to st hill who is low on causativeness since it takes outflow and causativeness to get here out in central organizations or in the world at large you run into more non communication than is comfortable if you flee the nonscientology world after standing it for just so long its the level of causation that gets on your nerves it isnt that they dont talk your language its their noncommunication its the fact that they dont seem to connect with anything people have to be gotten up to recognition of the world around them total introversion has to be changed to slight extroversion before there is any way that they can asis items guy cant go ot until he has been gotten out of his total introversion the grades enable the individual to break through to the environment they get person reaching causative to degree extroverted and able to asis person has to be able to cause slightly at least before he can asis something when person cant asis the bank he is the effect ofit small percentage of the level iv coauditors were type b when they started they werent really low on cause but only when they were spoton on the exact item with all ruds in could they asis it these were people who had had fair amount of auditing if you put green pc into gpm even spoton he would do nothing to the gpm the gpm would make him sick you can take type pc who can usually asis anything and if he is underfed run down or underslept so that his body is soaking up energy he will run poorly with packedup meter if someone cant asis his personal problems he wont be able to asis gpm this barriered lovely idea that lrh had which only works on him if he finds himself thinking too hard about something he can always skip down through the endwords and pick out the one that has gotten into restimulation and let it blow down this is bit heroic he thought that you could just take someone at level iv and assess the end words but you cant the meter packs up almost at once when person cannot asis his bank because his cause level is too low he will be the effect of his bank and he will get disappearance of that is worrying him so whatever process you use your whole task is to put the pc more at cause you run ow to raise someones cause level since ow is big barrier to his cause level in that he has done something he regrets and furthermore isnt communicating about it you run ow to raise his certainty of having done not just to asis regretted doingness you will find that it is probably that few of your pcs have been answering the auditing question since while you are looking for something they have done they are looking for an explanation of what happened to them some pcs go plunging madly into the bank searching madly for some answer that explains it all such pcs invent things or give things that they are not sure of in an effort to find the right answer a11 you have to do is be sure the pc is certain that he did the thing without alterises in other words you want an asising of doneness all you want is the answer to your question what have you done not what have you done that is bad antisocial etc i ate breakfast and that is probably why is not an answer to the auditing question as auditor all you have to do is police and make sure the person is certain he did do that it isnt the quality of the deed its just whether or not he has done it just make sure the pc is sure that he did that otherwise ow will not work so you build up the persons idea of what he can cause and what he can reach until he can reach the lowest rung of the upper ladder you can convert sop 8c and run it in such way that the pc is sure of doing it distance has to do with reach so on sop 8c you get wider perimeter of what person can reach then on subjective processing you get gradient of what the pc can asis in his mind the object of all lower level processing up to level vi is to raise the cause level of the individual dont expect recognition or appreciation from society around you when they dont even recognize themselves as existing we dont really have opponents except ourselves if we neglect the lower ladder that people need to climb before getting on the ladder to ot ow is the only thing that will key out gpm without the pcs having to pay attention to the gpm this is because ow is senior to the bank and can therefore make keyout clear then you can erase the bank to asis person must have done something promote the idea of raising cause level not so much the idea of going ot people could understand that6407c02 shspec26 ow modernized and revised there are two stages to auditing 1 get into comm 2 do something for the pc it is notorious that few scientologists will inquire deeply into exactly what someone did this is because in order to do something for someone one must have comm line which is supported or made possible by reality and affinity and where person is too demanding the affinity tends to break down so the auditor doesnt want to break the affinity line hence he never gets into the second stage of processing the one after comm line has been established in which the auditor does something for the pc the pc may feel miraculously better just from having comm line established but the two stages are like walking up to the bus and driving off if you dont drive off you never arrive anywhere any upset the pc has is actually so delicately balanced that once you have gotten in communication with the pc it is easy to do something about the upset batty ideas and doingnesses are particularly easy to get rid of since they are based on very slippery logic you could have the guys case fall apart before your eyes just from your asking what are you doing that is sensible and why is it sensible once your comm line and auditing discipline are perfect so you dont disturb the comm line you can forage around amongst his aberrations to great effect comm line is only valuable to the extent that you can use it to move around in the morass which he calls his ideas if you used the process given above aberration would fall to pieces use perfect discipline to keep in the comm line audit well get your comm cycle in let your cycles of action be completed then you can do something for the pc the discipline of auditing is what makes it possible for you to do something for the pc unlike other therapies that is all it is for in fact this gets you up to the door now you have to go through it the magic of auditing and the difficult part is to get in comm with the pc once you have done that doing something for the pc is very easy since his aberrations are so delicately balanced if you are not in comm with the pc he presents himself as accused by you he justifies himself pc who is in comm with the auditor wont be trying to justify himself and uphold his status you can go out of comm with pc by not doing anything for him you lose the rfactor with the person and you go out of comm process is simply combination of mental mechanisms which when inspected will pass away all auditing is subtractive it consists of asising things on the case you can over audit by trying to get more ta action from process when you have gotten it all you can underaudit by leaving off before getting all the ta action out it takes only observation of the pc when you have done something for the pc you will have gotten the ta action off the process if you have done something for the pc ta action will cease and it wont stop until then dont do something for the pc after you have already done something for him on particular process or in particular area if you go on in the area you will only restimulate something else in the pc if you are clever you will run process that cyclically runs out of ta and end it there at the end of cycle in r6 you develop sensitivity for when an item is dead and you will leave it if you ask for it one more time you are dead you will get tocky needle and an arc breaky pc at lower levels you can get one thing run out acknowledge it very well and go on using the same process in way which makes it whole new minor cycle within your major process cycle auditors who cant do this have to run lots of different processes but they could get much more out of one process if they got slick at directing attention you dont necessarily change the process when the pc has cognited if it is general process that can apply to lots of areas get the cognition out of one area then find another area you dont have to change the process you can just change the subject of the process if you use this approach you have to ask yourself all along have i done something for the pc if you notice that the pcs answers are dodgy recognize that your comm line isnt establishedsome processes such as what could you say to mewhat would you rather not say to do two things at once both getting into comm and doing something for the pc eg by getting off withholds all this is prelude to ow because ow is the greatest comm line wrecker that an auditor has to deal with withhold running is peculiar in that it can put in comm line but it is avoided for fear of breaking down comm line it can get confusing when the same process that puts in the comm line to the pc also does something for the pc this tends to cause confusion in which the difference between putting in comm line and doing something for the pc gets lost ow is senior to the bank that doesnt mean that when the bank is gone you will still have ow it means that ow keys out the bank handled rightly it puts in the comm line but if the auditor permits the pc to sit there with withholds in the session instead of protecting his comm line as is his intention he ends up destroying the comm line by missing the withhold and letting the pc arc break another thing that makes ow dicey is that the word withhold occurs in the bank furthermore withhold is an outofarc process and cannot be run by itself done fortunately does not appear in the bank so you can run donenot done however the common denominator of the bank is done done is high order of lock on all forms of reactivity done to is another part of the bank unless the auditor uses specific name with it that is not in the bank see p 595 above re use of nouns in processes ptp can be created by failure to complete comm cycle method of handling ptps would be to ask the pc at start of session are there any communications you have left incomplete the pc would then rattle off several and not register further on ptps the reason why he hasnt completed the communication is because of the overts he has against what he has the ptp with you never have ptp with something that you dont have an overt on so first ptp is based on or connected to an incomplete comm cycle then to done this follows the pattern of what to do in auditing see p 642 above that is the way the bank stacks up even psychosomatic illness is based on an incomplete communication in extremis you can handle psychosomatic illness as ptp you can handle it non adventurously with what communication to or about the illness havent you delivered or you can ask what comm havent you completed to the blumjum the more adventurous cycle is the done and notice that you have just got the same cycle as that of auditor to pc establish comm then do something the severity of the illness has nothing to do with the speed of release of it or the difficulty of handling it the what communication hasnt been completed is easy it requires nothing of your auditing discipline but it is the lickanda promise the done takes more skill knowledge and perseverance the session patter could go like this auditor ptp pc yes auditor any comm you havent completed pc blah blah if the ptp is then gone then there is need to continue if the ptp is not gone then get off the pcs overts there are seventeen ways to get off series of overts there are overts in chains recurring withholdsrecurring overts basicbasic of something etc etc you have to ask the proper questions to get the overts suppose the pc keeps giving you the same often minor overt it is part of chain you need to ask the right question and audit by chain you must also be prepared to find overt at the bottom of the chain but man is basically good despite his reactive bank the bank is only composed to make man commit overts which is against his better nature the bank is the perfect trap because having committed the overts the individual wont go on communicating you do not want to talk to people that you have wronged you withhold to prevent further overts that is the fundamental think of man before he goes so far downscale that he dramatizes obsessively what have you done has two branches 1 what have you done that is socially reprehensible and prevents you from communicating with others 2 just having done something both are valid but watch out for the pc using the process to look for an explanation of what has happened to him this pc will give suppositional answers which you dont want he will invent things he hasnt done to get rid of the consequences that he is experiencing he is trying to find good enough overt to explain what is occurring in his life he will often go far backtrack to find it steer this pc back to where he belongs all you want is what he is absolutely certain that he has done so you have to make sure that he is certain he did the thing if the auditor is asking and the pc is doing b the communication factor is out so the auditor wont do something for the pc you might ask what are you quite positive that you have done ow is likely to be the biggest area of recovery for the pc provided the auditor isnt too tender and will steer the pc you have to observe when the pc thinks that it wasnt an overt if the guy gives you something he did as an overt but obviously doesnt feel that it was an overt then you must ask why wasnt this an overt and get itsa then you might ask was this really an overt after all at this point you might get the glee of insanity then you might get long worry about this with ta action eventually he will realize that it was an overt meanwhile you are raising the cause level of the pc you could go into done in numerous other categories however you may fail in trying to direct somebody in these fields6407c07

knee how to do touch assist two weeks ago it worked if someone asks you for help do something for him i never tell anybody anything people come to see wherever i go putting practice together has always been mystery to how anybody could miss the only thing an auditor has to solve is the problem of what to live on while he is building practice it could take three to five months get in contact

what you can do that counts lrh has signed things rene lafayette ken martin kurt von rocken winchester remington colt etc there is easy way to do anything there are some ways that are not as hard as others being pro in any field takes work of one sort or another physical or otherwise you have to invest some of yourself in it you have to know how you are going to use the data you had better know all there is to know about your subject if you hope to be able to solve technical problem that may or may not have been covered in what you have been studying you may find that the problem is actually very simple even though you know that what you are studying is inapplicable to what you are going to be doing go ahead and learn it well if it is part of formal course finish studying it if you are in training because you are liable to find out that its principles do apply after all when you get round the corner after you have completed the study make your adaptions put some of yourself in it ask yourself how will i use this stuff how will it apply to study does you good whatever unless you go through this process students in many fields engineering courses economics etc dont consider what application they will put the data to which is one reason they have trouble learning it solutions are evolved not from inspiration but from observation inspection data and familiarity reach and withdraw runs off the barriers that prevent you from observing something you can overdo the studying by spending far too long gathering data this would indicate some defect in getting familiarity with what you are studying to gain knowledge or understanding of something you need to be in touch with it arc u you can get too concentrated on one line and get so withdrawn that you lose touch with other things that is why lrh periodically goes charging off into contact with different areas once in awhile you ought to go look and see how people operate so that they dont get unreal in building practice

overts to people is justifications if you ask pc what overt he has committed and then ask him why it wasnt an overt you will find that it wasnt an overt and therefore didnt relieve as an answer because it was all justified one of the powerful new overt processes as given by on recent tapes is 1 in this lifetime what overt have you committed 2 how have you justified it 2 is run flat until the overt given in 1 is knocked out then new overt is found and 2 is done thoroughly and repetitively on it this is not new form of process but these are very new commands note it is not an alternate command note that cycle of action is completed with question 2 or 1 before you leave off processing this particular overt only when you have all the justifications and cognitions possible on 1 do you ask for new overt from the pc this cracks the general irresponsibility the auditor is met with in trying to get ow to benefit the irresponsible case in this lifetime is added because the pc who cant face his overts not only justifies them but goes way back into his past lives to find overts instead of getting off the simple this lifetime ones this is not the same process as plain what have you done in which any action done by the pc is accepted as the answer however in simple general ow you will find the pc is not answering the auditing question but is answering what have i done that caused my trouble the pc is running what action that i have done explains what has happened to therefore running justifications off is further south process than any earlier version of ow and is very effective in raising the cause level of the pc lrhnbrd l ron hubbard copyright 1964 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco

you cant hurt thetan he was asking for motivator hes got overts on ive got service fac on that his overts are bigger than mine my intentions were good hes victim anyway i had bypassed charge i was just being selfdetermined ive come up to being overt its better than suppressing ill straighten it out next lifetime he must have done something to deserve it he was dragging it in i was in an arc break he needed lesson hell have another lifetime anyway its only consideration anyhow its not against my moral code codes are only considerations they couldnt have it they werent willing to experience it i dont see why i have to be the only one to take responsibility its about time i was overt they are only wogs anyhow they are so way out they wouldnt realize it hes such victim already one more motivator wont make any difference they just cant have 8c i cant help it if he reacts hes too critical he must have missed whs why should i limit my causativeness just because others cant take it it was my duty to tell the truth he must have postulated it first he never would have cognited if i hadnt told him ill run it out later hell be getting more auditing lrh nb rd copyright 1964 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6407c09 shspec28 studying data assimilation these are the points to watch in assimilating data 1 nomenclature knowing what word means 2 the subject matter itself arrangement and understanding of the subject matter part of the issue of nomenclature is knowing what definition means we cant use psychiatric terms in scientology because the field of psychiatry has different basis and purpose than ours and their terms have implications that would give utterly unwanted twists to our knowledge if we used them it doesnt matter that they are the authorities an authority in fact is someone who can produce result the world has elected people as authorities on subjects when these people cant do the subjects so if you recognized these authorities you would get all crossed up with fields that had failed and that would enter degree of failure into scientology so we leave their technology and nomenclature alone we get results so we are the authorities the existing terminology is actually false since it is from field that gives result our terminology has evolved and has become fixed on the printed page we have to safeguard what weve got or knowledge gets wiped out we must first try to evolve nomenclature cleverly so that it wont conflict with earlier terms then we must carry it forward as standardized item to maintain constant another responsibility is to avoid developing too many new terms any technical field has specialized terminology they are all snob languages showing superior understanding you dont dare use carnival terminology in front of circus performer when referring to the same thing as one becomes more expert in field and gets more familiar with subject his terminology becomes less formal and serious it becomes more like slang having passed through phase of formal terms we shortcutted this process by leaving out the pompous formal nomenclature stage reverence for nomenclature is symptomatic of being at the novice stage of memorizing the terms knowledge is tremendously dependent on nomenclature this fact is almost never appreciated by teachers and students they are trying to talk and use language that they dont know this can get so bad that they think the subject is incomprehensible or that they are incapable of understanding it when in fact they just havent grasped the meaning of some symbols being used to designate things or their grasp is fumbly not instantaneous as person goes on studying past point of uncomprehended nomenclature he stacks up the opinion that he doesnt know about it carried on forward from the one term that he didnt totally grasp he thinks he doesnt know or cant know subject when in fact he only doesnt grasp the nomenclature the basic lie that makes incomprehension persist is that it is the subject that is not understood when it is word that is not understood person will develop an automatic comm lag at the point of the nonunderstood word he will misassign the lack of understanding to whatever area it appears in comprehension of the nomenclature used is vital in studying anything you put yourself in the soup as soon as you leave one word not understood behind you besides the subject of nomenclature we have the subject matter itself the arrangement and understanding of it ie what is being named one should get very thorough grasp of the thing under discussion person can misunderstand something that he has read because it conflicts with the usual idea or he can even find it unbelievable if you dont agree with something that is true it is either misunderstood or there is button that you are running into when you find something unbelievable be sure you know what you are unbelieving first be sure that you have understood the words used then be sure that you have got the thing the phenomenon right ninety percent of the time you will find that you had something in crosswise in the other ten percent of the cases you can handle it by setting up examples ofhow it applies to you and to life get examples of how it is that way and how it isnt that way you will generally find then that some button was in the way of your grasping it following this sort of routine you will find yourself able to study former methods of study what few there have been have not been very successful when there is training available about the only reliable method of studying is to read everything you can find on the subject from cover to cover in studying scientology it is imperative to know how to study since we are studying that which we are studying with to classify students as fast or slow or bright or dull is to make false classification since this classification leads to improvement of anyones ability to study there are students who can memorize words and pages virtually at glance but this does not guarantee that they will be able to do anything with what they memorized you can find out by seeing whether they can define the words the direction and end purpose of study is understanding with an unknown word or phenomenon in the middle of subject you will have mystery and nonapplication one of the primary criticisms of modern

students franchise overtsorder of effectiveness in processing star rated except for forbidden words list it will be found in processing the various case levels that running overts is very effective in raising the cause level of pc the scale on actual tests of running various levels of pc response is seen to go something like this i itsa letting pc discuss his or her guilt feelings about self with little or auditor direction i itsa letting pc discuss his or her guilt feelings about others with little or auditor direction ii repetitive ow using merely in this lifetime what have you done what havent you done alternate iii assessment by list using existing or specially prepared lists of possible overts cleaning the meter each time it reads on question and using the question only so long as it reads iv justifications asking the pc what he or she has done and then using that one instance if applicable finding out why that was not an overt advice enters into this under the heading of instruction youre upset about that person because youve done something to that person dynamics also permissively enter into this above level i but the pc wanders around amongst them in level iii one can also direct attention to the various dynamics by first assessing them and then using or preparing list for the dynamic found responsibility there is reason to expect any great pc responsibility for his or her own overts below level iv and the auditor seeking to make the pc feel or take responsibility for overts is just pushing the pc down the pc will resent being made feel guilty indeed the auditor may only achieve that not case gain and the pc will arc break at level iv one begins on this subject of responsibility but again it is indirectly the target there is need now to run responsibility in doing ows the realization that one has really done something is return of responsibility and this gain is best obtained only by indirect approach as in the above processesarc breaks the commonest cause of failure in running overt acts is cleaning cleans whether or not one is using meter the pc who really has more to tell doesnt arc break when the auditor continues to ask for one but may snarl and eventually give it up on the other hand leaving an overt touched on the case and calling it clean will cause future arc break with the auditor have you told all prevents cleaning clean on the unmetered pc one can see the pc brighten up on the meter you get nice fall if its true that all is told have i not found out about something prevents leaving an overt undisclosed on the unmetered pc the reaction is sly flinch on metered pc it gives read pcs protest against question will also be visible in an unmetered pc in reeling sort of exasperation which eventually becomes howl of pure bafflement at why the auditor wont accept the answer that thats all on meter protest of question falls on being asked for is this question being protested there is real excuse for arc breaking pc by 1 demanding more than is there or 2 leaving an overt undisclosed that will later make the pc upset with the auditor forbidden words do not use the following words in auditing commands while they can be used in discussion or nomenclature for various good reasons they should be avoided now in an auditing command responsibility ies justification s withhold s failed ures difficulty ies desire s here there compulsion s ively obsession s ively unusual restraint should be given these words just dont frame command that includes them use something else why overts work overts give the highest gain in raising cause level because they are the biggest reason why person restrains himself and withholds self from action man is basically good but the reactive mind tends to force him into evil actions these evil actions are instinctively regretted and the individual tries to refrain from doing anything at all the best remedy the individual thinks is to withhold if i commit evil actions then my best guarantee for not committing is to do nothing whatever thus we have the lazy inactive personothers who try to make an individual guilty for committing evil actions only increase this tendency to laziness punishment is supposed to bring about inaction and it does in some unexpected ways however there is also an inversion turn about where the individual sinks below recognition of any action the individual in such state cannot conceive of any action and therefore cannot withhold action and thus we have the criminal who cant act really but can only react and is without any self direction this is why punishment does not cure criminality but in actual fact creates it the individual is driven below withholding or any recognition of any action thiefs hands stole the jewel the thief was merely an innocent spectator to the action of his own hands criminals are very sick people physically so there is level below withholding that an auditor should be alert to in some pcs for these have withholds and have done nothing all of which seen through their eyes is true they are merely saying i cannot restrain myself and i have not willed myself to do what i have done the road out for such case is the same as that for any other case it is just longer the processes for levels above hold also for such cases but dont be anxious to see sudden return of responsibility for the first owned done that this person knows he or she has done may be ate breakfast dont disdain such answers in level ii particularly rather in such people seek such answers there is another type of case in all this just one more to end the list this is the case who never runs ow but seeks the explanation of what i did that made it all happen to this person easily goes into past lives for answers their reaction to question about what theyve done is to try to find out what they did that earned all those motivators that of course isnt running the process and the auditor should be alert for it and stop it when it is happening this type of case goes into its extreme on guilt it dreams up overts to explain why after most big murders the police routinely have dozen or two people come around and confess you see if they had done the murder this would explain why they feel guilty as terror stomach is pretty awful grim to live with one is apt to seek any explanation for it if it will only explain it on such cases the same approach as given works but one should be very careful not to let the pc get off overts the pc didnt commit such pc recognizable by the ease they dive into the extreme past when being audited off meter gets more and more frantic and wilder and wilder in overts reported they should get calmer under processing of course but the false overts make them frantic and hectic in session on meter one simply checks for have you told anything beyond what really has occurred or have you told any untruths the observation and meter guides given in this section are used during session when they apply but not systematically such as after every pc answer these observations and meter guides are used always at the end of every session on the pcs to whom they apply l ron hubbard lrh nb cden

if he is run above his or her level and remember that temporary sags in level can occur such as during arc breaks with the auditor or life process can be accusative because it is worded too strongly it can be accusative to the pc because the pc feels guilty or defensive anyway at level i proper ow processes can take up the troubles that are described as peculiar to some pcs without getting too personal about it here are some varied level i processes tell some things you think you should not have done tell what youve done that got you into trouble what wouldnt you do over again what are some things person shouldnt say what gets person into trouble what have you done that you regret what have you said you wish you hadnt what have you advised others to do there are many more these at level ii all convert to repetitive processes at level iii such processes convert to lists at level iv such processes convert to how they werent overts or werent really done or justifications of one kind or anothercare should be taken not to heavily run an outofarc type process this is the command which asks for outofaffinity moments outofreality moments and out of communication incidents all after charge is based on prior arc therefore for withhold to exist there must have been communication earlier arc incidents are basic on all chains out of arc are later on the chain one has to get basic to blow chain otherwise one gets recurring answers pc brings up same incident over and over as you dont have the basic on the chain you can alternate an arc command with an outofarc command what have you done means one had to reach for and contact can be alternated with what havent you done means not reached for and not contacted but if one runs the outofarc not reached for and not contacted process only the pc will soon bog on the other hand an arc process runs on and on with bad side effects ie what have you done what bad thing have you done is mixture of arc and outofarc done reached and contacted bad wished one hadnt so solely accusative commands upset the pc not because of social status or insult but because pc particularly at lower levels of case wishes so hard he hadnt done it

new problems arise in auditing and auditing supervision without an adequate written record of time and ta by which is meant the total number of divisions down tone arm has moved accurately in unit of time such as 20 minutes or 212 hr session one does not know whether or not process was flattened process is considered flat when it produces more than 25 div of ta in 20 minutes the auditor cant recheck the last 20 minutes because he has time noted and tone arm notations therefore he or she audits by guess and leaves process cycles of action on the case either unflat or overflattened this alone is enough to upset pcs further when two processes have been run in session and only counter was used an auditing supervisor has idea at all of whether one was flattened before the other was begun also ta for session can be gross error by reason of poor handling of the tone arm if an auditor fails to set the tone arm accurately each time the needle moves from set on the dial less ta is shown for the session if the auditor habitually overworks the tone arm setting it further than it should have gone to bring the needle to set either up or down then the ta counter will show far more ta for the session than really happened the way to handle this dilemma is to use the ta counter only for rough estimate of ta for session or process and to continue to record tone arm action at levels iii and iv one is too busy at levels v and vi and by that time should be able to rely on the counter as ta in such sessions is very large the tone arm is never touched during sneezing body motion etc and recording is made but if the ta blew down because of it the fact is noted in the worksheet column and the new reading entered all meter auditing below level v should be recorded by time and tone arm position to so record ta it is not necessary to use several pounds of auditors report forms one uses one auditors report form to report on the session and similar sized rough work sheets to record time ta position and what is going on these rough work sheets are divided into two or three vertical columns with ballpoint pen and each one of these is split in half vertically in the first column enter time in the second enter ta notes of where the tone arm is at that time take tone arm readings only with the needle at set if something noteworthy occurs write it across these two columns using the spaces of time and ta position for brief note and below it going on with the time and ta position notes one writes down the ta position with the time it happened only when the tone arm needs to be moved to bring the needle back to set needle that moves but comes back at once within 1 or 2 seconds to set is not recorded point one 1 division changes are not recorded as too minuteone fills up these three double columns turns over the sheet and does the same on the back printed auditors reports are never used as work sheets they give the details of the beginning of the session condition of pc whats intended the wording of the process etc then one goes to work sheets and only returns to the auditors report which is half empty to complete the session and end it off with pc goals and gains and all that the ta counter is then read and written on the report this is all so written that one can see the whole session at glance including ta total just by looking at the one side of the auditors report form on that one side the session begins ends and by seeing how the pc was at start and is at the end and the ta counter read what was done and the success or failure of the session is grasped at glance in trying to analyze the session and help the pc more one inspects the work sheets when the session is completed the work sheets are put in proper sequence sequence quite visible because of the time notations the auditors report is put face up on top and the lot are all stapled together by the lefthand corner if an ordinary stapler wont do it easily for 212 hr session far too many notations are being made for iii or iv pc is that active faults of tone arm handling over or under setting of it by the auditor show up process flattening can be traced changes of process can be seen and the auditor or the auditing supervisor can find out what really happened i myself wouldnt know how to guide the next session at levels iii and iv if i didnt have record of ta of the last session to inspect whether the session were mine or anothers such delicate judgements as was the ta just working into the process or was the processing dying down or was it being overflattened just cant be answered by the auditor himself much less an auditing supervisor if timeta record exists also dont take tone arm reading every 2 minutes or every minute thats poor because such timed readings tell nothing when the ta has to be moved more than 1 divisions to keep the needle at set one notes time and the new tone arm reading thats the only answer to how often one reads and notes ta action changes of process are noted across both time and tone arm columns but also at session ending noted on the auditors report one doesnt often change processes and only when the old one has 1 had time to get the ta worked into it 2 had the ta worked out of it and 3 the old one produces only 25 divisions of ta action in consecutive 20 minutes of auditing the tone arm counter is must or one spends ages adding up his session ta when he needs lunch or break but it jolly well never can supplant work sheet automation can only go so far tone arm counters cant think the auditors i train can l ron hubbard lrhnbcden copyright 1964 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6407c28 shspec31 campaign to handle psychosomatic ills there will be small popular textbook on the handling of psychosomatic illnesses healing is nobodys monopoly if it becomes anyones monopoly it will be the monopoly of those who can produce results he who can do the job should be the authority there are three actually four aspects or types of illness 1 predisposition eg rats carrying disease impure water etc 2 precipitation 3 acuteness ie acute illness or injury 4 prolongation ie any illness that goes beyond its expected term when there is an acute injury or illness one that exists right now but is temporary then there is job for medico he is the authority in that field that is where he is trained we should grant him that beingness if someone gets cholera he is sick get the medico where the medico errs is in trying to take in terrain that is broader than the sphere of his authority there are two other things that happen in illness the predisposition or cause of it the medico is just faintly into this it is more the province of the public health officer who is often an engineer not an md efforts to handle predisposition factors are put on physical level tb testing industrial health programs etc medicine cant often determine the length of time involved in predisposition it begins with an indeterminate point as far as medicine or doctors are concerned with physical cause eg germ or malarial mosquito or the alcohol that drunk driver who injured himself drank before he drove such things are what the medico attributes predisposition to they are physical things not mental ones the other area of illness is prolongation the perpetuation of an illness the failure to recover speedily by the expected term of the illness doctors know the expected duration of the acute phase of an illness they have way of estimating the period of predisposition unless they can establish disease contact even that is not really accurate since person can be predisposed to certain illness before contacting germs contact with the germ is really precipitation of the illness so medicos are only slightly involved in predisposition they have acute illness as their exclusive purview and they are totally ineffective in the area of prolongation prolongation is fuzzier area since the treatment of the illness can contribute to it the medicos whole idea of prolongation is 1 treatment not soon enough 2 improper treatment 3 complications but prolongation can only be controlled to limited extent by medicine if an illness enters the stage of prolongation with complications setting in the medicos tend to go into apathy just like the patient because there are elements in the prolongation of the illness that they cant control medicos understand predisposition by physical means they understand the acute phase in physical terms in scientology we would say that the cycle of action would be from the first contact with the predisposing factor to the end of the expected normal term of the illness the doctor can handle this cycle but sometimes complications occur because ofpoor or absent treatment in his view again it is physical but the medico tends to be rather apathetic about it or to go into frantic activity eg repeated operations or heroic measures shock or postoperative shock is physical thing to doctor usually he can neither prevent it nor do anything about it he neglects any possible mental influence when you say illness and healing the md of course thinks of physical address to these since this is what he means by these terms however most doctors know that they are up against something else when they are dealing with psychosomatic illness if you say psychosomatic healing this is way out to the doctor how the doctor somes to recognize the existence of psychosomatic illness is puzzler since this type of illness is not started by physical contact the faults that the doctor finds with psychosomatic healing are only that 1 it encroaches on his field 2 he doesnt understand it the psychosomatic healer tends to overreach himself and to enter the field of physical healing in which he is not trained and he tends to inhibit or prohibit treatment of physical illness when it exists for example doctor will therefore condemn chiropractor he will point out that the chiropractor adjusted the slipped disc of ten patients and of course nine of them felt better but he did the same thing with the tenth patient who was really suffering from tb which undiagnosed by the ignorant practitioner subsequently caused the death of the patient therefore chiropractor is dangerous to the doctor that is the professional mds professional objection in its entirety this argument is neatly handled by us if we send sick patients to an md before we handle them the md also recognizes that when he gets into the field of psychosomatic illness he is in nevernever land he knows not of because it is not purely physical an auditor cant do much with someone who is acutely physically ill such person has too much ptp and not enough ability to asis heavy acute illness is ptp and you cant audit over ptp so dont try get the ptp handled first by doctor if necessary then the field of prolongation of illness belongs to scientology dont audit over high temperature you could perhaps use very simple process reachwithdraw from the pillow perhaps and see if it works but thats all the proper approach is to try to put such pc in communication at very low level if you dont get sudden resurgence leave it there is point in trying to complete whatever action you were on because the pc is too distracted by his body problem to asis what you were on prolonged illness is in the field of psychosomatic healing ie scientology touch assist shifts the pcs attention off of the place where the pc decided to stop the shock wave and it discharges that part of the incident thus touch assist allows the incident to run through the places where the shock wave did go to can be run out if you continued the touch assist you would put the pc back at the beginning of the incident again then you would have to run the incident out again the reason why an engram persists is that it contains lie the pc has tried to stop the motion and with the stuck picture has apparently done so but actually the pc did not stop the incident or the movement of the shock wave through the body so it has to be run through to be asised so when accepting pc for auditing you would be wise to have him get good physical exam first so that any acute physical illness can be treated before you start auditing him however if the pc has an untreatable illness there is point in telling the doctor that you are going to heal him you are not talking about the same kind of healing so you will just get into big disagreement you can get into communication with the doctor on the basis of his expertise in his area get him to write report on his findings dont appear to challenge him in his field when you are in the field of psychosomatics you are in the field of prolongation of illness your argument with the md takes an interesting turn at this point there is nothing that he can do you can tell him this is question of psychosomatic illness there is probably some mental condition holding the illness in place he can agree with you in oversimplifiedterms you can tell him that it is more complicated than that and he will agree it is something that has exceeded his cycle of action so he has to become the effect of it if you can do something about psychosomatic illness when the doctor cant he will be glad to send those patients to you because those are the patients he can do nothing about which makes him feel like fraud and gives him loses these are the patients whose illnesses go on longer than they should you can tell the doctor simplified version of what you will do as one specialist to another then you get your result and the doctor will look on you with awe the md knows that the psychiatrist is failure because among other things he cant handle never solved the problem of prolongation for the md if scientology made its position completely clear to the medical doctor namely that we are not interested in trying to heal obvious physical injury and illness our view would become much realer to the md and we would be seen as doing him service in handling the crocks just agree to the truth that skull fracture for example is nothing that psychosomatic healing should be practiced on that there is purview that belongs properly and exclusively to the md and surgeon and he will stop fighting you instantly psychosomatic healing actually has an old tradition older than the mds this includes witch doctoring magic etc naturally it is the oldest tradition it has truth behind it because it is the tradition of the spirit this is just small part of scientology but it is where we belong in the field

johnson they gave him the wrong bloodtype during transfusion and thereby possibly cost him his life thats pure damn foolishness in the first place they monkey around when they get outside their limited proper field this caused lrh to take sharp look at possible cooperation and made him question it legislatures pass laws about things that they know nothing about theres nothing in the constitution that says you have to be sane to be citizen and yet if you are pronounced insane you are longer citizen and have civil rights whatsoever the right to say who is insane is given to people with training in the field of the mind who think that the mind is the brain by law they do not have to be trained in anything but medicine anyway there is bill or law that says that psychiatrists can practice in the field of the mind only that one must be an md psychiatrists do not have to be licensed and the term psychiatrist has legal standing to train an animal you wait for the animal to do something and then say the command word and reward the animal association according to pavlov and thompson is concatenation of events by which one reaches conclusion freudian psychiatry is not currently practiced none of the current practitioners was trained by freud and the original system may have called for more intelligence on the part of the practitioner than seems to be used now freud probably used savvy and wordassociation to cone down on the problem free association is the lengthy procedure for contemporary freudians amassing enough data appears to be their system but by the time one amasses enough data one is simply confused you need chance to apply the data technology is dicey stuff the more vias it goes through the more errors it becomes subject to lrh handles lots of tech queries from students instructors msh etc the right to practice depends ideally on the ability to do not on some state legislators decisions promoters and lobbyists determine what laws and appropriations shall be made anyway in order to get more money for their department or industry or whatever that is why there are periodic attacks on scientology it is being used as an example of how bad it all is over there if you hit someone mentally or physically with enough force duress or bad news you can make him give you something mass physical blow significance saying how bad it is eg is seepage troubling your loved ones this is mortuary bad news comeon for expensive caskets blackmail is based on the same principle so is taxation and the draft the medical doctor uses this technique in diseasefighting campaigns that scare people with how bad it is instead of getting their income from curing people they use the scare tactic as large source of funds if you understand how this law operates you can usually put together good defense or counterattack this scare tactic is also used by patients im so bad off youve got to give with the next bad news artist you run into ask him boldfacedly what am i expected to give you you will stop him cold in his tracks this completely discombobulates him you apply the second half of the law that he is operating on albeit unknowingly before he is ready for it you complete the cycle unexpectedly you may not get sensible answer to your question but you will change what he is doing his attention he may not doing this consciously he may have you misidentified and be dramatizing something he surely doesnt expect your responseif you can make people laugh when theyre crying and cry when theyre laughing then you would know something about the human mind this is an interesting point but knowing the mind doesnt mean manipulating the mind the medical profession means something else by psychosomatic healing than what you mean by it they mean the minds influence on the body but they consider the mind to be the brain so psychosomatic means the brains or the nervous systems effect on the body this is like saying that the switchboard is the causative element of the phone company so psychosomatic has come to mean the bodys effect on the body thus the subject of psychosomatic illness has disappeared as meaningful subject the word psychosomatic actually means psyche soul plus soma body so proper definition of psychosomatic would be thetans influence on the body that is our definition but not the medicos the first downgrade was to translate psyche as mind the thetan had lost his identity and had become identified with the masses and machinery of the mind the second downgrade was to make mind mean brain and nervous system this makes psychosomatic mean about what the influence of the switchboards and telephone lines on the government would mean that is what the mds mean since the brain and nervous system are part of the body you are just dealing with the bodys influence on the body case has just fallen out of it better term then might be spiritual healing or the spirits influence on the body you can educate or process someone to recognition of the effect he as being is having on his you could ask him for times in his life when he was ill following being upset he might comm lag long time but getting few of these out of the way will improve someones case we have advanced beyond the tradition of psychosomatic healing because we recognize three stages of influence the thetan psyche influencing the mind psycho which then influences the body soma we recognize that the mind is doing something to the body some retained memory has held pain or an experience in place keeping the body ill or predisposing the body to illness or injury you wouldnt have somatic body feeling of feeling good because it would be you that felt good dianetics was at the level of mind over the body but even here the mind was not totally causative we had to recognize that something was doing something that was not the mind we recognized that the thetan existed and could influence the mind to make it stop influencing the body for the worse and that makes us different we have found the thing that the thetan can influence the mind he may not be able to influence the body directly but he can influence the mind which in turn is influencing the body this is more effective than earlier healing practices because asking the thetan to influence the body directly is too great gap for him to jump scientology handles predisposition to illness and we are the only ones who can just as we are the only ones who can handle prolongation of illness6408c04 shspec33 summary of study there has not been technology of education or study there was school technology but it didnt have much to do with education education seldom has much to do with school education as opposed to schooling takes into account the relative importance ie the applicability of the data being taught schooling has real thought of applicability for instance there are people in art who think that knowing names and dates is knowing something about art when they couldnt tell you what picture was painted with in education mass and significance must be balanced dont get too much significance for the mass when you get into significance vs mass you get into action action could be defined as significance versus mass of some kind the reason why one engages in action is that one has purpose of achieving or avoiding something in education when the significance is never added to the mass you get jammed curriculum there is doingness significance that has nothing to do with the mass that you are now confronting is disrelated datum all it does is to throw you curve school is expert at doing this you could have school system that would teach but that wouldnt educate anyone or train anyone for anything because it failed to add any mass or doingness to the significance the data in such school system is all curiosa it is not of any use that is why you almost never turn an artist out of university universities separate significance from action so that the student gets introverted with confront of the subject you cant have education if you detach doingness from significance if you do this you get highly impractical person who never leaves school professor for someone to teach who cannot do is terrible mistake instructors in scientology should be able to audit any trouble an instructor has in teaching has at least little to do with inability in the area person merely writing reports of people who can do is too far removed from the mass to write good textbook when you have thoroughly learned something you can use your textbook knowledge to think and you will get better result than the pure textbook approach would give lrh also found that the pure darkroom training that he had had wasnt enough in itself to make good photographer there is ample evidence of this fact in the daily newspaper pictures which are mostly by untrained photographers photography has the common denominator of the public taste it is new subject only little over century old it hasnt had time to get snobbish when subject is all mass and significance it also fails professionalism has to do with significance doingness and mass you need all three to get final result education would treat these three things equally this isnt new thought but the photography course confirmed it for lrh professionalism is sweated for professionals work hard dilettantes dont you dont have to have done everything that has been done to be pro you dont have to have made human mind to fix one up or to have built an emeter to know how to operate one this would be an overstress on doingness the way to keep things in balance is to design the course such that if someone isnt going to do something you strip the significance out of it doingnesses become converted to significances if one isnt going to perform them you should never thus convert doingnesses to only significances ie never take something that is never more to be performed and describe it far beyond necessity you can work it in the other direction and convert significance to doingness if you take something that has been done but isnt currently being done and teach someone to do it eg bromoil prints the doingness and mass of subject that should be taught are the currently applicable doingnesses and masses of the subject the significances that should be taught are enough background so that the individual doesnt get stuck in the doingness so that the doingness has framework and the principles behind it are clear andunderstood this is little more significance than you would expect that is why you show the student how the subject evolved what other doingnesses there have been and the principles behind the doingnesses then he can think as well as perform mechanical act that is the difference between pro and practical man when doingness changes the guy who has grounding in the subject can understand why and evaluate it properly professional therefore can advance where practical man without theoretical grounding would become antiquated or obsolete mere theoretician could be welltaught but he is seldom educated since his doingness would be missing he might have some other doingness that would be useful eg he could be an art expert who knows nothing about art but whose doingness is the detection of the age of canvasses or whatever most of the protest of the young is that they are being schooled not educated an instructor could think someone was doing simply because he was in motion but if the motion has nothing to do with what the student will be doing it reacts like significance and the student will feel bored and stuck as though he was up against something that he couldnt move through education should be the activity of relaying an idea or an action from one being to another in such way as not to stultify or inhibit the use thereof it permits the recipient to think on and develop the subject and not to become antiquated on the subject the information is loose and flexible in his head not fixed in such way that it relates to only one thing the basic thing wrong with education has been that it never defined what it was trying to do it got confused with schooling education got in trouble the second it started to do something that it didnt define by starting with the thetan as the basis of our theory we exceed the reach of other subjects we have to process someone to get him to understand because the thetan is relatively incapable of understanding in degraded state there appears to be close relationship between education and aberration you could get resurgences in many areas of case just by getting someone to find and define misunderstood words from life6408c06 shspec34 study gradients and nomenclature bulletins are now being written in form that is easier to understand since lrh started to study study scores on exams have gone from 5 in the gos to 60 in the 90s since this material started to be communicated the aim is to improve the ability of the student to learn by altering the methodology of teaching this is an unusual approach we are now handling the students subjective reaction to the subject by changing the method of teaching the usual way to change the students reaction to the subject was by punishment the normal physical universe method the grade system is punishment system on rare occasions the participation of the student has been invited by some teachers education is not normally very successful although educators dont often recognize or admit this fact in scientology we have the unusual situation of being able to see the end product of our education in action this makes it easy to see how well the students learned the material in studying study lrh avoided fields where the students ability to apply what he learned is readily observable we have instantaneous inspection of the results of our study this is quite rare most fields of study expect the student to be very amateurish in the field of photography you get results almost as rapidly as in studying auditing which made it good comparative field for studying auditing is complicated activity in teaching it we apply the principle of gradient scales which was discovered long since we have someone learn fairly simple basic action very well then we add second action etc modern universities usually err by entering the gradient at too high point and assuming that the students already know basics that they dont in fact modern education is the art of teaching on an outgradient our basic gradient on education is to start by getting someone there this is step that elementary school teachers overlook and that works very well when used for five or ten minutes day brief time though that is at the start of the day for instance you could run look at that wall etc the fact that body is there doesnt prove that the person is there nobody is smart where he is not so getting the person there raises iq you always have to start with an action that is simple enough so that the student can get it rather easily otherwise he will feel spinny and confused as he goes on you could discover whether this had happened with person by checking on the emeter for early difficulties in studying dianetics or scientology if you got ta and continued reads as the person discussed it you would know that there was something there that bad never been resolved the difficulties that men have with their minds are those which have ridden forward with them into the present those are the ones that must be handled you can always get one read on difficulty or confusion that someone has had in the past simply because it is pictured on the track as having been difficulty but it wont keep reading if it hasnt ridden forward in time as an auditor you are only interested in the things that the person never resolved which are active now those things will read repetitively this applies to clearing up someones difficulty in studying because the confusions that the person had which are now cleared up have power to confuse him now arc must have preceded all misemotion and bad reaction the confusion that sticks the student in pt is never his basic confusion if student really cant learn something then there is lower point on the gradient that the student skipped at that point he had enough confusion to be overwhelmed that second point is the one that you will get on the meter you wont get the earliest point this follows the pattern of the mind person doesnt have trouble from what he knows is wrong what the student is very confused about which the instructor cant seem to teach is not the right point to try to clear up the way to handle this student is to go back and find the word in the earlier material that wasnt understood you can pinpoint within few words the exact spot at which student started to have trouble then look earlier and find the skipped gradient if there is some word that astudent doesnt understand with violence you look before that you go back as far as you need to the physiological manifestations will be feeling headachy spots in front of the eyes walls getting closer spinny weird feeling the skipped gradient can even be in an allied subject when word is misunderstood words right after it vanish teaching is relaying data to person that he can receive and understand in such way that he will be able to use the data that is the definition that was given the other day to fit in with this exact rationale that we are discussing now instruction would consist of guiding student along known gradient not dreaming up solutions to his confusions good instruction consists in backtracking to find the point where the student thought he understood when he didnt study is concatenation of certainties string of confidences and competences so before you help student out let him get in trouble never trouble trouble til trouble troubles you that is the difficulty of group study teachers have to make an average of trouble for the whole class dont ever help student before be runs into trouble it is interesting that it was in 1947 that lrh started investigating the effect of mislearned word on life following the data from commander thompson on wordassociations lrh established that when he cleared up some words what had been troubling person ceased to trouble him though he could well have new problems another aspect of the misunderstood word phenomenon can be that the word or phrase used can be inadequate leading to omitted data one can get hung up by being deprived of some information eg by typographical error so it could be omitted data as well as misunderstood words that causes trouble for the student the fault could be in the text the common ingredient is that something is not understood6408c11 shspec35 study evaluation of information psychologists are working for advertisers in order to find out what makes people tick motivational research but they are the wrong people to go to since they dont know what the real buttons are scientologist could be much more successful at motivational research degrading though the use of knowledge of the mind for such purposes would be in order to live calmly in the midst of confusion person must have the basic answers then the confusion doesnt bother him 90 of the time and the other 10 of the time he can do something about it knowledge is achieved by study the subject of words boobytraps persons efforts to find out about the world the individual generally assigns to the wrong part of the study material the reason why he cant study it because the right part is something that he isnt confronting and he feels he cant confront it so he disperses and confronts something else study could mean the same thing as inspection ie observation to find out something about something person can observe something directly or he can get knowledge on second hand basis from the printed page the second system speeds up the amount that you can learn since you dont have to do all the basic legwork even when you have direct experience it is best to have some fruits of others observations and experience from which to profit illiterate cultures dont survive as well as literate ones those who do not know who do not understand get overwhelmed and tossed out between the two extremes of 1 observation necessary because one knows everything dying civilization or individual 2 observation possible because the words arent known lies the middle ground of knowing the words and staying alert never become complacent about what you know and you will survive nicely this applies especially to someone who knows more than those around him this danger of stultifying because of thinking that there is more need to observe faces scientology the person who survives is the one who can observe understand and do second hand observation in particular has to be very well understood the understanding has to increase in proportion to the directness of the observation understanding is substitute for mass in studying something there are two things to understand about second hand observation and understanding the understanding can be indirect because of 1 time 2 being relayed by someone else the difficulties of secondhand observation are innumerable so part of our understanding must be evaluation of the reliability of the information that we are being given that is where the bulk of beings get fouled up evaluating an information source is matter of experience among other things you must be able to go on past something you know you dont understand being prepared for any misunderstood phenomena and knowing the source of these phenomena what person studies and the way in which he studies should depend on what he wishes to do with the information specialized words are used for specialized observations you can approach subject at various levels you can think that you know more than you do if you have had superficial contact with the subject but how much do you want or need to know about the subject do you want to be able to discuss it at parties or to use it for something and if the latter for what do you want to use it for instance art could be used as discussion topic as interior decoration as investment as something that one will teach others to appreciate or as something that one will create oneselfstudy that winds up only in understanding with activity is ok there is lot of it around in society but dont make habit of it you can think that you know all about it when you cant do it that is not very prosurvival neither is the consideration that the subject is too complicated for you to ever use it doingness does require much more understanding than lookingness if you are studying for doingness study on gradient give the student series of doingnesses that he can do and have wins at doingness increases understanding as well as the other way around6408c13 shspec36 study and education education is acquiring knowingness in subject and an ability to act in that area the whole subject of education has as its end the accomplishment of certain doingnesses study that doesnt have that intention is only directed towards acquaintance dilletantism or doodle daddling that is not really education education is to accomplish certain things with that subject if person is educated in subject he can accomplish the results of that subject because he knows that subject this is why education in schools isnt really education at all you cant really separate education from some role some professional doingness as the end in view that is the modern quarrel with education in schools much is spent to educate students but they dont get educated people dont get educated in arithmetic because it doesnt have an end product it could have an end product but the end product hasnt been defined or described in universities the student is expected to use higher mathematics to solve problems that could actually be solved with arithmetic if arithmetic hadnt been degraded by being thought of as nothing but groundwork for higher mathematics as the purpose of subject deteriorates or is purported to deteriorate the subject itself disappears if the individual learning the subject has purpose for the subject it will die away in him live study is one that has use dead study has use you can cause subject to die away either by making its use die away or by omitting its purpose as part of the educational process ie not telling students what the subject is for this brings to mind the dissemination formula this is related to the fact that you need purpose to study something getting persons ruin and applying the formula gives him purpose for looking at the subject of scientology it is possible to become obsessive in the study of some subject that has use in talking about scientology people will think of it as subject only when they see that it has purpose that is real to them as an attainable purpose for an educational subject to continue to exist it must have purpose that can be seen to be an attainable action to the individual addressed in his view the value of subject depends upon the value of attaining its stated purpose culture is held together only by education the achievement of an education is remunerated to the degree that 1 its service is understood to be valuable this shows that some odd services are thought to be valuable eg undertaking which has survived as technical line for thousands of years 2 it is understood continuing need for subject will preserve the subject but its technology must be relayed which it will be if it is needed one could destroy subject by destroying its purpose or by destroying its technology or by adding things to its technology that are unnecessary in educating person in certain subject the longer it takes to get to the point of using the subject the more opportunities there are to fail at it this is is the reverse of the toosteep gradient cf the analogy of the runway if it is too short you cant take off but if it is too long you are likely to damage the plane on the ruts and stones before you can take off true knowledge gives correct emphasis merely theoretical knowledge will give wrong emphasis this can result in technology getting lost as would happen if for instance you studied three weeks on how to make emeter varnish and other such matters unrealities enter when you teach solutions to problems that dont exist or when you fail to solve problems that do exist by experience you learn where the problems are it is hard to teach subject with which you have immediate personal experience this is one reason why education gets bad name since most professors dont know what they are talking about those that can do those that cant teachall subjects wind up in finite doingness if subject doesnt wind up in finite doingness person cannot be educated in that subject anything that winds up in specific doingness can be educated education in the absence of the mass with which the technology will be involved is hard on people it makes them feel squashed bent sort of spinny bored exasperated sort of dead pictures of the mass would help you would expect the greatest incidence of suicide and illness where people were studying subject whose mass was absent too steep gradient gives different physiological reaction confusion and reelingness the bypassed definition gives blank washedout notthere feeling followed by nervous hysteria the eventual manifestation of this is blow from the subject to remedy the absence of mass supply mass to remedy the toosteep gradient find the last point that was well understood and find the misunderstood right there or just after to remedy the misunderstood word get it defined and used manifestations of study problems absent mass 1 squashed feeling 2 bent feeling 3 feeling sort of spinny 4 boredom 5 flatness 6 peeling sort of dead 7 exasperation 8 headaches 9 stomach aches 10 eyes hurting 11 dizziness too steep gradient 1 confusion 2 reelingness bypassed definition 1 blank notthere washedout feeling 2 followed by nervous hysteria 3 followed by blow from the subject this is the final manifestation gradients are more involved with doingness though they do hang off in the subject of significance but it is the action that we are interested in the misunderstood word is the most important thing in establishing someones doingness the restoration of doingness depends only on getting the misunderstood word defined and understood though to do well or with talent may vary from person to person person say doesnt know word in psychology so he cant move over into scientology the misunderstood word opens the gate to education so it is the most important aspect of study techhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 14 august ad14 remimeo franchise sthil students scientology two prepcheck

notised are sometimes used as pair to get pc easier in session the buttons protested and decided are sometimes used as pair dirty needle mid ruds called because middle of session was the earliest use rudiments of session are less employed today because of the discovery that all dirty needle phenomena is usually traced to the auditor having cut the pcs communication to get rid of dirty needle one usually need ask only have i cut your communication or do an arc break assessment if that doesnt work dirty needle continuously agitated always means the auditor has cut the pcs itsa line matter what else has happened chronically comm chopping auditors always have pcs with dirty needles conversely pcs with high tone arms have auditors who dont control the itsa line and let it over restimulate the pc by getting into lists of problems or puzzlements but high tone arm also means heavy service fac whereas dirty needle seldom requires mid ruds or prepchecks it just requires an auditor who doesnt

will cover it in moment rudiments 6 what goals would you like to set for this session please note that life or livingness goals have been omitted as they tend to remind the pc of present time difficulties and tend to take his attention out of the session 7 at this point in the session there are actions which could be undertaken the running of general ow or the running of mid rudiments using since the last time i audited you or pull missed whs as indicated but if pc cheerful and needle smooth just get down to work one would run general ow if the pc was emotionally upset at the beginning of the session or if the session did not start for the pc the latter being simply another indication of the pcs being upset or arc broken but these symptoms must be present as sometimes the session hasnt started merely because of poor tone 40 or because the pc had something he wanted to say before the auditor started the session running owif it is all right with you i am going to run short general process the process is what have you done what have you not done another process that could be used is what have you said what have you not said the process is run very permissively until the needle looks smooth and the pc is longer emotionally disturbed where are you now on the time track if it is all right with you i will continue this process until you are close to present time and then end this process after each command ask when that was the last command is there anything you would care to ask or say before i end this process end of process running the mid rudiments one would use the middle rudiments with since the last time i audited you if the needle was rough and if the tone arm was in higher position than it was at the end of the last session order of buttons here is the correct wording and order of use for the big mid ruds has anything been suppressed is there anything you have been careful of is there anything you didnt reveal has anything been notised has anything been suggested has any mistake been made has anything been protested is there anything you have been anxious about has anything been decided in using the first three buttons suppressed careful of and didnt reveal the rudiment question should be asked directly of the pc off the meter repetitive when the pc has more answers check the question on the meter if the question reads stick with it on the meter like in fast rud checking until it is clean the last six buttons are cleaned directly on the meter as in fast ruds pulling missed withholds use since the last time you were audited has someone nearly found out something about you body of session 8 now go into the body of the session end body of session 9 is it all right with you if we end the body of the session now is

to mention thank you for making these gains for this session or im sorry you didnt make any gains for this session havingness 12 after adjusting the meter put your hands in your lap please squeeze the cans if the squeeze test was not all right the auditor would run the pcs havingness process until the can squeeze gives an adequate response ending session 13 is there anything you would care to ask or say before i end this session 14 is it all right with you if i end this session now 15 end of session tone 40 has this session ended for you if the pc says repeat end of session if the session still has not ended say you will be getting more auditing end of session tell i am longer auditing you please note that havingness is run after goals and gains as this tends to bring the pc more into present time and to take his attention to degree out of the session wording for the above follows the tradition of earlier model sessions adhere severely to this session form it is nearly an

covered in this hco bulletin are 1 the construction of clay tables 2 clay table use in training 3 clay table definition training 4 clay table use in the hgc 5 clay table healing 6 clay table iq processing clay table work in training the only reason any student is slow or blows lies in failure to understand the words used in his or her training you will find that students at any level in any course will benefit greatly from clay table work on definitions the importance of this will become apparent as you study our new educational technology now mainly to be found on the tapes of the few weeks before this date clay table is any platform on which student standing or sitting can work comfortably in an academy it may be 3 feet by 3 feet or 5 feet by 3 feet or any larger size smaller sizes are not useful in the hgc it is about 212 feet by 4 feet the surface must be smooth table built of rough timber will serve but the top surface where the work is done should be oilcloth or linoleum otherwise the clay sticks to it and it cannot be cleaned and will soon lead to an inability to see clearly what is being done because it is stained with clay leavings in the academy castors wheels can be put on the legs of both the clay table and the clay container where they will be moved lot several different colours of clay should be procured the best source is school supply house where educational supplies are sold artists clay is not as good as the school type ask for kindergarten clay receptacle also of wood or metal and having separate stand of its own of any type is also valuable it should have subdivisions in it for the different coloured clays the amount of each colour is not important so long as there is at least pound or two of each colour in small class or an auditing roomin the academy colours are only used to make student see the difference between one object and another and have other significance as the objects in the mind are not uniformly coloured while ridges are black they can become white engrams may be number of colours all in one engram just as technicolor is coloured motion picture however some persons see engrams only in black and white so the colour in the academy is for instruction only assisting to tell the difference between one object or another in the hgc it may be very significant to the pc as covered later the instructor works with the table before classes at times so it is of benefit to have table so arranged that it will tilt toward the class at about 30 angle with the floor this can be done as easily as putting the back legs of the table on temporary wooden blocks or as complicatedly as using large engineers drawing table which tilts its whole top if table is to tilt the lower edge during the tilt must have one or two inch guard board to keep the covering or the clay from falling to the floor if it slips it doesnt slip usually on linoleum table surface but sometimes bit is dropped and an instructor can more gracefully recover it if it hasnt rolled off on the floor loose linoleum top is also prevented from sliding off by guard board any part of the mind can be represented by piece of clay or white card the mass parts are done by clay the significance or thought parts by label piece of clay and label are usually both used for any part of the mind thinedged ring of clay with large hole in it is usually used to signify pure significance the labels used by instructors but not by students are done on white cards inked with heavy black inking means such as china marking pencil or gemmarker where metal cylinder holds ink and the point is made of felt the inked label is mounted on small stick two to four inches long of the kind used by nurses for swabs or metal ones used to hold meat together scotch tape or sellotape will bind label to stick everything is labelled that is made on the clay table matter how crude the label is students usually do labels with scraps of paper written on with ballpoint an instructor would use the fancier kind so that these would easily be visible to others the main clay table and its clay container is set up in the lecture room of course in such way so that it can be moved up in front of class or over in the corner out of the way or to an area in the room where two or three students can gather around it or work more than one clay table must be made for large classes but the additional tables need not tilt in the hgc clay table is narrower and longer and one is placed in each auditing room any hgc clay table can be used to train staff auditors the clay tables in auditing rooms are used for processing in the hgc there is not just one table for everyones use there is one in each auditing room use on courses any part of the mind or any term in scientology can be demonstrated on clay table this is an important point to grasp the use of the table is not just for few terms it can be used for all definitions the ingenuity of the instructor or the student and their understanding of the terms being demonstrated are the only limits on clay table simplicity is the keynote nothing is too insignificant or unimportant to demonstrate on clay table the first mistake is to believe that only r6 for which the lower grade student is not ready can be demonstrated on clay table anything can be so demonstrated if you work at it and just by working on how to demonstrate it or make it into clay and labels brings about renewed understandingin the phrase how do i represent it in clay is contained the secret of the teaching if one can represent it in clay one understands it if one cant one really doesnt understand what it is so clay and labels work only if the term or things are truly understood and working them out in clay brings about an understanding of them therefore one can predict that the clay table will be most used in practice or organization which understands the most and will be least used in an organization that understands the least and is least successful let us look over the level of simplicity of the terms to be used in course of instruction let us take body all right make few lumps and call it body and put sign on it body now that doesnt seem to be much to do but it is lot to do to forward understanding let us make yellow ring of clay beside the body or on it or in it and label it thetan we can thereupon see the relationship between the two most used terms in scientology body and thetan and cognitions will result the students attention is brought right to the room and the subject getting the student to do this by himself even when hes seen it done by the instructor produces new result getting the student to do it 25 times with his own hands almost exteriorizes him getting the student to contrive how it can be done better in clay or how many ways it can be done in clay drives home the whole idea of the location of the thetan in the body art is object in clay table work the forms are crude take large lump of clay of any colour and cover up both thetan and body with it and you have mind take every part of the mind and make it in clay by making thetan making body and making one or more parts of the mind machine facsimile ridge engram lock what have youall scientology terms and get the student to explain what it is and we begin to clarify what were about get student to make present time problem make him put in all its parts represented in clay boss mother self and have each one done with body thetan and mind and some rather remarkable insights begin to occur the quantity of things that can be made has limit the principal thing is to get every scientology term made in clay and labels by the individual student you will see new era dawn in training you will see academy blows vanish and time on course cut to one fifth in many instances these are desirable attainments in any course so clay table work is serious academy business ingenuity and understanding are the only limits on the use of the clay table and the attainment of excellent results with it clay table work in processing the clay table presents us with new series of processesthe preclear is made to make in clay and labels whatever he or she is currently worried about or hasnt understood in life scientology terms such as the present time problem can also be graphed but this is specialized if very beneficial use but the essence of clay table processing is to get the pc to work it out in training you mostly tell the student in auditing the pc tells the auditor this is still true in clay table processing clay table healing the preclear shows the auditor the objects and significances of his difficulty example pc has continual pain in the right leg perfectly ordinary clay table and clay container as above are used but the table is narrower and longer than training clay table the auditor seats the pc on one side of the table and the auditor sits on the other side there is meter between them the auditor report is kept on side table or the auditing table nearby not on the clay table the container is handy to the pc and contains several colours of clay the pc under the auditors direction but with coaching as to how then makes the leg of any colour the pc chooses and label my right leg and puts it on the clay leg this done the auditor asks the pc to say what should go near the leg the pc then makes it crudely and rapidly in clay again of any colour the pc chooses and makes label for it and puts it on the new object the auditor wants to know what else should be near the leg the pc says what and makes it in clay and labels it usually the pc chooses colours which are significant to him or her but which in fact need have significance to the auditor under the auditors brief questioning or voluntarily the pc tells the auditor all about each and every object he or she makes as it is made and labelled the full auditing comm cycle is observed but the auditor acknowledges more often than he or she commands the representation in mass and label form and the pcs explanation of each mass and label as made constitute the valuable actions the pc can put aside or reuse the clay of objects already made but not the leg which must remain if this is done well and completely the pcs right leg will alter in condition you could assign several words to this activity to explain it you could call it symbolism or healing by projection of ones troubles into mass you could call it remedy by duplication but you really dont have to explain it with new term because it works this type of healing is very old in fact it is the first recorded effective healing recorded in the dawn of man but when we add to it what we really know of the mind when we add to it the auditing comm cycle when we use it with the pc telling the auditor not the practitioner telling the pc we move into zones of healing never dreamed of before this is in fact one of the new healing processes i have been promising levels i to iv its name is clay table healing the pcs havingness stays up while the significance comes off which is chief valueintelligence iq intelligence quotient or the relative brightness of the individual can be rocketed out of sight with hgc use of clay table clay table iq processing this is another process than clay table healing dont mix them this is done with the following steps 1 find out where the pc is trying to get brighter it wont do any good to try to make the pc brighter in fields or zones of knowledge where the pc doesnt know he or she is stupid so it is of great interest to find out where the pc is trying to become smarter and then using only that subject if you as the auditor select the zone it has been inferred that the pc is stupid in the area the auditor chooses and usually you get an arc break even if it doesnt show in the session so choose zone of knowledge where the pc is striving to become more informed and the process works 2 trace back with meter what word or term the pc failed to grasp in the subject chosen in 1 above trace one word early in that training that the pc didnt understand never ask for the first wordmerely an early one 3 get the pc to make up the mass represented by the word in clay and any related masses get them all labelled and explained 4 repeat 2 and 3 but not step 1 until step 1 is flat the process for any one subject can be considered flat when the pc is alert and interested in the subject of 1 it may take several sessions to flatten step 1 once one subject has been straightened up and pc is bright about it we get step 5 which consists of doing 1 2 and 3 again rather than just 2 and 3 but flatten step i before finding new subject or the pc will be just as confused as ever clay table iq processing is clay table version of one of the new educational processes if the clay table version is used dont use the other itsa or meter versions if the other itsa or meter versions are used dont use the clay table version this is called for purposes of reference clay table iq processing that is different than clay table definition training and it is different than meter definition processing and different also from coffee shop definition processing all these are different activities and the others named will be issued in due course suffice at this time to cover clay table definition processing it is fantastic in producing results and in raising iq in all clay table processing the pc handles the mass the auditor does not suggest subjects or colours or forms the auditor just finds out what should be made and tells the pc to do it in clay and labels and keeps calling for related objects to be done in clay do it in clay is the phrase avoid using make it because its gpm word good clay table auditor takes it very easy is very interested acknowledges when it is expected is very sure to understand what it is and why and lets the pc do the work it is particularly important that the auditor grasp what the clay objects are and what the label means an auditor tends to blow or become critical of the pc when the auditor glosses over his own understanding of what the pc is making and why so when the auditor understands perfectly he or she simply acknowledges and when the auditor doesnt understand completely he or she asks and asks until he or she does understand the auditor never asks aquestion so the pc understands when the auditor already does as this makes false arc in the session handling clay clay is messy until we find or unless we find totally nonoily clay precautions must be taken to keep students and particularly pcs clean and if not clean cleaned up afterwards clay can get on emeter cans and insulate them from the hands clay can get on clothes and papers and walls and doors in most alarming way therefore students and pcs using it can provide smocks for themselves and the instructor and auditor can provide liberal quantities of cheap cleaning tissue and solvent several cheap solvents work the least odorous and easiest handled are best odorous solvents should be guarded against as academies hgcs and private practice rooms will soon begin to smell like cleaning shops or mortuaries this can become serious in restimulating pcs so use odourless solvents and provide baskets for used cleaning tissues and empty them the clinging quality of clay and the odour of bad solvents could put an end to the great value of clay table work so safeguard against this good hunting l ron hubbard lrh jwrd copyright 1964 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 18 august ad14 remimeo sthil students scientology iii to iv this hco bulletin is preceded by hco bulletin of august 17 ad14 the process covered in the present bulletin clay table clearing was called clay table iq processing in the earlier hco bulletin clay table work covering clay table clearing in detail note clay table clearing is recommended hgc process at levels iii iv one of the most compelling urges below level vi is the desire to achieve an incomplete purpose this will be found to be remarkable dissemination factor below level vi one is striving to complete his or her goals at level vi gpms are run out but before that can be achieved one is thrust into the gpms by the effort to accomplish further one does have wishestodo of his or her own having nothing to do with gpms but only being blocked by them usually someone wanted to attain an improvement when he or she came into scientology this wishedfor improvement until achieved remains as hidden standard by which one judges whether or not he has improved if the wish is attained then one knows scientology works if the wish is not attained then one isnt sure scientology works wishes fall into two broad classes i mental achievement ii physical achievements including relief from illness the clay table process most likely to give the preclear his wish to accomplish some purpose is clay table clearing this is one of four clay table activities the other three being clay table definitions clay table healing and clay table track analysis the last being training activity for class vi one must differentiate amongst these four activities as they are not the same things clay table definitions are done only in training and are not auditing clay table track analysis is done in training for level vi and again is not auditing the two clay table auditing activities arei clay table clearing used to achieve the pcs rehabilitation and raised iq in various fields and ii clay table healing used to get rid of physical discomfort of psychosomatic origin the above pair are the two hgc uses of clay table as of this writing one does not use clay table definitions or clay table track analysis in auditing sessions clay table clearing as one scientology remedy for increased iq and destimulation clay table clearing is audited by an auditor in session meter may or may not be used depending on the training level of the auditor but regardless of level metering is done during actual work on the clay table where the auditing space is limited the equipment used may be as meagre as biscuit can full of clay and twofoot square piece of linoleum to lay on the auditing table the meter and auditors report being taken off the table and the auditors report written on clipboard in his or her lap during the auditing session to end the session on the meter the linoleum is simply set aside and the meter put back on the table more elaborate arrangements can be used as time and finance permit but so long as one takes precautions not to get clay all over everything and everybody the twofoot square lino scrap will suffice the entire effort by the auditor in session of clay table clearing is to help the pc regain confidence in being able to achieve things by removing the misunderstandings which have prevented that achievement to process only scientology terms and call it clay table clearing would be gross error the pcs upsets with the mind seldom began with scientology if the pc in answering the auditors questions gets into scientology terms that is perfectly all right but to sit down and concentrate on scientology terms while calling it clay table clearing would be an error for these two reasons 1 scientology terms are training activity called clay table definitions and 2 the pc did not become aberrated only after he or she got into scientology early on in an intensive one gets into scientology terms now and then as these may be locks on an earlier misunderstanding with similar subject here is an example of this psychologist has terrible time understanding dianetics and scientology in being run on clay table clearing the psychologist gives as his chief desire in life gaining an ability to understand people the first few terms chosen for clay table work may well be scientology terms but the auditor steers the pc back bit and it was psychology the psychologist didnt understand and the clay table work would then be concentrated on psychology terms or childhood misunderstandings about people until the pc felt he had regained the ability to understand peopleor as such pc would look at it had begun to understand them now with the first desire chosen to understand people flat the auditor would search for new zone where the pc wished to become able so you see the auditor is handling the chief urges of the pc in clay table clearing the auditor is not trying to teach the pc thing we have for long spoken ofa ability regained b make the able more able c help the pc achieve his goals in life these and other aims in processing are strictly processing aims they are not training activites the action is destimulation of those things which bar the pcs progress in life by handling broadly the pcs bafflement about life we 1 unleash his theta by destimulating confusions and 2 we eventually clear the pc we are directly removing the held down fives see dianetics evolution of science and clearing the pcs ability to think see and understand we do not remain long on scientology terms if we get into them because of the evidence that the pc was not clear before he came into scientology further it is up to the pc to choose the zone to be explored just as youd be in trouble setting goals for the pc so you would be in trouble telling the pc what he wanted to do in life hes had too much of that from others to also get it from his auditor in using clay table clearing we do not go into physical ills these are handled faster by other processes if these physical ills were the reason the pc wants to be processed then 1 you should have the pc given competent physical examination as there may be some simple remedy for his condition or some condition present that needs physical treatment and 2 if you process the pc and want to do clay table work then you should be running clay table healing not clay table clearing if you start to run pc on clay table clearing and discover the pc is being audited only to be cured of something not to be mentally improved you carry on to an early point where you can gracefully shift over and end off clay table clearing and begin clay table healing how to do clay table healing will be covered more fully in later bulletin the steps of clay table clearing step one find subject or activity where the pc has desired to improve himself this could be anything from athletics to not to be frightened of goats in essence this is stated goal the pcs auditors reports if he or she has been audited before will be found to abound with these further examination will discover that one is repeated very often one may take up these earlier session life and livingness goals if the pc still wants to and does not have one on hand in which he or she is more interested the current interest of the pc is the safest point with which to start one establishes this by simple discussion of what the pc wants to do in life this step is as brief as what are you trying to do in life one finds something the pc wants to achieve or do whether it is happy or unhappy beneficial or suicidal and one uses this do not linger on step one once this is done do not challenge or question it the auditors job here is to assist the pc to attain his goal and if its to commit suicide thats what the auditor uses the auditor uses any sincere life and livingness goal the pc expresses as what he wants to do only one word of warningdo not accept sarcastic or critical goal that means the pc has anarc break ptp overts or withholds or is being audited under duress and the auditor must handle the attitude with the usual means but it is also an error to challenge purpose the pc really has just because it sounds crazy or antisocial step two having established the purpose the auditor now establishes something about it the pc didnt understand this will be some generalized idea usually it will seldom be word it will be some idea expressed in several words or gestures however it is expressed by the pc the auditor accepts this as what the pc has not understood about 1 above it may take while to sort out this concept or idea but when it is sorted out thats it example the pc has understood an afterlife in hell as punishment for committing suicide the question asked to get the pc to dredge up this idea would be something like what about suicide havent you grasped assuming the pcs desire was to commit suicide its always what about the purpose expressed in 1 above havent you grasped dug been clear about etc or even what was there in purpose expressed in 1 above that baffled you when the pc has one go on to 3 it is mistake to get the pc to try to clarify it any further than his first statement of what it is as that isnt accepting the pcs answer and you must always accept pcs answer so long as it is an answer according to the pc one gets the point of bafflement stated any old way by the pc and goes on to step three it is good idea to write the idea or concept the pc didnt understand on your work sheet step three get pc to reduce that idea to single term this may be one word or composite word this step may involve lot of groping or discussion it may go on for quite while the purpose of the auditor here is just the auditing question gently but firmly and even insistently put put that concept about the idea found in 2 into one word express that idea you had in single term coax bully insist plead but finally get it done it is this step that tests the auditors comm cycle ability for if the auditor has control over the session the pc will shift the idea in step two or try to discuss the whole subject of step one the pc will squirm may try to beg off may declare its impossible but the auditor recognizes this action of the pc as charge blowing off and presses on with the command express the idea can be read off work sheet in one word eventually the pc will deliver up one word and thats one of the words in the original subject as given in step one that the pc never understood and some of the reason why the pc has stayed confused about the subject as given in step one with consequent aberration you may not believe it at times while doing step three that the pc can do it you may even be prone to agree its impossible to do so but if you do youll lose the session and may lose the pc you must get the idea in step two expressed as word in step three and the pc must eventually be satisfied that the word he now gives does express the idea given in step two the auditor must make sure of that the question may be are you satisfied that the word give word pc has come up with does express the idea read the idea of step two off the work sheet youll easily see if the pc thinks it does or doesnt relief attends his realizing it does express the idea in step two vague confusion attends his feeling that the word he has given does not express the idea in step two as this whole step borders on challenging pcs answer care must be taken not to really arc break the pc he or she can be driven very close to the brink of an arc break and very possibly may be by the insistence on an answer but the bypassed charge is the lost word and as soon as it comes up and is given to the auditor the pc becomes all smiles if session arc break occurs use the list one arc break assessment list or if its not grade iii session have class iii auditor do the arc break assessment you can see by this why clay table clearing is really for hgcs or professionals the only major error the auditor can make in step three is to fail to get the pc to do the step and give word for there is where the charge is on the word that represents the idea of step two sometimes step three is very easy often not the greatest danger lies in an auditor going wishywashy and letting the pc change the idea of step two or just letting the session collapse into endless itsa in step three as in step two the auditor is there to get job done and does it having gotten the word that represents the idea given in step two the auditor goes on to step four caution dont let pc choose word that solves step two step four this is the true clay table step and one might say this is where the fun begins this is usually the longest step by far the auditing command is represent the wordas given in step three in clay the auditors purpose in step four is to acknowledge the pcs ideas and comments and protests b understand by questions where the auditor doesnt really understand what the pc is trying to do and c and chiefly c get the pc to represent the words meaning in clay and d make sure the pc is completely satisfied he or she has represented the meaning of the word in clay the command represent the word in clay may have to be repeated many many times if the command is executed the auditor must ask gently are you satisfied you have done it the pc may do it over and over or protest how it cant be done and all that but the auditor must get the pc to do it the auditor may never suggest how it can be done even when it is obvious truth is its always obvious how to do it to the auditor but the auditor isnt aberrated on that point and the pc is so the pc struggles until he or she really does represent the word in clay in way that brings the dawn of comprehension lovely thing to see any word can be represented in clay the auditor must realize that words that are confusing to the pc are harder for the pc to represent in clay again the major mistake is to fail to get the pc to do it another gigantic error is to agree it cant be done and yet another error is for the auditor to fail to understand himself what the pc has done if the auditor cant understand it the pc cant either never be polite about not understanding what the pc means pcs arc break harder on faked understanding than on repeated auditor efforts to understand pcs will explain for long periods when the auditor is still trying to grasp it pcs blow up when auditors fake comprehension they have not obtained from what the pc said or did to the auditor the clay representation and the pcs explanation of it must be seen to easily represent the word found in step three an added command is how does that represent the word this has nothing to do with art it has to do only with good sense there may be one or several clay forms that represent the word what the pc does with it or some action with it may also be part of the representation of the word when the auditor is sure the pc has represented the word of step three in clay and is sure the pc is sure the auditor leaves this step step five still keeping the subject found in step one the auditor goes to step two and finds new confused idea the pc has about the subject of step one the subject of step one is left only when the pc is very satisfied he has either regained his ability or confidence or has concern about it this may take many sessions then one gets the pc to choose new subject and proceeds with that using the exact steps above with shortcuts or failures to get the pc to do what he is supposed to do in each step dont leave subject chosen in step one unflat by failing to clear the pc on that subject step by step over and over it may be supposed that clay table clearing is the only process needed to clear pc this is untrue pcs have overts and withholds they get ptps and have had arc breaks with life they are sometimes too hard to control and need cchs and sometimes they are so bad off they have faults of any kind and say so while sitting right there in body but for the pc who can be audited on it clay table clearing is strawberries and cream soft berth spring flowers and exit from the nightmare into life l ron hubbard lrh jw jh copyright 1964 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 24 august 1964 sthil students franchise scientology i to vi session mustnots not that you would do such thingyou undoubtedly already know better but just as matter of record the following session mustnots should be taught in letters of fire to any new auditor i never tell pc what his present time problem is the pcs ptp is exactly and only what the pc thinks or says it is to tell pc what his ptp is and then audit what the auditor said it was will inevitably arc break the pc this of course is under the heading of evaluation in the auditors code and is one way of evaluating very serious way too ii never set goal for pc dont set session goal life or livingness goal or any other kind of goal auditors get tangled up on this because everybody has the same r6 goals and when you call out the next goal from the list it appears you are giving the pc goal but an r6 educated pc knows that and it isnt evaluation other goals are highly variable the pcs life and livingness goals and session goals are especially variable pc to pc and even within one session on the same pc to tell pc what goals to set for session or for life is to upset the pc if you dont believe it trace some pcs upsets with their parents and you will find these usually trace back to the parents setting life and livingness goals for the child or youth the pcs session and life and livingness goals are the pcs and for an auditor to deny refute criticize or try to change them gives arc breaks and for an auditor to dream up brand new one for the pc is especially evaluative iii never tell pc whats wrong with him physically or assume that you know whats wrong with the pc is whatever the pc says or thinks is wrong physically this applies of course only to processing for if you werent auditing the person and if the person had sore foot and you found splinter in it and told him so it would be all right but even in this case the person would have had to tell you he had sore footthe main reason society has such distaste for medical doctors is the mds continuous diagnosis of things the person has not complained of the violence of surgery the destruction of lives by medical treatment rather educates people not to mention certain things instinctively the patient knows that the treatment may leave him or her in much worse condition and so sometimes hides things for the medical doctor to cry aha and tell the person he or she has some undefinable ill is to drive many into deep apathy and accounts for the high frequency of operational shock wherein the person just doesnt recover so never tell pc what is physically wrong with him if you suspect something is physically wrong that some known physical treatment might cure send the pc for physical checkup just to be safe in the field of healing by mental or spiritual means the pc is sick because he or she has had series of considerations about being sick deformity or illness according to the tenets of mental healing traces back to mentally created or recreated masses engrams or ideas which can be either destimulated or erased completely destimulation results in temporary recovery for an indefinite period which is nonetheless recovery erasure results in permanent recovery destimulation is the most certain feasible and most rewarding action below level vi erasure below level vi is too prone to error in unskilled hands as experience has taught us the reality of the auditor is often violated by pcs statement of what ails him the pc is stone blindbut the pc says he has foot trouble obviously from the auditors viewpoint it is blindness that troubles this pc but if the auditor tried to audit the ailment the pc has not offered an arc break will occur the pc is ailing from what the pc is ailing from not from what the auditor selects for it is the statement of the pc that is the first available lock on chain of incidents and to refuse it is to cut the pcs communication and to refuse the lock after that you wont be able to help this pc and thats that permitted auditor statements there are however two areas where the auditor must make statement to the pc and assume the initiative these are in the overtmotivator sequence and in the arc break when the pc is critical of the auditor the organization or any of many things in life this is always symptom of overts priorly committed by the pc the pc is looking for motivators these criticisms are simply justifications and nothing more this is sweeping fully embracive statementand true one there are criticisms in the absence of overts committed earlier by the pc it is quite permissible for the auditor to start looking for the overt providing the auditor finds it and gets it stated by the pc and therefore relieved but even here the auditor only states there is an overt the auditor never says what the overt is for thats evaluationyou will be amazed at what the pc considered was the overt it is almost never what we would think it should be but also an auditor whose pc is critical of him or her in session who does not say it sounds like you have an overt there lets find it is being neglectful of his job the real test of professional auditor the test that separates the unskilled from the skilled is can you get an overt off the pcs case without arc breaking the pc and yet get it off the nice balance between demanding the pc get off an overt and getting it off and demanding the pc get off an overt and failing to get it off but arc breaking the pc is the border line between the unskilled and the professional if you demand it and dont do it youll arc break the pc thoroughly if you fail to demand it for fear of an arc break youll have lowered graph on the pc the pro demands the overt be gotten off only when necessary and plows on until its gotten off and the pc brightens up like lighthouse the amateur soulsearches himself and struggles and fails in numerous waysby demanding the wrong overt by accepting critical comment as an overt by not asking at all for fear of an arc break by believing the pcs criticism is deservedall sorts of ways and the amateur lowers the pcs graph demanding an overt is not confined to just running ow or some similar process its backbone auditing tool that is used when it has to be used and not used when it doesnt have to be the auditor must have understood the whole of the overtmotivator theory to use this intelligently b indicating bypassed charge is necessary auditor action which at first glance may seem evaluative however the bypassed charge is never what the pc says it was if the pc is still arc broken bypassed charge is however found by the meter and the pc has actually got it or it wouldnt register so the pc has really volunteered it in roundabout wayfirst by acting like he or she has bypassed charge and then by bank reaction on the meter always indicate to the pc the bypassed charge you find on the meter never tell pc what the bypassed charge is if you dont know class vi auditor knows all goals but the goals are wrong and often sloppily just tells people at random they have wrong goal knowing this to be probable but its very risky if you find it on the meter telling the pc what the bypassed charge is is not evaluation telling the pc what it is without having found it is evaluation of the worst sort l ron hubbard lrh jwcden copyright 1964 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6409c01 shspec37 the pe course here is some data from the field of study that relates to the pe course new people hear incomprehensible words and dont return thats it that is the reason why you have fifteen people on monday who dwindle to two people on friday what has been discovered here is the act that exists prior to the overt and which illumines the overtmotivator and ow sequences before there is an overt there is noncomprehend so the overtmotivator sequence goes 1 misunderstood word 2 noncomprehend 3 belief that it is ok to commit an overt 4 the commission of the overt 5 the withhold of the overt 6 blow an attack or withdrawal this can be big or small see also hcob 8sep64 levels ii to iv overts what lies behind them critical thought is justifier lessener of the overt and therefore symptom of an overt if you ask the pc for an overt and he gives critical thought of course you dont leave it there you ask for the done having gotten that you could ask for the noncomprehend and behind that for the misunderstood word get the nattery student to find on his own before the next coursetime all of his misunderstoods in previous courses or studies and get them cleaned up someone who cant do anything about anything is reasonable about it all this is disease that civilized person gets into being reasonable doesnt solve anything you cant do anything about it so you get reasonable about it being reasonable is what someone does who cant make his goals anymore if you really find out what the score is you dont have to be reasonable you can do something about it if guy is having trouble understanding and is nattering about scientology before he has had time to find anything to natter about there is word or words in prior related subject that was misunderstood someone who has misunderstood words in field that is allied to scientology will be unable to learn scientology this is why someone who is psychologist has trouble learning scientology he could do some clay table processing to handle it or you could assign him selfaudit looking up the words in psychology that he didnt understand this takes care of the natterer in the pe course as very precise action if you get someone in the pe course who is trying to get it but cant ask him for the word that you have used that he didnt understand if the guy is simply trying and failing to grasp word he just has an incontext misunderstood word find it and he will brighten up then there is the perfect pe student who sits and nods but hasnt clue this is handled by having people give written examples of the point that you have made taken from real life this permits return flow and lets you spot the fellow who is utterly glib and cant apply the fellow who hasnt connected get him to give you list of words that he hasnt understood since starting the course take up those words and clean them up probably some other people on the course havent got them either suppose that you were offered course to teach you all about automobiles and you had never seen one but you had sort of vaguely heard about them you had heard that they travel over the ground at tremendous speeds this sow ded rather neat and intriguing so you decided to take the course then suppose you got hit with three nights in row of how neat cars are andhow fast you can go in them and how intriguing they are and you never got word one about what an automobile is what makes it work or what its parts are so when you teach scientology teach it an overt against scientology is justification for not having understood some word or concept in scientology keep it simple and keep it defined as much as possible keep it familiar people like the familiar people dont like things that are totally new the public likes the old with maybe little bit of improvement not new subjects so you had better represent scientology as what it is which is the only conservative study in the field of the mind it follows the traditional patterns of philosophy religion and the mind your own interest in it may have come from your recognition in it of the philosophy of greece and rome and of faculty psychology people justify not having understood subject so they commit the overt that shows that the subject is good presentday psychologists think of man as machine psychology has stable datum perception depends on association and sensation according to the psychologist there is perception in the absence of sensation and association that is machine in the absence of someone tickling its gears and certain things making other things happen is incapable of noticing anything that is happening this notion puts conditions upon being able to perceive anything and it is not true it would be true of machine with nobody in charge but it is not true of being being does not require sensation with association in order to perceive only if person were piece of meat would this be true before i can look at field of id have to have received sensation from it and to have associated it with my childhood robot would have to do that it would have to have associative memory etc psychologists believe that man is robot when you say that perception is engaged upon by the being himself as means of communication with the universe around him and other beings you would have been welcomed by the sixteenth century faculty psychologists but you are damned by the moderns you have introduced volition volitional and nonvolitional acts you have set up the individual as seeing what he wants to see and not seeing what he doesnt want to see you have set up the whole mechanism of power of choice and you have set up the dignity of the individual and that they want nothing to do with because they in not understanding man have gone the route of the overt see earlier part of this tape thats why psychiatry cuts out brains theyve got to make nothing out of man because they havent understood him and the misunderstood word that it goes back to is psychology every psychiatrist is in the frame of mind of man they are arc broken with their own subject they know it doesnt work this is where their contempt for man comes from they dominate thought in universities they teach that man is good he is just machine such philosophy became necessary when leaders entered wars that killed off thirty million people at crack this philosophy justifies the overt you have to have philosophy that man is good in order to go on committing overts so mans mental subjects first didnt bother to understand anything about man and so then began to commit overts and then employment was found for these blokes by fellows who had to have their overts justified the hitlers and the stalins man is not more degraded than he was it is just that mans mental sciences have departed from the traditional which had to do with the dignity of man wundt made his big mistake at leipzig in 1879 and pavlov and psychiatry came riding in scientology is in the great tradition of the dignity of man the ideas that we are moving along with are the traditional ideas these ideas have to do with attention perception power of choice and motivation of behavior we do not go on the basis of how wicked everyone is we just ask what these things are the idea that men are animals was always there to be bought but it wasnt until 1879 that it got taken up so modern psychology is the upstart subject modern psychology and psychiatry came from the russian and the german two groups ofpeople who have enviable reputation for humanitarianism if the germans had just stopped with music and cameras we would be fine but every once in awhile they got careless with guns psychiatry came from germany and modern psychology came from the russians psychology is really substudy of scientology and as such it is our property after all psychologists cant even define psychology it should have its spelling changed to psyche ology study of the soul so as to reflect its true and traditional meaning it is the psychiatrists and psychologists who are the radicals scientologists and the traditionalists we are the conservatives psychiatry psychology philosophy and religion and all subsumed in scientology the radical approaches have had their chance and have failed to produce results they should stand aside in favor of the more traditional approach psychology as psycheology should be seen as being part of scientology the eyes can see by putting something there to be perceived as well as by perceiving what is there learning nomenclature is equivalent to learning what is there treat the pe course as an area where people can learn the language and find out what is there to be named and students will come up smiling if they dont understand the words they blow natter and commit overts thus we build our own opposition6409c03 shspec38 clearing what it is clear means what it meant in dianetics the evolution of science which is the same as what it means on adding machines computers have complex circuits sometimes drop of solder gets dropped in which shortcircuits the circuits and adds some wrong constant factor to the computer in mechanical adding machines if you never pushed the clear button after the previous operation you would get the old total added in that is the uncleared answer where old data modifies pt data the mind likewise will add old answers into current computations and get wrong answers persons memory will be bad in the area where the old answer is stuck amnesia is all the helddown fives adding up to total blank memory is not broad condition it is spotty as leopard person has bad memory in an area of aberration traumatic experience is surrounded by locks so sometimes it is hard to find there is such thing however as uniformly good or bad memory the worse off someone is the more areas of nomemory there are insanity becomes way of obfuscating overts as well as motivator and justifier for them if we could get person to see the overt all that insanity would become unnecessary if you want to improve someones memory you must ask memory on what person is aberrated in the area where his memory is poor there is fairly goodsized piece of nuttiness occluding some area of his experience and memory all you have to do is to monkey with it little and it will start to clear psychiatry errs by trying to make sense out of the incomprehensible it cant be done by definition you should not try to figure that square shapes make people nervous because some patients were nervous around doors instead you should find out how come the patients got nuts on the subject of doors you dont try to make sense out of the incomprehensible all you have to do is to understand that he the person who has presented you with the incomprehensible doesnt understand it and to start looking for where it came from people are far more normal than they are crazy cf hs sullivan nobody is totally crazy other mental sciences go crazy on this fact because of mans thirst for allness which is just the craving to identify with psychiatrists going aaa think that there is such thing as total insanity and that therefore there is such thing as the state of being insane even in his legal systems man has to have something called insanity this is not correct person is insane in one or more areas or subjects there is such thing as total insanity gibbering idiot who asks for glass of water when he is thirsty is sane in that area the sentence this man is insane requires three dots at its end to show that it is incomplete psychiatrists have never completed the sentence so that it reads properly and accurately as this man is insane on the subject of _______ but if psychiatrists knew that much about the subject of insanity they could cure it it is the missing link actually they have never defined their terms if you ask psychiatrist what subject is this guy insane on he would say maybe exhibitionism bull pucky thats condition not subject you cant classify insanities because insanity is the same on the same subject as any other to finish the sentence this man is insane on the subject of _______ psychiatrists would have to observe the patient then they would see that there was similarity to others insanity find the subject on which person is insane find the source of the subject and he will have cognitions and the aberration will blow if you are in an area where the pc is cogniting you must therefore be in an area where the pc was aberrated you are tracking down and clearing helddown five cognition is returned memory when the pc is cogniting it is an indicator that he is getting rid of helddown fives and he will be remembering better in that area if person never cognites you arent tracking down any helddown fivesclear means on any given subject not nuts anymore especially where the person has been pretty nuts you could say for example on the subject of children this person is clear you would have to put it into the framework of relationship of some kind when you have hit enough stuck fives you can call the guy clear which means cleared being with cleared ability to think guy who has been cleared in given area of aberration cant go nuts in that area again it took fantastically offthewall set of circumstances to aberrate the person in the first place to aberrate him again you would have to get the same weird circumstances all together again and then some because now he is educated too he knows how it happened cleared person or clear would be person with obvious aberrations and with majority of areas cleared who has cleared ability to think the basic business of an auditor is to use scientology tech to locate areas of aberration in the being and then to follow those areas down until the person recognized an earlier causation for the condition he would then be unable to reconstruct his nuttiness in that area because the thing that had him aberrated in the first place is gone and he also knows that he has been nuts in that area so when he sees something approaching that could be recurrence of the condition he preunderstands what might happen again and it wont happen having had the experience and being aware of it is like being inoculated he couldnt go nuts again in that area if he tried therefore clearing is stable the state of total causation is not the same as the state of clear the state of total causation is ot which is different from being unaberrated clearing is something that applies to the mind it is related to finite state of existence the ability to survive well in everyday existence in the universe across time when we try to make clear an absolute we go beyond that into another area that has the sideeffects of clear although you are not trying to fix the guy up the final result is total resumption of beingness at total causation which isnt necessarily in the physical universe in finite time clearing is an assist to finite existence not some supernatural thing man doesnt leap from state of total aberration to state of total divinity it is long walk which starts with the guys present environment the gradient scale only breaks down when the pc gets into running the things that make up the mind gpms now you are handling uncommon unnatural problems like why did the being make time track what is he doing in the physical universe etc an individual who had time at all would not be normal it takes different framework to explain this now you have an individual who through his understandings of what is around him and his exact handling of the masses and significances in his immediate vicinity has gradual emergence and cognition of what is going on we are knocking out his concept of existence and replacing it with total knowingness of existence that individual is emerging towards causation not towards being cleared he is going towards point where he causes the past not where he is cleared of the past the aberrations you are taking away from him on r6 are not timed aberrations that is what makes them build up and that is why they are rough they cant be blown by meter dating they date now however you can date and blow an implant gpm isnt something that happened in the year 2681 b that is quite different from something that happened within the universe that you can fit in on the time track if you find an engram all you have to do it date it and it goes bzzt the pc wouldnt have prayer of getting it back after the guy is clear you begin to ask where is the time coming from that you are dating the clearing in now you are into r6 and ot the guy is more causative over the universe less worried about what the universe is doing to him you are going from the finite to the infinite the field of recreation of the individual or the individuals rising up towards total cause is long and arduous road you dont run out of gpms very fast the point is that there is separation point between the finite universe and the world of total beingness people going towards clearing are interested in physical wellbeing and their relationships with other human beings they are interested in accomplishing finite goals in the physical universe like keeping job etc if person going up the other track hasnt totally followed the clearing track he is still interested in those things too although perhaps not soaberratedly but only people who are interested in clearing are interested in finite physical universe goals if someone is insane you remove the individual areas of aberration as they become accessible and leave growing core of sanity that was always there somewhere along the line he ceases to be interested in becoming clear of his past and he begins to be very sincerely interested in causation personal individual causation what is the individuals relationship to and responsibility with regard to the physical universe the individual is also capable of going nuts in this direction and thinking that he is god but only if he isnt really past the gates on the road clearing ceases when the individual can recognize his basic gpms and knows where they came from etc ordinary clearing procedures wont touch gpms so clearing ceases now you go into running gpms the person soon gets over being interested in blowing out the electric light or wondering if he could do this etc he gets more serious minded about the situation as it becomes more real to him and more natural to him he stops worrying about other people getting to be ot the end of the road is in view and it is finite road so the two roads are different one has to do with processing somebody within the limits of time and experience deleting things that keep the individual from getting right answers in existence the other is different auditing changes the individuals responses to auditing change you can still shift the preot back little onto the other road if you do this too much he collides with the next gpm and it jams the meter the locks are now all on top of gpms not on traumatic life experiences charge on subject could lead to misunderstanding word on the subject clarification of the word would cause dropping away of some locks on the subject this could apply to gpm words also it isnt how big or how little persons aberrations are that counts it is how many aberrations he has the closer the aberrations are in subject to each other the more there are these aberrations are not necessarily based on dramatic or interesting experiences either although

force for all uses of the clay table clay table work is level iii this means that it can be used by any hcahpa any student in training for hcahpa in an academy may use by general policy hcahpa processes in the academy while undergoing training it can be used on any hqs student by an hcahpa student it cannot be used by or taught to hqs students only the student who has completed his hca training may use it on outside pcs or in an hgc clay table work of any kind may be used in pe work or in has coaudits or in public coaudits of any kind where the coauditors are not already trained in an academy on clay table work by recent policy relaxing pc gradation pcs at any level may be run on clay table but only by level iii hcahpa trained auditor or in an academy by someone being trained in level iii processes clay table work looks simple works fast but it is essentially listing type process where things are being selected to run and that makes it solidly level iii expert handling of the auditing comm cycle and other fine points are vital to working with pc on clay table one has to understand the theory of clearing as given in the saint hill tape lecture of 3 sept 64 clay table evolves homo sapiens into homo novis the new man clearing in its earliest original sense is easily obtained by clay table work in the hands of the auditor trained at level iii that is marvelous thing there is reason to wreck it in pcs and spoil it for them by letting it be badly used by untrained persons clay table training will be available in academies across the world r6 auditors leaving saint hill and heading for key points in international central organizations have been carefully trained on clay table work and even as this is being written it is being set up for teaching in most academies there is therefore excuse to use it incorrectly clay table work handles 1 the longstanding goal of getting clear without exceptions or only minor percentages making itwith it comes broad general clearing it may have been overdue for while but it is here clearing for anybody 2 improvement of work accomplishment by staffs3 rapid certain gains in hgcs as routine activity by hcahpas 4 penetration of the world of healing and definite change in our attitude toward healing 5 more rapid progress through upper courses there are other gains attainable in clay table work but the above five are the ones you will soon get the full benefit of technically and organizationally the only things which can inhibit these gains are trying to use clay table work without complete briefing b use of it by auditors below level iii i sought for long while for the technology up to level iv we have now achieved it lets go at it right get it correctly applied and succeed with it l ron hubbard lrh

all levels ptps overts and arc breaks just to remind you other auditing is not possible in the presence of present time problems and overts auditing is possible in the presence of an arc break these are data like acknowledge the pc an auditor is one who listens etc these belong in the abcs of scientology present time problems when pc has ptp and you dont handle it you get gain there will be rise on personality test graph there will be little if any ta action there will be gain in the session the pc will not make his session goals etc etc so you dont audit pcs who have ptps on anything but the ptps the pc has and you dont audit ptps slowly and forever there are numerous ways of handling ptps one of them is what communication have you left incomplete about that problem few answers and poof ptp another is what doesnt that person or thing pc is having ptp with know about you other versions of overts and withholds can be used these are all fast ptp handling methods and they get rid of the ptp and you can audit what you started to audit the mark of ruddy amateur in auditing is somebody who can always do successful assists but cant do real session the secret is in an assist you are handling the ptp arent you so you never audit over the top of in the presence of ptp another circumstance is cant get down to real auditing because the pc always has so many ptps this is only confession that one cant handle ptp and then get on with the session one fumbles with the ptps so badly as an auditor one never really handles the pcs ptps so of course one never gets on with the job at handauditing the pc the pro in real session just handles the ptps quickly gets the pc into session and gets on with whatever should be run overts overts are the other principal source of getting gain here we really can tell the goony birds from the eagles professionally pro would think of auditing pc on other processes in the presence of overts 1 the pro would recognize by the pcs natter or lack of previous gain that the pc had overts2 the pro would know that if he tried to do something else besides pull these overts the pc would eventually get critical of the auditor and 3 the pro wouldnt fail to pull the real overts or b arc break the pc in getting the overts off if one gets reasonable about the pcs condition and starts agreeing with the motivators look at all the bad things they did to thus ignoring the overts thats the end of gains for that pc with that auditor if one is clumsy in recognizing overts if one fails to get the pc to give them up if one fails to properly acknowledge the overt when given or if one demands overts that arent there overt pulling becomes howling mess because then getting the pc overts off is tricky business auditors sometimes become shy of doing it and fail as auditors sometimes pcs who have big overts become highly critical of the auditor and get in lot of snide comments about the auditor if the overt causing it is not pulled the pc will get gains and may even get arc broken if the auditor doesnt realize that such natter always indicates real overt when pcs do it eventually over the years it makes an auditor shy of auditing auditors buy critical thoughts the pc has had as real overts whereas critical thought is symptom of an overt not the overt itself under these critical thoughts real overt lies undetected also i love these pcs who have to get off withhold about you last night jim said you were awful an experienced auditor closes the right eye slightly cocks his head bit to the left and says what have you been doing to i havent known about i thought begins the pc the question is says the old pro what have you been doing to that i dont know about the word is doing and off comes the overt like ive been getting audited by bessy squirrel between sessions in the coffee shop well some auditors are so reasonable they never really learn the mechanism and go on getting criticized and getting gains on pcs and all that i once heard an auditor say of course he was critical of what he said was true id been doing terrible job the moral of this story is contained in the fact that this auditors pc died rare thing but true one the pc had terrible overts on scientology and the auditor yet this auditor was so reasonable those overts were never cleaned up and that was the end of those auditing sessions its almost never that drastic but if an auditor wont pull overts well auditing gets pretty unpleasant and pretty pointless too lack of grasp of the overtmotivator sequence when somebody has committed an overt he or she has to claim the existence of motivatorsthe deddedex version of dianeticsor simply when one has motivator he is liable to hang himself by committing an overt puts an auditor at very bad disadvantage howling pcs and pc wins arc breaks you cant audit an arc break in fact you must never audit in the presence of one auditing below level iii the best thing to do is find an auditor who can do arc break assessments at level iii and above do an arc break assessment on the pc an arc break assessment consists of reading an arc break list appropriate to the activity to the pc on ameter and doing nothing but locate and then indicate the charges found by telling the pc what registered on the needle that isnt auditing because it doesnt use the auditing comm cycle you dont ack what the pc says you dont ask the pc what it is you dont comm you assess the list between you and the meter same as pc there then you find what reads andyou tell the pc and thats all bypassed charge assessment is auditing because you clean every tick of the needle on the list being assessed the pc is acked the pc is permitted to itsa and give his opinions but you never do bypassed charge assessment on an arc broken pc you do an arc break assessment as per the paragraph above this one these two different activities unfortunately have the word assessment in common and they use the same list therefore some students confuse them to do so is sudden death you can really clobber pc by doing bypassed charge assessment on an arc broken pc and also you can arc break pc by doing an arc break assessment on pc who isnt or has ceased to be arc broken so unless you have these two separate and different actionsthe arc break assessment and the bypassed charge assessmentclearly understood and can do both of them well and never get too rattled to know which one to use you can get into plenty of trouble as an auditor only auditing over the top of an arc break can reduce graph hang the pc up in sessions or worsen his case so its the next to the most serious blunder that an auditor can make the most serious error is to deny assistance either by not trying to get the pc into session or not using scientology at all auditing an arc broken pc and never realizing it can lead to very serious trouble for the auditor and will worsen the pcs casethe only thing that will summary it is elementary auditing knowledge that gains occur in the presence of ptps or overts and that cases worsen when audited over the top of an arc break there arent lots more conditions that can exist given an auditing session there are only these three barriers to auditing when you do clay table auditing or any other kind of auditing the rules all still apply change of process or routine doesnt change the rules in doing clay table auditing off meter one still handles the elements of session one puts the pc on the meter to start off and checks for ptps overts withholds even arc breaks handles them quickly and then goes into the body of the session much the same as the oldest model session rudiments one doesnt use mid ruds or buttons to get started one just knows the things that mustnt be there ptps overts arc breaks and checks for them handles if found and goes on with the main session activity if ptp or an overt or an arc break shows up one handles them putting the pc back on the meter if necessary when they are handled the pc is put back into the main activity of the session its true of any auditing that gets done it isnt likely to alter and actually new data is likely to be found that controverts any of this the phenomena will still be the same phenomena as long as there are pcs ways of handling may change but not these basic principlestheyre with the auditor in every session ever to be run so one might as well stay alert to them and be continuously expert in handling them they are the only big reefs on which an auditing session can go up high and dry so their existence causes and cures are of the greatest possible importance to the skilled auditor l ron hubbard lrh jwcden copyright 1964 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 8 september 1964 remimeo franchise sthil students levels ii to iv overts what lies behind them i recently made very basic discovery on the subject of overts and would like to rapidly make note of it for the record you can call this the cycle of an overt 4 being appears to have motivator 3 this is because of an overt the being has done 2 the being committed an overt because he didnt understand something 1 the being didnt understand something because word or symbol was not understood thus all cavedin conditions illness etc can be traced back to misunderstood symbol strange as that may seem it goes like this 1 being doesnt get the meaning of word or symbol 2 this causes the being to misunderstand the area of the symbol or word who used it whatever it applied to 3 this causes the being to feel different from or antagonize toward the user or whatever of the symbol and so makes it all right to commit an overt 4 having committed the overt the being now feels he has to have motivator and so feels caved in this is the stuff of which hades is made this is the trap this is why people get sick this is stupidity and lack of ability this is why clay table auditing works clearing pc then consists only of locating the area of the motivator finding what was misunderstood and getting the word made into clay and explained the overts blow pure magic the trick is locating the area where the pc has one of these this is discussed further in saint hill lecture of 3 sept 1964 but is too important discovery to leave only in tape formthe cycle is misunderstood word or symbolseparation from arc with the things associated with the word or symbolovert committedmotivator felt necessary to justify the overtdecline of freedom activeness intelligence well being and health knowing this and the technology of auditing one can then handle and clear these symbols and words and produce the gains we have described as being clear for the things causing the decline are cleared out of the being lrh jw cden l ron hubbard copyright 1964 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 9 september 1964 remimeo sthil students level iii clay table healing the purpose actions and the auditor commands of clay table healing are completely different from those of clay table clearing when undertaking clay table clearing one can also from time to time do clay table healing on the pc in fact one commonly starts out clay table clearing by doing clay table healing to get the hidden standards things the pc uses to tell if the process is working out of the way however when one is working on pcs to heal not to clear and when the sole object of auditing is healing then one does not move over into clearing during given series of sessions but only uses clay table healing example mrs g comes to be audited to heal her bad arm on her only clay table healing is used mrs comes to improve her ability on her clay table clearing is used and as sessions progress some sessions of clay table healing also become necessary in the general course of auditing mrs g would have to alter her reasons for being processed on her own sayso before one would move her into clearing this point is made to clarify for auditors the fact that when people want to be healed they are given healing and one doesnt force them into living better lives also this takes care of case levels clay table healing uses different more repetitive easier approach than clay table clearing one completes cycles of action over and over on the pc the steps are step 1 get the pc to name the condition the pc requires to be healed step 2 make sure the pc is satisfied this is the condition he or she wants to be healed this and 3 can be meter steps step 3 get the pc to name body part that seems most closely associated with the condition step 4 make sure the pc is satisfied he or she has given the correct part step 5 get the pc to represent the named body part in clay or whatever modelling substance is being used step 6 make sure the pc is satisfied the body part has been represented step 7 get the pc to state what should be near the body part just made step 8 make sure the pc is satisfied he or she has stated the correct thing for 7 step 9 get the pc to represent whatever is named in 7 in clay step 10 make sure the pc is satisfied he or she has represented itstep 11 begin with 5 again and do not redo 1 to 4 inclusive until the upsets in 3 have vanished step 12 begin with 3 again step 13 begin with 1 again when condition vanishes caution to redo the condition every time or to change the body part to be healed every time are failures to flatten the process before beginning another the whole process is flat only when 1 is flat by which is meant the condition has vanished but one doesnt even test for the condition again until the afflicted body part is recovered so there are two things to flatten one first flattens the body part or several body parts before choosing new condition to handle to be explicit when one has done 5 onward over and over until there is difficulty in the body part left one checks the condition and if it has not vanished one finds new body part 3 to fit the condition and using this does 5 onward over and over until that is flat then one checks the condition l again and if it is still there one finds new body part and uses it for doing 5 onward over and over one does this until the condition l has vanished you get session then that looks like this in terms of the above step numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 5 6 7 8 9

fatal never touch the pcs clay b tell the pc what is wrong with him or her never evaluate c fail to flatten body part never leave body part until it is ok d choose another condition before the original condition is gone always get another body part to do if the pcs attention is at all on the condition fail to get the pc to make up the affected body part each time always get the pc to make up the body part being used newly f fail to follow the auditors code always follow it g fail to use the auditing comm cycle every time the pc does or says anything he or she wants you to understandh pass over something the pc did or said that you didnt understand always get it so you the auditor understand it i audit pc with ptp always clean up ptps j audit pc who has an undisclosed overt always clean up the overts k audit over the top of an arc break handle arc breaks properly on the meter summary clay table healing is study in repetition and simplicity for an auditor it is easy it is very successful but it is very simple auditing however that simplicity has to be done right therefore it is very precise series of actions an auditor who cant handle the auditing comm cycle shouldnt ever be let near clay table healing as the pc will be made ill by constant arc breaks the above to k precautions are all but one dont touch the clay basic standard auditing they must be well done skills each one before clay table healing can be routinely successful failure to have these skills of auditing well in hand will give very uneven results one pc gets better another pc change another gets worse uniform results come from uniform auditing skill the pc is put on the meter only at session beginning and end and is not metered during clay table work unless ptps overts or arc breaks become apparent at which time the pc is put on the meter for as long as is necessary to handle the matter auditing occurs when the auditor takes up too much time with nonclay table activities in clay table auditing caution the pc sometimes names some very peculiar body parts and sometimes says conditions are body parts it is not for the auditor to argue he or she is just to make sure that the pc is sure sometimes going into clay table clearing you find yourself really doing clay table healing in such case the auditor should use the healing approach not the clearing approach example pc wants to improve his walking and we find this according to the pc is body part so we use clay table healing not clearing clay table clearing is process of clearing words and symbols clay table healing is process of taking ailments out of objects the processes therefore can both be used in clearing but when you use one or the other you flatten it before returning to the other and you keep the steps separatedont mix the steps use the steps of one or the steps of the other it should be noted in passing as point of interest that pcs trouble with any object in addition to body part responds to clay table healing where the object is not body part but is still an object like car or typewriter you can use the clay table healing steps these healing steps however unlike the clearing steps will not work well on condition only healing steps become less workable when you try to audit worry or being afraid they work best on leg or clumsy fingers extending them beyond their purpose to any part of any of the eight dynamics the healing steps drop in workability clearing steps however work on almost anything whether an object or condition but work better on conditions than upon objects lrh jwrd l

to understand something about policy policy is not just something that lrh just dreamed up it is something that has been worked out and that has held true over period of time if someone who was supervising staff knew all the policies on central orgs that have been worked out over the years and if he did what they said he would never have to solve single problem looking over any scene in an org and the policies for the area lrh could routinely give the policy covering that situation it is interesting for an organization as young as this one to have this much policy policy makes communication possible between two points this is its main function not forcing people to obey orders in the absence of policy you dont have communication between two points because the two points are not agreed on anything tradition is likewise an agreement the above points about policy therefore also cover civilization civilization has mores and guides to conduct which are agreed upon and which assist the general survival of the individual and the majority of the group policy is or should be based on experience and should lead towards survival so we have policies customs and procedures these are sequential doingnesses if you dont know and follow these you fall out of agreement with the people who are following them and you will feel strange you might have better way to do something than the agreed upon way but if your way is at wide variance with the accepted way the others may shoot you if society is too dissonant it is longer civilization because it does not have agreements there are all kinds of ways of getting married these days this bunch of mishmashes shows that there is something wrong with the institution of marriage as it now stands the rise of animalistic psychology has violated the individuals right even to have customs behaviorism invalidates the idea that people should have customs there are only supposed to be pushbutton responses one is supposed to react to stimuli etc instead of policies you have manipulation people and societies object to manipulation especially hidden manipulation it violates the right to have right way to do things it denies the individual the right to any sense at all it is longer based on considerations of survival the dignity of man involves the ability to decide policy with others policy and customs are things that make sense at least at the time that they are formulated customs and policy look odd when they persist after the problem that they were created to handle has vanished when tradition that originally made sense loses its sense it may now have as its rationale politeness or some such thing people tend to carry solutions into the future after the problem is licked policies can conflict if realities are different for instance in miami during the second world war american planes had habit of practicing dive bombing on hips entering harbors they got fired on by dutch ship returning from the south pacific in scientology we appear to be out of step but what we are out of step with is the new technology of control which assumes that men are animals that should be handled by having their buttons pushed lrh was taught at princeton that law proceeds from the customs of the people law that proceeds only from central source and ignores or seeks to change peoples customs will either be ignored or will bring on revolution as with prohibition the civil rights act also sought to change customs by legislation it violates the first amendment and other amendments of the constitution it violates the right to jury trial something that one seemed to notice this produced breakdown in communication which resulted in disorder and rioting because it was violation of custom and an attempt at central enforcement of custom the way to keep the peace is to keep the customs of the people military governors had this fact laid on them with an axe since this was the way to keep civil bodies in back of the front lines under control having them out of control was embarrassingwhen you violate the expected survival pattern of an area you have said die bucking custom is bucking theta comm line you have cut the comm line between point and point b now their actions dont mesh since they are operating on different policies custom and policies are methods of bringing about communication and agreement along certain matters that lead to higher level of survival if policy leads to higher level of survival it is good policy poor policy leads to lower level of survival and bad policy leads to complete disaster this accounts for the ebb and flow of civilizations civilizations could die out because their customs have become antiquated but far more often civilizations are smashed by the fact that the central government or an external source an invasion has smashed the customs of the civilization today on this planet communism is engaged upon this process using the wundtian psychology of 1879 scientology is not in conflict with the customs of the planet or the universe quite the contrary if you can communicate with anyone on the subject of scientology he will agree with you unless he misunderstands word since you are talking to him out of the traditional technologies of healing and the human spirit and the traditional philosophies and psychologies know the truth and the truth will set you free this is an ancient policy of psychology that is now being violated for instance washington is now claiming that the government has the right to lie this violates the custom of tell the truth and the policy of the courts governments justify government lies in all sorts of ways but individuals arent supposed to lie it is legal for governments to lie but not for the individual to lie this is bad news the man in the street will agree with you as long as you dont use words that are strange to him he will agree on ideas such as the idea that man has right to be free to control his life etc our target is not to make an insane person quiet but to make him sane that has been the target of mental healing since the stone age but not in the last halfcentury that is why we are looked upon as dangerous by the new faddists who are interested in manipulation not freedom they would argue with the idea that it is good for people to be free an idea that has never been contested in civilized society try asking psychiatrist what are you trying to do with your patient he will never tell you that he is trying to make him sane he will obfuscate the slave philosophy was practiced in sparta communism is similar but bolder we have made progress in how to accomplish goals which man has had as long as he has been man what we have developed that is new is technology to attain the traditional goals of philosophy and religion scientologys way of expressing mans basic goals and our organizational methods may be new but not the basic goals of scientology which are the goals of man we can improve on the idea behind the witch doctor healing by manipulation of symbols we have the advantage of being able to communicate and have session by witch doctor we do not mean someone who uses an african black magic juju but real healing witch doctor in the absence of orthodoxy anything can be called unorthodox society that has right conduct is society in which anyone can be punished and criticized by art critics scientific agencies etc because he is not conducting himself rightly you can longer comply there is nothing to comply with they pretend there is custom there when there isnt any that there is 1234 procedure and then will never tell you what it is and yet punish you because you dont comply with it the material wealth of society doesnt demonstrate its longevity or endurance greeces greatest art and philosophy was produced in its decline the communication of custom is itself technology when it breaks down the custom can be abandoned conversely when the custom itself has broken down you get communication breaking down we get breakdown of civilization when its customs break down because of failure to communicate them you get cooperation when people dont know the customs on which they operate the means of communication of customs are longer taught in this civilization this is where study tech and misunderstood word tech fits inso you could be remiss in teaching scientology by using words that are strange and misunderstood if you do this you have not established communication being comprehensible comes ahead of being effective since comprehensibility makes your effectiveness apparent if youre truly comprehensible people will forgive you almost anything as witness my life so the proper order of importance is 1 comprehensibility 2 necessity demand 3 effectiveness6409c22 shspec40 review of study there are textbooks on how to study even in schools of education lrh plans to write one that would revolutionize the field of study and education in johannesburg tests on school children showed decrease in iq that was more marked the longer they stayed in school the longer person studies of course the more words he runs into that he doesnt understand and the more confusion he piles up artists writers etc in the workaday world have this peculiarity the successful ones have never taken course in their art field or even finished college at party given in new york for professional writers lrh did an informal survey to determine the educational background of the guests he found that most of them had either been expelled from college or had never attended college in the first place the one exception was man who piped up and said that he had obtained phd in literature he turned out to be literary agent failed writer in the years following lrh found out that writing courses dont teach writing they teach some technology that writers dont use and various gimmicks that writers also dont use writers do have and use technology but writing courses dont teach it the trouble is that writers are professional liars when then tell you how they write they tell the most incredible tales they never really say what they do so there are lot of pretended technologies in the area in any technical subject technology builds up in the area of correction such technologies as photographic retouching or correction lists tend to be more complex than the technologies that they correct if you have the technique of how to do it in the first place everything will move smoothly from there on but if technology is missing not known or not practiced we will now get complicated technology arising as lowerscale subject that will be corrective of the upperscale subject medicine is another example of corrective technology the upperscale technology would be that of making bodies properly in the first place as practiced today all education is corrective technology it is trying to correct its own failed corrections there is duress in the field to get students to learn this must be an effort to correct the students failure to get the material in the first place caused by early confusions duress in education is substitute for the missing technology of the misunderstood word and the cause of the failure of education the duress makes it impossible for the student to use his education he is left on suppress and an onlyone basis because the duress has caused him to go out of arc with the subject so he does nonapplication of the information he might even get weird and revengeful towards his subject schools keep kids in line until they are old enough for the police to take over the job freedom from is fighting something or worrying about it not true freedom one way in which you can have misunderstood is by getting what the writer is saying but having misunderstood or missed something perhaps earlier not getting what the writer is driving at how does the state suffer from miseducation in russia many students were given onthe job training for key posts but after their training 100 of the students left the posts that they were trained for what must have happened is that way back in school the communist love of changing the meanings of words got in there the english upper governing class lost their influence by being educated to death so the continuation of culture depends on having technology of study the government is trying to bring in law and order while creating disorder delinquency and stupidity in the schools once again scientology and dianetics collide with an area where there is pretended technology unlike the area of medicine and drugs the field of education is not one of vested interest because there is not as much money in itwhen you are teaching teachers about study technology you should recognize that you are moving them up from level 0 to level i see pp 521523 above for description of level 0 above for description of levels i and ii for summary of levels and classes iiv you can tell the teachers the iq of your children could be increased by study instead of decreased or your school could run with less upset or juvenile delinquency is caused by miseducation this will be very acceptable to them and they will never think to ask where this data and knowledge is coming from because they never think about anything in the first place you havent realized that they cant see where it is coming from because they cant see at all this is because they have been trained into stupidity when you fail to communicate to someone about scientology it is because you are talking to them above the level at which you should be talking to them youve got to give them the idea that there are data that data can be comprehended and that they can learn something then you can give them the idea that there is knowledge people dont expect anything to work because nothing ever has they dont think that there is anything to know if we are unreal to them it is because everything is unreal to them we have high commandvalue over them scientology could probably put the whole society into some kind of obedience basis but that is not our purpose you would have win if you approached someone on the following gradient 1 getting him into state where he could learn 2 showing him that there was something to be studied 3 showing him that there was body of information about study 4 showing him that there was body of information to study this hasnt been our normal approach we have generally overlooked the fact that if someone cant learn he cant even receive your message in fact his basic ptps have to do with not knowing if he knew that there was some way to learn about anything he would be very interested if he could know that there was some way to gather data he would be on your side because he could apply this to his ptps you would teach him that the first step to knowing about something is to observe it both you and he have probably taken it for granted that he is already doing that when he isnt you could ask him something like have you ever taken really good look at what your wife is doing or some such when you are teaching someone about study you take the obvious and expand it as an introduction to the field in dissemination you are not up against societys ignorance cussedness or unwillingness to be helped but against incorrect study tech and charge on study this jams your comm line incorrect study tech prohibits people from learning that there is more to know thus stultifying the intellect creating stupidity and discouraging observation therefore study is an excellent dissemination tool when disseminating stay simple concentrate on something like one learns through observation which is accomplished by observing tell them about the value of observing gaining familiarity etc dont start with the arc triangle the person that you are disseminating to doesnt know that knowledge hasnt already all been found out he has to come to realize that he can learn and that there is more to know since he first tried to learn something he has been subjected to technology that stultifies the intellect he has weird ideas about study that make him flinch from the idea of learning things you have to make him reach by giving him the obvious which he can see take the obvious points and get studious about them you can get away with being studious about what is obvious person isnt going to get anywhere except by observation anyway let him get complex about the subject of observation he will only wind up back at observing he will get to the fact that you observe by observing after he blows through the complexity by reach and withdraw of observation he gets more familiar eg with his wife thus study can bring him out of ithubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 27 september 1964 remimeo sthil students level iv clay table clearing this hco bulletin cancels the steps of clay table clearing in hco bulletin of aug 18 ad14 the original issue of clay table clearing was called clay table iq processing the materials were not broadly released pending the outcome of pilot projects i conducted i find now that the hco bulletin of aug 17 ad14 which covered clay table iq processing was the better process hco bulletin of aug 18 ad14 clay table clearing was not as good as the first process i released as auditors had more trouble with it in using clay table clearing as per the hco bulletin of aug 18 ad14 auditors asking for the answer in step ii what about the subject the pc hadnt grasped always got question as the pcs answer example of the error auditor what do you want to improve pc my memory auditor step two what about memory havent you grasped pc what it is auditor reduce that to single term pc remembering end of example of error you see that the auditors question was answered by pcs question about the subject what it is therefore the pc answered his own question for the next step step iii remembering you now have solution to get the pc to represent in clay it has restimulated the real earlier missed word the pcs solution to the pcs question wont lead anywhere in being processed so this isnt correct to get pc question as the answer to ii or pcs solution to the pcs question as the answer to iii this takes clearing nowhere and also restimulating an earlier word in the pcs bank that is misunderstood puts bypassed charge into the session leading to possible arc break we learn then that 1 we mustnt ask the pc question about what he wants to improve that will cause the pc to answer with his own question and 2 we must not take new solution to the pcs difficulty to represent in clay solution is later in time than the upset about the subject the cause of the upset is always an earlier misunderstood term the term is therefore restimulated in trying to represent the solution the term then becomes bypassed charge therefore we also learn this phenomenon if you get the wrong thing to represent in clay it will restimulate the right thing that should have been represented and the wrong thing will not itself blow if represented in clay as it is not early enough therefore done wrong clay table clearing will not seem to work and will also arc break the pcclay table clearing is then relegated to level iv and only clay table healing where the chance of wrong words is remote is placed at level iii at level iv the auditor has been trained to do arc break assessments obviously clay table work needs its own arc break assessment list the important things are 1 dont let the pc answer what about it he wants to improve with question and 2 dont let the pc give you new solution to his difficulty as the thing to represent in clay in clay table iq processing as per hco bulletin of aug 17 ad14 this didnt arise because the auditors question was asking only for term these are other things ive learned about this process from watching other auditors use it and with the above these are incorporated into the following brief rundown of revised clay table clearing clay table clearing issue 2 step i find an area where the pc is trying to get smarter or wants to improve or wants to become more able this we will call the subject it must not be physical body part as that is clay table healing if the pc gives physical body part or health change to clay table healing step ii the caution here is dont let the pc toss this off carelessly it must be some subject in which the pc really wants to improve or some subject in which the pc really is trying to get smarter if pc is sarcastic do an arc break assessment from an appropriate list establish that the pc sincerely wants to improve in the subject or get smarter about it or become more able in it write the subject in the auditors report step iii trace back meter make lists word or term the pc has had difficulty with in the subject this is called the term the usual question would be what word or term have you had difficulty with in subject name step iv satisfy yourself that this is the word or term the pc has had difficulty with but do not make lists or go on and on getting the pc to change terms for hours as step iii and step iv require only few minutes or even seconds usually write the term in the auditors report step v tell the pc represent that term in clay pc may represent it and any related masses in clay and may work on it as long as he or she likes step vi make sure pc labels with paper and pen or in some similar way each thing the pc represents make sure you do not touch or take away the pcs clay be honest if you dont understand what the pc is doing and get the pc to make you understand it using labels and clay not long verbal dissertations not related to the clay and labels make sure you dont evaluate for the pc or tell the pc what his models or difficulties are all about make sure the pc is satisfied he has represented the term in clay dont arc break the pc by refusing the obvious or by letting the pc quit while the pc is still dissatisfied he has done ita nice balance to maintain make sure the pc is satisfied he has represented the term in clay step vii have the pc do the term in clay again this is repetitive representation in clay do not do or continue to do this step after the pc has had big cognition about the term which blows it or blows the whole subject in this step the term can be done over and over many times the test is whether or not the pc has fully understood it note with terms on which the pc has definition at all the pc can look them up in the dictionary or the auditor can look them up for him but the term must still be done in clay as there was some reason the pc missed it step viii when the term is flat go back to the subject and ask the pc how he feels about it if there is the least hesitation or any evidence of discomfort or doubt about the subject continue to use the same subject and go on with step iii above locating new term for the same subject be very careful however that the pcs attitude stems from the subject itself and not an arc break go on down the steps with this new term for the same subjectstep ix when you have handled enough terms to produce very obvious change and when the subject is obviously flat by reason of cognitions or abilities regained go to step i for new subject and carry it through the steps as above caution pcs with ptps overts missed withholds and arc breaks will not progress under routine auditing these must be handled see the book of case remedies and other sources for data on how to handle ptps overts missed withholds and arc breaks routine use remedies note the new expanded definition for the old word routine and the new word remedy this special use of the word routine accidentally fits the way it was formerly used but it was used more loosely then to mean any combination of processes in package whereas it now means that which advances the usual case that is in session and has ptps overts or arc breaks in restimulation routine such as clay table clearing is for routine use it is for normal case advance pcs with ptps overts missed withholds hidden standards etc as well as arc breaks do not advance on routine these require remedy remedy is something you do to get the pc into condition for routine auditing this concept is new and is very much needed it constitutes bit of breakthrough in itself when you attempt routine auditing such as clay table clearing on pc who has longstanding ptps or has just got one for the session or has overts or withholds or an arc break you will get advance from routine auditing you have to remedy the case by rudiments or special processes then when the case is ready to run routinely you can do or resume clay table clearing there is process that handles ptps and rapidly advances the whole case also there is process that handles an immediate arc break and also advances the general condition of the case overt and withhold processes are excellent remedies but slow case advancers the mark of the skilled auditor is the ability to remedy case and then get on with routine auditing the auditor who only audits remedies will never really advance case permanently and an auditor who can handle only routines and cannot remedy case are alike in that they wont make clears it is upon the dual ability of the auditor that clearing dependsthe ability to spot the non advancing case spend few sessions remedying it and then get on with routine auditingthe ability to get those fresh ptps and overts in the first few minutes of the session and get on with the routinethese are two different auditing actions the auditor who can observe which of these actions the remedy or the routine needs to be done and who can judge when they should be done and who knows the remedies and who also knows the routines can clear pcs the answer to clears now depends on the skill and training of the auditor far more than on the state of the pcs case future errors after the pilot run on getting clay table clearing ironed out in use in the auditors hands and the blunders that will be made before auditors become familiar with the hco bulletins and these processes i think the main errors will be found to be gross auditing errors such as failing to get the pc to answer the auditing question and such like meter clay table clearing sessions are started with meter the meter is laid aside when the routine is actually begun checks for tone arm action can be made mainly by observing the pcs good indicators if theyre in the pc is getting ta if theyre not observable the pc isntgetting ta however as clay table clearing is at level iv pc who has not gotten ta action on lower level processes should be run on clay table clearing until his case is remedied note it has been observed in one pc who did not get ta action that correcting just one word the pc had misdefined in his bank brought about good indicators but this was done merely by case remedy using twoway comm not by clay table clearing the pc thereafter got good tabut would have done so after the remedy on any process clay table work is not for cases who get ta in general see the book of case remedies do not confuse getting one word defined by twoway comm with clay table clearing they arent the same thing the meter is used at the beginning and end of session to handle rudiments and give data on state of needle and ta and is used during session only when pc has an arc break and then only to locate and indicate the charge on arc break lists when remedy such as mid ruds is undertaken during the session the meter is also used session form model session as amended is used as the session form of clay table clearing in using model session be careful not to restimulate overts and ptps the pc obviously does not have in restimulation at session start if the pc is eager and talking about the clay table give the usual start of session procedure note down the ta and state of needle give the start of session and swing at once into the body of the session when session has been successful do an equally brief end of session procedure and end it only if the pc seems preoccupied at the start of session or the ta is found to be much higher than at the end of the last session or something seems wrong should you go into full model session beginning rudiments and only if the session was rough should you do the end of session rudiments these uses of model session are for levels iii iv and vi lrhjwrd l ron hubbard copyright 1964 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6409c29 shspec41 gradients gradients are vital in all areas of scientology and life gradient is concept that has bypassed many scientologists as evidenced by the difficulty that some of them have in pulling withholds if you knew gradients well you would never have trouble with auditing pcs what you are really having trouble with isnt what you appear to be having trouble with the same applies to pc or student if you are not getting case gain on pc it could be mistake in the gradient you cant get someone over trouble that he isnt having so if you process his problem and he doesnt get better you have him over his head on what he can confront and handle what he complains of may not be the real problem at all some processes like what could you confront handle this automatically this doesnt mean that you dont have to follow gradient in your address to the case you should plan it on gradient processes are all designed with the idea of starting with little and moving up to lot the classification program is designed the same way as the auditor moves up in class he can handle more difficult pcs and more of the pcs case you can handle just about anything by tackling the first fundamental thing first and taking on more and more bit by bit in lots of research people have never gone to the fundamentals they have never asked what they were looking for or where to approach it or observed some obvious basics for instance you can examine sound gross vibration with light fine vibration but you cant examine light with sound you cant look at it with anything but itself the only thing that can look at color light waves is you the color wheel cant be circle the same color appearing at the other end of the spectrum must be matter of harmonics this gets into taste you are the only thing that can evaluate color harmonics when you dont know about gradients you try to build castle on top of palace on top of condition that you call the pcs case without going to the fundamentals knowing what you are looking for or where to approach it or observing some obvious basics this happens because you never walked up the gradient and never saw the fundamentals of th pcs case you only wind up with notion of the fantastic complexities of existence if ones observations are nonsense then ones solutions will be nonsense and if you keep trying to observe the totality of the case without observing one little thing about it you will never find the gradient that leads to observation of the case approach case with the question what is he doing that i can understand you wont be able to remedy the case unless you can find one thing to handle at time on the case to remedy case find one thing you can understand about the case and fix it then find another as this proceeds the case will become simpler dont try to grasp or handle the whole damned case in two days the pc is always at the top of selfcreated gradient of complexity that he hasnt climbed and he tries to get the auditor there too so you get suckered in on it and try to solve the whole case overnight thus you get lose now take overts you ask the pc if he has ever committed crime that could send him to jail if it were discovered that is flying to the top of the building jumping the gradient and making the auditor feel as though he cant pull overts you pull overts on gradient what gradient would work first you have to take into consideration the fact that you are pulling the pcs overts on comm line which may be pretty tenuous to start with the comm line must be sturdy enough to hold the level of charge or overt that we want to have come over on it first build up the comm line then start getting some little overts that come across easily leading to bigger and bigger overts always pulling overts of magnitude that the pc can confront there are two gradients 1 the pcs willingness to talk to the auditor 2 the level of overt that he is willing to tellthere are degrees of willingness to talk to the auditor you cant expect pc who is unwilling to talk to you to tell you some big overt once you have the comm line in the pc will be able to tell you as much as he himself can confront which will increase the more he tells you people can generally confront thought more easily than they can confront masses or things so on the pe course stick to definitions of things like life or body not necessarily even definitions of scientology terms you can blow tons of charge with nothing but definitions dont get into heavy bank stuff use light gradient definitions about thoughts are easier for people to grasp than definitions of masses if someone cant see the data that you are giving him he cant apply it and he flies up to the top floor of the building adds complexities to the data and then considers that it is complex and that there is fundamental there so he invents bunch of nonsense with regard to it misses it entirely and never gets any result with it so be careful about gradients in training the student has to be able to see and apply what you are talking about what you want to watch for in pc is glibness unreal answers and comm lag trying to find gradient to enter in on with that fellow is fantastic because he is already stuck in the top floor but unreal the gradient had better be low slow approach you have to find something about the case that you can grasp then go ahead the time to start looking for something in the case that you can grasp is when the case gets into some difficulty some lack of advance undercut the case on the basis of ability if you undercut on the basis of sanity you may insult the pc find out what the pc can really do and get him to do it better when pc doesnt advance find lower gradient find something about the pc that you can grasp the next time you feel queasy about pulling pcs overts look the situation over do you have comm line there to pull the overts on when you do the next stage is what could the guy himself confront approach the pc gradiently with questions like what have you done and why wasnt that an overt you have to keep the comm line in while pulling the overts by pulling them gradiently you can err by asking the pc for more overt than he himself can confront having done as long as you are asking for overts he can confront the comm line will stay in and your manner wont even matter asking for things that he cant confront only restimulates him it is not matter of politeness when we pick up points in the gradient of living that the person has bypassed and gotten stuck on and get him to understand them we call this clearing at those points the pc had wrong answers or omissions when those are cleared up he can confront and live life easily dont be so dedicated to the gradient that you fail to observe when someone climbs it very fast as can happen complicating factor that hasnt been recognized is peoples prior education or knowledge of some area or activity this is generally explained as natural talent or knack you can get mistaken ideas about the difficulty of auditing or about your ability to audit when the real problem is only that of approaching the case on the right gradient it is trebly important to train students on the right gradient so that people can win at it and know that they can do it and keep on doing it6410c13 shspec42 cycles of action the importance relative value or worth assigned to datum is as important as the datum this is evaluation of importances cycles of action are fundamental of which one must be aware there is particular crisis relating to this topic except insofar as auditors have been failing to get their questions answered we are talking about cycle in the sense that wheel going around and coming back to the same place is cycle the word cycle has picked up some odd connotations as in the modern short story which tries to give an appearance of nochange by starting and ending in the same place in the same mood in the field of mechanics cycle is total revolution in physics and engineering cycle is the motion between the end of one wave and the end of the next wave ie the motion during one wavelength there is an old definition of cycle that has more to do with what we are talking about that is philosophical concept that doesnt involve the word cycle this concept is found in the hymn to the dawn child in the vedas it expresses that there is nothingness from which comes something that grows matures decays and returns to nebulosity and nothingness johann templehof went to india and got people from krishnamurtis group interested in scientology this annoyed krishnamurti the concept of the cycle of action gives us lots of applicable wisdom cycle of action is plot of consecutive incident against time from r6 we know that time is commonlyheld consideration it is big gpm with lot of rootwords with an endword time connected to them it is an agreedupon progress that we are all making and moving forward in view of the fact that we are all in present time since there is nowhere else to be and that we dont really move in time the incident as it goes forward appears to be plotted against time it is the incident that makes the time old humanoids have time because little happens and there is future kids days are interminable because lot happens you could boil this down to tolerance of incident it is ones tolerance for incidents that give one the impression of time going fast or slow when person has an increase in his tolerance for incident life seems to slow down if you measure time by the amount of incident occurring and then didnt have any incident you wouldnt have any time it is not that the more incident the more time you have necessarily you are dealing with false commodity for one thing and for another thing how much time you have depends on the consideration of whether lot of incident makes lot of time or little time you can practically monitor how much time you have by your consideration of how busy you want to be sometimes there gets to be too much incident so there gets to be not enough time you can manufacture time by deciding that you can confront being busier its the consideration of how much incident makes how much time that gives or subtracts time from ones existence it is how much you decide that you can tolerate or confront if you have the consideration that you can be busier or that you have enough time to do something you can and will you can consider time long or short and it will be you can also get up to point where you consider time long or short without measuring it against incident you could get high enough toned to consider that evening was couple of years away and live couple of years before evening since you would thus be out of agreement with other beings it would seem that to do this you would have to have considerable tolerance for being alone for long periods of time the three actually five different attitudes towards time here are 1 unconscious 2 incident monitors the persons time here the person is at the total effect of time and he is habituated to incident monitoring his time but it is certain speed of incident that he is used tohaving monitor his life when the pace changes he gets reverse consideration the person never affects changes or even considers the incidents this is homo sapiens 3 person monitors time by willingness to confront incident here at the state of release the person considers one of two things if i get busy time goes faster b if i do nothing time will go faster the first of these two considerations is commonest here the being gets the idea that he can monitor time by his willingness to confront incident he can change his own pace by changing incident 4 person just postulates time this occurs around level vi here the persons considerations about time alone determine the amount of time he has he doesnt have to depend on exterior incident to consider whether much or little time goes by he can make party last long time if he wants to 5 pandetermined time at the level of ot the being might have pandetermined attitude towards time which would monitor the time of others as with sleeping beauty mesmerism provides lowerscale example of similar phenomenon with mesmerism you can put someone into total rapport where he feels and thinks the feelings and thoughts of the person who has him mesmerized the mesmerizer can pinch his own back and the mesmerized person will leap convulsively and have fingernail marks on his back this is form of physical pandeterminism it is quite unethical to do this on some poor sap who has only shred of selfdeterminism left but it is lower harmonic of the upperlevel pan determinism over time to considerations about how much time is passing you could add other considerations like the consideration that the actions people are engaged in are happinessproducing actions in an area where such consideration had been made everyone would think he was doing fine you could also have the opposite consideration that the actions people are engaged in are misery producing actions in this case people would feel as though they were committing overts by acting this would change peoples considerations of time the main culprit in doing this is the newspaper which puts out this consideration by reporting only bad news on pan determined basis but using very lowgrade finite comm line the newspapers are spreading the idea of worthless series of incidents this makes time worthless to people if society depends lot on whether they feel their cycle of action should or shouldnt proceed this consideration will do something to time and to the amount of doingness an action is simply motion through space having certain speed especially volitional or intended motion it has bad name in some quarters eg in literature or psychology in civil defense during crises any individual in action during an atomic attack would be put out of action local authority who is supposed to act is not being the idea is there must be action intended motion the prevention of motion is fairly prevalent in mental healing the psychiatrist thinks that someone is cured when he becomes inactive person who has label and who is active must be restrained in mysticism the wise or enlightened person is supposed to be totally motionless people would like to believe this if they are scared of ots the mystical mystic is case type he is reasonable but he wont act so the idea of time and whether incidents or action should occur gets messed up action has become dirty word you get an insane generality here the attitude that incidents should take place or lots of incidents should take place below this you get its all going on and theres nothing i can do about it its all happening to it has nothing to do with this is the sign of civilization on the decline even the person who says it has nothing to do with has to admit that it does have something to do with him when he is driven to it if you approach him closely enough with action and you will get cornered rat effect then you get an uncontrolled response like barroom brawl action gets bad connotation because it can produce destruction and pain when people cannot confront pain they are also refusing to confront action and when this happensthey cease to confront incident and they wont advance cycle of action and their sense of time goes out by telling sick people to stay quiet doctors are prolonging the time for them telling them to have activity of some sort would make time pass more quickly this has remarkable effect on healing where more action is demanded of person than he can confront pugnacity sets in so you get destructive action which is more action than anyone can confront as with hitler who created too much action this gives people the false idea that the cycle of action always ends in decay and death because this is what it looks like in the physical universe it is here that we depart from the cycle of action depicted in the hymn of the dawn child we are taught this on every hand you have so many examples of cycles of action that end in death and disaster that you get reluctant to complete cycle of action this leads to such foolish ideas as i mustnt complete cycle of action on the pc because it will injure him this is the worry of an auditor who never completes auditing cycles that is what keeps people from arriving they are afraid to get to the final point or there could be something wrong with the persons considerations of cycle or action confrontation of incident may be low for instance some auditors cant confront too rapidly changing pc or too slowly changing pc this could lead to overrun if one cant confront changing the process or underrun if one thinks that completing cycles of action means killing pcs any of these difficulties with the cycle of action means trouble with the auditing cycle one way or another if an auditors comm cycle is out after he is up the line bit then this is why it is not the complexity of the process the auditor has to have his auditing cycle in for sure by the time he is auditing r6 there are 1 considerations of cycles 2 considerations of action 3 considerations of cycles of actions in scientology cycle of action is simply from the beginning to the end of an intended action ie the start of the cycle of action would be the first appearance of the intention to do something or of the intention to begin doing it now you can also have an otherdetermined definition of cycle of action from the moment mother looks at to where she whips the selfdetermined cycle of action is from the beginning to the end of an intentional action the way to take care of trouble with the cycle of action is itsa

organizations city offices and field auditors who have received training in it clay table is for levels iii and iv clay table healing is level iii and clay table clearing is level iv where the auditor is also trained to handle arc breaks central orgs are to use only on hgc pcs or in the stuff coaudit but may permit use by an auditor only where that auditor has been fully checked out on its hco bulletins and is supervised clay table public use or use on public coaudits or has courses will bring about casualties these clay table processes are extremely powerful and therefore very restimulative to give lectures on them to uninformed persons may have repercussions in their cases clay table is also deceptively simple it appears so easy to read about that one is likely to miss its simple but only if you consider driving between two ravines at hundred miles an hour is simple it looks easy until you run off the road by failing to locate the steering wheel before you drive central organization may teach classification courses at level iii for clay table healing as soon as it has instructors trained in it at saint hill it may teach classification courses at level iv in clay table clearing to students who took the class iii course staffs may be trained and checked out in clay table work but preferably by saint hill graduates there is penalty attached to misusing clay

question answered at times when pc answers in reply to the question asking for what he wants to improve to be clear and this is then pursued in the session serious trouble occurs why what do you want to improve is not answered by to be clear it would be answered by my sanity it would not be answered by my aberrations since nobody wants his aberrations to improve if your pc is not trained into being in session you of course dont get answers to your questions what auditor has recently as you should to all new pcs particularly explained what was expected in the session i am going to ask you something then you are going to answer it then i will acknowledge then i will ask again etc in other words what auditor has recently explained to new pc the auditing cycle well if he hasnt on new pc an auditor cant control anything that goes wrong in the session as theres session clay table like all other auditing has to have an auditing cycle of asking or telling the pc getting that exact question answered or command complied with acknowledging it and so forth when this is omitted particularly on clay table work disaster follows faster than in other types of processes as clay table bites deep so 1 get your pc trained into what the auditing cycle is and 2 get the question or command that was asked or given answered pcs can say whatever else they please but they must answer the auditing question or auditing occurs more than any other this one is bedeviling clay table work and slowing results and every upset on clay table so far has been traced to this l ron hubbard lrh jwrd

the pc sessionable when you start to audit new pcs the liabilities are these 1 if you do not show him what auditing is he does not know what is expected of him thus he is not only not in session but in mystery 2 if you do not indoctrinate him into what he is supposed to do when the auditor gives him question or command he often does not answer the question or comply with the command and only then can things go wrong in the session 3 if the pc is not in the auditors control and if anything goes wrong then the auditor can do nothing about it as he does not have any session or control of the pc covert auditing some particularly has students are very remiss in this and covertly audit in talking to someone they also seek to audit that person without the person knowing anything about it this of course is nonsense since auditing results are best achieved in session and session depends upon selfdetermined agreement to be audited you can achieve changes in person with covert auditingi wont say you cant since i have done so but it is uncertain and not very popular you have to audit without agreement when the pc is unconscious and cant respond but to make it common practice when it is really used only in emergency as in unconsciousness or when you have time would be foolish further using scientology to handle situations in life is whole subject in itself and it isnt auditing example person angry scientologist locates and indicates the bypassed charge example on raving psychotic the scientologist arranges for the person to have rest away from his ordinary environment and associates and forbids damaging treatments example somebody seems to have lots of problems so the scientologist teaches him what problem is example by observing the anxiousness of person to receive motivators the scientologist estimates the degree of overts the person has committed example one sees difficulty in planning is not getting any better so he decides there must be lie in the plan and locates it at which time good plan can emerge there are countless ways to use the philosophy of scientology in direct application to life and even hopeless physical conditions respond to just understanding more about life for instance there are many cases on record of bedridden person reading more than dianetics the evolution of science and becoming well and activeso one doesnt have to covertly audit if any communication is possible one can teach advise orient someone in existence applying the truths and knowledge of scientology the point is when auditing is begun it is best done by agreement to be audited and is most successful when the preclear understands what he is supposed to do in response to auditor actions and is only disastrous when there is not enough control in the session to set things right if they start to go wrong any auditor who just sits and lets pc ramble on and on with regard to the subject being handled even in itsa is very foolish has session and is wasting time the wrong thing to do is chop the pc up and cut his comm because he is so far adrift the right thing to do is to prevent it before it happens by not auditing preclears who have not agreed to be audited or who have faintest idea of whats expected of them in the hands of an unskilled auditor i have seen preclear who was running psycho analytic type session giving all the expected psychoanalytic symptoms and responses and getting nowhere there are two ways it could have been handledone is to have explained this wasnt psychoanalysis and then explained the auditing cycle the other would have been to run ow on the analysis the pc had had or even do bypassed charge assessment on the analysis probably both would be necessary if mere information about how auditing was done did not care for the condition one of the rules of auditing is never to let any part of any question or command be agreed upon once and never repeated example the auditor tells the pc when i say her in this command i mean your mother now what have you done to her the pc is always having to think back to this agreement to answer the command educating pc is not the same thing here one is knocking out past response patterns as in social actions or some earlier form of treatment one is in effect cancelling out earlier habits of response in order to get auditing to occur once that is done one does not of course have to do it again and what the pc says in session is what the pc says sometimes he wanders all about before he answers the question but the auditor in any case must get his question answered or the command complied with so auditing in general is cleancut agreement to be audited session is conducted with an auditing cycle matter how long or short that cycle may be l ron

students franchise clearing why it works how it is necessary the wrapup of level vi this last year brought about full explanation of why clearing works at lower levels and it also brought about why some could not be run at once on r6 the reasons are quite simple the basis of the reactive mind is the actual goals problem masses gpms life has pulled these out of position and thrust the pc into the mass when you find what lock words have been tied into the gpms in this or even an earlier lifetime and key them out destimulate them untie them from the main mass the gpms sink back into proper alignment and cease being effective this makes keyout clear this condition is valuable because the gpms are now confrontable one by one not dozens by dozens and routine 6 can be run easily on the preclear once routine 6 auditing has begun one can only handle the derangements of masses by list 6 bypassed charge auditing by lists or in an arc break by using list 6 as an arc break assessment if you seek to return to clay table clearing after beginning r6 you get only locks on the item the pc has been left in and cause only upset so you never return pc to clay table clearing once he has begun r6 moral dont begin r6 too soon clear first that the state of clear is transient and impermanent does not make it less worth while in itself it is of enormous mental value and the full results never fadeonly some of the bloom thats because the main bank is brought back into restimulation by life or the pcs overts etc it is easiest to run r6 on pcs who have at some time or another been cleared it is also possible to run r6 immediately on some rare pcs because they are just about clear anyway it is risky to attempt r6 on the average pc who has not been cleared some pcs cant be audited at all on r6 until they are cleared that is because they have too many lock words words not in the gpms but close in meaning keeping the large chunks of the reactive mind in present time when these lock words are handled by being found and understood the reactive mind drops out of restimulation and one can then run it out in an orderly fashion item by item and gpm by gpm those are the mechanics of the reactive bank itself the real use and value of clearing in auditing and the conditions necessary for the successful handling of routine 6 from the first moment he starts being audited the pc is heading first for orientation in his environment fewer ptps and conflicts with others around him second for release from thefeeling he will only get worse and cant progressdone by giving him small wins third by getting rid of his physical problems fourth by clearing away the locks on the reactive bank and fifth and sixth by running out the reactive bank itself note fifth is mentioned as it is also encountered in the form of whole track not always necessary to handle once the reactive mind is vanquished the pc is again capable of his full potential as being if you try to shortcut it you get failed cases so thats the why of levels and their design and even if unpopular they are the necessary steps across the bridge if somebody comes along and says it can be done with needle and syringe or whirling until one is dazed or sitting on mountain top gazing at his navel he has perfect right to say it but the road out whatever the process followed must overcome the obstacles listed above or it is road but trap my responsibility has been to find the way to develop the processes by which it could be walked safely and to communicate what i know about it to the best of my ability even across barriers erected to communication and against the wishes of those who place value in slaves there could have been thousand other ways million variations billion reasons why one should not go but if there are other ways man has not found them and indeed has only laid more difficulties by his past efforts that is the way it can be travelled truth is not always popular that is why there is so

levels the reasons for them lrh had cognition khrushchev was overthrown because russia went into compulsive duplication of great britain and the us and tried to hold an election the term raw meat applies to 1 lack of processing 2 the pcs opinion of what he is someone who has actually started on r6 must not be returned to clearing or getting definitions audited etc he is sitting in an item and could pick up some other item out of sequence some endword that is out of sequence this could give him nasty somatics so there are solid technical reasons why pcs progress up the levels the original reason for levels was to stretch auditors out to what they were capable of it became obvious that pcs didnt gain well when run above their level despite their eagerness to be run on r6 the reason why john campbell parted company with lrh was his devotion to the machine he thought the ideal civilization was machines tending machines people who consider that they can formulate infallible plans for utopia dont think that people should have power of choice since it disrupts the utopian plans but the ideal plan has hardly been found on the political front as one can see in any newspaper furthermore since absolutes are unobtainable the ideal state will never be achieved beings are not all alike so who could judge when perfection had been attained you would never get complete agreement man is capable of his own judgment this alone keeps the absolute from being attained for instance what is the perfect piece of music all the way down the line the individual never completely loses his individuality integrity to himself is the last resort of thetan the individual can only be pushed so far richmond kelly turner commanded the uss astoria cruiser in world war ii he was captain bligh type guy very grim lrh knew him maybe the source of mr roberts nothing on the astoria worked the crew was on white mutiny in which the crew acts only under direct orders takes initiative and executes nothing that is needed unless directly ordered to do exactly that that was their way of getting even thetan never gives up russia is one big white mutiny it is not that there is anything wrong with having rules and having people comply with them what is wrong is using duress continually to deny people any judgment or initiative with regard to the rules the gradient of ability relative to rules is 1 doesnt obey rules because he doesnt know them 2 total adherence to rules based on understanding of them 3 varying the rules based on higher understanding what gets interesting and can get troublesome is when you follow the rules with variations if you are trying to learn some subject follow plan or something there are two conditions that are variation from the must do it 1 total ignorance and rebellion based on aberration 2 skill and judgment enough to know which rules can be varied and howthis latter condition is reached when you know the game all the way around the amateur tries to find the perfect instrument to do it the pro knows how to make use of what hes got and the rules in order to vary the rules successfully you have to know the rules cold otherwise you will fail because you are operating out of ignorance and rebellion lrh tells an anecdote about an old chinese carpenter who resists using guard on his band saw he knows what he is doing youve got to earn the right to vary the rules in life or in auditing in confronting variation from the rules the manager supervisor or whoever has to be able to differentiate between the two sources of variation ignorance or familiarity if he doesnt judgment is denied the individual who could exercise it and the supervisor gets into trouble are you dealing with ignorance or virtuosity you can enforce the rule against the person who varies it for the first reason with impunity because life is assisting you by punishing stupidity and ignorance anyway but dont shoot the second type of variation down this person has earned the right to vary the rule whether the person knows his business or not can be seen from his results if he is consistently getting results and protests the rules we can see that he is virtuoso if he is consistently unable to get results he needs more rules not less since his departure from the rules doesnt get good results the only way you will progress is over his dead body but he never dies so you cant win using force and duress against ignorance you must educate on the other hand if you combat virtuosity instead of ignorance and you create leaders for revolution that will unseat you the people who have been exported to this planet all fall into two and only two classes 1 rebellious geniuses 2 stupid criminals there is inbetween the latter rebel destructively and stupidly the former rebel intelligently they give trouble to the stupid state which thinks that it has the perfect answer one gives reactive trouble and the other gives intelligent selfdetermined trouble you had better recognize the difference between the two when you try to handle selfdetermined intelligent trouble with force this is handling thought with mass and it doesnt handle well since power of choice is the main power the person has so use duress on the former but never on the latter all protest is not the former exclusively our question in scientology is why should some people stay debased stupid and protesting becoming an ot has to do with power of choice and power of observation therefore wave of magic wand will produce an ot since it would just be another effect on the person buddha tried to wave magic wand and produces slaves horrible example of postulate gone wrong the asia minor ot j who turned leaves into loaves and fishes or whatever just impressed everyone to the point that they are still overwhumped this is probably not what he intended the unpopularity of scientology levels comes from an unfamiliarity with the road to be walked youve got to get the guy to where he can talk to an auditor enough and tolerate control enough and be keyed out enough from the mass that he is sitting in and under enough discipline to confront the objects in the bank necessary to run out to resolve his case that may take quite awhile the easiest thing to do is to unburden the case by getting locks off you do this by 1 handling the auditing environment first you unburden the session then get the pc educated into what he is supposed to do and willing to talk to the auditor you have to explain this to him and show him the auditing comm cycle get what auditing is over to the pc this is getting the pc sessionable lrh invents the term sessionable 2 handling the betweensessions environment preparation handle ptps at first just by finding out what they are before actually auditing them we can ask the pc what the parts ofhis environment are cf expanded dianetics this alone helps him to sort out his problems it gives some gain get the pc to straighten out his environment so he is not sitting in his office with his house right outside the window while he is in the auditing room this is not auditing the environment it is just getting the pc to identify its parts at this point you dont want his problems with his job you just want his job named as part of his environment you are getting him sessionable which might take several sessions b auditing then you ask the pc for problems with the parts of the environment mentioned above find one that his attention is stuck on ask him what communication he hasnt completed to those terminals you handle problems very lightly but wind up with the period between sessions being clean enough so that it doesnt keep coming up at the start of each new session again this may take several sessions 3 beginning approach to the bank now we are going into the pcs past and future in 1 and 2 above we were broadening the perimeters of the pc we continue this now by beginning to handle the pcs past and future helping him to orient himself better we could run give something that happened in the past with date and place this does the same for the pcs past environment that you have done for his present environment at what is now level i you begin arc straightwire orienting the pc to his past repetitive processes if the pc gets to this point he can be audited easily 4 clay table healing using this you can straighten out the concern that the pc has about the body 5 on up the levels in completing the levels you are handling locks on gpms so they get all straightened out ready for r6 someone who hasnt been brought up through the levels isnt ready for r6 and will get into trouble6410c27 shspec44 the failed case the book of case remedies handles the failed case look up the symptoms and handle as directed but there is one case that will always be failed case the reason lies not with the auditor scientology or the tech in 1954 lrh researched people who had turned against dianetics and scientology to find the common denominator he found about twentyone people who had been in dianetics and scientology but had worked against it and caused lot of trouble seventeen of the twentyone had criminal records also they had had auditing but had gotten case change there might have been twentyone for twentyone but lrh got tired of looking after seventeen recently lrh found out the other factor in the totally failed case the totally failed case commits more overts between sessions in pt than can be picked up in session he is the continuous pt overts case he doesnt asis things well he takes long time to get at anything he takes responsibility for anything he is hard to get in comm with etc in freudian terms he is the detached case dissociative reaction schizoid personality he admits to fantastic crimes but doesnt really consider he did them he is really saying society forced to commit or my hand stole the watch etc he says i picked up the pocket book but means my hand picked up the pocket book such case cant asis the overt because there is lie in his statement of it it is incomplete he says my hand stole the watch but the correct statement is i saw the watch and stole it with my hand he has put an alteris on the line he didnt do it it happened then there is the guy who is putting up social front and never admits anything he has done because he doesnt want to look bad to the auditor this is partly matter of getting in good comm line you can get real overts off the case by asking for horrendously exaggerated overts like have you murdered any little children lately it is trick for another gradient you can ask what are you willing to talk to about you can audit all the sexual overts off the case that you like without restimulating gpms because sex is not in the gpms or endwords as such though it forms locks on gpm end words and rootwords sex is humanoid activity and the gpm words dont necessarily refer to humanoid activities but the real failed case commits so many overts in pt you dont have time in session to get them all off the failed case is continually committing real pt overts he is so irresponsible that the overts dont react on the meter because they are just not potentially real to him the source of small reads in r6 is running the pc where he isnt which means leaving bpc where he is if he is getting reads on any list you are using to correct this situation either the items on the lists are unreal because hes got reality on gpms being totally uneducated or hes got it all suppressed if you are running prepcheck on pc and he runs out of answers on button eg suppress dont push him on that button just because you are getting ta on it you will just restimulate the rest of the buttons ta action in prepcheck is on the process ie the whole prepcheck not on the button you happen to be running at the moment if the prepcheck is not flat when you reach the end of the buttons go through it again i know of auditing action where pc who has been getting proper ta action in the session who says i dont have any more answers to it has ever had any further answers to it there are indicators in the physical appearance and meter behavior of the pc who is running ow that there are more answers than he is willing to give only in this case do you press the question home this is not applicable to ptps withheld ptps wont hurt the pc they will only be withheld if they are connected to an overt and you will get that on ow buttons so watch out for overrunthe slowest rate of change in pc is at the start of the case the case that is winning accelerates in rate of change as you audit it up the line cognitions of given magnitude come faster comm lag decreases so you have to be careful not to overrun the pc the failed case however doesnt change at all you can check rate of change of case by checking to see how many hours it takes for person to have fundamental cog of some kind at first perhaps it takes 25 hours later perhaps it only takes an hour then you get the person who audits almost by inspection the increased rate of cognition goes along with decrease in the comm lag another thing you will notice is the pcs physical posture and mannerisms if there is change in these over time if the pc keeps returning to posture or mannerism then he is not experiencing rate of change of progress another bad indicator in this respect is when nonoptimum condition persists when you see that you know that the case needs remedying the other bad indicators would be there too as an auditing supervisor you should expect to see some change within few days one way to spot what overts the failed case is committing between sessions is to listen for what he complains of in others the way you would handle the failed case would be to extend your zone of influence to include everywhere the case goes between sessions for long enough to prevent the continuous overts long enough to pull the pc out of it this would be very thoroughgoing solution and change but it is about all you could do you do what you can there is fast process to undercut the case either the furthest south process you could use to benefit the case would be justifications but you still have to get comm line established first commoner than the continuous pt overt case is the person who continually committed overts in the past and has this in restimulation the case that has lots of past overts but isnt doing them in pt is easier to handle the proper approach to this case is 1 get in comm with the pc 2 get more and more overts on gentle gradient if the case keeps getting off the same overt it has become problem as far as the mechanics of it go problem is postulate counterpostulate therefore it floats in time this is problem about the overt it wasnt an overt in his view it was justified so in this situation you can use 1 what have you done 2 how have you justified it or 3 how wasnt that an overt this is not repetitive process ask what have you done that was harmful act and really get an answer that both of you agree was real overt this is not repetitive question it is one question that might take 25 hours of arguing back and forth about what is an overt etc chitterchat to get answered when youve got it then ask how was that not an overt and keep going on that one for as long as it takes to really get that answered you want to get what he really thought was unharmful about it why he really had to do it at the end of this process he will really cog dont run these two questions as repetitive process it can take long time to get them answered you are asking the questions right into the guts of aberration you are not going up on it on some gradient hoping some accident will occur you are going right down the center of the road after something that answered that question an unchanging condition comes from postulatecounterpostulate so an overt which created or sought to solve an obsessive problem hangs in time and becomes both an overt act and ptp most overts are committed as solutions this gives you another inroad to the case that keeps committing pt overts handle the overt as ptp that the pc is trying to solve you could find out what ptp are you trying to solve with overts or what have you done recently that was pretty antisocial then what problem were you trying to solveby doing that it would be an oddball problem the trouble with such case is that you are likely only to get bunch of motivators repetitive questions dont work if the question you ask the pc or his answer to it isnt real to him the fact that the pc is out of comm with you makes finding the ptp that the pcs overt is intended to solve uncertain of result however on ordinary cases it works very well to find what ptp the guy is trying to solve with his overts and doing so blows lots of overts into view that the pc might never otherwise have suspected not all overts are efforts to solve problems some are accidental some are out of misunderstoods getting the justifications off unlocks the problem aspect takes lot of locks off etc the pc will cognite on the problem and the effect can sometimes be magical none of the above will work with truly failed case type although it may sometimes nudge such case the only thing you can do with the failed case is to restrain him somehow from committing overts long enough to get him audited long enough so that he will quit committing the continuous pt overtsthe book of case remedies manual covering preclear difficulties and their remedies by l ron hubbardhow to use this book this is professional text part of the clearing series it does not give the processes on which cases should be run to achieve higher levels it gives the processes you have to use when the case doesnt run on standard processes to use this book properly one does not start or run cases with the remedies given one uses the table of remedies contained herein when the case has not run at all or momentarily or consistently does not advance on general processes when the case wont run whether for session or for many sessions look the preclear up in the table of remedies and use the prescribed action only long enough to get the preclear running again then return to the regular processes for the level preface for this edition the first edition in 1964 of l ron hubbards the book of case remedies gave auditors necessary points of technology for the last push to the great releasing and clearing successes that followed only year later release grade and clearing technology was completed by l ron hubbard and students were already started on the big one itself the clearing course in one and half years from the first clear we had close to seven hundred more clears there is not the slightest question about any part of the route people from everywhere and all sorts of backgrounds are taking their steps easily the clearing course and the training and release grades leading smoothly to it are all utterly provenly successful any new list of clears as of any date has to be revised upward fast as new graduates finish the clearing course growing and doubling in numbers and to graduate from that course one has attained the state which is philosophys win after thousands of years there were clears before ever the book of case remedies becomes with rons hco bulletins of 9 november 1967 and 13 january 1968 new book and new technical breakthrough this expanded edition contains all the material of 1964 it also releases new technology resulting from upper level discoveries by l ron hubbard his text is thus expanded but is not otherwise changed in this edition remember that except for the new materials added in this edition it was written during the last phases of total clearing research release and clear were found in completed clearing technology and result to be higher states than at any earlier time described when ron says clear in this book he is talking about what is now known to be high

archangel michael and lot of luck fourteen active years and tens of thousands of pcs preclears have changed all that during this past summer when i had completed the routine 6 pcs own goals research i was able to review all the levels and stages pc or an auditor scientology practitioner has to go through what emerged in getting this material into understandable form was that people had in general confused clearing and operating thetans ots clearing many had tried to deify clears and had rarely understood ot clears and clearing are actually fully explained in the first published article on dianetics dianetics the evolution of science and in book one dianetics the modern science of mental health clear is the name of button on an adding machine when you push it all the hidden answers in the machine clear and the machine can be used for proper computation so long as the button is not pressed the machine adds all old answers to all new efforts to compute and wrong answers result people who have old fixed answers reacting when they try to think get wrong answers when they try to solve their current problems such old answers are not cleared rollo is still solving the tantrums of his mother who has been dead for years marybelle is still running away from the tramp who attacked her when she was 10 years old so rollo stays home as the solution to the women of the world and marybelle runs madly about as solution to all the uncouth men she sees their friends think theyre bit odd their doctors prescribe pills and we clear the old senseless answers which wont let them get more sensible answers as adding machines or any kind of calculator they would be junked they give wrong answers to life because they already have hidden answer in their cog wheels they are not cleared well really thats all clear is clears are beings who have been cleared of wrong answers or useless answers which keep them from living or thinking the state of clear now the state of being cleared was what confused the issue people wanted to know what theyd be like if they were cleared good question data accumulated but not as fast as the questions the people cleared would be better feel better act better be more moral etc all that is matter of record but the craving for an absolute caused everyone to put the state called ot in place of the condition of being cleared absolutes in our axioms are unobtainable2 the state of operating thetan operating thetan is state of beingness it is being at cause over matter energy space time form and life operating comes from able to operate without dependency on things and thetan is the greek letter theta theta which the greeks used to represent thought or perhaps spirit to which an n is added to make new noun in the modern style used to create words in engineering it is also thetan or theta to the nth degree meaning unlimited or vast the traditional concept in brief thetan is an individual spirit or soul or life unit or fifty other things all adding up to the traditional concept of mans spiritual nature or beingness more radical recent thought departed into adventurous bypaths and announced contrary to more conservative philosophy and usual acceptance that man was an animal made up of brain and bones and possessing soul this may have made the originators of this quaint russogerman school feel less guilty for what they did to men in wars and science but it takes more than marxist psychologist to change every mans basic philosophy forever and 9999 of earths people at least still believe they have souls or are souls only the philosophically illiterate and the agitators for the recent radical schools of psychology suppose they have made inroads in mans belief that he has or is soul only those who seek to enslave man would try to sell the idea of soulless man the rest of us and we comprise remember 9999 of the population of the planet still hold to the concept that we are spirits or spiritual beings and that we go elsewhere when we die only men who have quite thirst for revenge would want others to totally die following tradition remaining with more traditional philosophy and working with what seemed more reasonable i was able to demonstrate in 1952 the actual existence of this thing called spirit the experiments of exteriorization but wishing to avoid spiritualism or even soul because both had such bulky histories as words i coined the word thetan derived as above and scientologists ever since have been quite happy with it i should have called it the more traditional greek word psyche perhaps but at that time i saw virtue in being confused with psychologists who explain in their own texts that they dont know what their own name means as they dont know what psyche is and dont believe there is one which rather upsets their title to the word they use for themselves but anyway for better or worse i used thetan the ultimate state it soon became quite visible that the spiritual condition could be improved and an ultimate attainment of cause over matter energy space time form and life was possible now this was the ultimate state operating thetan theoretically attainable transcendence over death and the travails of mortal existence it was dream bold dream but not new dream like everything else we have in scientology it is based on traditional philosophy the thinking then of every great civilization up to this century not only would have grasped the meaning of this but were themselves seeking to attain it name great name in historical philosophy all right he was trying to attain ot by means of exploration of life thought man or the reason of things3 only in the last few decades has the dream been challenged by radical few that they teach in universities is only comment that todays universities arent the halls of enlightenment they were ah well they can all be improved and it would take more than these rebellious few to smash one of mans great dreams the dream of freedom of spirit the dream of freedom of self the dream of ascending above base matter clear differs from ot so ot was the state of beingness clear was gradient condition gradual bettering during studies of the past year all this disentangied and became understood and for the first time was easy to express clear is not gradient up to ot clear is gradient up to homo novis only homo man novis new this is desirable improvement very desirable for anyone an entirely new thing has to be done to make an operating thetan but one had to know how to make one to find out about one and routine 6 the process that makes an ot starts really at homo novis certainly routine 6 runs best on homo novis the proof is that those scientologists who have been pretty well cleared dont have any trouble at all with routine 6 and those who havent been cleared and particularly those who have had few gains in processing have pretty awful time of it with routine 6 they get bit along with it but its like watching pygmy wrestle with an elephant thus although we have routine 6 my task has been to bring preclears up to clear and then to send them onward to ot the levels to ot this is done and very doable it is by moving the being up to few basic wins with ordinary processing up to level iii and then moving the preclear up to clear level iv and then going for ot which is level vi v being skipped but left in place because it contains known type of technology not needed but necessary to know the existence of to stretch point one is really clearing from level i to level iv but clearing now that ive had chance to refine it is itself process that takes skill and ability both to run and receive and one has to get the being up to doing that so being who can do that is release which reaches up to level ii these stages as expressed in levels are all quite real and are getting very precise see chart of gradients fourteen years of work developed lot of knowhow and it all fell into its rightful place when one got to where one could stand high and inspect the ground below one needed routine 6 and the practical attainability of ot to see where one was with the fellow who just walked in off the street how did one get such fellow from the coal pit to the mountain top that was the problem operating thetan cause over matter energy space time form and life theta clear4 not now used as it is only partial condition of ot contains history of man implants past lives whole track engrams parascientology data processes not now in active use clear does not react with wrong answers to human problems healthy susceptibility to illness and accident reduced selfdetermined higher activity level less an effect of the environment release one who can get better and knows he has benefited and knows he wont get worse apprentice scientologist one who knows how io know how to study what life is about homo sapiens gradients of various states5 chapter 2 handling the preclear at the lowest place on the route up one finds the roughest auditing conditions there is heroic effort that will produce an instantaneous and permanent gain one can produce fast gain that is so fast it unstabilizes the pc its all too sudden and new and the pc cant take it so quick witness the fate of pc who is suddenly exteriorized deprived of body even for few minutes in auditing matter how much better he feels for those few minutes the change is too quick you can exteriorize any pc thats sudden and fast and impermanent so its research tool not an auditing procedure you possibly could clear somebody by some lightning fast means but down hed come again why because you havent cleared enough buttons thats all you left too many wrong answers on the case for the case to be right in new state the secret of preclear gains the secret of handling the preclear is getting the pc wins he or she can have in the world he or she is living in and getting more and more such wins until new gains are acceptable and therefore stable after that you can go for broke in clearing and when you have cleared the pc until he can stand unaided and get right answers in the existence he or she is living in you can again go for broke with routine 6 and you eventually have ot be comfortable i speak now from very well substantiated technical height which it took all the fourteen years since book one to climb and i find it can be done rather easily if it is done from step to upward step and not subjected to an impatient hit or miss scramble in scrambling one only gets bruised on the rocks this is not to say it takes long time it takes rather steady and orderly time not flying before one can walk so to speak and being able to look up without getting dizzy and to look down without being overcome with the grandeur of ones own climb be comfortable about it is the byword people enroute at comfortable rate are actually unaware of gains they just take them for granted the auditors task the auditors task in handling the preclears case is to guide the pc upward and again upward to comfortable acceptable wins which the pc can have and which therefore will be permanent6 chapter 3 keep the pc getting audited in order to help anyone much less make clears and ots it is necessary to keep the pc getting auditing that sounds rather easy at first glance with all the dazzling goals that can be set for him or her but in actual fact this is the only place auditors fall down obviously you cant clear anybody regardless of the techniques you have if the preclear wont keep on getting auditing give an auditor preclear to audit and auditors do very well indeed but when the pc blows or just doesnt turn up any more what then thats the end of clearing isnt it the basic problem so the basic problem of making clears and ots is not getting preclears to have auditing thats easy really its getting preclears to keep on getting auditing and there is where auditors yes and case supervisors fall down the preclear must get wins there are several reasons why it is hard to get pc to go on getting auditing they add up under the heading wins if pc is not getting wins then two things happen since the pc is not getting more able the pc is not earning fast enough or finding the additional time necessary to have auditing and b the goal of attaining higher state is thwarted and this arc breaks the pc if pc is getting wins then the pc gets more able earns more or finds more wherewithal and accomplishes more in given period of time leaving more time to use for auditing and b the minor upsets or discomforts which accompany even the smoothest auditing are disregarded economics i am sorry to have to mention economics but these play their role operating in society full of economic traps and snares one has to have solution to them or falter and this applies to both the auditor and the pc regardless of whether there is any charge for the auditing or not freedom from economic acute duress means freedom to get audited or audit and such freedom is bought more easily by ability than chance but persons progress improves the7 persons control over things long before ot is approached actually long before clear is realized the road is long people dont realize how long the road is they dont want to confront it but theres an awful lot of aberration between an ordinary being and release much less clear release is one who knows he isnt going to get worse the command of release over his time and possessions while not overwhelmingly great compared to clears is yet fabulous compared to one who was never audited at all the necessity for wins so it is vitally necessary to keep the pc getting wins matter how small to keep the pc getting audited this is sometimes hard to do for the traps of life are always yawning for the person near the bottom in fact the closer the person is to the bottom the more likely he or she is to fall into one of lifes snares therefore the closer to the start the person is the more necessary it is to get him wins for the easier it is for him to be thrown about in his routine daily existence as catastrophe is simply arrived at just in day to day living while quite uncleared and as the persons answers in that state are not likely to have high percentage of accuracy the easier it is for him to get into condition where he cant receive further auditing for economic social or other reasons it takes wins to surmount all that if being at any point on the route blows departs for good theyve lost the final attainment even if they did have benefits know the answers so to make releases clears and ots one has to know the answer to how do you keep pc getting auditing to answer that you have to know the answer to how do you handle case that isnt winning and to know that you have to know how do you handle cases and to know that you have to know how do you handle the particular kinds and conditions of cases all that must seem very vast and indeed it has been the knowledge has been of highly specialized kind borne out of years of training and experience what do you do when the pc does what auditing supervisors have been beating their skulls in on such problems for years therefore seeing this i developed sort of table this table or list gives what to watch for what to look into when it happens and what to run to take care of it now all these processes are old ones theyre tried and trusty8 i have not tried in this book to give you the magic processes that assist or release or heal or clear or make ot for this material is not the material the auditor falls down on in this book i have given you the processes that keep pc getting audited when he seems to stop or wants to stop or might stop the fundamental basics given any kind of competent training the auditor must realize only these things if pc be kept getting auditing the most dazzling results can be obtained by following the processes for those results b if the pc cant be kept at auditing results can be obtained c that the pc who gets regular wins acceptable to the pc will keep on being audited d that the pc who doesnt get his small quota of wins will blow and that the blowing preclear is the only remaining generally unhandled problem in any auditing activity f that the preclear can be handled so as not to blow and to get wins this book tells you how to do these things9 chapter 4 the ptp overt and arc break the three general areas which prevent wins are 1 the ptp present time problem 2 the overt act with its withholds of all varieties and 3 the arc break sudden drop in affinity reality and communication the following facts are some of the best substantiated facts in the whole of our technology the present time problem 1 the presence of present time problem in session unless handled will prevent all gain if ptp exists in the pc and you try to audit something else and ignore the ptp the pcs personality graph will show change the ta tone arm of the meter will not move well the pc will not make his or her session goals and auditing may eventually cease the overt act 2 in the presence of an overt act undisclosed to the auditor and withheld from him matter how openly it may once have been done the auditing cycle of communication between auditor and pc as in trs 0 to 4 cannot occur as the pc is withholding therefore nothing can vanish in the pcs reactive mind and auditing becomes painful the graph will not change nor will the ta move well the arc break 3 in the presence of an arc break the pcs attention is so distracted by the reactive charge that has been bypassed restimulated but overlooked by both pc and auditor that the strain of splitting attention between the charge in the bank and the auditor will operate to worsen the pcs case reduce the pcs graph and freeze the tone arm of the meter therefore one must not pursue an auditing cycle during an arc break but may only locate and indicate the bypassed charge the main point if an auditor doesnt handle these three things competently the pc will eventually cease to be audited now recognizing that these three things the ptp the overt and the arc break are all that really forestall continued auditing it becomes necessary for the auditor to know his bulletins and be skilled in practice and to be successful in releasing healing clearing or making ots i make attempt here to give all the anatomy and ways of handling the three demons named above the technology is all over the place in bulletins and publications and also i intend to do book on each one here i only wish to point out that if pc gets wins he or she will get more auditing if he gets enough steady auditing on standard processes he or she will go all the way up and only the ptp overt and arc break can prevent the wins and cause the blows so to release heal clear or make ots one has to be an expert on blows their cause and cure10 chapter 5 the pc that quits pcs who blow or cease to be audited do so because 1 nobody noticed the rising arc break 2 the proper action was not taken in time handling blows therefore one has to do three things in handling pc who is about to blow or who blows blow means leave get out rush away cease to be where one should really be or just cease to be audited these are 1 notice the condition or circumstances leading to blow long before the person does this is probably the single hardest thing to teach according to my experience as it depends on the auditor instructor or scientologist observing and not being so reasonable about the beings condition that nothing is done 2 take the proper action to prevent the blow by proper action is meant to find out what the circumstances preceding the condition have been and then to fit to those circumstances course of action example pc has been running level i only well one wouldnt go into level vi or level iv processes if the pc has been running itsa saying its _______ then obviously there is only the auditors acknowledgement to consider so one only finds out what hasnt been acked acknowledged example if the person has only been studying one finds out what the missed definition was in short base the action on what the being who is blowing was doing just before the blow 3 carry out the course of action effectively dont just find out if the person has withholds pull them example hgc pc is blowing pc was running overts d of p director of processing tells auditor to find the missed withhold auditor comes back and says yes there was one the d of p thinks thats good thats handled then the d of p hears that the pc went back to smokeville in the middle of the intensive checking the d of p finds that although missed withhold registered on the meter and one was pulledthere was filthy needle afterwards so there were several missed withholds and an ineffectual job was done remedies remedies for threats about blowing or blows are only good if 1 the condition is observed 2 what the person has been doing just before is found out and course of action based on that is planned 3 the course of action is effectively carried out unless these things are done one often finds the person who is blowing is already beyond reach remedies not properly selected or carried out do not seem to work and so get invalidated remedies are quite workable when the above steps are followed but pie that is too sour and requires sugar doesnt get any sweeter if you pour salt into it whereas salt is perfectly acceptable when added to dish that needs salthubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 9 november

review and of the flow of students and pcs through the saint hill org show 1 the key processes so far as orgs are concerned are remedy remedy b and s ds 2 auditors need direct mechanical technology to do these three processes effectively remedy remedy locates the misunderstoods person has in scientology originally it read misunderstood words words of course will emerge in the general run of misunderstoods remedy is done only by listing it must not be done verbally alone it is level iii process the listing question is in the subjects of dianetics or scientology who or what has been misunderstood the item is found on the list and given to the student that is all there is other step the rules of listing all apply if the student wont have the item it is not correct and the list must be straightened up with the general auditing rules that govern listing remedy b the form of this process is changed it is done by three lists these three may only be done by formal listing and the general tech of listing as governed by level iii tech the lists make the form of an ithis is done to locate what in the scientology pt is giving trouble it is done as list and the item is found list 1 b the listing question is in your studies of dianetics and scientology who or what are you having trouble with the item is found and given to the student this step is governed by all the tech of listing list 2b the item found on list lb is now listed in order to find the past track subject similar to what is giving trouble in present time the listing question is in your past who or what was similar to item found in list 1b it is highly illegal to limit the question to this lifetime all the rules of listing apply the item is found and given to the student list 3b the third list of the process is now done the listing question is who or what was misunderstood in the item found on list 2b the listing is covered by the general tech of listing as found in level iii the item is found and given to the student this completes the remedy b if floating needle occurs any time during the process with good indicators thoroughly visible in the student the process is concluded at that point the process is used on anyone having trouble studying dianetics or scientology the trouble as it doesnt clear up with remedy is coming from some prior subject more than one of these can be done if all steps are done for each ones d search and discovery of suppression is called an s and d it locates the suppressives on the case i have several times undercut gotten processes that reach deeper on s ds the earliest process asked merely who might have been suppressive to the pc this is still valid but i have found 2 flaws in it 1 the auditor does not do listing type s d at all but just chattily brushes it off 2 the list from this question contains an actual suppressive that is passed right over therefore i undercut the question and obtained much better results because the new question reached deeper the new question was who or what might have suppressed you then i recalled an even deeper question this was what purpose has been suppressed this was given to qual div sh some time ago it would have 2 lists the first is for the purpose as above and the second would be who or what suppressed purpose found for some reason probably because one did 2 lists this undercut was neglected therefore i researched further and developed what we will now use as an s d it is one of these killer processes it is very strong so it isnt to be carelessly do ne if you get wrong item on an s d you can make the pc ill so one has to do an s d right and follow all the rules of listing as given in level iii tech also i find now that when list item found is generality multiple subject not specific such as dogs or the public the list is simply not complete one does not have to settle for generality and then list the generality he will find that the pc will eventually list the specific nongeneral item anyway of course one can also do represent list of general item found if that seems best the real question for an s d was established only when i found purpose all suppressives have in common and is very fundamental effort in suppressives this effort by suppressives when found then permitted to form the question the key s d question is who or what has attempted to unmock you unmocking an effort to reduce or make disappear is the primary effort of suppressives therefore the listing question on test delivers up items totally overlooked by the earlier types of s d the question needs to be cleared carefully for nonscientology if it has to be rephrased watch out as the meaning may vanish tried to make nothing of you might substitute but at this writing only unmock has been tested and question for others thaneducated scientologists will be developed and issued and made part of the enclosure for the book this s d question must be done by listing only and with great care to follow level iii listing tech as it being powerful will backfire on the pc if done carelessly and wrong item is found the item is found by listing and given to the pc which is the end of the process if generality results it may be represented but listing continued will give the same result of single item general item must not be given to the pc as the final result this process will now be standard review s dhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 13 january 1968 remimeo s ds there are three types of s d search and discovery these are used to nullify the intluence of suppressive persons or things on case so the person will be able to be processed and will longer be pts potential trouble source people who are pts became that way because of suppression by persons or objects insanity is also remediable by s ds where the person can be processed these are all listing processes and if the auditor is not welltrained and good at the technology of listing not only will good result occur but the pc given wrong item overlisted or underlisted or audited over an arc break or ptp can be made ill pcs who become ill are always to greater or lesser degree pts these questions should not be shown to pc as they may start him selflisting the type is determined by the 1st letter of the key word in the listing question sd type u who or what has attempted to unmock you where this does not communicate use who or what has tried to make nothing out of you very bad off case may respond best to who or what has unmocked you this above is the standard and most used s d sd type s who or what are you trying to stop this works on all cases to greater or lesser degree it is particularly useful on case that is giving great deal of trouble gets small reads or is rather suppressive this should work on the insane also as the point where øn thetan becomes insane is the point where he begins to generally stop things i looked for years for the exact point where øn ceased to be sane and became insane on any given subject and fmally found that it was the exact moment he became dedicated to trying to stop whatever it was sd type w who or what are you trying to withdraw from this is the action after failure to stop has occurred in administering these the best order would be type w type s and then type u if you are going to give them all to

potential trouble source there are two stable data which anyone has to have understand and know are true in order to obtain results in handling the person connected to suppressives these data are 1 that all illness in greater or lesser degree and all foul ups stem directly and only from pts condition 2 that getting rid of the condition requires three basic actions discover b handle or cdisconnect persons called upon to handle pts people can do so very easily far more easily than they believe their basic stumbling block is thinking that there are exceptions or that there is other tech or that the two above data have modifiers or are not sweeping the moment person who is trying to handle ptss gets persuaded there are other conditions or reasons or tech he is at once lost and will lose the game and not obtain results and this is very too bad because it is not difficult and the results are there to be obtained to turn someone who may be pts over to an auditor just to have him mechanically audited may not be enough in the first place this person may not have clue what is meant by pts and may be missing all manner of technical data on life and may be so overwhelmed by suppressive person or group that he is quite incoherent thus just mechanically doing process may miss the whole show as it misses the persons understanding of why it is being done pts person is rarely psychotic but all psychotics are pts if only to themselves pts person may be in state of deficiency or pathology which prevents ready recovery but at the same time he will not fully recover unless the pts condition is also handled for he became prone to deficiency or pathological illness because he was pts and unless the condition is relieved matter what medication or nutrition he may be given he might not recover and certainly will not recover permanently this seems to indicate that there are other illnesses or reasons for illness besides being pts to be sure there are deficiencies and illnesses just as there are accidents and injuries but strangely enough the person himself precipitates them because being pts predisposes him to them in more garbled way the medicos and nutritionists are always talking about stress causing illness lacking full tech they yet have an inkling that this is so because they see it is somehow true they cannot handle it yet they recognize it and they state that it is senior situation to various illnesses and accidents well we have the tech of this in more ways than onewhat is this thing called stress it is more than the medico defines it he usually says it comes from operational or physical shock and in this he has too limited view person under stress is actually under suppression on one or more dynamics if that suppression is located and the person handles or disconnects the condition diminishes if he also has all the engrams and arc breaks problems overts and withholds audited out triple flow and if all such areas of suppression are thus handled the person would recover from anything caused by stress usually the person has insufficient understanding of life or any dynamic to grasp his own situation he is confused he believes all his illnesses are true because they occur in such heavy books at some time he was predisposed to illness or accidents when serious suppression then occurred he suffered precipitation or occurrence of the accident or illness and then with repeated similar suppressions on the same chain the illness or tendency to accidents became prolonged or chronic to say then that person is pts to his current environment would be very limited as diagnosis if he continues to do or be something to which the suppressive person or group objected he may become or continue to be ill or have accidents actually the problem of pts is not very complicated once you have grasped the two data first given the rest of it becomes simply an analysis of how they apply to this particular person pts person can be markedly helped in three ways gaining an understanding of the tech of the condition b discovering to what or to whom he is pts c handling or disconnecting someone with the wish or duty to find and handle ptss has an additional prior step he must know how to recognize pts and how to handle them when recognized thus it is rather waste of time to engage in this hunt unless one has been checked out on all the material on suppressives and ptss and grasps it without misunderstoods in other words the first step of the person is to get grasp of the subject and its tech this is not difficult to do it may be bit more difficult to learn to run an emeter and considerably more difficult to learn how to list for items but there again this is possible and is much easier than trying to grope around guessing with this step done person has real trouble recognizing pts people and can have success in handling them which is very gratifying and rewarding let us consider the easiest level of approach i give the person the simpler hcobs on the subject and let him study them so that he knows the elements like pts and suppressive he may just cognite right there and be much better it has happened ii have him discuss the illness or accident or condition without much prodding or probing that he thinks now may be the result of suppression he will usually tell you it is right here and now or was short time ago and will be all set to explain it without any relief as stemming from his current environment or recent one if you let it go atthat he would simply be bit unhappy and not get well as he is discussing usually late lock that has lot of earlier material below it iii ask when he recalls first having that illness or having such accidents he will at once begin to roll this back and realize that it has happened before you dont have to be auditing him as he is all too willing to talk about this in most informal manner he will get back to some early thislifetime point usually iv now ask him who it was he will usually tell you promptly and as you are not really auditing him and he isnt going backtrack and you are not trying to do more than key him out you dont probe any further v you will usually find that he has named person to whom he is still connected so you ask him whether he wants to handle or disconnect now as the sparks will really fly in his life if he dramatically disconnects and if he cant see how he can you persuade him to begin to handle on gradient scale this may consist of imposing some slight discipline on him such as requiring him to actually answer his mail or write the person pleasant good roads good weather note or to realistically look at how he estranged them in short what is required in the handling is low gradient all you are trying to do is move the pts person from effect over to slight gentle cause vi check with the person again if he is handling and coach him along always at gentle good roads and good weather level and h and r human emotion and reaction if you please that is simple handling you can get complexities such as person being pts to an unknown person in his immediate vicinity that he may have to find before he can handle or disconnect you can find people who cant remember more than few years back you can find anything you can find in case but simple handling ends when it looks pretty complex and thats when you call in the auditor but this simple handling will get you quite few stars in your crown you will be amazed to find that while some of them dont instantly recover medication vitamins minerals will now work when before they wouldnt you may also get some instant recovers but realize that if they dont you have not failed the auditor can do 3 s ds after this with much more effect as he isnt working with completely uninformed person 3 s ds only fail because of wrong items or because the auditor did not then put in triple rudiments on the items and then audit them out as engrams triple flow being is rather complex he may have lot of sources of suppression and it may take lot of very light auditing to get him up to where he can do work on suppressives since these were after all the source of his overwhelm and what he did to them might be more important than what they did to him but unless you unburden him he may not get around to realizing that you can run into person who can only be handled by expanded dianetics but you have made an entrance and you have stirred things up and gotten him more aware and just that way you will find he is more at cause his illness or proneness to accidents may not be slight you may succeed only to the point where he now has chance by nutrition vitamins minerals medication treatment and above all auditing of getting well unless you jogged this condition he had chance at all for becoming pts is the first thing that happened to him on the subject of illness or accidentsfurther if the person has had lot of auditing and yet isnt progressing too well your simple handling may all of sudden cause him to line up his case so do not underestimate what you or an auditor can do for pts and dont sell pts tech short or neglect it and dont continue to transfer or push off or even worse tolerate pts conditions in people you can do something about it and so can theychapter 6 table of remedies remedy applies to any course student including pe what is

bjapplies to cases that do not respond to any of the above when the correct observation was made and the remedy well applied what is observed remedies work although pc has been audited on them what to do find out if pc has been drawing or has been promised disability compensation or b is in any way being rewarded for his condition or c has been part of any healing profession or d is professional auditor or scientologist assess the words condition disability sickness for largest read other words of like nature may be used in the assessment what to direct flatten the following process what word assessed have you been paid for tense can also be changed to are you being or will you be connected to word assessedchapter 8 technical notes note 1 the difference between arc break assessments and bypassed charge auditing you do not audit an arc break assessment auditing consists of asking or commanding and acknowledging you dont ask anything or give command and then acknowledge while giving an arc break assessment you just do it and indicate to the pc what reads on the needle you do this until the pc is cheerful again there are several lists only one l1 applies to session the others apply to levels and types of processes only skilled meter operator should do arc break assessments an unskilled one makes only more arc breaks by flubs if an auditor who cant do an arc break assessment has pc arc break that auditor should find an auditor who can do an assessment and get it done on the pc before proceeding with auditing bypassed charge assessment unfortunately also has assessment as part of its name and can be confused with an arc break assessment but bypassed charge assessment is actual auditing level iii here one cleans each smallest read off question but not cleaning cleans before going on to the next question handling originations by the pc and acknowledging one never does this with an arc broken pc with an arc break one just ploughs on looking for big read and indicates it to pc note 2 the double arc break if at any time during the handling of pc who is blowy or has blown the pc again arc breaks while doing the arc break assessment locate the charge that has just been bypassed and then b resume handling the charge that was being looked for when the new arc break occurred dont mistake mere criticism and natter which is usually present during an arc break assessment for new arc break note 3 all of the above apply to clay table and any other type of auditing note 4 in the supervisor remedies i was greatly assisted by mary sue who has supervised more hgcs than any other auditor in the worldchapter 9 envoy none of the remedies given above have failed when actually applied in any case which had the symptoms for which the process is recommended they have been used as the routine advice given to auditors for their preclears by myself they have been used in many more instances by mary sue during times she worked as case supervisor or director of processing in many organizations almost all of these processes are quite old you will note that these processes do not resolve the preclears main aberrations they only resolve the preclears complaints lack of wins and tendencies to blow while useful even in general processing few would be satisfactory diet for all sessions always here we are only taking up the troublesome cases the cases that are made troublesome by lack of wins the case situations which absorb the bulk of supervisors time and sap his and the auditors morale i dont at the moment recall any cases or conditions of blow different from the ones given in the tables above and mary sue after some thought couldnt recall any others this does not mean there are others but they would be pretty unusual if there were use by supervisors the apparent exception to the table the case everybody says is different and nut covered falls under the australian heading because australians almost never do what theyre asked to do this exception would go somewhat like this d of p to staff auditor use remedy ag on your pc today later staff auditor to d of p that didnt work this routine could be followed by the d of p thinking golly thats different type of case not covered in the table and sitting up half the night working out new approach rather the d of p being wily and wise in the ways of auditors should have said to that didnt work d of p to staff auditor what didnt work and the staff auditor would then have said why getting the pc to think of horrible things to do to her husband which isnt if you care to look remedy ag for being wily and wise myself in these matters i always ask what didnt work and if the answer was what id said in the first place id have then asked the pc what was run and would have found something else had been used by being sure the direction was followed and was done i then have found what did and didnt work and so you have table and in using it to supervise be sure that 1 the condition the pc is manifesting is the one reported 2 the right manifestation is located in the table and 3 the instruction is properly and completely executedonly if you do these things can you supervise the auditing of pcs successfully the case supervisor or d of p who doesnt take the three steps above remorselessly will have pcs blow or will have that more gentle blow they just dont keep on with auditing but let us end

the book of case remedies must not be run to limit the pc to this life the way to do this remedy is by listing it is process of level iii one asks for subjects or practices similar to scientology he lists the answers he makes complete list not too short not too long and the item on it usually the correct subject or practice gives blowdown the pc sometimes cognites at this point and good indicators come in strongly if this does not spectacularly occur one asks for the misunderstoods not the misunderstood words the pc might have on this subject this probably cleans it all up if you got the right item on the list remedy b has been run lately in manner to limit it to this life that is an error the pc never has done anything in this life that aberrated him the subject on which scientology is hanging up is almost always in past life hence it is reached only by generalized listing you dont ask in remedy b for misunderstood words in the found subject as these would be in hottentot arabic lingua spacia or some outlandish tongue the pc has memory of as comment why cant people just understand process and do it without goofing it remedy b has been rendered wholly ineffective by the misinterpretation it has received remedy b is vital process and if run and run right as above it cures the slow academy student so lets do it do it do it and without goofs huh l ron

sthil scn staff scientology iii iv more clay table clearing goofs it has come to my attention that auditors in some instances have found new way of not getting their auditing question answered on clay table work they dont get the pc to represent the meaning of the word but let the pc do something in clay vaguely similar to the word example of wrong action auditor has found the word alchemy has been misunderstood says represent alchemy pc then does in clay retort and man in conical hat auditor says okay this is goof in fact two goofs may be present if the pc had really not understood alchemy his answer in clay would have been more searching one the auditor may have gotten five or six words from the pc and selected one that had reaction and in which the pc was not interested for pc to be so glib means the pc isnt even puzzled about it and the auditor isnt auditing an aberration helddown 5 at all see dianetics evolution of science and my lecture this year on the definition of clear without understanding which nobody is going to clear anybody anyway there may even be third goof the auditor has grasp at all of what constitutes clay table clearing or why it works and hasnt got the idea he is clarifying meanings and clearing up puzzles the pc has the actual goof is that the pc did not represent the word represent means according to the shorter oxford english dictionary to bring into presence to bring clearly and distinctly before the mind to place clearly before another this even shows up yet another goof the auditor had clearer idea of alchemy than before and so was sort of disinterested party to the whole thing and on investigation would have been found to pay heed habitually to pc origins therefore the auditor was weak on tr 2 and catastrophe on tr 4 but getting back to the main goof pc really not representing the word therefore not answering the auditing command is obvious in that clearer or more distinct understanding of the word emerged the pc then didnt answer the what word or term havent you understood in that subject and gave term he really already knew or the auditor didnt accept the right one out of several offered leaving in fact the pcs answer unacknowledged then when the auditor gave the second command represent alchemy one auditing cycle had already been missed as above and so represent was not done either if an auditor runs into the trouble of pc just doodling in clay with clarification of anything then one of the following is at faulta the auditor accepted subject the pc didnt want to improve at all or b the auditor accepted misunderstood word which the pc had never misunderstood or c the auditor didnt get even earlier commands answered on the pc and so had sloppy comm cycle going already or d the auditor had idea of what clay table clearing was all about or the auditor was auditing far above the pcs level and should have been working out of the book of remedies rather than clay table clearing or f the auditor was continuing to audit an already arc broken pc or g the pc hadnt enough grasp of the meaning of the word chosen to even start or h the pc hadnt clue what represent means resolutions of to f are pretty obvious to any trained auditor but they are resolved as follows get the pc in comm as pc obviously not willing to talk about personal affairs or himself to the auditor this is the oldest in session definition what are you willing to talk to about is the commonest remedy b same as or the auditor is just willfully choosing the wrong word out of suggestions the pc makes in which case ow on pcs is indicated on the auditor c pc or auditor madly out of comm with the other and the reason should be found and remedied d the auditor should review dianetics evolution of science and have starrated examination on as well as demonstration by the auditor of the definitions and principles of the lecture on clearing of this year before being permitted to do any more ct work the pc long since should have been looked up in the book of remedies and the remedy applied for the pcs condition or case before ever adventuring upon routine auditing such as clay table clearing f an arc break assessment should have been done if this was what was wrong g the pc should be given dictionary to look the term up in before representing it in clay h the pc should be oriented or trained as to what is expected of him in clay table auditing including the meaning of represent also to add somewhat unusual solution the command represent alchemy should be lengthened to represent the meaning of the word alchemy in clay auditing cycle the more i see of clay table goofs the more impressed i am with the wisdom of keeping clay table clearing at level iv because the main goofs are all auditing cycle goofs the silly onessuch as the auditor never has passed itsa but has always only done tr 0 when asked so this auditor has never listened to the pcsuch as gummed up tr 1such as the auditor acknowledging the pc before he has clue what the pc said or didsuch as the auditor wandering off the course of the session q and aing and just not duplicating the auditing commandsuch as failing to handle pc originations clay table work separates the experts and amateurs like gourmet would separate sour wine and champagne with sour basic auditing it just doesnt satisfy whats required i think letting students putter about with clay even on scientology definitions before they are class is at least is horrible mistake every consistently done clay table goofing ive seen so far showed up an auditor who just didnt know his auditing cycle and couldnt get that done much less ct clearing ct clearing not only can be done it clears if done l ron hubbard lrh jwrd copyright 1964 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 6 november ad14 remimeo franchise sthil students styles of auditing note 1 most oldtime auditors particularly saint hill graduates have been trained at one time or another in these auditing styles here they are given names and assigned to levels so that they can be taught more easily and so that general auditing can be improved note 2 these have not been written before because i had not determined the results vital to each level there is style of auditing for each class by style is meant method or custom of performing actions style is not really determined by the process being run so much style is how the auditor addresses his task different processes carry different style requirements perhaps but that is not the point clay table healing at level iii can be run with level i style and still have some gains but an auditor trained up to the style required at level iii would do better job not only of ct healing but of any repetitive process style is how the auditor audits the real expert can do them all but only after he can do each one style is mark of class it is not individual in our meaning it is distinct way to handle the tools of auditing level zero listen style at level 0 the style is listen style auditing here the auditor is expected to listen to the pc the only skill necessary is listening to another as soon as it is ascertained that the auditor is listening not just confronting or ignoring the auditor can be checked out the length of time an auditor can listen without tension or strain showing could be factor what the pc does is not factor considered in judging this style pcs however talk to an auditor who is really listening here we have the highest point that oldtime mental therapies reached when they did reach it such as psychoanalysis when they helped anyone mostly they were well below this evaluating invalidating interrupting these three things are what the instructor in this style should try to put across to the has student listen style should not be complicated by expecting more of the auditor than just this listen to the pc without evaluating invalidating or interrupting adding on higher skills like is the pc talking interestingly or even is the pc talking is part of this style when this auditor gets in trouble and the pc wont talk or isnt interested higher classed auditor is called in new question given by the supervisor etcit really isnt itsa to be very technical itsa is the action of the pc saying its this or its that getting the pc to itsa is quite beyond listen style auditors where the pc wont its the supervisor or the question on the blackboard that gets the pc to itsa the ability to listen learned well stays with the auditor up through the grades one doesnt cease to use it even at level vi but one has to learn it somewhere and thats at level zero so listen style auditing is just listening it thereafter adds into the other styles level one muzzled auditing this could also be called rote style auditing muzzled auditing has been with us many years it is the stark total of trs 0 to 4 and not anything else added it is called so because auditors too often added in comments qed and aed deviated discussed and otherwise messed up session muzzle meant muzzle was put on them figuratively speaking so they would only state the auditing command and ack repetitive command auditing using trs 0 to 4 at level one is done completely muzzled this could be called muzzled repetitive auditing style but will be called muzzled style for the sake of brevity it has been matter of long experience that pcs who didnt make gains with the partially trained auditor permitted to twoway comm did make gains the instant the auditor was muzzled to wit not permitted to do thing but run the process permitted to say nothing but the commands and acknowledge them and handle pc originations by simple acknowledgment without any other question or comment at level one we dont expect the auditor to do anything but state the command or ask the question with variation acknowledge the pcs answer and handle the pc origins by understanding and acknowledging what the pc said those processes used at level one actually respond best to muzzled auditing and worst to misguided efforts to twoway comm listen style combines with muzzled style easily but watch out that level one sessions dont disintegrate to level zero crisp clean repetitive commands muzzled given and answered often are the road out not pc wanderings pc at this level is instructed in exactly what is expected of him exactly what the auditor will do the pc is even put through few do birds fly cycles until the pc gets the idea then the processing works an auditor trying to do muzzled repetitive auditing on pc who through past therapy experience is rambling on and on is sad sight it means that control is out or that the pc never got above level zero its the number of commands given and answered in unit of auditing time that gets gains to that add the correctly chosen repetitive process and you have release in short order using the processes of this levelto follow limp listen style with crisp controlled muzzled style may be shock but they are each the lowest of the two families of auditing stylestotally permissive and totally controlled and they are so different each is easy to learn with confusion its been the lack of difference amongst styles that confuses the student into slopping about well these two are different enoughlisten style and muzzled styleto set anybody straight level two guiding style auditing an oldtime auditor would have recognized this style under two separate names two way comm and b formal auditing we condense these two old styles under one new name guiding style auditing one first guides the pc by twoway comm into some subject that has to be handled or into revealing what should be handled and then the auditor handles it with formal repetitive commands guiding style auditing becomes feasible only when student can do listen style and muzzled style auditing well formerly the student who couldnt confront or duplicate command took refuge in sloppy discussions with the pc and called it auditing or twoway comm the first thing to know about guiding style is that one lets the pc talk and itsa without chop but also gets the pc steered into the proper subject and gets the job done with repetitive commands we presuppose the auditor at this level has had enough case gain to be able to occupy the viewpoint of the auditor and therefore to be able to observe the pc we also presuppose at this level that the auditor being able to occupy viewpoint is therefore more selfdetermined the two things being related one can only be selfdetermined when one can observe the actual situation before one otherwise being is delusiondetermined or otherdetermined thus in guiding style auditing the auditor is there to find out whats what from the pc and then apply the needful remedy most of the processes in the book of remedies are included in this level ii to use those one has to observe the pc discover what the pc is doing and remedy the pcs case accordingly the result for the pc is farreaching reorientation in life thus the essentials of guiding style auditing consist of twoway comm that steers the pc into revealing difficulty followed by repetitive process to handle what has been revealed one does expert trs but one may discuss things with the pc let the pc talk and in general one audits the pc before one establishing what that pc needs and then doing it with crisp repetitive auditing but all the while alert to changes in the pc one runs at this level against tone arm action paying little or heed to the needle except as centering device for ta position one even establishes whats to be done by the action of the tone arm the process of storing up things to run on the pc by seeing what fell when he was running whats being run now belongs at this level ii and will be renumbered accordinglyat ii one expects to handle lot of chronic ptps overts arc breaks with life but not session arc breaks that being needle action session arc breaks being sorted out by higher classed auditor if they occur to get such things done ptps overts and other remedies in the session the auditor must have pc willing to talk to the auditor about his difficulties that presupposes we have an auditor at this level who can ask questions not repetitive that guide the pc into talking about the difficulty that needs to be handled great command of tr 4 is the primary difference in trs from level i one understands when one doesnt by asking more questions and by really acknowledging only when one has really understood it guided comm is the clue to control at this level one should easily guide the pcs comm in and out and around without chopping the pc or wasting session time as soon as an auditor gets the idea of finite result or that is to say specific and definite result expected all this is easy pc has ptp example auditor has to have the idea he is to locate and destimulate the ptp so pc is not bothered about it and isnt being driven to do something about it as the finite result the auditor at ii is trained to audit the pc before him get the pc into comm guide the pc toward data needful to choose process and then to run the process necessary to resolve that thing found usually by repetitive command and always by ta the book of remedies is the key to this level and this auditing style one listens but only to what one has guided the pc into one runs repetitive commands with good tr 4 and one may search around for quite while before one is satisfied he has the answer from the pc needful to resolve certain aspect of the pcs case ow can be run at level i but at level ii one may guide the pc into divulging what the pc considers real overt act and having that then guide the pc through all the reasons it wasnt an overt and so eventually blow it halfacknowledgment is also taught at level iithe ways of keeping pc talking by giving the pc the feeling he is being heard and yet not chopping with overdone tr 2 big or multiple acknowledgment is also taught to shut the pc off when the pc is going off the subject level iii abridged style auditing by abridged is meant abbreviated shorn of extras any not actually needful auditing command is deleted for instance at level i the auditor always says when the pc wanders off the subject i will repeat the auditing command and does so in abridged style the auditor omits this when it isnt necessary and just asks the command again if the pc has forgotten it in this style we have shifted from pure rote to sensible use or omission as needful we still use repetitive commands expertly but we dont use rote that is unnecessary to the situation twoway comm comes into its own at level iii but with heavy use of repetitive commandsat this level we have as the primary process clay table healing in this an auditor must make sure the commands are followed exactly auditing command is ever let go of until that actual command is answered by the pc but at the same time one doesnt necessarily give every auditing command the process has in its rundown in clay table healing one is supposed to make sure the pc is satisfied each time this is done more often by observation than command yet it is done we suppose at iii that we have an auditor who is in pretty fine shape and can observe thus we see the pc is satisfied and dont mention it thus we see when the pc is not certain and so we get something the pc is certain of in answering the question on the other hand one gives all the necessary commands crisply and definitely and gets them executed prepchecking and needle usage is taught at level iii as well as clay table healing auditing by list is also taught in abridged style auditing one may find the pc being cleaned up on list question giving half dozen answers in rush one doesnt stop the pc from doing so one half acknowledges and lets the pc go on one is in actual fact handling bigger auditing comm cycle that is all the question elicits more than one answer which is really only one answer and when that answer is given it is acknowledged one sees when needle is clean without some formula set of questions that invalidate all the pcs relief and one sees it isnt clean by the continued puzzle on the pcs face there are tricks involved here one asks question of the pc with the key word in it and notes that the needle doesnt tremble and so concludes the question about the word is flat and so doesnt check it again example has anything else been suppressed one eye on pc one on needle needle didnt quiver pc looks noncommittal auditor says all right on and goes on to next question eliminating pcs possible protest read that can be mistaken for another suppress in abridged style auditing one sticks to the essentials and drops rote where it impedes case advance but that doesnt mean one wanders about one is even more crisp and thorough with abridged style auditing than in rote one is watching what happens and doing exactly enough to achieve the expected result by abridged is meant getting the exact job donethe shortest way between two pointswith waste questions by now the student should know that he runs process to achieve an exact result and he gets the process run in way to achieve that result in the smallest amount of time the student is taught to guide rapidly to have time for wide excursions the processes at this level are all ratatattat processesct healing prepchecking auditing by list again its the number of times the question is answered per unit of auditing time that makes for speed of result level iv direct style auditing by direct we mean straight concentrated intense applied in direct mannerwe do not mean direct in the sense of to direct somebody or to guide we mean it is direct by direct we dont mean frank or choppy on the contrary we put the pcs attention on his bank and anything we do is calculated only to make that attention more direct it could also mean that we are not auditing by vias we are auditing straight at the things that need to be reached to make somebody clear other than this the auditing attitude is very easy and relaxed at level iv we have clay table clearing and we have assessment type processes these two types of process are both astonishingly direct they are aimed directly at the reactive mind they are done in direct manner in ct clearing we have almost total work and itsa from pcs from one end of session to another we may have only few auditing commands for pc on ct clearing does almost all the work if he is in session at all thus we have another implication in the word direct the pc is talking directly to the auditor about what he is making and why in ct clearing the auditor hardly ever talks at all in assessment the auditor is aiming directly at the pcs bank and wants pc in front of it thinking speculating maundering or itsaing thus this assessment is very direct action all this requires easy smooth steelhandinavelvetglove control of the pc it looks easy and relaxed as style it is straight as toledo blade the trick is to be direct in whats wanted and not deviate the auditor settles whats to be done gives the command and then the pc may work for long time the auditor alert attentive completely relaxed in assessment the auditor often pays attention to the pc at all as in arc breaks or assessing lists indeed pc at this level is trained to be quiet during the assessment of list and in ct clearing an auditor may be quiet for an hour at stretch the tests are can the auditor keep the pc quiet while assessing without arc breaking the pc can the auditor order the pc to do something and then the pc working on it can the auditor remain quiet and attentive for an hour understanding everything and interrupt alertly only when he doesnt understand and get the pc to make it clearer to him again without arc breaking the pc you could confuse this direct style with listen style if you merely glanced at session of ct clearing but what difference in listen style the pc is blundering on and on and on in direct style the pc wanders off the line an inch and starts to itsa let us say with clay work and after it was obvious to the auditor that this pc had forgotten the clay youd see the auditor quick as foil look at the pc very interestedly and say lets see that in clay or the pc doesnt really give an ability he wants to improve and youd hear quiet persuasive auditor voice are you quite certain you want to improve that sounds like goal to just something some ability you know youd like to improve you could call this style oneway auditing when the pc is given his orders after that its all from the pc to the auditor and all involved with carrying out that auditing instruction when the auditor is assessing it is all from the auditor to the pc only when the assessment action hits snag like ptp is there any other auditing style usedthis is very extreme auditing style it is straightforwarddirect but when needful as in any level the styles learned below it are often also employed but never in the actual actions of getting ct clearing and assessment done note level v would be the same style as vi below level vi all style so far we have dealt with simple actions now we have an auditor handling meter and pc who itsas and cognites and gets ptps and arc breaks and line charges and cognites and who finds items and lists and who must be handled handled handled all the way as auditing ta for 2l2 hour session can go to 79 or 125 divisions compared to 10 or 15 for the lowest level the pace of the session is greater it is this pace that makes perfect ability at each lower level vital when they combine into all style for each is now faster so we learn all style by learning each of the lower styles well and then observe and apply the style needed every time it is needed shifting styles as often as once every minute the best way to learn all style is to become expert at each lower style so that one does the style correct for the situation each time the situation requiring that style occurs it is less rough than it looks but it is also very demanding use the wrong style on situation and youve had it arc break progress example right in the middle of an assessment the needle gets dirty the auditor cant continueor shouldnt the auditor in direct style looks up to see apuzzled frown the auditor has to shift to guiding style to find out what ails the pc who probably doesnt really know then to listen style while the pc cognites on chronic ptp that just emerged and bothered the pc then to direct style to finish the assessment that was in progress the only way an auditor can get confused by all style is by not being good at one of the lower level styles careful inspection will show where the student using all style is slipping one then gets the student to review that style that was not well learned and practice it bit so all style when poorly done is very easy to remedy for it will be in error on one or more of the lower level styles and as all these can be independently taught the whole can be coordinated all style is hard to do only when one hasnt mastered one of the lower level styles summary these are the important styles of auditing there have been others but they are only variations of those given in this hco bulletin tone 40 style is the most notable one missing it remains as practice style at level one to teach fearless body handling and to teach one to get his command obeyed it is longer used in practice as it was necessary to have every result and every process for each level to finalize styles of auditing i left this until last and here it isplease note that none of these styles violate the auditing comm cycle or the trs l ron hubbard lrh jwrd copyright 1964 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6411c10 shspec46 ptps overts and arc breaks there is another style of auditing between level 0 and level 2 see hcob 6nov64 styles of auditing it is version of guiding style without repetitive commands it is guiding style that goes into itsa coffeeshop style lrh is talking about guiding secondary style here this is outlined in hcob 12nov64 scientology ii pc level 0iv definition processes you can herd pcs into line by multiple acknowledgment the styles of auditing parallel the return of selfdeterminism to the auditor progression upwards through the styles of auditing goes along with an increase in the auditors ability to occupy viewpoint and therefore observe the error in training is to demand more of the lowerlevel auditor than he can possibly deliver eg having level 0 auditor finding out from the pc what is troubling him before having him talk about it listen style is the hardest for the instructor to judge and at first for the student to do because it is so simple that the student adds all sorts of complexities you must adjust your supervision to this simplicity there are three actually six barriers to case improvement 1 ptps 2 ptps ld 3 overts and withholds 4 overts and withholds ld 5 arc breaks 6 arc breaks lb these are potentially present in any session at any level we dont try to handle them at level 0 and 1 they come into action at level ii with the things given in the book of case remedies the woof and warp of any case is composed of certain mental makeup of combination of chronic or continuous nature in any pc there is chronic case messup then you have those things that keep the basic aberrations from unraveling these are the things that keep the case from being entered and that prevent the pc from being in session given that he does have an auditor any of these things can be chronic or immediate continuous or temporary an overt act will go into action only when restraint is put on it in the form of some sort of withhold the person becomes guilty etc since you have to have secrecy you have to have censure and with censure there is need for secrecy when being doesnt think an action is good he goes into being made guilty hence the overtmotivator sequence hence the connection between the feeling of guilt and on the one hand feeling that one has done wrong and on the other hand the feeling that one will be punished the overt is prior to the withhold you should classify overt withhold and missed withhold processes all under overts there are lots of things to know about overts and lots of processes for running them the present existence of problem is worse than its problematic nature the ptps floatingness in time is what is peculiar to it and what makes it get in the way of auditing it was looking at the ptp that got lrh into discovering gpms on politicalphilosophical level the problem appears as dialectical materialism which says that force vs force produces ideas dialectical materialism is making philosophy of and deifying the problem although dialectical materialism says that force vs force produces ideas it is actually the other way round since actually idea vs idea produces force the idea that force makes ideas is just an expression of the man from mud theory if neither postulate of problem overcomes the other force accumulates on them and the forces will counteroppose if they are in balancethey will hang up in time only those problems that are held in this delicate balance hang up and become ptps to get rid of problem one postulate or the other must give way if one side can overbalance the other the problem slips and doesnt remain ptp past problems may be solved by overbalancing without really being resolved these may still exist in the past but they are not floating up to pt ptps still have an exact balance on both sides the cold war of russia vs the us has slipped since the idea of coexistence crept into the ussr if as an auditor you realize that not every problem needs to be handled but only the ones that are so delicately balanced your job will seem easier since there have been lots of problems in thetans whole existence the balance is actually so delicate that any little nudge will change it and let it slip away you sometimes see pc struggling to hold onto ptp that has been way of life after the auditor has knocked it off its pins the pc has still got tremendous accumulated forces involved in its solution routine is something you use to change an aspect of the pcs case it always works unless there is ptp overt or arc break in the way an arc break is actually tickling of some major restimulation of something in r6 list 1 is adequate to key it out it is direct short circuit into the bank there are actually very few things in chronic restimulation in the bank the primary one is difficulties with communication that is the primary endword that gets into restimulation there is real reason why anyone should communicate with anyone about anything when you run recall time you communicated you are actually running 268 gpms all at once so wonder the pc feels better afterwards and when something goes wrong with your comm cycle that upsets the pc exactly what the pc does at that point is probably the rootword when you quiet it down by locating and indicating the bpc you just drop it back to its former status you havent done anything for the pcs case but you have made him auditable the big buttons in the bank are 1 communication 2 time 3 havingness these things like time problems and bits of items like havingness are the things that are in chronic restimulation but the aberrative value of havingness compared to communication and time is miniscule communication is way back on the series communication and time are in restimulation all the time or for one thing there wouldnt be any time that is one reason why waiting is so upsetting that means that you go after arc breaks with feather touch to key them out dont audit them or you will mess the pc up by keying in communication harder knowing that these three phenomena are what keep case from being audited keeps you from being confused by all the possible manifestations which do in fact boil down to these categories ptps ow and arc breaks the pc can be troublesome case trouble source because he has someone on the other side of him who doesnt want him to improve he will try to get better to prove the other person wrong which gives him ptp resulting in case gain overts carry lot of different reactions depending on things like the persons responsibility level they are source of change not fixedness in case the case shifts does well at times gets sporadic results etc the pc wont let himself get any better he has odd computations like the idea that if he gets strong he might commit overts you would get the same manifestation of rollercoaster gain in pts condition if there is someone in the persons environment who keeps knocking him down whenever he gets better the mechanism is withholdwhen person has tremendous number of overts that remain constant he is trying to solve problem with overts that is the usual reason for the overts the overt can be on the part of the person or of society over the course of an intensive or longer cycle you have to get sufficient gain to get the pc up high enough so that the gates dont get closed in your face by his committing more overts before you get to audit him again the reason the psychiatrist damages people is that his problem is that of preventing people from damaging other people your problem then would be social problem in dealing with the continuous pt overt case you would have to solve this problem before you could make progress with the case the change overt case goes up and down little unlike the ptp case the pc may refrain from committing overts for awhile so overts cause change on graphs constantly but not steadily with fluctuating graph you could also be facing pts situation the main problem relating to overts is whether the pc will be damaged by motivators running overts can backfire if you let the pc get off only wholetrack overts because they are safe or miniscule overts critical thoughts etc such pc is dodging continuous pt chain of overts the pc with continual outrud is arc breaky if you try to get him to put his attention elsewhere because when you take his attention away from the charge of the outrud it hits him hes got to have it remedied before he can be run on routine fortunately not all pcs need much remedying the book of case remedies is basically just batch of methods for putting in ruds you can be as nice as you want about pulling withholds but remember that it must be done and that fact may put you beyond niceness once in awhile eg you might have to say something like ok come back for some more auditing when you have decided to tell what you have done thats lfinghubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 12 november 1964 remimeo franchise sthil students scientology ii pc level 0iv definition processes the first thing to know about definition processes is that they are separate and distinct and stand by themselves and are not clay table processes because definitions are used in clay table work in clearing and in instruction it is easy to make the colossal mistake of not realizing they are themselves distinct type of process and that they can be run with reference whatever to clay table or examinations in the book of case remedies we find on page 25 remedy and remedy b these two remedies are and b because they handle primary source of worry to instructors and auditors because definitions are also in clay table clearing and are used in instruction one might overlook and b as processes auditing style each level has its own basic auditing style and its secondary style as will be found covered completely in publications after this date the auditing style of level ii is guiding style the secondary style is guiding secondary style or guiding s style assists an assist is different from auditing as such in that it lacks any model session assists are normally short periods of auditing but not always i have seen touch assist go on for months at the rate of 15 minutes day two or three days week and it may take hours to do touch assist on an accident victim what characterizes an assist is that it is done rapidly and informally and anywhere coffee shop auditing isnt really an assist as it is usually done over coffee too casually to be dignified by the name of auditing the pc is never informed at all of the existence of session the pc in an assist is however informed of the fact and the assist is begun by start of assist and end of assist so an assist like session has beginning and an end the auditors code is observed in giving an assist and the auditing comm cycle is used as an auditor one sets out in an assist to accomplish specific thing for the pc like relieve the snivels or make the ache in the leg better so an assist also has very finite purposesecondary styles every level has different primary style of auditing but sometimes in actual sessions or particularly in assists this style is altered slightly for special purposes the style altered for assists or for particular process in regular session is called secondary style it doesnt mean that the primary style of the level is merely loosely done it means that it is done precise but different way to accomplish assists or to assist the pc in regular session this variation is called the secondary style of that level remedies remedy is not necessarily an assist and is often done in regular session it is the remedy itself which determines what auditing style is used to administer it some remedies as well as being used in regular sessions can also be used as assists in short that process exists as remedy has bearing on whether it is used in an assist or model session guiding style the essence of guiding style is 1 locate whats awry with the pc 2 run repetitive process to handle whats found in 1 in essencesteer the pc into disclosing something that needs auditing and then audit it guiding secondary style guiding secondary style differs from proper guiding style and is done by 1 steering the pc toward revealing something or something revealed 2 handling it with itsa guiding secondary style differs from guiding style only in that guiding secondary style handles the matter by steer itsa guiding style proper handles the matter with steer repetitive process definitions processing definitions processes when used as remedies are normally processed by guiding secondary style both remedies of the book of case remedies and b are guiding secondary style in their normal application one would expect them to be used by class ii auditor one would expect the assist to last 10 or 15 minutes perhaps more but less than regular session would take one would expect that any case in pe class any student that was getting nowhere would be handled by the instructor with guiding secondary style using remedies and b as precision processesremedy patter one would not expect the person or student in trouble to be turned over to another student for handling its too fast sharp and easy to handle that trouble oneself if one is class ii or above and far more certain you can do it while youd be finding another student to do the auditing it would be uneconomical in terms of time not to just do it right thenno meter leaning up against desk the auditors patter would be something like what follows the pcs responses and itsa are omitted in this example i am going to give you short assist all right what word havent you understood in scientology okay its preclear explain what it means okay i see you are having trouble so what does pre mean fine now what does clear mean good im glad you realize you had it mixed up with patient and see that theyre different thank you end of assist in between the above total of auditing patter the student may have hemmed and hawed and argued and cognited but one just steered the pc straight along the subject selected and got it audited and cleaned up if the student gave glib text book definition after challenging the word preclear we wouldnt buy it but would give the student piece of paper or rubber band and say demonstrate that and then carry on as it developed and that would be remedy you see it is precision auditing and is process and does have an auditing style and it works like dream you see this is steer itsa as to its style and that it addressed the immediate subject what makes remedy is not that it handles scientology definitions but that it handles the immediate subject under discussion or study remedy b what makes remedy b remedy b is that it seeks out and handles former subject conceived to be similar to the immediate subject or condition in order to clear up misunderstandings in the immediate subject or condition remedy b run on some person or student would simply be bit more complex than remedy as it looks into the past person has continuous confusion with policy or auditors etc so one runs b like this the following is auditor patter only im going to give you an assist okay all right what subject were you mixed up with before scientology im sure there is one okay spiritualism fine what word in spiritualism didnt you understand you can think of it good ectoplasm fine what was the definition of that all right theres dictionary over there look it up im sorry it doesnt give the spiritualist definition but you say it says ecto means outside whats plasm well look it up all right i see ecto means outside and plasm means mould or covering note you dont always break up words into parts for definition in b remedies yes ive got that now what do you think spiritualists meant by it all right im glad you realize that sheets over people make ghosts ghosts fine glad you recalled being scared as child all right what did the spiritualist mean then okay glad you see thetans dont need to be cased in goo all right fine good you had ectoplasm mixed up with engrams and younow realize thetans dont have to have bank and can be naked fine end of assist note you dont always repeat after him what the pc said but sometimes it helps student departs still cogniting enters scientology now having left spiritualism on the back track doesnt keep on trying to make every hco bulletin studied solve ectoplasm the buried misunderstood word that kept him stuck in spiritualism definitions purpose the purpose of definitions processing is fast clearing of held down fives jammed thinking because of misunderstood or misapplied datums preventing someone getting on with auditing or scientology remedies and b are not always used as assists they are also used in regular sessions but when so used they are always used with guiding secondary style steer itsa as comment people who seek to liken scientology to something oh like christian science are stuck in christian science dont say oh it isnt like christian science just nod and mark them for fast assist or session the moment the chance offers if they seem very disinterested or aloof when asked to pe course theres weapons in that arsenal auditor use them as remedies and b stand as the first and second given in the book of case remedies so before large number of potential scientologists stands the confusion of definitions we are now working hard to make scientology definitions easy for them by compiling dictionary using words new to people only when useful but those that dont come along at all are so wound up in some past subject they cant hear or think when that earlier subject is restimulated and that earlier subject is held down only by some word or phrase they didnt grasp some poor pawn howling for the blood of scientologists isnt mad at scientology at all but at some earlier practice he got stuck in with misdefinition of its terms you see we inherit some of the effects of the whole dullness of man when we seek to open the prison door and say look sunshine in the fields walk out some who need remedy b say oh the last time somebody scratched the wall that way i got stupider why say hey im not scratching the wall im opening the gate why bother he cant hear you but he can hear remedy b as an assist thats the channel to his comprehension understanding when person cant understand something and yet goes on facing up to it he gets into problems situation with it there it is over there yet he cant make it out infrequently fortunately for us the being halts time right there anything he conceives to be similar presented to his view is the puzzle itself aaa and he goes stupid this happens rarely in the life of one being but it happens to many people thus there arent many such messes in one person in one lifetime that have to be cleaned up but there are few in many people the cycle of misdefinition is1 didnt grasp word then 2 didnt understand principle or theory then 3 became different from it commits and committed overts against it then 4 restrained himself or was restrained from committing those overts then 5 being on withhold inflow pulled in motivator not every word somebody didnt grasp was followed by principle or theory an overt was not committed every time this happened not every overt committed was restrained so motivator was pulled in but when it did happen it raised havoc with the mentality of the being when trying to think about what seem to be similar subjects you see you are looking at the basic incident its locks as in chain of incidents the charge that is apparently on the lock in present time is actually only in the basic incident the locks borrow the charge of the basic incident and are not themselves causing anything so you have basic misunderstood word which then charges up the whole subject as lock then subject charging up similar subjects as locks every nattery or nonprogressing student or pc is hung up in the above 1 2 3 4 5 cycle and every such student or pc has misdefined word at the bottom of that pile if the condition is new and temporary its scientology word thats awry if natter progress etc is continuous and doesnt cease when all is explained in scientology or when attempts to straighten up scientology words fail then its an earlier subject at fault hence remedies and b hence guiding secondary style hence the fact that definitions processes are processes and vital processes they are if one wants smooth organization smooth pe smooth record of wins on all pcs and if one wants to bring people into scientology who seem to want to stay out of course these remedies and b are earlyon processes to be audited by class ii or above on level 0 or i pc or student however some in scientology as of this date are studying slowly or progressing poorly because and b havent been applied one expects that very soon now that auditors have this data there will be nobody at upper levels with his definitions

students scien staff scientology iii and iv clay table label goofs you will find in all poor auditing situations where something has gone wrong that you can figure yourself half to death if you do not know that all auditing errors are gross huge large and in this meaning basic the gross auditing error most commonly found in auditing is just not following the directions for the process not mild departures but big ones this often goes undetected by case and auditing supervisors because the auditing report or the statement of some student is not complete or truthful about what was done if case and auditing supervisors dont know that sometimes reports or statements are most expressive in what they leave unsaid or even twisted to make somebody look good safeguard repute then the case or auditing supervisor can worry himself or herself silly trying to find out why some case isnt running clay table healing and clay table clearing like any other processes are subject to gross auditing errors gaes incomplete statements or reports or even falsified descriptions of what was or was not done unusual solutions is phrase describing actions taken by an auditor or case or auditing supervisor when he or she has not spotted the gross auditing error the unusual solution seldom resolves any case because the data on which it is based the observation or report is incomplete or inaccurate sometimes people wonder why certain order was given they never ask what data was given that described the situation for which the order was given example past pc reporting on an auditor the auditor was drunk order given as result auditors must not drink actual situation auditor was dizzy after session and wobbled when he stood up whisky bottle in the office had been made into lamp the pcs statement was false data therefore the order given by the d of p was an order which remedied nothing the d of p should have seen this as natter and located instead the pcs overt that would have improved case and spared an order sometimes such data can be very convincing in administration at long distances or in life one cant always get the right data and so issues an order hopefully but in auditing the factors are fewer and under better control and so incomplete or false data is easy to detect the goof in clay table work of all kinds the pc must label everything he or she makes the word everything runs up against one of mans favourite aberrations man crunches things up condenses goes all out for togetherness or sameness his epitaph should be its all the same identifying things with things causes man to call number of things one thing he also is fond of calling one thing number of things when he worsens on this pointill show you how this works auditors report the pc labelled everything actual fact the pc made representation in clay composed of 15 separate pieces made one label giving all fifteen one name auditors complaint the pc isnt progressingno cognitions in this case the auditor conceived the clay layout to be the one thing the pc said it was and had the pc label it the pc did one label now the auditing direction in clay table work is to label every thing the gae was failing to get everything labelled instead of figuring out some new process or angle to the case all that would have been necessary was to get complete accurate description of the session exactly what did the pc do and it would have transpired that the pc made picture was it labelled yes what was it labelled the pc labelled it catastrophe which is the word we were working on of course at that point smart d of p case or auditing supervisor would have figured it out how many things were there in the picture oh about twenty and the correct auditing direction would have been go back and have the pc make the picture again if youve reused the clay and this time have the pc label everything thing piece itemmade got it one label for each different bit of clay in the picture that done the pcs case falls apart as the pc sees this or that should or shouldnt be in the picture or why it is so the biggest goof in all processes is not doing the process and in ct work the surest way in the world not to do the process is to let the pc make something and not get the pc to label it and thing of many parts must have label on each part l ron hubbard lrh jwrd copyright 1964 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6411c17 shspec47 styles of auditing reference hcob 6nov64 styles of auditing getting the different auditing styles clarified and formalized will make learning to audit easier over the years many auditing styles have developed to deliver different processes repetitive commands came in in 195556 along with trs muzzled auditing followed to handle auditors who messed up pcs with interruptions comments etc more recently with lrhs work on the comm cycle and the discovery that auditors werent really listening listen style was developed for prepchecking and sec checking where you steer the pc around another style was developed guiding style now that we have all the processes all the styles are there in order of developing an auditors skill as he goes up the levels the higher you go the more precise your auditing is but also the higher you go the more sloppy your auditing may look at the level of r6 the pc is going through so much and changing so fast that the auditor has to be able to shift and change rapidly in order to keep up with the pc and his mind and in order to do just what is necessary to keep the pc running down the bank pc has to be up aways to be able to have allstyle auditing for the pc to be up to standing allstyle auditing would require high level of confidence in auditors and acquaintance with different styles of auditing so the unpredictability of allstyle auditing would throw the pc off if this was the first style he had encountered auditing the pc at lower levels would give him more certainty if you ran r6 on raw meat you might get away with it but the first mess you got into would be the end of the pc hes got confidence in auditing and reliance on scientologys ability to handle ptps to fix him or rescue him etc there is case factor also preventing new pc from being audited on r6 the worse off someone is the more important he is and the more exaggerated his ideas of his ability are hes got hidden standards outconfront etc etc there isnt much you could do if you put the pc on r6 and he spun so dont do it you are making yourself the effect of his bank most people start their auditing in total desperation in fear of going out the bottom getting up to the point where they know that they wont get any worse release is major improvement it doesnt necessarily take long time to do this you might tend to overrun the pc unless you observe well and note the acceleration of gain that occurs dont cut off pc cogs furthermore you are handling level of case that is voluntarily trying to improve which means that there is some spark of responsibility for selfimprovement and some idea that the person can do something about it people can go so far downscale that they think nothing can be done about anything then you get socialist or communist state to take care of them one reason why governments call scientology fake is that they have the opinion that nothing can be done and scientology is claiming that it can do something through pcs course of auditing we must keep the pc winning so that self at cause keeps coming up it is easier to make someone better than to make him worse he resists getting worse but doesnt resist getting better when he realizes that he can and must do something to get better and that he will not get worse be will be release the auditing styles can be plotted against the most likely win for the pc at given stage of his auditing how you audit pc is at least as important as what you audit just the mechanics of auditing are therapeutic regardless of the process they are applied to first the pc discovers that he can talk to someone then he discovers that he can answer question when he is asked one there is some 8c in this that is beneficial as well as duplication which he has fallen away from he cant be anything because he cant duplicate anything unless you have gotten someone out of this kind of condition he cant confront existence thetan can only be what he can see he can only see what he can duplicate it is hard to get duplication of an accident or crime because person cant be it therefore he cant see it this leads to slight occupational liability as an auditor you are looking at pc all the time that you dont particularly want to be youre trying to improve him arent you fortunatelyit isnt necessary for you to be willing to be aberrated to get well because we have the whole anatomy of the reactive bank and there is sense in it if the pc hadnt made the reactive mind and the gpms he would be virtually unaberratable there would be dwindling spiral because the thetan would have to determine to have something wrong with him thetan had to decide to be aberrated he did it but almost accidentally having done it he was too stupid to get out of his trap there are different degrees of aberration based on the locks and the tendency of the reactive mind to group bunch up and get into restimulation there are some basic things that can go wrong with thetan which are above the level of the bank and gpms these include duplication and communication duplication and communication can be aberrated regardless of endwords there are endwords there too but these are highlevel ideas common to all thetans with or without banks pc should be able to communicate and duplicate pretty well they do improve up to the point where he can confront his bank at level 0 the pc knows that he has communicated because the auditor received the communication at level i the pc knows he has received communication because he has answered it and the auditor is satisfied with the fact that he has answered the communication if the auditor lets the pc receive communication or question that he doesnt answer the pc is unsatisfied because knowing that he didnt answer the question he starts doubting his ability to receive communication at this level he finds that not only can he answer question but also he can answer it repetitively this is big change for many people when pc can answer question repetitively that is even better than just being able to answer question that is why we say i will repeat the auditing command see abridged style below guiding style at this level we are handling the pcs finding out that there is something there to the pc the whole world is reasonless he is starting out at lower harmonic of the truth namely that there is nothing there and that he has reason to be upset about anything he says i feel nervous today and sees cause for it the biggest cog here is that there are causes for things for one thing he will realize that he is not just natively stupid or that life doesnt have to be mess something could be causing the condition he is in the pc needs to get the idea that conditions dont just happen but are caused by things and that be is longer just pawn if things cause things you might be able to predict if things cause things you might be able to do something about something if things cause things you might be able to do something about yourself guiding secondary style this comes out of guiding style auditing steer plus itsa is the process that goes with it you find it and bleed it remedy and b level ii locates causes without knowing the cause person is dispersed all over the universe finding the cause and then doing something about it is terrific abridged style when he has learned all that it is safe to run him on an abridged style we can look and see what is going on the reason why at levels i and ii you always say ill repeat the auditing question when the pc hasnt answered it is that you are teaching the pc that he can receive and answer an auditing question at level iii this is not necessary anymore and it may be irritating to the pc he already knows that he can get the command so you have abridged style in which the auditor and the pc can look and see what is going on this is an abridgement of lower not upper styles the pc says he has ptp you dont guide him into it you just ask what is it it usually blows so you then drop it the pc can asis things more easily now you audit purely against finite result to the point of getting to happen what you want to have happen and further the pc learns that when he gets audited something happens direct style now weve got direct style auditing getting the exact result applies even more here you go direct to the resulthubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 10 december 1964 remimeo franchise sthil students sthil coaudit scientology 0 listen style auditing there are two ways to run listen style auditing1 as number of teams directly under an auditing supervisor and 2 as an individual auditor correct training procedure at level 0 is to have the auditor do coaudit style until confident and then train him to do the same thing individually listen style coaudit the coaudit version is merely to get the student to do auditing without having to assume too much responsibility in this version it is really the instructor who is doing the auditing he starts the session and tells the auditor to give the commands and acknowledge the answers if this relationship is understood it makes the supervision of level 0 group of teams much easier the procedure for running listen style coaudit is as follows 1 instructor gets the auditors to seat their pcs in their chairs and then sit down 2 he writes up on board the exact wording of the process to be used 3 he asks students if the room is alright for them to be audited in 4 he tells them what is going to be run in the session r factor and cleans up any questions on the part of pcs obviously stress is on getting them able to talk to anyone 5 he tells auditors and pcs that all the auditor is permitted to do is to give the command and acknowledge the answers if pc says anything that cannot be handled with an acknowledgement the auditor will put out his hand behind him and wait for an instructor 6 he tells the auditors to keep their auditors reports 7 instructor then says start of session and tells the auditors to give the command goals or rudiments are set or done notes students should be taught that before they give an acknowledgement they should understand pcs answer they are permitted therefore to ask pc to amplify an answer or to explain word so that they the auditors understand the answer if student puts out his hand the instructor goes to session and without ending it handles what needs handling and then lets session go on the instructor is careful not to become the pcs auditor completely as transference will set in and pcs will invent trouble to get more attention instructor should have meter handy so that in the case of an arc break he canquickly do an assessment in doing the arc break assessment he is of course careful not to audit the pc only to locate and indicate the bypassed charge at end of period instructor says commence ending your sessions he waits bit and then says tell your auditor any gains youve made in the session auditors write them down waits again and then says alright im going to end the session now end of session instructor then gives whatever instruction is necessary either to end the period or to get the room ready for the next period or gives break etc listen style individual this is done exactly the same as the coaudit version but in this case of course the auditor handles the session it goes like this 1 the auditor seats the pc in his or her chair and then sits down across from the pc knees few inches from the pcs table is used or just two chairs the auditors report being kept on clip board there is of course meter 2 the auditor takes the exact auditing command to be used from his text book bulletin or notes 3 he asks the pc if it is all right to audit the pc in the room and if not makes things right by adjusting the room or location of auditing 4 he tells the pc the purpose of such sessions reality factor i want to get you used to talking to another i want to improve your reach etc its the auditors goal at this level not the pcs pcs dont get chance to have goals in listen style as they would set goals they cant attain at this level and wouldnt have enough reality on auditing anyway to be sensible about it so only an r factor is usedno goals the auditor also tells the pc exactly how long the session will be 5 the auditor tells the pc that all he is going to do is to listen and try to understand the pc and that all he wants the pc to do is talk on the selected subject the auditor will give him and that if he veers off the auditor will call it to his attention 6 the auditor then quickly starts his auditors report 7 the auditor says start of session 8 the auditor gives the command from his text bulletin or notes the command must have something to do with telling people things or communicating and may also specify subject to talk about 9 further commands are given only when the pc loses track of the subject and wants to know what it was see routines for level 0 for exact handling of commands 10 when the pc says something and obviously expects response the auditor signifies he has heard using any normal means 11 when the pc says something the auditor doesnt grasp the auditor asks the pc to repeat it or amplify it so that the auditor does hear it in the fullest sense of the word see the prompters below only 4 are allowed 12 when the pc stops talking the auditor must adjudicate whether the pc is simply longer interested in the subject or has become unwilling to talk about some bit of it if the auditor believes the pc has stopped because of embarrassment or some similar reason the auditor has the prompters the only things he is allowed to useprompter have you found something you think would make think less of you prompter b is there something you thought of that you think i wouldnt understand prompter c have you said something you felt i didnt understand if so tell again prompter d have you found something you havent understood if so tell about it the student must know these prompters by heart he uses as many as needed in the sequence given to start the pc talking again the auditor must not start new subject or process just because the pc cant bring himself to go on talking the whole essence of level 0 is to get the pc up to being willing to talk about anything to anyone thus any coaxing is also allowed threats are forbidden b c or d usually handle these are the commonest reasons people cease talking mere forgetting is handled just by reminding the pc of the subject 13 new processes or new subjects in routine which are in essence new processes are started only when the pc has brightened up and become quite able by reason of getting comfortable about the last one realizing that the whole target of level 0 is to get people willing to talk about anything to others regained ability on subject governs when to start new process if the auditor can answer to himself this question in the affirmative then he can go to new process is this pc able to talk freely to or about subject of last process if so its all right to select new question from the same routine or new routine more rarely and ask it now but it is never all right to prevent pc from talking by butting in with new question one never asks amplifying questions at level 0 commentary type questions are also out the auditor listens to the questions answers and only interrupts when he truly hasnt heard or didnt grasp some point over and over repetitive use of commands is made of course as thats level one the commands are given rarely same commands but only to get the pc going again staccato repetitive commands and brief pc answers are not for level 0 14 toward the end of the auditing period the auditor warns the session time is about over well have to be ending shortly 15 when the pc has given an extra comment or two the auditor says were closing the session now time is up have you made any gains in this session 16 the pcs answers are quickly noted 17 the auditor says end of session note pcs of course often keep on talking and make it hard to end session end it anyway if this seems to shock the pc point out the time the session ended as originally set and say also youll be getting more auditing and well take that up in the next session youll always have trouble ending session if you fail to put in its time in the r factor reality factor in 4 above as the auditor notes the time in his report see 4 above he must say this session will go until________hours and minutes precisely thus he has an out for ending it an auditor must never run beyond that time set and must of course audit until it is reached this by the way does not just hold good for level 0 it is very good practice for all levels in regular sessions the only exception is the assist where one is auditing toward definite gain in general auditing one seeks to obtain general gains not sudden momentary spurts the auditor whether in coaudit or individual session at this and the next level will soon become impressed with this fact the more he himself says during the session the less gain the pc gets therefore aside from the above the auditor does very little in the session and is paid handsomely for it in pc gains l ron hubbard lrh jwcden copyright 1964 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 11 december 1964 remimeo franchise sthil students sthil co audit scientology 0 processes the whole case gain to be expected from pc at level 0 is an increase of ability to talk to others at level 0 we do not expect or lead people to expect any sudden miracle of physical or mental recovery rather we emphasize that we are getting their feet on the ladder and as they progress up through levels they will achieve all they ever hoped for and more jumping to higher levels leaves the lower level disabilities untouched and while trying to audit somebody at say level iii we will find ourselves struggling with things that should have been handled at level 0 further this target is the one that beginning pcs make the most gains on in my experience i recall one near miracle on girl who couldnt bring herself to talk to her parents and all i did was get her to tell what shed say to them if she could talk to them recalling is too steep for starting pc they cant recall well really until about level iv when they can be cleaned up on their arc breaks with life here we have the whole design of level 0 recover the pcs ability to talk to others freely if you realize that pc cant be in session unless he is willing to talk to his auditor you will also realize that he cant be in life until he is able to communicate freely with others thus any process that does not forward this end is not for level 0 matter how frantic the case may be to become clear yesterday the more hysterical pc is about getting advanced processes or case gain the less strenuous the process administered must be the psychiatrist erred on this one point and it wiped him out as social benefactor the more desperate the case the more desperate were his measures he was just echoing his patients it is very important for an auditor to realize this one datum for it is the second guiding rule of level 0 it is very senior datum one must not become desperate and use desperate measures just because the pc is desperate or the family or society is desperate about the pc the worse off the pc the lighter the approach to that pc must be psychotics real gibbering ones are below auditing treatment in sessions the measure used for them should be just rest and isolation from their former environments and the first process used should be just getting the person to realize you are safe and safe to talk toso although few cases are psychotic this still holds good the auditor must get the pc to realize he is safewont punish scold reprimand or betray confidencesand that the auditor will listen it doesnt give the auditor withhold to not speak of anothers withholds one can only withhold what one oneself has done what the pc did or said isnt even subject for session on the auditor for withholding it had aberrative value even when were class iv we still start all our pcs at the pcs level which is for beginning pc level 0 so what we are trying to do with our pcs at level 0 is the following 1 recover the pcs ability to talk to others freely 2 teach the pc by example the auditor is safe to talk to and wont scold reprimand punish or betray and 3 refuse to engage in desperate measures just because the pc is desperate and therefore get real lasting gain for the pc routines routine is standard process designed for the best steady gain of the pc at that level the remedy is different it is an auditing process which is designed to handle nonroutine situation the only real remedy at level 0 is patching up having failed to hear or understand the pc the rest is all done by routine the case remedies are at level ii and while we all realize that every level 0 case needs lot of level ii remedies we also know that remedy will work well until the pc is able to talk to others when you run into trouble at level 0 there are only 3 reasons possible 1 the pc was not run in direction or on process to improve his or her ability to communicate to others 2 the auditor failed to understand the pcs statements either words or meanings or 3 the auditor engaged in desperate measures changed processes or scolded or did something to lower the pcs feeling of security in the session thats all as you go on up through the levels you will find many other ways pc can get upset but at level 0 the pc is not close enough to reality on his own case to even be touched by these at first the pc is long way off when he first starts getting audited he can only approach his own case by degrees so pc matter how wildly he or she dramatizes at level 0 is really only capable of reality of the smallest kind about self and such pc must be able to talk before anything else can happen pcs can be ruined by someone who doesnt grasp that simple fact psychiatrists failing to grasp it murdered several million peopleso its light matter its an important one pc at level 0 usually cant even conceive of an overt harmful act done by himself when they can they go religiously guilty and seek to atone or some such thing become monk or commit suicide the reason 33 13 percent of all psychoanalytic patients are said to have committed suicide in their first three months of treatment is not that they came too late but that lot of wild data was thrown at them to get at their source of guilt and they went head on into the reactive bank sought to demonstrate their guilt by making others guilty and killing themselvesyou dont want anything out of the pc but an increased ability to talk relaxedly to others without fear embarrassment suspicion or guilt so all processes at level 0 are arranged accordingly wordings to give all possible wordings of routines that will accomplish the above is completely beyond need once you have the idea of it straight you can invent them by the dozens one doesnt even have to think of particular pc all level 0 processes are good only when they apply to all pcs routine 00 zerozero the starting routine is the most basic of all auditing routines it is simply what are you willing to talk to about pc answers what would you like to tell about that at level ii the first question alone becomes remedy here the two questions make routineand very effective one it is routine 0a this is how the auditor puts together routine 0a 1 make list of people or things one cant generally talk to easily that includes parents policemen govemments and god but its far longer list the auditor must do this it must never be published as canned list 2 using any one of the listed items if you could talk to____listed item what would you say all right thats all there is to finding the commands for routine 0a one doesnt get the pc to do the list the list isnt done in session the auditor does it himself on his own time and each auditor must do his own list for his pcs and add to it from time to time as he thinks of new ones the pc isnt necessarily given any choice of items the auditor picks one he thinks may fit thats easy to do after one session the pc keeps complaining about parents ok run 0a on parents and flatten it by flatten is meant to use that one subject until the pc is darned sure he or she could now talk to the item chosen if the pc still wants to abuse the item it isnt flat if the pc still wants to do something about the item it is not flat when the pc is cheerful about the item or longer fascinated with it its flat remember theres need to find out what the pc cant talk to in fact most cases youre better off just to take an item of your own for 0a and use it may seem strange but youll have smoother time of it with the pc further youll not restimulate churn up the pcs bank so hard routine 0bthe second routine consists of things to talk about one puts the routine together this way 1 the auditor makes list not from the pc but himself of everything he can think of that is banned for any reason from conversation or is not generally considered acceptable for social communication this includes nonsocial subjects like sexual experiences wc details embarrassing experiences thefts one has done etc things nobody would calmly discuss in mixed company 2 an item from the list is included in the auditing command what would you be willing to tell about add the item you choose 3 when they have run down as in clocks ask them who else could you say those things to 4 rechoose subject on the list 5 repeat 3 6 continue to repeat 4 and 5 above all dont be critical of the pc and very calmly hear and seek to understand what the pc said you never by the way seek to find out why the pc reacted or responded in some way real blunder at level 0 is why did you feel that way or why do you think you cant say that youre not after the causes of things at level 0 you will find out why at level vi at level 0 just keep them talking while you listen and you use only the subject chosen to keep them talking routine 0c routine 0c is of course old r1c renamed it is done without meter and it has any subject under the sun included in its command it is elsewhere covered in all the above routines it is vital not to alter the commands given above there are many more possible routines but to be level zero routine it must have as its goal only freeing up the ability of the pc to talk freely to others this is not level to be regarded with brushoff it takes lot of skill to restore pcs ability to communicate freely when an auditor has that skill he will succeed at all higher levels when pc has that skill regained his world will look to him to be far far better place so it is very important to get over this first hurdle and very important not to dodge it and try to climb the hill anyway it will become an awfully steep hill l ron hubbard lrh jwcden copyright 1964 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6412c15 shspec49 communication gradient on duplication level 0 and level i are laid out and the materials exist for levels ii iii iv and vi see hcopl 11dec64 full table of courses and classifications the pe course is back down below level 0 and the has course is in the academy with strict curriculum it includes axioms and other bits and pieces hqs is what old hcahpa was when you go all the way to the top it is then very easy to see what lies between you and the bottom that is what has happened mow we can see what an auditor has to go through and achieve to get all the way up unnecessary parts of training have been eliminated without leaving gaps that people could fall into you can tend to discount how much auditing you have had when you get up near the top that would be one reason why you would think you could take new pc and run him at once on r6 thinking that he is where you are as case when he isnt person who is perfect and has problems 1 is very delicate 2 commits overts the case who never finds anything to audit because he is perfect must be audited very delicately person may get full complement of motivators from something yet still assert that is was right if such person were to admit to or confront single little fault ie give up service fac it would be to him the final degradation he is very overty but he is at point where if he admitted that he had ever done anything wrong he would slip over the edge of degradation that he has been clinging to and start asserting his rightness by being even wronger like kid breaking windows who keeps on doing it trying to assert the rightness of what he is doing manifest insanity is confirmation of an error you have to increase the cases responsibility by series of steps the only trouble you have had with pcs has come from not going up through the steps necessary to keep the pc winning getting gains that are real to the pc the book of case remedies is the totality of level ii overts and ptps but the pc has to be gotten up to the point where he can be run on the processes in the book of case remedies there are certain things senior to the bank on which thetan would be able to be aberrated whether he had bank or not though without bank the thetan could get unaberrated again without auditing the design of the bank is what gives the thetan the dwindling spiral but if thetan werent aberrated and had designed reactive mind he could determine to spin in on spiral now that he has that skill because he has done it but he couldnt have realized how much trouble he would get into he is capable of miscalculating which is fascinating ability to have the thetan is natively capable of getting into more trouble than he can see thetan is capable of having these things happen or making things happen to himself he is capable of setting up masses to suspend in time the masses gpms create time but it is difficult for thetan to aberrate himself to such degree that he cant recover the only way he could recover is to block out duplication cf the axioms that which you dont asis will endure forever if thetan is unwilling to duplicate something it will endure the only way thetan can erase something is to be willing to duplicate it eg if you are unwilling to be like person you will get madder and madder at the person to the point where he will disappear not by being asised but because you cant see him anymore he is still there thus you have universe thetan is nothing and he is unwilling to be something so you get masses and they endure because the thetan wont asis them so he makes bank which tells him what he should and shouldnt be willing to duplicate this bank had two halves1 the cowboys in the white hats which he was willing to duplicate so they disappeared 2 the cowboys in the black hats which he wasnt willing to duplicate so they became more real and solid this leads to the dwindling spiral communication can be lower gradient on duplication that leads to more willingness to duplicate as well as the other way around the rough part of the bank is duplication you could take some other part of the comm formula drill it and start to knock out the duplication hangup with communication you might get over the obsession not to duplicate without getting an obsession to duplicate you knock out the ferocity of dont ever be that as when you say to yourself i must never never never be bum on skid row and then you must obsessively duplicate the bum by becoming one you get out of compulsive and inhibited actions by communication if person cant stand the thought of an auto accident he wont be able to duplicate car communicate with it or control it and he will crash the remedy would be to have him touch car this shows why touch assists and processes of communication with aberrated body parts or whatever are so effective you become what you resist in other words that which you are unwilling to duplicate will persist and eventually overwhelm this is not to say that you have to obsessively duplicate either mere experiencing of something is nontherapeutic communication with something is therapeutic if you are afraid of being an alcoholic dont try it out communicate with alcoholics or with something relating to this subject then the refusal to duplicate clicks out give the alcoholic bottle or glass to communicate with but dont let him experience it run reach and withdraw on it or on photos of skidrow bums wilson newlyappeared political figure has 48 hour comm lag between his saying i will never and his doing it he is nearly nuts and never notices that he is doing this if hes agin it he is going to be doing it to be it why was i so angry about it yesterday im it the bank says that 50 of existence must be shunned and the other 50 is love it gotta be it cherish it so of course the universe will eventually become the 50 you mustnt have anything to do with you do not have to experience something in order to duplicate it the things that bug you are the things you mustnt be or have anything to do with and if you cant comm with something you cant hold it off how do you keep one boat from smashing another if you mustnt have anything to do with boat hook there are gradients in the field of duplication making drawings is duplication and telling about them is communication so that would help out kid who was having trouble you could get him up to drawing what he didnt like about school drawing school in 3d etc cf play therapy in which the kid is encouraged to demonstrate with toys the various aberrative parts of his life just dont make it too steep gradient having to experience is an outgradient you collapse terminals with the thing that you are experiencing how can you hold anything off if you cant communicate with it also if you cant duplicate something you cant handle it putting it all on communication activity would be less likely to go too steep 8c is steep process because it asks the pc to communicate with mest which is the one thing he doesnt want to duplicate also this process is run duplicatively therefore communication like with the cowboys in the black hats is the key that unlocks duplication it is what you monitor case by and what you try to solve first not only with regard to levels but also at the beginning of every session you could use gradient of duplication instead of gradient of communication though it is hard to assess the gradient properly using duplication and the pc will hit too steep gradient and blow if you approach the whole thing on communication gradient you will give the pc very gentle gradient communication as word happens to be part of the reactive bank an endword but this doesnt matter however just because you have gotten the pc past level 0 it doesnt mean that you have got rid of his reactive mind or his peculiarities as thetan you will never get rid of the latter cleared thetan without bank will still have slump spots centered around communicationduplication making things unmaking things persistence any value that time might be and value there is to experience etc he will make and unmake pictures of things he will have an aberratable pattern that isnt planned then he could just look at this small aberration and it would asis he asises things very easily because he doesnt have it all hanging on earlier similars in bank there are certain factors in person regardless of his experiential track for instance the fact that communication knocks out refusals to duplicate this comes up in lot of cognitions nonduplication decision goes along with noncommunication actions 8c is hard because youre asking him to communicate with mest and that is the one thing he will not be it makes quite process 8c also handles unwillingness to duplicate clever auditor always reestablishes the pcs communication where it ought to be before going on to do anything else so if pc is not in comm you must find out why we know the key points withholds ptps and overts they all have outofcomm to them an overt is regretted communication ptp is started but not completed and thereafter refused communication withhold is an unwillingness to communicate if you partially communicate with an unwillingness to communicate youve got missed withhold this is particular kind of problem broader look at this area is given by the fact that the pc has ptp because he is unwilling to duplicate something or someone youve got to be careful not to throw the pc into the bank with gradient if the pc gets misemotional you are on an outgradient because the person is experiencing something rather than communicating push person into situation where there is noduplication decision and communication with that and powie he interiorizes into that very point this can also throw the pc into gpms and endwords of duplication and communication and their negatives communication is the solvent that handles nonduplication as you audit the pc normally youve got destimulative factor you are putting the pc more thoroughly in comm with his bank without throwing him into it ie without experiencing it if you skip the communication you will get the obsessive duplication the experiencing the dramatization you could develop process that would do this to the pc one such process would be what wouldnt you mind going out of arc with more direct one would be what dont you like duplicate it though the latter would be therapeutic on some pcs or by making guy wrong you can prove to him that he is duplicating something that he has said he would never duplicate this is the psychiatric approach you hate your father so you are being him arent you the reason why you cant just process pc all the way north with communication is that you have to pay attention to the complexity of the bank eg service facsimiles the bank is complex enough so that the pc will have to confront and undo it you have to pay attention to the pcs physical peculiarities the pc is going to run into some corner of the bank and you have to pay attention to it you must find areas that the pc can asis and walk him into them but you are not just auditing the pc vs the bank there is the environment full of other peoples banks etc so you have to make fast gain you have to have enough of gradient so that the pc knows that he has made gain and enough gain so that he wont get squashed before the next session you can get rid of bad habits in the pc not by direct attack on them but by general comm process washing out all unwillingness to duplicate if thetan could duplicate he wouldnt need habit to handle it cf earlier data on circuit as substitute for confront see p 47 above person getting extricated from his own bank is also mixed up with other banks also he is still eating dont advise people to experience life if you find some guy that is awfully slow to bring up the line why dont bring him up yourself he has had plenty of time to do himself in and some people have simply done better job

hco bulletin of 11 december 1964 processes and to hco bulletin of 10 december 1964 listen style auditing routine 0a expanded an additional command increases the usefulness of this routine it is therefore rewritten as follows the auditor makes list of things people generally cant talk to easily that includes parents policemen governments and god but its far longer list the auditor must compile this list himself or herself out of session it may be added to by the auditor from time to time it must never be published as canned list scientology instructors and scientology personnel should not be listed on it as it leads to upset in sessions step 1 the auditor chooses one of the subjects off the list and uses it in steps 2 and 3 below until the pc is comfortable about it subjects from the list can be chosen in sequence or at random chosen subject is not left until the pc is comfortable about it by this is meant the pc would not feel disturbed talking to the subject chosen the auditor does not ask the pc which subject or if it is all right to choose that subject as the pc at the moment of selection is not likely to feel comfortable about any of the listed subjects and so will just reject the auditor just chooses one and starts on it step 2 the auditor asks if you could talk to ______chosen subject what would you talk about pc answers one or more things at greater or shorter length step 3 when the pc seems satisfied the question has been answered the auditor then says all right if you were talking to ______chosen subject in 1 about that what would you say exactly the pc is expected to speak as though talking to the subject chosen in l step 4 the auditor notes whether pc is comfortable about the subject chosen in step 1 yet without asking pc this is done by noting the voice tone or text of what the pc would say if it is shy diffident or if it is belligerent or annoyed the same subject is retained for new go with steps 2 and 3 if the pc seems bright and cheerful new subject is chosen from the list for working over with steps 2 and 3 if the subject in 1 is retained the auditor again does steps 2 and 3 above over and over until the pc is cheerful subject chosen in 1 is not left until the pc really can respond cheerfully when this is accomplished new subject is chosen as step 1 and the process is continued with steps 2 and 3 using the new subject the whole of routine 0a is flat when the pc feels far more comfortable about talking to specific items and isnt shying off from items on the list it is flat therefore when an ability is regained on specific items on the list and the list items arent producing big new changes in the pcs communication abilitylisten style coaudit it is expected that by the time an auditor is permitted to do the zero routines individual listen style will have been entered upon until the class seems able to run individual sessions old r1c can be used by the auditing supervisor on group basis using listen style coaudit until the group has the idea of sessions routines work best on individual listen style the pc is always wondering in listen style coaudit if the auditing supervisor is listening to him personally the auditor is not the receipt point of the pcs comm in many instances old r1c is the best training mechanism to get auditors to run sessions in this process the auditing supervisor just chooses something for all the pcs to talk to the auditors about like dynamic or common social problem l ron hubbard lrhjwrd copyright 1964 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedmy philosophy by l ron hubbard the subject of philosophy is very ancient the word means the love study or pursuit of wisdom or of knowledge of things and their causes whether theoretical or practical all we know of science or of religion comes from philosophy it lies behind and above all other knowledge we have or use for long regarded as subject reserved for halls of learning and the intellectual the subject to remarkable degree has been denied the man in the street surrounded by protective coatings of impenetrable scholarliness philosophy has been reserved to the privileged few the first principle of my own philosophy is that wisdom is meant for anyone who wishes to reach for it it is the servant of commoner and king alike and should never be regarded with awe selfish scholars seldom forgive anyone who seeks to break down the walls of mystery and let the people in will durant the modern american philosopher was relegated to the scrap heap by his fellow scholars when he wrote popular book on the subject the outline of philosophy thus brickbats come the way of any who seek to bring wisdom to the people over the objections of the inner circle the second principle of my own philosophy is that it must be capable of being applied learning locked in mildewed books is of little use to anyone and therefore of value unless it can be used the third principle is that any philosophic knowledge is only valuable if it is true or if it works these three principles are so strange to the field of philosophy that i have given my philosophy name scientology this means only knowing how to know philosophy can only be route to knowledge it cannot be crammed down ones throat if one has route he can then find what is true for him and that is scientology know thyself and the truth shall set you free therefore in scientology we are not concerned with individual actions and differences we are only concerned with how to show man how he can set himself free this of course is not very popular with those who depend upon the slavery of others for their living or power but it happens to be the only way i have found that really improves an individuals life suppression and oppression are the basic causes of depression if you relieve those person can lift his head become well become happy with life and though it may be unpopular with the slave master it is very popular with the peoplecommon man likes to be happy and well he likes to be able to understand things and he knows his route to freedom lies through knowledge therefore for 15 years i have had mankind knocking on my door it has not mattered where i have lived or how remote since i first published book on the subject my life has longer been my own i like to help others and count it as my greatest pleasure in life to see person free himself of the shadows which darken his days these shadows look so thick to him and weigh him down so that when he finds they are shadows and that he can see through them walk through them and be again in the sun he is enormously delighted and i am afraid i am just as delighted as he is i have seen much human misery as very young man i wandered through asia and saw the agony and misery of overpopulated and underdeveloped lands i have seen people uncaring and stepping over dying men in the streets i have seen children less than rags and bones and amongst this poverty and degradation i found holy places where wisdom was great but where it was carefully hidden and given out only as superstition later in western universities i saw man obsessed with materiality and with all his cunning i saw him hide what little wisdom he really had in forbidding halls and make it inaccessible to the common and less favored man i have been through terrible war and saw its terror and pain uneased by single word of decency or humanity i have lived cloistered life and hold in contempt the wise man who has not lived and the scholar who will not share there have been many wiser men than i but few have travelled as much road i have seen life from the top down and the bottom up i know how it looks both ways and i know there is wisdom and that there is hope blinded with injured optic nerves and lame with physical injuries to hip and back at the end of world war ii i faced an almost nonexistent future my service record stated this officer has neurotic or psychotic tendencies of any kind whatsoever but it also stated permanently disabled physically and so there came further blow i was abandoned by family and friends as supposedly hopeless cripple and probable burden upon them for the rest of my days i yet worked my way back to fitness and strength in less than two years using only what i knew and could determine about man and his relationship to the universe i had one to help what i had to know i had to find out and its quite trick studying when you cannot see i became used to being told it was all impossible that there was way hope yet i came to see again and walk again and i built an entirely new life it is happy life busy one and i hope useful one my only moments of sadness are those which come when bigoted men tell others all is bad and there is route anywhere hope anywhere nothing but sadness and sameness and desolation and that every effort to help others is false i know it is not true so my own philosophy is that one should share what wisdom he has one should help others to help themselves and one should keep going despite heavy weather for there is always calm ahead one should also ignore catcalls from the selfish intellectual who cries dont expose the mystery keep it all for ourselves the people cannot understand but as i have never seen wisdom do any good kept to oneself and as i like to see others happy and as i find the vast majority of the people can and do understand i will keep on writing and working and teaching so long as i existfor i know man who has any monopoly upon the wisdom of this universe it belongs to those who can use it to help themselves and others if things were little better known and understood we would all lead happier and there is way to know them and there is way to freedom the old must give way to the new falsehood must become exposed by truth and truth though fought always in the end prevails 6503c02 shspec53 technology and hidden standards economics and organizations are matter of the mest universe let give you tip if someone around you or your organization is having trouble with organizational matters you just processed them subjectively too long it doesnt matter how long you process them subjectively now they are not going to go anyplace the trouble with them is objective you want to give the objectivetype processes not subjective organizational tech is being formed up into courses for the business world it has taken two to three years to plow this line now that we have product to put on the line it will go like crash dissemination techniques have been worked up out of the materials of scientology which have only to be written up and issued lrh has found all the points where organizations dont expand and found what makes them not expand what contracts them etc you end up with formulas that you can give to the janitor to apply to his job and he will look them over and see that they make sense his willingness to work was jammed by his ignorance of the law that governed that work under its various conditions all you have to do is to know and use the formulas if you apply them backwards you shrink and collapse it is longer question of our arriving before everything blows up we have made all our deadlines the questionable period is behind us organization is important to build scientology up to civilization level our intentions are good so we will make it it is now foregone conclusion that we will make it as soon as the materials are in your hands you cant help but make it in the human race and in the mind there is barrier called the hidden standard when anyone is critical they are apparently criticizing against hidden standard of behavior they seldom tell you what the behavior should be only what it shouldnt be or if they say what the behavior should be it is in antipathetic terms there is definition of normal person hence abnormal is defined against hidden standard the communist ideal would be anonymous this is weird person who is doing job should make known that he is the one doing it if someone isnt known he gets reward it is possible to develop odd tests for deciding what is good or right eg choosing doctor for appointment to hospital on the basis of his sports career examination and selection of personnel gets into trouble continually for lack of proper standard the hospital blames the medical school for not training good doctors but the hospital is setting up hidden standard and blaming the school for not delivering without saying what they want delivered marriages are made miserable by the hidden standards that spouses run on each other they dont make clear what they want when they say that they want good spouse eg the wife says you are not an adequate husband the husband says i guess im not an adequate husband but the wifes standard remains hidden she doesnt describe it to him you could handle marital problems organizationally by finding hidden standards auditors come up against this often you as an auditor have to face up to pcs who are running hidden standard on you all the time what you are looking at is not really standard but perverted standard it is not real standard nobodys ever acknowledged this standard and that holds it apart from the time track the auditor should acknowledge the standard so that it doesnt get parked on the time track the standard is the collection of non acknowledgments that the individual has if you want to end cycle of action acknowledge if you dont want to end cycle of action dont acknowledge in auditing if you dont want to end cycle you halfacknowledge as way of keeping someone going full acknowledgment of cycle ends it nonacknowledgment keeps it going that is why people tend to get uglier not prettier one ever says my you look ugly today one reason why person gets fixed on human bodies is that one said oh i see you are man this lifetime this datum is very applicable to registrars as well as auditors if you acknowledgethe person before he arrives he wont arrive nobody will appear for training or processing if you acknowledge heavily the right way to handle letter from someone who announces his intention to come for training or processing is to be courteous and not too definite give some information but not solid acknowledgments people generally work towards beingness they dont function so well just being post this is question of acknowledgment which ends cycle on the post retirement is an acknowledgment of persons total active life it ends the life in many cases it ends life in any form military commissions act as an invitation to overthrow ones superiors because commission is not granted by saying thank you for having been lower post you now have the right to work toward commissioned post corporal would function much better if on attaining his new rank he were to be congratulated not on being corporal but on having been private and on having attained the right to work towards becoming lance corporal if persons rank or position is bestowed as an accomplishment rather than as challenge or becomingness then the cycle has been ended before it began by being prematurely acknowledged the only way person can get in trouble is to be george smith while hes pretending to be his post there is the post which is set of beingnesses and lines and actions and policies all by itself and theres being who runs the set of beingnesses lines actions and policies which is the hat george smith must not operate as george smith when he is supposed to be being or attaining say the post of d of t there is hat and then there is being who runs the hat to get hat on you must put it in category of being in the process of being attained once it is attained and acknowledged it ends so as an auditor you have to be careful what and how and when you acknowledge if arthur says that he has had horrible day at school lrh doesnt acknowledge with good he would use something more sympathetic and really acknowledge it so that it could go onto the backtrack you have the power to put someones past on the past track and to give them future if you want to kill them dead acknowledge everything with crash this gives them future be little doubtful about someones future plans dont use certain solid acknowledgments then give the discussion good acknowledgment recognize that datum like this with lot of uses could easily gang agley on the back track it would get perverted messed up etc from this datum could arise such things as hidden standards and amnesia getting shot is too solid an acknowledgment of lifetime so one forgets it that is the basic mechanism behind nonrecall of past lives things that arent acknowledged because they are totally out of agreement while the good things are acknowledged these unacknowledged things bring about condition where everything disappears out of the persons past except the nonacknowledged things that people thought were silly or that they protested or that they were upset about this gives you decay of personality as person moves along the time track whether the person has gpms or not though without gpms the person could do and undo the aberrations almost at will person should know that he has tendency to collect all those things that were never acknowledged that is because the individual has some dependency on the comm formula as long as person has any desire to communicate he will be liable to malfunction of certain parts of the comm formula and when these parts go awry things do go weird person could regulate his conduct by knowing what parts of the comm formula were good and what parts were bad which parts would natively get him into trouble and which wouldnt if youre gonna associate with your fellow beings youre going to have to use the communication formula one way or another you will have to know how it works the part that acknowledgment plays etc the comm formula can have things go wrong with it so there is potential for native aberration there is direct source of direct aberration plus the native aberration of beings the two can work together gpms which are agreedupon aberration can hold lesser stuff native aberration eg failed acknowledgments etc in place and give them aberrative force and importance insanity could be two things1 the persons collection of unacknowledged things 2 outright gpm commands to be nuts crazy person is doing lot of things that have never been agreed with and therefore have never been acknowledged you dont have to agree with something in order to acknowledge it where you have both factors working together the gpms make the unacknowledged things very solid and very much in force you know that the pc will run into aberration of this sort at levels vi and vii the latter is power processing he runs into the collection of non agreedwith things the bank itself has lots of charge the nonagreedwith things locks carry very little charge the pc assigns the values wrongwayto especially at first because he assigns aberration to what he can confront so youve got 1 the bank 2 the accidents and incidents of livingness the power of these two is eight billion to one but it appears to be the reverse because that is all the thetan can confront you can key out the locks and pat the bank back into place this in itself is fantastic improvement over what anyone has been able to accomplish before there are hidden standards about what we are supposed to be accomplishing nobody will admit that you have reached any state because they have never told you what state you were supposed to reach in the first place amongst your fellow human beings this kind of cycle takes place you finish the pc up in session he feels good then he runs into the human race after the session they run hidden standard on him and try to make him prove that he is now in better state the hidden standard interferes with delivery there is point in talking to someone about clear or release youve got to talk scientology in terms that are real in relation to the goals of the person to whom you are talking or you will trip all over his hidden standards about the only standard you could have for clear is fn at clear read the standard for release is do you think that you will get any worse people have hidden standards about who you should be to audit them what condition they should be in in order to have had case gain etc you could run who would i have to be to audit you and acknowledge the dickens out of it for any condition you have described as better condition in scientology there is hidden standard and hidden standard exists even for known standards for instance you say we require pink sheet but they keep bringing you green ones saying is this what you want what happens is that the individual with his concatenation of nonacknowledged ideas adds up to nonobservational point he cant observe from this point he cant tell where he is or what you are saying to him about how he should be etc cf earlier material on service facs as substitute for observation safe assumptions etc see hcob 6sep63 scientology five instructing in scientology auditing instructors task d of ps case handling hcob 160ct63 r3sc slow assessment the pc will keep trying to bail himself out provided you dont overwhelm him with things to bail or give him nothing just give him things to bail with within his understanding and ability to confront and he will eventually float in that way you dont q and with his hidden standards you never realize how much better you are than yesterday because you are experiencing negative gain it is longer wrong with you so of course you are not now worrying about it just attesting level and getting certificate acknowledges the entire level the session the auditing etc the attestation keys it out and puts it on the back track this way also the pc doesnt get stuck in win hidden standardbecause of hidden standards the only safe way to evaluate case progress is mechanical method such as meter and completed cycle of processes it so happens that if the pc does complete the cycle of processes he will have case gain and this can be strung out along levels with such basic processes that you dont have different pcs all the time an unwritten standard is hidden you may feel that there is hidden technical standard this is an alteris what has happened is just that there is material that has not yet been released nobody is trying to hide any technology your best answer to the pcs hidden standards is to hold to your standard technology and just take

ron because you felt hed be interested in it here it is weve had several instances where people have read the remedies and come in to tell that certain ones fit them then when they started to tell which ones specifically they couldnt remember themor they would be able to remember only one the book obviously indicates bypassed charge and handles most of the problems they find out what their problem actually is one fellow who has been arc broken with scientology for years even before i heard of scn came in and i asked him to find himself in the remedies he started reading them and each one seemed to fit him except about 3 or 4 of them i noted them down one by one as he called them to when he finished i said more about it later onabout 15 minuteshe decided hed better look through those again because he was sure that they didnt all fitmaybe some of them have changed so he went through them again one by one and only 3 still seemed to applyand only one of them was strongest he felt the other two seemed to have lost their punch he was quite different after that i also did what the remedy called for which cleaned it up the last time i saw himat our congresshe not once mentioned the problem hes always had with eyespots and frankly i was afraid at that point to say eyespots to him for fear hed key it back in again so i just settled for his not mentioning it as soon as we get our next batch of remedies i intend to send at least 4 of them as gifts to people who are badly arc broken with us if they actually read them i know exactly what will happenthey cant stay

students sthil r6 coaudit scientology 0 scientology vi words misunderstood goofs it has come to my attention that words student misunderstands and looks up can yet remain troublesome and that r6 materials are suffering from the same fate when meter activity lessens its this way the student runs across word he or she doesnt understand he or she looks it up in dictionary finds substitute word and uses that of course the first word is still misunderstood and remains bother example line in text the size was gargantuan student looks up gargantuan finds like gargantua huge student uses huge as synonym and reads the text line the size was huge short while later is found still incapable of understanding the paragraph below gargantuan in the text conclusion the student makeswell it doesnt work the principle is that one goes dull after passing over word one does not understand and brightens up the moment he spots the word that wasnt grasped in actual fact the brightening up occurs whether one defines the word or not but to put another word in the place of the existing word whether in level 0 or level vi is to mess it all up take the above example huge is not gargantuan these are synonyms the sentence is the size was gargantuan the sentence was not the size was huge you cant really substitute one word for another at level 0 or level vi and get anything but an alteration so something remains not understood at level 0 and the meter stops at level vi it just isnt what was said or thought the correct procedure is to look over get defmed well and understand the word that was used in this case the word was gargantuan very well whats that it means like gargantua according to the dictionary who or what was gargantua the dictionary says it was the name of gigantic king in book written by the author rabelais cheers the student thinks the sentence meant the size was gigantic king oops thats the same goof again like huge but were nearer so what to do use gargantuan in few sentences you make up and bingo you suddenly understand the word that was used now you read it right the size was gargantuan and what does that mean it means the size was gargantuan and nothing elseget it theres hope for it mate youll have to learn real english not the 600 word basic english of the college kid in which few synonyms are substituted for all the big words and as an aside like

lrhmlrd copyright 1965 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6503c16 shspec55 the progress and future of scientology in 1950 people used to yammer at lrh about fixing up the organization he was caught flat footed when dmsmh was published one expected it to be bestseller but it was and it stayed at the top of the list for months the publishing firm that published it was overwhelmed by it when others set up the foundation and asked lrh to run it he said ok but he had management control he proposed some ideas then which are only now being put into action until about july 1950 his attitude was well i just wrote it the name lrh was getting very popular but he was trying to avoid the hat but he was setting the place up giving eight hours or so of lecture day getting the building the furniture etc the building had three main railroad lines one on each side lrh used to fix up pcs that other auditors couldnt handle he started the has course using the data straight out of book one the students all went onto the original hca course the word hubbard in hubbard dianetic auditor and in other titles was chosen by the elizabeth and auditors lrh went along with it with certain misgivings few days before the publication of dmsmh palmer at the explorers club offered lrh an expedition to the dodecanese islands south of greece to find sunken ship with statuary the deeper into 1950 it got the better the expedition looked the organization took more and more of lrhs time lrh was still telling people this kind of thing the general manager said to lrh you must front up the organization these people are depending on you lrh found out that joe winter was squirreling telling people that dianetics was developed by some nonexistent group of scientists and that auditing was an art with nothing scientific about it contemporary subjects were things like psychodrama moreno et these things looked good but they didnt work so two hours after the first meeting of the dianetic foundation lrh put his time on the line and took responsibility for the development of the subject rather reluctantly he wasnt prepared to make his life an open book because it was too incredible for people to believe and they would call him liar lrh is not in bad favor with washington senators etc in 1955 if he had wanted to lrh could have gotten legislation passed that would have protected scientology the fbi was very nice when he wanted to find out who out of about 200 staff people were communists they told him who were not communists about thirty out of 200 there was an airplane waiting to take lrh to st louis and put him in spinbin fortunately the people who were sent to get him werent as well trained in combat as he was he took care of them this all occurred subsequent to lrh taking on his hat it has taken fifteen years to get to state where the hat could be worn because lrhs hat assaults the foundations of the society we live in by talking about freeing man bettering man etc ours is philosophy that says that people cant be lied to that we can see through the black magic spells this is an interesting civilization because people dont know who they are where they are where they are going or what they are doing you start laying truth on the line and confusion starts to blow off the early days of dianetics followed that rule we got through it because in july 1955 lrh wore his hat of being him and one has been able to throw him off it since lrh is also capable of occupying subordinate role lrh worried for awhile that he was one of those guys who can only lead and cannot follow however he was delighted to find out in the navy that he was also an excellent subordinate but to occupy topdog role all the way up you know theres government or any mystic vision back of you and confront everything simultaneously and stand there regardless of the dead cats the alarm clocks and bricks and everything else which are coming your way that took some doing and thats all you look at when you look at this early history it was stable datum going into very very aberrated world from where i looked it looked awful lonesome occasionally it took some doing and some confront we have changed things in the world we have changed psychology for one thing it wasnt done alone early staffs took beating at times eg in philadelphia when fifteen or twenty cops came to arrest lrh as witness in abankruptcy hearing by the time the federal marshalls got to lrh they were utterly demoralized they took him downtown before judge and there was great embarrassment when the lies from the wichita foundation were uncovered but we have been standing still waiting for the dead cats to clear from the air our early history is that of trying at first unsuccessfully to just hold position putting in dianetics as stable datum blew off enough confusion in the society so that we could move for long time it was impossible to hold position stably hence the way the early foundations moved around lrh was standing there as being but as an organization we couldnt stand up lrhs idea was to do his research and get it to the point where there was dependable gain there for every case easily attainable and deliverable he paid attention to the dead cats that may have been rough on people the group has been asking him to advance line into society while he has been fixing up the technology so that it could be delivered he has kept organizations running but he has not put much time in on organization comparatively in the early days the reason we didnt deliver was that there was way to enforce the way to do it dianetics got enturbulated because unstraight tech poorly delivered prevented case advance and there wasnt any way you could discipline the administration of the technology to discipline the administration of the tech the following is required 1 youve got to have the technology and not hidden standards 2 youve got to be able to make it known 3 you have to police its use ie to make sure that it is that technology that is applied that is the 123 of an administration early on we lacked not only the tech to handle simple things like ow and pt concerns of the pc but also the means to see that what we did have got applied dianetics was not and we are not just an idea book copyright or nice philosophy lying in book on shelf we are bringing live human beings up to recognition of their own beingness and that is live action we dont face it because it is easier to confront concept than live being we have never been anything but beings going through society when we started up the line it was the enturbulation of the trillions starting to blow we had more ways to knock out the whole track than to get the overt out of the last hour we had started to make hole in the collective aberration of mankind it was we as beings making the hole not the idea not with good tools not with administration to enforce what tech we had you are perfectly right to say its rons fault that it didnt all go smoothly i should have been an ot who came to earth and got ahold of someone named moses and said hey moses here are some rules now you go back and front for is there anything wrong with that story can you imagine anyone doing that if he had all that power this didnt happen it just required more nerve to stand up by yourself the people who attacked us are dead or in terrible shape the organizations that attacked us are weaker we have held the fort successfully and we can now begin to do what we want rather than what we have to do we are holding our position as an organization now we are able to get tech applied our organization takes the form we want it to take in 1950 lrh said it will go as far as it works he has been pushing the tech to its limit despite pleas to take over the admin things are becoming more orderly now lrh is in position to put in administrative form and structure we had gotten ourselves to position where we were holding ourselves from expanding now the instructor can wear his hat in the course the action of administration is simply smoothing out the enturbulence of the environment when you introduce someone to scientology he can run into lots of confusion with the other people in his environment he has changed and they havent as an individual he goes through what scientology as group has gone through however it wont take him fifteen years to get up to point where he can hold his case gainthere is terrific relationship between the environment the individual and the speed with which process works the earlier auditing on case is race between the auditor and the pcs environment that was true of the introduction of dianetics and scientology into the environment also that was also race the guy who has an early win in scientology tells his friends and confusion blows off which may spin him in he gets inval etc he has put in stable datum and cant hold his position in the resultant confusion youve got to get process working on somebody that is effective enough so that the environment wont knock him down faster than you can pull him up you have to deliver to him the kind of technology that he can somehow stand up with you must not unsettle him eg with r6 you want him to be stable furthermore you want to give him some administrative protection today you have been given weapons of administrative protection for your pc as well as method of forcing pc to take action and not keep messing up in his environment we are more powerful and things are more stable than ever before and will continue to be so as long as we follow the channels of the administrative system as long as our mutual understanding of the existing situation and the lessons of what we have been through are applied we have had lines that were blocked lrh is pulling out the blocks now putting in comm lines etc the trick is to avoid unsettling lines that are already in and working the goal is an accelerating curve we are past the critical point of organizational case gain now we can hold our gains now we have to get in comm lines and put policy to work if you want to strengthen an organization just find the blocks to expansion and pull them out open up your comm lines put your barriers on the edges of the lines to channel them and put life into the group last summer lrh changed the whole org board to make it more workable this action resulted in smoother flows and less upset we are about to complete that reorganization without cutting out any working lines but paralleling them duplicative functions are being cut out so there is less traffic all we ask of staff member is to discipline his comm line there is vast rush to get the tech all published we need to get the organizational lines in first so that when we hit the society with new material there will be lines for the traffic to flow on the levels checksheets and processes are ready for release the processes are simpler than you would expect earlier technology was more advanced in some instances than later tech for instance the material in the philadelphia doctorate course is level vii material the old technology was workable ever since excalibur was written in 1938 but the chances of it being received followed or applied were remote we are now moving ahead to some law and order which smooths things out man was too far down to know that he was confused now he can

arc breaks as you know only ptp present time problem can hold graph unchanging and only an arc break can lower one therefore the anatomy of an arc break is more vital to know as it can worsen than the anatomy of ptp but both are very important and with the overt act and misunderstood words in study form the vital four things anyone should know in auditing pcs the average student has hard time getting rid of arc breaks in others mostly because he never really finds the arc break one auditor was sure pc had been arc broken by the last few inches of lecture tape and was madly calling washington to borrow the tape so the poor pc could listen to it again to cure his arc break well i dont mind being cause but my tape never arc broke the pc the auditor just didnt locate the charge the whole trick is to keep cleaning up the arc break until the pc is happy again and then quit when you find it thats it you dont find it and still have an arc broken pc the terribly simple truth is that 1 the pc is arc broken because something happened 2 the pc will continue to be arc broken until the thing is found 3 the arc break will vanish magically when the source is found finding the arc break and indicating it clears the arc break if it doesnt clear on what you find then you havent found it you must not continue to run pc on some process when the pc is arc broken you must find the arc break and clear it the pc will go into sad effect if you dont find the arc break but instead continue the process if you think you have found the arc break and havent and then go on auditing the pc will go into sad effect arc broken pcs are easy to identify they gloom and misemote they criticise and snarl sometimes they scream they blow they refuse auditing if you can read lighted neon sign at 10 feet on dark night you can detect pc who has an arc break some auditors can detect them sooner than others i can see one coming in pc 112 hours of auditing before the pc starts to get misemotional in earnest some newcomer in the business might not detect one until the pc wraps chair around the auditors head as i say the ability to perceive one varies the better you are the sooner you see one if an auditors pc isnt bright and happy theres an arc break there with life or the bank or the session the thing to do is find it and clean it up and now all is revealed this is what makes an arc break occuran arc break occurs on generality or not there the generality example of generality they say you are coldhearted everybody thinks you are too young the people versus sam jones the will of the masses case manifestation example little boy screaming in rage when he makes mistake in drawing auditor observes little boy is upset auditor what are you upset about little boy howling my drawing is good auditor who said your drawing is good little boy crying the teachers at school plural auditor what teacher singular little boy sobbing not the teachers the other children plural auditor which one of the other children little boy suddenly quiet sammy auditor how do you feel now little boy cheerfully can i have some ice cream the formula 1 ask what the pc is upset about 2 ask who thought so 3 repeat the generality the pc used and 4 ask for the singular 5 keep 3 and 4 going until the pc is happy as its near q and it should be awfully easy they name prunes you say what prune is prunes result its quite magical done barehanded or on meter errors you can miss in english sometimes on you the pc says you are mean we have plural or singular signal in the word you therefore statement that you are arc breaking or you are mean may not mean as an egocentric auditor may take it the auditor but you may be being used as the whole world the above formula holds 1 to 5 just find out which person is meant by the word you our old look at who am i was not too wrong so next time your pc says the instructors are mean dont be goofy enough to indicate the charge with ok you are arc broken because the instructors are mean and then be amazed when the arc break continues you didnt find out what instructor is instructors if you ask bit further youll find it probably wasnt the instructors but somebody else and that somebody will be unit not groupa less workable but interesting approach is who uses the word everybody frequently its of interest only because everybody makes dispersal which the pc cant see through it will take quite while sometimes for pc to spot such person how many people have died heartbroken because they were mean to him and it was just one vicious being who had been blown up to they the not there is also generality because it can be anywhere but it is special case when something becomes unlocatable it can cause an arc break the cure for this one is to find out whats gone if you see somebody with cold ask whos gone and youll be amazed at the recovery if you pursue the matter one concludes its less the loss than not knowing where something has gotten to making one into generality the common response to sudden loss is to feel everything is gone or going this is the state of anxiety explained the beaten and downtrodden respond well on this when brought up through normal levels to the level of remedies very sneaky question is who or what was everything to you but use it sparingly the pc will go whole track like flash if overworked remarkably at this late date to find it thats why he rather fancies his pictures at least he has picture of it dreams follow sudden loss its an effort to orient oneself and get something back level vi arc breaks of course theres nothing wrong really with thetan but his reactive bank he can recover from the rest and his reactive bank is full of generalities which explains the hard arc breaks of level vi but dont tamper with level vi if the pc belongs at ii you can get enough locks off any day from normal life to cure the arc breaks youll encounter getting up to vi main thing to know is an arc break occurs because of generality or not there fortunately it doesnt always occur only sometimes and when it does find the singular form of the generality in admin particularly you save more executives that way and in auditing you just dont have failed cases or blows if you know it l ron hubbard lrhwmcajcden copyright 1965 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6503c30 shspec56 arc breaks and generalities the problem of getting materials out has to do with lrhs pen fingers and the short only 24 hour day nevertheless expansion is going rapidly what is interesting is the number of false data that you can get that create false impression for instance you can get the datum that they say when only one guy said it we were thrown curve last year it was reported to lrh from at least two sources that the gradation program was unpopular in fact the gradation program alone was responsible for last years organizational upsurge lrh let the gradation program wobble and modified it whereupon decline set in most people think that it was the price shift at the start of the year that caused the decline but the decline was coincident with lrh leaving for vacation when investigated it was found that registrars were using the confusion caused by the price shift to deny service they sold lot of auditing saying the price will be prohibitive in thirty days and everyone went into agreement with it the registrars also confused the public about what they could get with what in terms of memberships furthermore there wasnt price rise the price dropped unlike registrars in central orgs lrh never talked about money someone would come in to central org thinking about auditing and someone at the org who had money problems himself gratuitously gave the wouldbe pc money problems lrh never talked about money yet people force discussion of money on him if processing works the person who gets it is more able to have money since registraring to get money was never something that lrh had to do he is considering removing interviews with the reg as part of the regs hat it must have been something added on the line that suppressed the inflow of money it must have been the selling lrh used to explain every datum at least nine times in lecture before study tech came out that got around misunderstood words because the material was put in various ways when telling students to do something he has found that they will do what he said so he has to be sure that he tells them what to do very very clearly instruction is basically trying to cover all of it so thoroughly that there are gaps and room for question on how to do it an old process gets all the quirks and weird ways to do it ironed out as it gets used people in the org got the odd idea that class vi auditor would only audit level vi material class vi auditors can run level 0 only they would use emeters assess for the exact thing to run etc an auditor uses all the tools of the trade that he has mastered if class vi auditor were doing touch assist on burned area and he could see that the area was not getting better fast ie that there was ta on the process he would know that the pc must have something connected with the injury like withhold or an overt having the pc point to where it happened and where it is now is having him contact the environment and letting the whole incident come into view now the touch assist can go to work never accept rumor as something on which to base any action or decision except to investigate use statistics which are particularities if you dont have stats for each individual you get chaos because it is generality an organization will cause arc breaks amongst its staff if you cant get statistic on everybody present week in and week out people will protest an organization as slavedriving system in the absence of stats the stat has to be on each individual or it is worthless it must also be compared with former stats this is what it takes to keep some activity or organization going for long period of time the galactic confederacy had pretty good org board the org lasted eighty trillion years its only flaw was not having any provision for change or improvement it had two billion staff members in the central org lrh set himself the problem of making an org board that could cover from one person to two billion when things arent staticized you get rumors injustice and authoritarianism because generality is operating earth organizations commonly attribute success wholly to the man at the top when in fact he is only 60 or 70 responsible general macarthur didnt win the war though he was bright cookie in korea he didnt win because he wasnt goodpolitician he disobeyed condition formula he was in emergency and didnt promote public opinion is made out of someones hat the moral is that when you try to explain condition with generalities that do not apply you muck up the whole situation that is how russia will take the us they have better propaganda they are promoting communism and who is promoting democracy wilson and johnson are reorganizing economies in period of decline emergency when they should promote what they cam eventually deliver be prepared to deliver it etc they are advertising crisis if you dont want to be something dont postulate it if you yell crisis you will get crisis apply the proper conditions formula us business operates an though it is in perpetual condition of emergency it uses heavy promotion etc american businesses never apply the condition for normal when they get there so they never get out of emergency in emergency you handle with sledge hammer in normal you handle with kid gloves all this has to do with dealing with what is actually going on but you can never find out what is actually going on from having just mass of something there is nothing to compare it with you can only find out what is happening with the individual bits of something never with the masses you get in trouble when you generalize what should be particular in scientology we do make general statements about men we can only get away with doing this because we have studied many individuals when we say about men is actually description of thetan there is another interesting fact about generalities we used to know fairly little about arc breaks now we know that an arc break is generality that should be particularity it was single but it was called many only an arc break can worsen graph during processing which makes an arc break more serious than ptp if theres graph change theres ptp there is nothing wrong with generality per only with one that should be particularity if you get generality when asking for an arc break get the pc to particularize it you can fail to find the bpc by taking generality as the bpc instead of going on to find out who they is you would still have to get the specific who and it may take several of these steps to get it eg aud is there an arc break pc yes the instructors are mean to aud who is the instructors pc pete aud there is bpc has he failed to answer you etc pc it is actually the students aud who is the students pc agnes id forgotten completely she said i was lousy auditor yesterday what is basically wrong with the r6 bank all the gpms are generalities that is why people arc break so hard on r6 the above datum concerning generalities also solves loss the loss of something produces generality of where it could be when you lose something it could be anywhere which makes it generality this is lie so the person arc breaks one of the ways to cure yourself of loss is to remember that the thing that was lost can only be in one place not in thousands of placesits an everywhere that should be particularity it gives the individual an unflat listing question about where the test of what was the bpc is when it is located does the pc cheer up if you have to locate it more you havent found the bpchubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 2 april ad15 remimeo bpi mag art all scientology auditor issue 8 franchise sthil students the road to clear i have just made breakthrough in finding what clear really is and we can certainly make it now the road to clear is very definite and the state is very attainable today clear has vicious reactive mind and operates at total mental capacity just like the first book dianetics the modern science of mental health said in fact every early definition of clear is found to be correct people have been unable to define release to their own satisfaction i find now release is person who has been able to back out of his bank the bank is still there but the person isnt sunk into it with all its somatics and depressions the emeter reads at the clear read the needle of the meter is floppy this is simulated clear we called it keyed out clear quite properly but it isnt clear i know now its release the person has been released from his reactive mind he still has that reactive mind but hes not in it he is just released from it he may go into it again but it feels good to be out of it his iq and ability rise and he is far more effective in changing his environment into better one the state is beyond homo sapiens by considerable this happens today before or at level v in most cases if the preclear has followed the grades and levels properly just one level up from there rather long level and rough one is the state of clear this is level vi this level consists of several processes the preclear still preclear has to be able to audit to make it it cant be done for him that was the hitch all the lower levels can be done for him but not level vi thats technical fact the preclear has to be able to handle scientology technology to handle his own bank level vi requires several months to audit through even with expert training but at its end magic theres the state of clear weve sought for all these years it fits all definitions ever given for clear the state at the end of level vi is not operating thetan any more than baby is man operating thetan is several levels above clear the bridge from clear to ot already exists and is found in route i in the book the creation of human ability the reactive mind and rotten mess it is too prevented pcs from doing route i drills it stood like huge black spider between the person and his realizing his full potential trying to do route i as given years ago with reactive mind still in place was to be blunt not possible for humansome people also get frightened of ridding themselves of reactive mind having looked it all over now i can state that it is as much use as sewer in the living room it says the bad is good and the good is bad its slave maker and stupidifier and body killer any time you think it has value imagine trying to swim in the city dump or trying to fly with an anvil in each pocket all the while saying this is exactly the right thing to do whats happened that caused the blunder is that keyed out clear looked like clear but was only release and one had to have very precise map and the skill to walk through the still present dark barriers that existed unsuspected between keyed out clear and the real state of clear so clear can be attained and further it is being attained right this minute by dozens of class vi preclears it will take them months to get there but they are soaring and will tell you so one session on it sends them the equivalent distance that ten intensives did in their early auditing why because they did the earlier auditing the road was just longer road man looks for the quick way the oneshot way the needle and the rocket to sudden glory clear takes now an exact progress over exact levels and the way is not long really but it could be few years for some but whats few years if one is bargaining for eternity the point here is that ive finally been able to tell you what it is and where it is and exactly how to get there sorry i couldnt sooner it took some time to find the way for you and communicate how to do it i always tell you as soon as i know i tell you when ive goofed and where well here it is thats what clear is and its road you can travel the states of being release is at the top of level v clear is at the top of level vi theta clear is at level ix an operating thetan is at level xviii above level vi there are mental auditing processes as we know them there are only various drill and familiarization processes like those in the creation of human ability processes and the regaining of abilities one supposed one couldnt ever attain thats the road and road map the only real error i made was in believing the road was bit shorter than it was the plan of going on to clear is to get processed up to grade iv or v then being release and quite beyond the top range of most iq tests get trained rapidly up through from level 0 to level vi and then audit up to grade vi which is clear grade and level are the same but when one is pc one has grade and when one has level one is studying its datathere are about 3 or 4 intensives to grade pc up to grade v thats perhaps 15 to 20 25hour intensives 15 to 20 weeks then training as student of the same material one was audited on from level i to level v thats six separate months worth of training then to level vi thats only as student at saint hill which takes about 23 months usually then year or less depending on how hard you work and at further cost to clear the total of this is about two years and two months of continuous processing and training time the total elapsed time might be longer even up to 5 or 10 years depending on ones own economics and all that the fact is that economics arent real factor contrary to what one might be thinking for today the increase in ability at one grade of processing is capable of delivering an economic boost adequate to earn or obtain much more extra wherewithal than the auditing or training cost economic increase because of auditing and training is sure thing today faster route but not quite as secure as you might think as one isnt already release while studying is to train from level 0 on up only i myself wouldnt like to do that as it would be rougher and could be even slower than the grade i to v pc then level i to vi auditor route but it could be done weve had 15 years of experience now we had to feel our way as man has never had road to clear its been through totally new territory never before viewed by man even the wise tibetan only achieved release and only after he invested 20 years of hard work at it at that from release as case on up to level vi as an auditor is pretty easy in fact the grade level roadway is like walking in pleasant countryside now oh one has few stumbles even on gravel path but thats part of it the pioneer times are all over and the pioneer always has it rough the 49ers left freeway to follow so have we it just took while to build so thats clear l ron hubbard lrh mlcden copyright 1965 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 4 april ad15 remimeo franchise arc breaks and missed withholds the primary error one can make in arc break handling is to handle the pc with arc break procedure when the pc really has missed withhold as some auditors dislike pulling withholds because they run into pcs who use it to carve the auditor up such as i have withhold that everybody thinks you are awful it is easier to confront the idea that pc has an arc break than the idea that the pc has withhold in case of doubt one meter checks on withhold to see if it is nonexistent am i demanding withhold you havent got if this is the case the ta will blow down if it isnt the case the needle and ta remain unchanged if the pcs nattery or arc breaky condition continues despite finding bypassed charge then of course it is obviously withhold arc break finding does work when the pc doesnt change despite skillful arc break handling locating and indicating it was withhold in the first place the hardest pc to handle is the missed withhold pc they arc break but you cant get the pc out of it the answer is the pc had withhold all the time that is at the bottom of all these arc breaks scientology auditing does not leave the pc in poor condition unless one goofs on arc breaks arc breaks occur most frequently on people with missed withholds therefore if pc cant be patched up easily or wont stay patched up on arc breaks there must be basic withholds on the case one then works hard on withholds with any and all the tools that weve got arc breaks dont cause blows missed withholds do when you wont hear what the pc is saying then you have made him have withhold and it responds as missed withhold in short the bottom of arc breaks is missed withhold but an antisocial act done and then withheld sets the pc up to become an arc breaky pc it isnt an accurate remark really since one has pc with withholds who on being audited arc breaks easily so the accurate statement is the pc is withholdy type pc that arc breaks lot now that type exists and they sure have lots of subsequent arc breaks and are regularly being patched up if you have pc then who seems to have lot of arc breaks the pc is withholdy pc not an arc breaky pc any auditor miss causes pc blowup the auditor by calling this pc an arc breaky pc is not using description which leads to resolution of the case as thousands of arc break assessments leave the case still liable to arc break if you call such case that arc breaks lot withholdy pc that arc breaks lot then you can solve the case for all you have to do is work on withholds the actual way to handle withholdy pc that arc breaks lot after youve cooled off the last of his many arc breaks is1 get the pc to look at whats going on with his sessions 2 get the pc in comm 3 get the pc to look at whats really bugging him 4 get the pcs willingness to give withholds up on gradient 5 bring the pc to an understanding of what hes doing 6 get the pcs purpose in being audited in plain view to him or her those are of course the names of the first six grades however low down these six things are all crushed together and you could really pursue that cycle in one session just to get the pc up bit without even touching the next grade up whenever i see sourfaced person who has been trained or is being trained i know one thingthere goes pc with lots of withholds i also know there is pc who arc breaks lot in session and i also know his coauditor is weak and flabby as an auditor and i also know his auditing supervisor doesnt shove the student auditor into doing the process correctly one sourfaced student one glance and i know all the above things bang so why cant somebody else notice it auditing is pleasure but not when an auditor cant tell withhold from an arc break and doesnt know that continual arc breaks are caused by missed withholds on the bottom of the chain i never miss on this why should you the only case that will really bug you is the continuous overt case heres one that commits antisocial acts daily during auditing hes nut hell never get better case always hangs up unless you treat his continual overts as solution to ptp and find what ptp hes trying to solve with these crazy overt acts you see we can even solve that case but dont go believing scientology doesnt work when it meets an unchanging or continually misemotional pc both of these people are foul balls who are loaded with withholds weve cracked them for years and years now but not by playing pattycake or slap my wrist takes an auditor not lady finger mister youve been wasting my time for three sessions you have withholds give mister you refuse just once more to answer my question and youre for it ive checked this meter its not withhold of nothing you have withholds give mister thats it i am asking the d of p to ask the tech sec for comm ev on you from hco for report if skill couldnt do it demand may if demand couldnt do it comm ev sure willfor its report how can you make man well when hes got sewer full of slimy acts show any person who is critical of us and ill show you crimes and intended crimes that would stand magistrates hair on end why not try it dont buy i once stole paper clip from the hasi as an overt or youre lousy auditor as withhold hell man people who tell you those things just stole your lunch or intend to empty the till get clever auditor thetans are basically good them that scientology doesnt change are goodbut down underneath pile of crimes you couldnt get

justice student training the nogaincase student instructors must be alert for nocasechange cases on course and for withholdy pcs who arc break easily blowy students and unstable gains cases even indifferent auditing on even haphazard course causes good case gains the minority group of nocasechange in routine course auditing and withholdy is very minor these categories contain all the students who disturb your course are insolent to instructors rant against rules etc you are under orders from that you must please them but you are under orders to report such cases to hco you only use difficult case or student in the academy as an indicator of something worse you arent staff auditor but an instructor you want proper auditor and case gain of course and youll get it providing when some student says it didnt work to find out exactly what the student did that didnt work and youll find it was never what was ordered however on cases that are very difficult watch it these difficult cases are more than cases they mean trouble for you from that student and for your class in ways you wouldnt look for by concentrating on tough cases you miss the fact that you have whole class to handle if you want it handled look rather at what these tough cases do to your class and handle the tough case in way to protect your course not to make their cases move in an academy dont try to handle your course environment with student auditing handle your course environment with good data good 8c and discipline and hco justice machinery your students now have their old course regulations suspended instead the justice codes are in the students are scientologists becoming students gives them new rights and it doesnt remove their justice rights either ive been through all you go through and i have found by comparing conduct on course to conduct in the field afterwards that the turbulent student is pc not student he or she makes trouble on the course and afterwardsthe total symptom that alerts you to such person is tough case this is very easy to notice just look over the student case folders and note that one or another student doesnt seem to get going note the folder you have to work on thats it thats your trouble spot on the course dont judge students by conduct or speed of study judge on tough case only routine auditing is good unless its been alterised routine processes work on good people the nocasegain case makes you hunt for magical processes and fatally leads to alteris now hear this the processes you have even when only fair are better than the processes that will be dreamed up by students or anyone around your course the processes you use if altered to fit some tough case will cease to work on standard cases when so altered the tough case who is also the difficult student is the sole reason one has an urge to alter process you must be sure to push routine processes done routinely when you see process being altered look for tough case in the pc or the student and call hco promptly if you find the poor ta type case the change response to routine processes your approach is to run the standard processes in the right grade in the right sequence thats all you teach students to do and its all you do in case supervision when these dont work even when you force them to be correctly applied you have tough case there dont louse up scientology technology to handle tough case you dont have to invent the processes for it they already exist in the hgc when you see alteris look for the tough case and let hco take it from there we are after all team and as team we can handle our environment your job is just teach and get run the processes of the grade in the right sequence your job is to teach students to do just that your job is to force the student to run the process that should be run and run it right and to correct any alteris savagely never let some student tell you it didnt work without at once plowing in there to look you will find only one of two things wrong 1 your student erred in the wording sequence or application of the process through lack of study or 2 either the student auditor or the student pc is tough case dont let anybody try to vary process to fit case if you do your indicator is obscured in letting anybody fool about in trying to make process work or trying to get inventive just to crack tough case the majority of your course trouble and the tendency to alteris material comes from trying to force tough case to get gains should you alter or advise alteration of process you are letting our side down it leads you into teaching students to alteris and there goes theballoon it means they wont be able to run standard stuff successfully and that means lets be brutal they will miss by nonstandard auditing on 909 of their cases the good people they will slant all scientology toward one nut and well be failed mess like psychiatry with our clinics full of psychiatric cases not people the hgc and perhaps one course level is taught to handle tough cases the processes for them are standard too you must hold the line and answer students didnt work with exactly what didnt work and exactly what did you do and youll find they didnt do it or its tough case either way follow policy you must report tough case to hco at once for there sits justice matter not an academy problem its not your hat you see the nogaincase the withholdy case that arc breaks easily the blowy student unstable gain student and your tendency may be to do something original or give the student some different process if you do you are madly offpolicy in the ordinary academy course you are not teaching tough case course you are teaching nice fast workable course for decent average cases your majority is composed of good students they deserve your time so this makes the tough case student the odd man or woman out they make lot of commotion so one may think they are everybody on course theyre not they are seldom higher than 10 so you risk the 90 of your course and all scientology just to handle 10 could i point out that the protestant idea of recovering at any expense and considering very valuable any sheep who strayed was batty how about the whole flock leave them to the wolves while one ran off after one please dont go the route by doing that its pretty awful this tough case is for the hgc and hco and id darn well rather you didnt give the person the technology before he straightens out as hell hurt people with it such tough cases are possible to salvage theyre just cases but it takes an hgc to run them and it takes hco to hold them still so theyll be audited remember were team hco and hgc are part of the team dont steal their hats the tough case is judged only on the basis of case gain or lack of it the academy does not send students to the hgc for slow study or dullness or any other reason except tough case thats firm policy the tough case is the only one you send there are 3 categories of these tough cases 1 the roller coaster case the potential trouble source suppressive person is on the other side of this one the case will get gain and slump get gain and slump over and over it isnt manic depressive as the old 1 9th century psychoanalyst thought its guy whose marital partner or family is going into fits over this persons connection with scientology this is purely justice matter and belongs to hco he either disconnects or acts to settle his or her situation halfway measures but you cant do much about that in an academy if you did youd leave your class to the wolves get online and route this mysterious fellow who cant get gain without losing it the next day or week over to hco with please investigate possible potential trouble source dont even bother to question the student hco will find out its also illegal to audit them so hco wont even route to the hgc but will act as per policy on suchalways err on the side of sending hco too many students rather than risk keeping one who is liability to us all but never send merely course cutup or lazy student whose case runs well this policy is only faintly discipline it is actually excellent technology to recurring course problem 2 the withholdy case the withholdy case is routinely arc breaking and having to be patched up commonly blows has to have lots of handholding as your course possibly isnt at that level it is too much to handle anyway and youre not equipped to handle but even if your course is equipped to handle the right action is again hco report this student to hco with the label withholdy case that arc breaks easily or blow type case and get hco over to the academy hco may route to hgc at the students own expense or get two tough staff members to stand by while the withholds are explored on meter in case this is real justice case or just student lunch thief the reason for all that weird behaviour is always withhold condition you cant be bothered hco however is interested in the report aspect of such case this person hasnt told all thats sure hco can send to hgc or refund or even comm ev 3 the suppressive person the suppressive person does turn up to get trained and when you train them their case doesnt change b they cheer when their course pc loses and gloom when their course pc wins and c they chatter about the horrors of discipline and seek to lead student squirreling or revolt their dream is society wherein the criminal may do anything he pleases without any faintest restraint we sometimes get loaded up with these characters but they run about 1 or 2 in 80 students usually this person has faintest chance of making it unless handled for what he or she is in an hgc and if you train such you lend our name to all the chicanery and injury they do with our tech and protect them with our name youve seen this case in another guise of squirreling chatterchatter about phoney past lives when they were cleopatra and so on invalidating others actual memories talking only whole track to raw meat youve seen this one its suppression pure and simple and they know it and they dont ever get case change and their arc breaks dont heal etc etc etc the secret here is continuous overts which are then withheld the technical fact is they are quite gone and are solving personal but long gone problem by continuous overts one can actually handle them if one knows this seemingly tiny fact one finds of course the ptp not the overts for one has about as much chance pulling this fellows overts as moving the earth by pulling weeds the suppressive acts this person does are solutions to solve some long long ago problem in which the pc is stuck to an hgc this is finding conditions of environment the pc has had and discovering how he or she handled them but this is hcohgc business the longer you wait to notify hco the more harm will be done and hco will get inquisitive as to why there was report from you on this for here is the auditor heart breaker the natterer the rumour factory the 11 and the course and group wrecker heres whee kill everybody in person here also is the possible government agent the ama bma stooge here is the guy who plans to squirrel and grab scientology here is the boy or here is the girl but here is also thetan buried in the mud and if you let this person go without attention he or she will soon become ill or dieor worse will mess up or kill others the person is the only real psycho and if you let him drift hell soon wind up in the brain surgeons suppressive hands so its nothing to overlook people who have to solve their problems by shooting the rest of us down are what made life such hell in this universe you have your hands on the implanted the warmonger the wrecker but still this is whats left of human being and he or she can be salvaged but onlyin an hgc not course please here also is the criminal or the sex crazy guy or the pervert who just had to break old rule 25 the old nosex academy rule people who are sex crazy are over their heads in collapsed bank that theyve collapsed themselves with overts lets be real this person throws people back in twice as fast as we can pull them out so why arm him with tech put on your label when you send for hco nocasechange despite good tries with the routine processes taught on this course that was closely supervised in correct application let hco take it from there its not academy business your routine procedure on any of the 3 types of case is 1 call hco department of inspection and reports 2minimize disturbance 3hold the student in an empty classroom or auditing room 4stand by to help if things get rough 5help hco complete its report 6let hco and probably hgc take over from there and get back to your students if youre going to grow and get your own case changes and have good time instructing youll read this very very carefully and put it very briskly into practice at first you may not agree that you should be so sharp it may be blow to feeling you can crack all cases you probably can but man thats an hgc hat what are you doing wearing it as an instructor by all means crack the routine cases but the tough ones thats hco and hgc the bigger we get the easier all this will be but now lets mark start in teaching courses that are fun for all by giving the deep six to those who want mess okay well do it do it do it l ron hubbard lrhmlcden copyright

without policy even bad policy will at least make team if it is followed policy is the extant agreement of the group without this agreement you only get individual action if an organization is better organized than other organizations it wouldnt have to do anything spectacular about the other organizations by way of competing with them or battling with them every war traces back to wild outpolicy if we come up the line as people as individuals and also as part of the team we wont get into all the trouble we got into as roarin screamin individuals way back on the track we will be able to make it all the way because we will be able to keep order all the way case stability depends upon the smooth organization of individuals without an organization the tech would drop out in time the organization must be close to flawless once you have put the organization in concrete and started it rolling if it is almost right you have had it because it will become an alldevouring monster and it will fail by the germs of its own destruction and what destroys almost any organization is its own germs its the things it laid in its the things you did not the things that were done to you the only way you can come down is for having made mistake yourself there must always be that prior mistake sometimes it is very slight and unpredictable apparently when curve goes down there are lots of errors there is one major error you must have understandings not understanding there are 265 x 6 separate dynamic urges in man and 265 x 6 x 18 separate causations there was an effort to make them so numerous that one could embrace them actual gpms organizational policy must be comprehensible the org board must express 1 function 2 duties 3 sequences of actions 4 authorities the org board gives the cycle of raw meat to ot the cycles of actions that person would undertake from the public it became public org board too the public enters from the left and proceeds to the right in life 1 you must have an impulse into channel2 the edges of channel must be held firm 3 the barriers in the channel must be removed 4 the noncompliance of forwardings in the channel must be taken care of 5 the distractions must be removed from the borders of the channel 6 there must be some place for something going down the channel to arrive at this is the definition of life life without that channel wont exist that is livingness going along certain course impelled by purpose with some place to arrive this also gives us all the levels of the gradation program clear is baby ot his next bank is the physical universe the first point on the org board is the office of lrh this used to be hasi this deals with 1 authority 2 lrhs material 3 lrhs signature the main thing about this department is the issuance of conditions the first cog is that there is condition hence this is the entrance point for raw meat he thinks others will take care of him however he must recognize his condition or he will die others tell him that his condition is that he will die scientology says you dont have to die or get sick etc all processes from that point on contain condition after you have condition you had better communicate with it hence the next department is the department of communications and the name of the level is communication the next level is perception the department of inspections and reports communication must precede perception the next point is orientation the individual finds out that he has been living in nightmare this is the department of compilation after you have accumulated notes you can put them together and hand them to people so that they can get oriented cf these briefing course notes perceptions get compiled into understandings so the next department is understandings ie the department of publications this department publishes what is to be understood or what is understood understanding is just telling yourself what is understood the next department the department of promotion is under purposes the only thing the promreg ever handles is purposes the pc at this level on the gradation chart has arrived at purposes ie r6 he has gotten rid of false purposes he has achieved the state of clear in its new 1964 definition see tape 6409c03 shspec38 clearing what it is the above is all under hco hco is doublebarreled division if you cross two divisions on hat from that point on you have jammed the ability of an organization to expand dont have one person on hats in two different divisions therefore six people are necessary in order to have an org one for each division when an organization gets fairly big you cross departmental hats at your peril personnel housing division 3 has to hold things together eg the physical plant it is also involved in financial planningdivision 4 has to do with what you do the doingness there has been neglected factor on the galactic confederation org board the product an organization has to qualify the product it must find out what made the product fall down ie there is need for lost battles division you must not let the person who trains students examine them scientology is the ability to change conditions but we have to decide what conditions we want to change you have to convince people that the product of scientology is valuable the alternative is sitting on an island out of communication it is the product that is distributed you can take your life and find out which division is missing note that there are six divisions and sixteen departments to expand the org board each department would have primarily six sections with sixteen subsections each one of these subsections in turn may have six divisions with sixteen departments each divisional head knows all the department hats in his division and something about all other departmental hats this gives you basically six hats and staff member hat there should be two admin personnel for every tech person if any hats below you on the org board are empty you are responsible for themhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 7 april ad 15 remimeo franchise sthil students level i premature acknowledgements heres new discovery imagine my making one on the comm formula after all these years do people ever explain to you long after you have understood do people get cross with you when they are trying to tell you something if so you are suffering from premature acknowledgement like body odor and bad breath it is not conducive to social happiness but you dont use life buoy soap or listerine to cure it you use proper comm formula when you coax person to talk after he has begun with nod or low yes you ack make him forget then make him believe you havent got it and then make him tell you at great length he feels bad and doesnt cognite and may arc break try it out have somebody tell you about something and then encourage before he has completely told you all thats why pcs itsa on and on and on and on with gain the auditor prematurely acknowledged thats why pcs get cross for reason the auditor has prematurely and unwittingly acknowledged thats why one feels dull when talking to certain people they prematurely acknowledge thats why one thinks another is stupidthat person prematurely acknowledges the quickest way to become social pariah dog is to prematurely acknowledge one can do it in many ways the quickest way to start the longest conversation is to prematurely acknowledge for the person believes he has not been understood and so begins to explain at greater and greater length so this was the hidden arc break maker the cognition wrecker the stupidifier the itsa prolonger in sessions and why some people believe others are stupid or dont understand any habit of agreeable noises and nods can be mistaken for acknowledgement ends cycle on the speaker causes him to forget feel dull believe the listener is stupid get cross get exhausted explaining and arc break the missed withhold is inadvertent one didnt get chance to say what one was going to say because one was stopped by premature acknowledgement result missed wh in the speaker with all its consequences this can be counted on to make you feel frightened of being agreeable with noises or gestures for bit and then youll get it straightwhat piece of tech to remain incompletely explained fair scares one it does and in the comm formula too l ron hubbard lrhwmccden copyright 1965 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6504c13 shspec58 the lowest levels research is not wrapped up new datum has emerged and research is going south lrh is researching power processing it is not surprising that the more one discovers in the upper reaches the more understanding one has of fundamentals that apply to the bottom youve got r6ew that is holding you nicely im putting the capper on the r6 gpm plot r6 has developed into series of starrated processes the first is the method of cleaning up outruds on yourself it is solo ruds process twoterminal auditing is too slow at level vi solo auditing all the gpms on r6 takes about three months at three to four hours per day the end product of this auditing is clear as we knew it in the earliest days reactive bank at all thetan experiences sense of unfamiliarity at this level and he runs into problems like how do you handle body he has to learn to postulate with great rapidity it is condition of too aware he has to get used to reading peoples minds he finds that absolute zero is proper temperature everything else is hot it is in tiny but observable motion and it is bothersome at first he needs refamiliarization he is not quite sure what he can do his framework on whom he must fight changes he can start wondering about his sanity because previously sensible things seem foolish he can also get solutions he can do analyses of situations that were previously blank puzzles the road to ot is one of familiarity clear has trouble trying to reconcile what has been going on in his life with what he is now he is not really able to think very straight about how confused he was sometimes its hard to understand why somebody else is confused for instance try to wrap your wits around some guys saying but we gotta get the republicans back in power you know they are nutty too since you erased your confusion and dont have it around anymore as standard clear is not necessarily very tolerant state but it is not very antagonistic state either its not negative one is far more positive about things than he ever was before his reactions are far more vivid you have to realize that thetan can become aberrated without being implanted or having gpms but what really made him unable was gpms which gave him wrong purposes and smashed him down so that he couldnt have any purpose of his own all his own real purposes are suppressed when you get out into the open your own purposes show up and you start doing what you would like to do not what your bank wants you to do in scientology we have been working with what the thetan wants we only fail with other people when we treat them as other than thetan being all thetans want out even those that are in an insane asylum who fight everybody who comes in the door beings are basically good one reason why the being has consented to have bank is that it prevents everyone else from being bad that is so farfetched that one would ever look for it as the philosophical fundamental in back of the aberration of man there is aberration that thetan can get into based on his ignorance his unfamiliarities his decisions based on data etc scientology is built straight around what might happen to thetan gpms gave him reverse purposes he decided that to keep others and himself good he should have bank to prevent himself and them from being bad the idea was that man is bad and we have to do something to him to make him good so we all have to agree to have bank to keep us from being bad but the bank cut off the thetan from all familiarity with himself as he was the decision to do that to create bank somehow put him into condition where he couldnt conceive of how he had been it was cutoff he is like guy in coal pit who doesnt believe that there is sun or platos cave metaphor in the republic he thinks that what he is in is normal environment he will say look you can see there is sun or light thats proof that was the barrier that made someone unsalvageable before we knew about it as you come up the line your r gets violated by the wog world the higher you get the more your r is susceptible to violation but fortunately the more capable you are of standingup to invalidation it doesnt mean anything to you it is vital that someone improve on gradient since pcs case gain must not outrun his capability of handling the new reality you cant travel the road to truth halfway see the tape 6211c01 shspec207 the road to truth above it is vital that lrh reorganize and perfect organizations now because we are at the makebreak point where it requires hard push at first shifting over to runaway forward motion if we released public book right now we would cave ourselves in the orgs have to be able to expand rapidly before flood of new people hits it we can push the boombutton any time all of sudden lrh made discovery that found the answer to cases that wouldnt run successfully on level 0 power processing there are two levels below level 0 1 conditions processes 2 existence processes existence is below conditions this antiquated the plans for boom so there have been changes there are three conditions processes auditing the case on these belowzero processes is walk in the park however it may take class vi to run them because what flies off the case comes off so fast that the velocity might be too much for coauditor or lowerlevel auditor these processes handle the nocasegain case they were developed to handle cases that lrh had formerly handled with justice and ethics these are the new conditions processes which could be run at any point on case and which have an exact endpoint beyond which they wont run further below the conditions processes is existence processing an existence process is one in which person recognizes something about existence mimicry gets at this sideways having these processes makes it hard to write new public book because they should be included in the discussion but not enough is known about them yet to write about them since the new membership pricing system was created based on the idea of having new public book the pricing is premature which backs it up on the orgs we will get the orgs to back up and get their organization and signup line well in hand look around here and find something really real to you is process at the existence level it was wildcat process from upperlevel tech that belongs at or towards the bottom you get person to find one thing that is really real in the room basic undercutting command might be are you something like that its familiarity without contact or communication and without an awareness of what familiarity is arriving you get the shutoff because as youve gone south youve dropped orientation youve dropped perception communication conditions and youre now in existence that existence must be without any of the other thingsso what is this level called existence how would you audit something without understanding orientation perception communication or the recognition of condition what do we have left we dont know but we will the new organizational plan is going in faster than it has been released you cant keep an org out of it despite its current incompleteness it is big magnet that is trying to take existing departments and put them on it it is unique and it works because it is parallelline org board not vertical org board it operates left and right not up and down one odd characteristic is that each repeating department as you go across the board from left to right has nothing to do with the functions that follow it but includes all of the functions which precede it just try to squeeze into department comfortably some action which follows it on the board to the right you get trouble try to get into the orientation department something about understanding well that has its own departmental functions but the next one to the right is purposes now lets put purposes under understanding in other words were going to have purposes before we have understanding you get mess organizationally or in auditing eg if you try to put something about promotion under understanding why people just sit around and understand that there should be some promotionit was working with the org board that brought to light the lower subzero levels because the org board is not an org board at all its philosophic machine to which an organization is easily adapted its an alldevouring monster anything that comes near it gets changed for the better it gives answers to questions that we have had trouble with before like personnel an ad is kept placed people come in they get hired they work for two weeks with staff hat they go to review etc it all gets done without having to go through any executive an applicant who calls up for job gets call two days later saying come on in he gets metercheck for ta then he is routed through fp to his place of work for two week temporary assignment at the end of which he goes to review and is either kept on or told that he needs more training for the job even if review boots him out he remains an applicant needing some more preparation before he can have the job review also tells the labor exchange about him to see if he can get other employment right away review also has displaced person division to give him meal ticket get him on pe course or coaudit until he can function then he is hired on provisional basis for year review maintains file of these people for periods of crush labor the only way this whole system wont work is if you dont man up the posts this employment system is also great for procurement people come to work and stay to study thus anything that gets near the organization begins to move this new organizational structure improves things for the better whether people like it or not it has to be completed before we release the field staff member program which will give backup to field auditors private practice mds must be wrong since it is failing it takes quite team to process pcs it is possible to process pcs in an organization but not in individual practice suppose you had dissemination technology that would make it so anyone you talked to would immediately become scientologist it exists it is only two or three weeks old not yet released the person who resists and protests it is the easiest to get and if fsms are sending in all sorts of cases even very lowlevel cases the organization must be able to handle them right off the bat all auditors that were ever trained are now to be called fsms the pay is ten percent of the fee of the person you send in center is nucleus of an organization if it moves even vaguely in the direction of an org board it will wind up becoming an organization so fast it wont know what happened there is policy that you cant be retrained for level that you have already obtained this goes along with the policy that checksheet cant be changed once you are on it there are at least twelve levels above level vi and st hill will be teaching thosehubbard communications office saint hill manor east

assn secs take notice the advent of levels and their final forms now being released bring us into new phase in auditing you longer have to audit the pc in front of you but need now only audit with the process next in line level processes must be audited in sequence in the level itself levels must be audited in sequence therefore all that is required of the auditor is to do good technical job of auditing avoiding q and and alteris like the plague your comm course and upper indoc trs and your meter drills from the book of meter drills are now the only drills permitted only alteris of routine auditing can cause case failure directors of processing mustmustmust be alert for departures from standard level processing and stamp it out quickly if they do not do so they will have case trouble the levels are designed for all cases from psycho to ot it now does not matter what condition case is in you just start at the lowest process of the lowest level on all cases begun flatten that go to the next process of the level flatten that when all processes of that level are flat the pc is examined and given grade certificate for the level completed and may go to the next level and the first process of that level is flattened and so on even the book of case remedies is handled at its own place in its own level and is not used below or above that place our technical reach is now so effective that you need analysis of the case you just run the levels you do not estimate pcs level you ask for his grade certificate and if he hasnt one just start at the lowest level skip any level already run and do on up youll not only catch all cases you will get maximum ta on each pc in that fashion one must not skip around within the level or amongst levelsscrewy application such as giving the first command of an alternate command process and then getting the ta out of the second command or any departure from good old standard auditing must be jumped all over hard rewording process given in the levels can be catastrophic its worded that way for reason clear the command well with the pc but never vary the given wording these actions with the new levels will be found magical directors of processing must not tolerate any slightest goof any q and any variation of any kind whatever and must be very severe with anyone who messes these processes up they are violently strong processes from bottom to top and they must be handled with exact duplication and skill in academies this injunction is particularly urgent standard student auditing can work wonders with these processes unless an instructor advises or permits alteris the processes developed are too powerful to admit of goofs and departures and unusual solutions if anyone reports it didnt work you had better get in there fast as that auditor really goofed and didnt run the process the way it was given in the hco b the most banal routine grind auditing will produce results splendidly the flighty undisciplined q and aed alterised fooling about will rapidly ditch the pc i am putting strong tools in your hands dont play about with them they might explode on you give them the respect they deserve and every case will come up bright and progress rapidly something new is here just follow the new map even dully and the pc will arrive louse it up and it will get awful all auditors at higher meter class run all lower level processes with meter providing only that they can get the pc to hold the cans for meter classed auditor there are unmetered processes except ones like 8c and even then the pc is checked on meter it does not matter how low on the levels an auditor begins to use meter as student just dont ask him to do much with it until the training level calls for meter training ds of t and ds of p and examiners must be very careful of false reports in case folders regarding what was run they should regard an illegible report as report they must also be alert for false attestations concerning grade requests for pc and for training check sheet completion it is false attestation to declare an incomplete grade or check sheet complete or done when it is not new ethics policies are levelled primarily at making auditing and training honest and flawless i can give you all the processes it is however necessary that they be honestly run and honestly reported only in that way can you make releases and clearsthe renumbering of levels and grades will be released in auditor 8 they make it easier to audit and train the materials for each level will shortly be released in hco bs from academies and courses i want auditors who are trained not to alteris technical materials in hgcs i want auditing exactly by the book its easier to do training and processing that way and you will get all the results you could ever usebut only if its by the book unaltered in application it will be the easiest auditing you ever did l ron hubbard lrh mlrd copyright 1965 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6504c27 shspec59 awareness levels lrh makes several observations on recent organizational outpoints wherever the public impinges on the organization it enturbulates and erodes it is the public that is in confusion we are putting the stable datum of an organization or scientologist into the middle of the confusion an individual cannot stand alone against the public in the midst of this confusion he will get knocked appetiteovertincup by the public unless backed up by the organization every scientologist and org in the world is connected with the suppressive thing called the society so they would skid if left by themselves you are dealing with psychotic society there are thirtytwo levels below 0 and the average public is at least fifteen levels below 0and neurosis starts at ten levels below 0 it goes only few levels down then becomes psychosis psychosis is an inability to observe and thats your public last year when lrh first had total reality on the exact character of the reactive mind on exactly how it was there and exactly what it was calculated to make an individual do he was shocked knowing that shock is an indication that there is something wrong with what he is shocked with he went over the structure of the bank suppressed challenged and arc broke it the shock was not actually with the reactive bank but with the pretenses that had been made about the character of man i havent cognited heavily for ages lrh cant get his own ta up masses affect his body but not him here is some more data that lrh has found on the subject of clear clears time track is gone so the eidetic memory talked about in book one is there only if he puts it there clear recalls not with pictures but by knowing pictures are completely unnecessary for any kind of recall at all this is probably the only change theres been from the definition of book one clear there are also energy phenomena mentioned several years after book one like heating things up by looking at them clear can make something warm by staring at it as person goes on up he takes both the new abilities and the lost disabilities for granted the negative gain is gain by absence and the positive gain is regaining his natural abilities after all so he may not notice the change unless he mocks up what was wrong with him last week so dont expect your pc always to be telling you what wonderful auditor you are that is bank phenomenon that will destimulate in three to ten days the persons increased awareness may not be all pleasant he can look at some dynamic or sphere of existence and see it clearly with shock the common denominator of behavior is degree of awareness that is what is held in common by all life there is such thing as being aware or not aware it is all degrees of awareness gradient like all the scales the difference between person and person b is degree of awareness or awareness of different things there are certain things of which one would become aware in order to get or as one got case advance if you skip one or two or three of those you cant become aware of this higher one lrh plotted the scale of awareness to get the bridge down to homo sapiens not having noticed the gap that he had created between himself and the lowlevel pc that is how he got thirtytwo levels of awareness below level 0 he suddenly found himself looking at the human race and it was horrible shock it felt weird he got over it in about twentyfour hours realizing that if you could deal with the average public pc you could process dog you are at least ten or twelve levels below communication with the average public pc the problem is how do you process when you dont have comm line another problem is that as someone comes up in awareness he goes through antisocial bands as well as inoffensive ones there are bands amongst them that are passive and propitiative these are resting places in which society doesnt worry about you ie it doesnt try to suppress you these lower levels are jammed together and it is bit hard to tell the order down near the bottom the awareness scale measures what person could become aware of if you find person anyplace on the awarenessscale then the next action which you have to do to give him case gain is to make him aware of the next level above that for instancesomeone below suffering might have case gain by being made to suffer you wouldnt necessarily process him up to this awareness the lowest type of process you would use is mimicry he would be aware that he was doing it because you were doing it awareness is always matter of increasing perimeter of reality you get concentric circles of awareness for instance psycho is only aware out to his fist beyond that is delusion awareness can invert and increase into delusion which puzzles you since the person seems to be getting nuttier delusion is inverted awareness youve got to increase his awareness in the direction of sanity or reality process in the direction of something real person who is improving gets more and more aware of what is going on inside wider and wider perimeter you could get guy aware of wall two feet in front of his face and it could be vast improvement you can do this with 8c increasing the distance to the wall when the pc touches it communication begins to come in you can have action without awareness ie you can have the situation where what the individual is aware of and what he is doing are not the same thing ever hence you get longterm headaches therefore the observation of conduct will not diagnose person unless you have little secret awareness scale of your own in other words youd have to know the secret of what the mest universe dictates as gradient scale of awareness observation of conduct will not lead to solution of the situation and man falls down in thinks that it will the field of psychology etc being entirely based on observation and labelling of conduct comes up with inaccurate diagnoses and messedup solutions you cant watch patient and decide that he is gymnastico potico and firebug who is compulsively attracted to water on that account the reason this girl keeps going to the water fountain is because she is thirsty she may be stuck in french foreign legion engram in the sahara therefore the remedy might have nothing to do with water fire etc the moment you grasp this principle you get the stable datum dont draw and conclusions from conduct all unexpected conduct tells you is that you dont know about something but that is something to know labelling is bad science and leads to solution all science is is the discovery that or all science had to find out to become science is that when something isnt working you havent got the answer this explains the advance of the physical sciences the mental sciences got parked by substituting authoritarian statements for searching for workable answer if as an auditor you base what you do on what the pc is doing you will go nuts too for instance if the pc is nattering and the auditor agrees with the natter and takes the pcs data as truth nothing happens conduct can be used only as an indicator that since the pc is behaving in some way that you didnt expect there is something about him that you didnt know that you can ask the pc regardless of whether it is missed withhold or not what dont i know about you will resolve the situation labelling it wont never just label conduct that you dont understand know that you dont know what is going on and find out also consider what the pc can find out about himself the nuttier someone is the harder he is to handle he is less aware and you are less aware of what you dont know about him also the nuttier the pc is the harder it is to get his attention so that you can find out what he is aware of and what is going on and what you dont know the dont knows are fabulous you have to push to get the person to become aware enough to get him high enough on the awareness scale so that you can find out enough so you can find out what you dont know about the person the game would be what can i find out about this person and what can he find out about himself by increasing that awareness scale the person will get saner and saner more and more aware more and more himself he can hit dynamic situations which he becomes aware of with shock you have to eat humble pie to begin this subject at all you have to know that there is something in the universe you dont know and that for person who is way down scale is the most dangerous utterance that he could possibly make he is so totally sealed off from things that if everyone realized how blind he was he thinks theyd just eat him up so he compensates for his unawareness by automatic mechanisms of pretense he lacks the courage to say well i dont know anything about that and yet he cant resolve anysituation until he says well whaddya know ive got an area where i dont know therefore when you see somebody behaving oddly the only thing you know is that theres something youre certainly unaware of and that he is probably unaware that he is unaware of hell cover that up with pretended awareness which doesnt exist ie delusion having gone through despair on the subject person can come up to realization that there is something you can know about anything you confront you can know that you dont know and that is the first thing you should know about it now you can take the action necessary to find out and in the process of finding out the whole thing will clarify the amazing thing about aberration is that if you did find out about something eg the internal government of russia it would either go clear or collapse just finding out what situation is asises that situation running an engram out of an organization or an individual is just continuing to pull into view what people didnt know about the individual or organization the only way in which you could fail to pull something into view is to suppose that you knew all there was to know about it and that there was nothing more to learn clear has become broadly aware of where he is unaware when he spots something like this he decides that 1 he should find out or 2 it doesnt make any difference you can decide whether it is worth finding out and if you do start finding out it will collapsehubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco policy letter of 5 may 1965 reissued 4 july 1970 remimeo classification gradation and awareness chart you will find chart enclosed in the auditor issue 8 it covers many things there are about 52 levels of awareness from unexistence up to the state of clear by level of awareness is meant that of which being is aware being who is at level on this scale is aware only of that level and the others below it to get case gain such person must become aware of the level next above him and so on up in orderly sequence level by level if you skip person on one level several levels up he or she will experience only an unreality and will not react this is expressed as nocasegain on the emeter it registers as tone arm action meaning there is meter registry of change on the meter control lever tone arm person audited bit below or at his level of awareness gets tone arm action case gain and has cognitions new concepts of life principal contribution of scientology is the technology necessary to change people so that they progress into higher states of ability when processed on the exact processes required by an auditor qualified by training to apply the processes expertly it is not only general ability that increases but iq renewed livingness and the skill and ability to better self and conditions the state of homo sapiens runs from around 4 down to the bottom normal is probably much lower as you study the chart you will see it is road map upward on the left we see the class of the auditor necessary to take the person up as well as the grade the preclear reaches in the next column we see his certificate name obtained through his training at an academy and later saint hill then we see very general description of the processes used on that grade the next column shows what pcs classified auditor can audit he can audit anyone at his class numeral or below he cannot audit pcs higher because of course he has not been trained to do so and is likely to have upset pcs the final column shows where the certificate and class is obtainedthe bridge this is the famous bridge mentioned at the end of dianetics the modern science of mental health it is now complete and is functioning the being enters it from somewhere in the minus regions as beginning scientologist and moves on up at about grade ii he has definitely reached homo novis he becomes release somewhere between ii and v and he becomes clear at the top of vi the state of operating thetan is attained above vi and is grade vii for man to have this at all is quite remarkable he never had it before since we find him improving but still on the average well below 4 by following this chart one can make release and then clear up to grade v one of course has help but above that technical limitations bar completely the idea of coauditing some auditors will attempt it themselves very far from there case wise and some have tried to show untrained pcs how to solo audit with meter the common result is that the pcs eventually collapse in total overwhelm as they are not trained to handle such forces and so it is cruel thing to do the preclear moves safely on the proper bridge and somewhere along the line must be trained in the classifications that match his grade then and only then can he make it all the way one can be audited quite ways then he had better get trained from zero on up you see here some new certificates these were made necessary by the gap which existed between the highertoned public person 5 and the beginning of the span we had to have longer approach on the bridge and so we put certificate ladder there beginning scientologist is given for pe and so on up as the chart shows the class material has not been changed if anyone has class zero he is still class zero but we will give him new certificate to replace his old one and so on there is change in grades and certificates from class ii up class v has been blank for years thus there is proper certificate there the hubbard validated auditor it says this auditor has been through review of all his lower skills plus new ones and can jump off now for solo and clear previously we not only did not reach into the average homo sapiens awareness but we also had means of touching cases much below 4 you are probably intrigued by class vii these power processes are what the clear or auditor almost there audits on low level pcs auditors below that case level can of course run them bit but the processes shortly cave him in these processes are only available at saint hill as they have just recently been perfected and an auditor to do them without danger to himself or the pc has to have interned at saint hill as saint hill hgc staff auditor not the same as class vi saint hiller the thing to do is start in your local academy at zero on the chart and move on up today that is faster and less expensive than you would think there are two courses to one class first one does the certificate course theory and gets his certificate this takes the average student about two weeks then one takes the classification course practical for that class and gets his provisional classification everyauditor must be classified now this again takes the average student about two weeks all the courses from class 0 up to iv are arranged that waythe material has been streamlined class v obtained at saint hill is longer and remains the same price as always as it reviews all the classes and retrains where necessary and awards permanent classification for all the lower certificates as well as class v some auditing occurs in the classification course and group auditing occurs daily an unclassed auditor cannot charge fee for auditing grade he is not classed for and if he is turned in to hco because of it the pc can regain all the fee from him we must make it safe bridge our entire ethics system is formed just to make it safe passage for the pc and to hold the bridge together so it can be crossed by man auditors routinely make releases with academy courses today auditors graduated from the saint hill course can then take the final steps to make themselves clear and saint hill interns are trained to make releases of the lowest cases training fees are uniform in the us now at 100 for each course in all commonwealth countries the cost is 28 course sterling convert to local currency there is one course for certificate followed by another for classification field auditors can charge anything they like for has and beginning scientologist courses and hubbard book auditors can become hqs through extension courses your org may possibly give the lowest course free and charge very little for the has my job is to give you the materials to make releases and the skill to make clear i have done and will do everything i can to help anyone attain these hitherto unreachable heights of life and ability the bridge is not only in it is functioning every hour right now book early the traffic is heavy already and auditors are the scarcest and most valued beings on this planet l ron hubbard lrhntaap copyright 1965 1970 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6505c11 shspec60 arc breaks and ptps the differentiation releases are being made with power processing with lrh d of ping and msh csing it is getting very routine to get keyedout clears in under fifty hours we know that we can audit anybody 34 awareness levels below level 0 note at this time the awareness scale was apparently in its present 1976 form the bulletins covering the power processes are too simple to be anything but confidential the processes are too pure and simple to be generally released they require both great deal of training and high case level therefore power is to be made confidential power processes can only be audited in organizations there is not enough control or sense among people like homer and berner to do it in the field the idea of running endwords on raw meat it just overwhelms the pc and is tough to straighten out clay table processes have been taken out of the processing lineup when people process raw meat with the clay table they neglect one thing rather uniformly getting the questions answered only few processes are left on students auditing checksheets the international situation has improved in the us the senate and house are attacking or are on the verge of attacking the fda in victoria the report on the inquiry is delayed it will doubtless fizzle out people probably thought lrh was exaggerating when he said that we were going to take the planet but he has always meant exactly that we are now just at the edge of dissemination as phase in the development of scientology having the minus0 awareness level scale is great help in dissemination the press will support you on need of change so you press this they will go along with this whatever the press says is protest revolutions are popular until you give them the change that is to be made into then they cool off the scale of awareness is scale of what person group or organization can be aware of it is new having the minus0 awareness level scale opens the door to bringing person right up the line to release on study alone because it has trick if you can locate what person is aware of on that scale you only have to tell him about the next level and he will become aware of that and experience case change therefore you can get case improvement by education dont confuse the level person is at with his conduct for instance someone dramatizing hysteria ie being hysterical isnt necessarily or even generally aware of hysteria therefore he isnt necessarily at the level of hysteria we do know that being must be aware and we mean analytically aware of something to be at that awareness level something someone is dramatizing is above where he is and is overwhelming him what he is aware of can be discovered he what he talks about or seems to be alert to there are lower levels than 34 below zero but power reaches to the bottom and gives release the two levels below level 34 unexistence are false causation 35 and reasonableness 36 these levels are below uncausing 32 the human race generally is near the bottom end of the scale person who is aware of being hysterical is pretty high toned relatively speaking you cant pull an overt off the person at uncausing there arent any it just happens what will be will be religions fail by being below perception of god the greatest arc break operation that has ever been pulled in the history of the human race the god who is everywhere with mass total generality total unlocatability total power total causation will you please please differentiate between arc breaks and ptps ninety percent of the pcs that you are doing arc break assessments on are in fact in ptps the arc break is usually after ptp unless it is flagrant case of bpc ptp is postulatecounterpostulate the pc is at war with something he is not just worrying about something he doesnt like he is agin something for instance husband has an argument with his wife one wants to go to the movies and the other doesnt this is war not an arc break but it could lead to an arc break on both sides running the arc break wouldnt help though it would runbut running the problem will help you could find the problem where you might not ever find the bpc so the sequence is 1 problem 2 overt 3 arc break if you clean up the bpc the case wont improve because the ptp is unhandled they wont necessarily even feel better you have to do something about the fractured postulate the condition of someone in ptp isnt arc broken its war postulatecounterpostulate adds up to war it would have done hitler good to have run him on an arc break he might have been on ptp though probably it would have required power processing to stop him though one commits intentional overts as solution to problem when you define an overt as solution to ptp you can solve any case when overts are defined as arc breaks they are closed to solution the resolution of the case is who have you been mean to process the pc at cause always person commits intentional overts for only one reason they are solutions to problems knowing this even lowlevel cases are open to solution but when you define an overt or series of overts as an arc break you close the case to solution because case is usually struggling along at low causelevel the question have you committed an overt will be hard for him to answer because he has never committed an overt because it was all vitally necessary and therefore totally justified you should ask the more penetrating question why is it so vitally necessary and why is it justified it is because there was problem requiring solution the solution being the overt what throws you is that the problem is so buried in the past that it is impossible to see the connection between the overts and the problem the problem is frequently on the past track often it has nothing to do with pt the person is still solving problem relating to an earlier relationship it is still pt to him hence it is still ptp to him if you trace it back you will find that it made sense somewhere earlier in screwy sort of way guy who is always smashing up his car might be solving problem with daddy who never let him use the car by making the car unuseable you look on lot of things as overts which are in actual fact vitally necessary solutions to urgent immediate problems of survival the only thing wrong with them is when you could ask guy when with finger snap and get say 1932 then you could ask what problem did you have in 1932 you will get many many manifestations but amongst them will not be disinterest if you told someone the right problem he would change his conduct having cognited that his solution was nuts these solutions are daffy because of droppedout time the solution is to an ancient problem which is gone leaving an overt to get the major problem on someones track may take power process but if the person has some fundamental problem in his life it has formed innumerable locks which have moved up to pt and they are the overts and withholds that he is dramatizing in pt if you are clever you can get at these locks you dont have to ask for overts if you ask for solutions to the problem the old process tell problemwhat solutions have you had modified to what solutions have you put into effect to solve that problem could be reworded as how have you attempted to solve that problem so you can just use tell problem what solutions did you put into effect to solve this problem this would give you ow or you could use what have you done to solve that problem how have you attempted to solve that problem orwhat would solve the problem or what action of yours was solution to the problem some such process would get the overts off any action the person took to solve the problem was to some degree an overt because it was against another postulate an arc break is charge that has been restimulated on the back track which hasnt moved into full consciousness and therefore hasnt been identified the pc avoids the area an arc break is bpc and hasnt anything to do with solutions to problems guy who is failing to complete comm cycle because somebody wont acknowledge it only has really the bpc of missed withhold an inadvertent missed withhold missed withhold can be inadvertent not intended it looks and feels much like an actual missed withhold if you wont acknowledge the fact that the pc has answered the question you bypass the charge of his answer but the better part of it is that you have given him problem since he intended to answer it this is ptp by definition he is trying to solve it by force then he arc breaks but that is secondary it will solve rapidly by asking what problem have you had in auditing especially on pc who has been roughed up by not being acknowledged eventually the pc would give you the problem of getting someone to listen to then to get the pcs overts on auditors ask then how did you go about solving it you get string of overts by getting ptps for instance what problem have you had with about auditing well very often you didnt seem to listen to well how did you handle solve this i stopped telling you right answers so the pc has an arc break ptp and missed withhold you can be misled by the bpc and the fact that yes there is an arc break but the arc break isnt fully cleanupable unless you find the problem that it is based on if you clean up the problem and the problems that the pc has had in his auditing whole string of arc breaks and whole string of overts will blow this is the case because awareness of problems is way south below minus thirtyfour cause overts is way north so if you try to pull problems directly with ow the pc would already have to be so hightoned that it wouldnt have any effect on him if you did pull the problems you can discuss problems with anybody it seems to be the case that where there is life there are problems where are arc breaks and bpc of course to get an arc break just throw an endword into restimulation get total generality hitting the person outside his awareness and you will see an arc break on the generality of it the whole bank is the most total generality that one can state that is still the truth when generality in the bank is restimulated the person cannot identify the threat and he feels terrible not knowing this is true arc break the pc cannot locate the source of this horrible feeling it isnt because he is sick to his stomach it is that he doesnt know why he is sick to his stomach if you give someone wrong item off gpm he will go from tone 40 to tone 40 so fast that he looks like dive bomber that is an arc break but someone who is arc broken with an instructor really has problem and some overts which were solutions auditors can get stuck in the win of successful arc break assessments and do them on people who really have ptps they will get loses that way problems are far more common than real arc breaks an experimental nontherapeutic but very educational process is invent problem you will see black masses show up as the pcs bank collapses on him if you ran invent asolution and the solutions that the pc gave you were all really invented solutions the mass would also move in but if you ran think of or recall problemsolution the mass would move off you could do think of problem invent solution and the mass will move in any totally new inventedness tends to collapse the bank if you started knocking out bunch of wholetrack problems you would find the mass going away similarly with wholetrack solutions the nearfar action of it is very interesting this makes problems of comparable magnitude able to bring mass in if you are really inventing which is hard to do the main message is that you can move mental masses around with the idea of problems and solutions why because of the basic definitions of problems and solutions solution is an effort to bat problem away which usually fails the problem being postulatecounterpostulate puts the opposite postulate across from you in hurry when you think of it persons problem is thought of as mass he calls ptp it because it is an it to him mental mass that he tries to bat away postulatecounterpostulate gives you mass so whether he sees it or not when person gets problem showing up he gets mass showing up and whether he realizes it or not the thing he tries to do about it is to do something about it to move it away from him but his effort will move it closer to him so hes in situation when he has problem that he has to do something about something to get rid of the something which is moving in on him this phenomenon of mass moving in happens in life too the pc normally responds by trying to do something to it to push it away but that effort will move it closer to him the guy has huge fundamental problem you get it and ask well all right is that your problem and he will say well really the problem was something else you ask the same question again and he says my problem was so and so and so the pc denies each problem as he asises it they are asising in the course of getting down to the main problem sometimes you have problem of missingness there is nothing there to confront this leads to where is it this kind of problem fringes into generality and borders on the arc break this is where the problem fringes on an arc break that is why problems and arc breaks appear to be cousins its gone and where can i find it are borderline to the arc break so it is easy to confuse them but failures to solve arc breaks should have clued you in to the fact that there is something else wrong fifty percent of the reactive bank is devoted to the compulsion to make reactive bank on every process except r6 you should ask about problems not arc breaks unless you realize that you have goofed in the comm cycle in that case lrh would ask about specific parts of the formula not do long list you dont have overts in the absence of problem the problem may be gone but the solutions are still forthcoming you can run responsibility on problems problems and solutions and any number of things the basic mechanism of the mind is that it needs problem situation to lock up time nothing else can stop person on the time track for instance world war ii is still being fought in literature it was problem with lot of solutions and civilization is to large degree still stuck in it as witness the sunday supplements tv programs etc night club could be mocked up like an air raid shelter and make fortune world war ii was postulatecounter postulate that is still more real to people than pt any point of the time track where civilization is stuck is seen as more real than any new period it is the same with pcs if your pc isnt paying close attention you can assume that the pc is stuck somewhere in back time you can get his attention by finding out where he is locked in time and entering that prior time period if you trigger the back time period you will find yourself there with him you get the pcs overts by going after problems but if he is below causation he wont recognize them as overts because they are necessary solutions just ask for the problemhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco policy letter of 17 may 1965 remimeo tech div qual div urgent cchs

1may65 iii organization the design of the organization and the policy letters on staff status pp vivii in oec vol 1 staff status policy letters have been issued on the new org board we will remedy an old evil by putting after the persons name his certification and classification as an auditor his grade as pc and his staff status in the past in trying to appoint someone at distance lrh had trouble knowing who was there now copies of org boards will be exchanged between orgs and it will be easy in filling posts to see who is qualified for promotion to be staff member in tech one needs to have technical certificate that covers basics of the organization an admin terminal needs basic cert on the org then he is qualified as provisional staff status i they can be transferred without permission staff status ii is general staff member this individual has worked for and attained solid position from there on it goes up to incharge head of subsection this is the lowest exec rating an officer is in charge of section for instance the cramming officer is in charge of the cramming section then there are titles that are not associated with rank or status eg communicator post can also have deputies post assigned locally is deputy one assigned from st hill would be acting for awhile then the acting prefix is removed and the person has full status acting or deputy do not refer to rank they refer to permanency deputy is somebody who is in there temporarily small breath of air could dislodge him acting denotes st hill appointment after short time up to year the acting prefix is dropped then the person becomes the title without the prefix deputy hco exec sec is someone holding the post until confirmed it is not at all permanent acting hco exec sec is st hill appointment and therefore official to be an acting the person would have to have the appropriate staff status for the post this is not true of deputy but deputy doesnt draw the pay of an acting you put person on post to see how they do you cant wait to fill posts for someone with the proper staff status so we have the deputy rating this appointment must be confirmed by st hill to get an acting rating and full pay acting applies until person knows his hat cold and can apply it policy letters are pouring out covering everything from organizational theory to nitpicky details of minor hats ethics is there to hold the lines and to get technology in ie to make it possible for tech to go in that is its sole purpose and it is fabulously successful in fulfilling that purpose ethics is the tourniquet before the doctor arrives its purpose is to quiet the turbulence down long enough to allow the auditor to come in you carry ethics in until you get tech in it has looked like the publication of someone as an sp has the same effect as public hanging cancelling someones certs has the effect of getting him back in all straightened up within two to two and half years not cancelling the certs results in his going off into the wilds and never showing up again peter crundall for example had his certs cancelled five or six years ago when he was screaming and howling about something he had to get 500 hours of auditing at his own expense now he is being the featured lecturer at an org it took about two years for him to get his auditing started and he got it all handled so it is an unkind thing to do not to bring order into scientology area man has tremendous reaction to justice the purpose of ethics is to get in tech but mans law and mans justice is not like that man wants to squash people who get in his way his justice has end product save punishment it does not straighten out the community therefore it doesnt work police forces have bad morale because there is end product of penal action people know this and react against it and some on an aaa basis will react against ethics in scientology the same way you jar peoples banks when you present the idea of ethics be that as it may greater proportion of people in scientology today favor decent ethics system than are batting back at it this is because they see that good ethics system willgive them better training processing and better grip of on scientology you cant sentence someone to technology or to getting better you can sentence him to not getting better one is forcing us to help people if someone keeps getting in the way it is pretty normal to stop wanting to assist him if you feel like blowing up organizations you should very carefully look up the justice actions of organizations and huge governments etc and compare these things if you do this you find some astonishing data the taut ship the viciously conducted regiment the harshly run empire all these survive and flourish with high esprit corps almost forever the sloppy ones succumb rapidly lrh got interested in this phenomenon while reading gibbons decline and fall of the roman empire the only long periods of progressive rule recovery from barbarian attacks and freedom from internal upsets were periods when the emperor was nut the good emperors got killed within few months this didnt jibe with lrhs experience in handling discipline on ship he realized that what works for small intimate group to keep the peace is different from what is needed for big group which gets lots of confusion in an org the points of enturbulation are the ones where the public impinges eg the line of getting the pc from the reg to the d of p this line keeps going out lrh used to wonder if there was something wrong with us to allow us to get enturbulated in this way then he looked at society in general and saw how much worse off their condition is society is deteriorating we are gradiently doing better and better as we expand we reach straight out into the tumult of society we had to have tools to extend our reach so that we could get our jobs done in time lrh found that as people moved up towards ot certain disdain occurred he saw that ethics would be necessary so that ots would take orderly bites out of people when they got annoyed by the disaster to that extent there is need for an ethics system because sufficiently powerful being annoyed at something is liable to straighten it up with such thoroughness that hardly anybody would ever recover and unless they have some orderly method of straightening things up they will straighten things up in their own way and it will make hell of mess the laws of ethics need to be known and understood they need to be predictable they cannot be capricious the question is are you for just shooting somebody down without warning or do you want ethics do you want law that just freakishly strikes down everybody in sight or do you want the kind of law that says here is the path narrow as it may seem in acting on these lines we have ethics rattling around in the orgs people are getting used to the tools you can give someone shock with heavy use of ethics it can be very effective used lightly used in this way ethics backs up tech most amazingly lrh has just discovered the pts case its cause and handling never audit pts the rollercoaster case is one that we have never been able to handle before he is connected to an sp and until ethics makes him disconnect or handle the sp he will continue to rollercoaster ethics can label the suppressive if nothing else you give the pts case the policy letter covering ptsness you dont have to issue an ethics order unless tech doesnt go in ie unless he cant or wont handle or disconnect you can insist that pts bring the sp in if necessary for auditing if things went that far you could threaten the pts person with not getting the sp audited unless the pts person gets him in before he is labeled an sp suppressives are pretty crazy the sp has got to fight he is back on the track fighting the ugbugs he is in an old ptp he is taking the actions in pt that would solve the problem with the ugbugs he is back on the track fighting an enemy that longer exists 99999999999 of his attention units are at some exact precise past period of the track and in that instant he is fighting off something and is trying to handle something by some means which are the ones he is using in pt he has problems with you and vice versa he isnt up there with you and you arent back there with him thats the whole anatomy of psychosis given associative restimulators and aaa youve got maddog type hes just defending himself in some mad insanity against things which are longer there hence the use of power processes on psychotics you can assume that the sp has problems in pt but those are not the problem that he wants to solve that problem is on the back track and it is loaded with crossassociations and identifications he misidentifies anyone whoapproaches or tries to help him in an effort to defend himself he is driven down to the first dynamic to such degree that one must get any better when he is driven down into the first dynamic he must destroy all around him one must get any better because they are the flying saucer people once scientology is known to be an effective way to help people watch out international city is being looked at by group connected to the we are having an effect the true antiscientologist isnt trying to be convinced he is trying to stop you you are the green alligator he is fighting 7000 years ago and if you or anyone else they are all the green alligator got any better you would be stronger and that would tear it and you would eat him up he thinks insanity is just total stuckness on the track in fight this is point that you prove instantly and utterly when you are running power class vii processes on someone power handles the sp and the insane the sp can be processed to sanity in under fifty hours but you had better have the organization and the ethics to hold things together you have to label ptss and sps to get the tech in an ethics action lasts until tech is in you use english to get tech in you stop it when youve got tech in even if stopping at that point leaves unfinished cycles of action along the way its not question of where does the ethics proceed its how long do you have to hold the area down an organization will run as long as it has channels and as long as particles on the channels dont carom off the sides of the channels and collide with the working parts of the organization if you can bring that about you can have an organization that would have total capability of pouring through it practically the whole of the human race lacking clean and definite flow channels your volume stays small because of all the barriers and stoppages that occur if the channel isnt kept open you cant handle the load scientology is probably the only outfit that ever hit this planet that meant exactly what it said and was doing exactly what it was doing and what it said it was doing and was doing exactly nothing else scientology doesnt have the time to do half the things that it has been accused of an sp saying i never said that believes that he really didnt and he is right in sense how the hell could he say anything he hasnt been there for seven trillion years im sure that many enthetaish people believe that weve gone stark staring mad with all this justice were just having little fun with justice just now and when we learn about it why well be able to control fairly well wide sphere of public in such way that they dont all get destroyed the main danger to them is not ethics its having their silly heads blown off because they make somebody mad youve got to have ethics in to handle nonscientologists if you put discipline in right at the start you can work very nicely with nonscientologists make sure that they know what ethics is how it works etc society is losing its grip we are putting in order to make an orderly show for the future6505c25 shspec62 the five conditions if it isnt written it isnt true is laid down so that rumors and verbal orders dont foul things up condition is an operating state each condition has formula that must be applied in order to change the state for the better dont misapply formulas if you know the conditions and their formulas you blow lot of the mystery that the rest of the world is sitting in emergency emergency is the most common state on this planet it is the condition of stats going the wrong way usually down over some significant period for instance it is declared by down stat for four consecutive weeks if stat that should go up goes down or vice versa youve got emergency the condition has to be declared by secretarial executive directive which is causative order certain steps then have to be done the first action is promote if an organization or produce if an individual when this has been done but not before economize dont economize on promoting if you do you inhibit getting out anything in order to produce enough money to raise the stat if this happens you will find yourself smaller and weaker after recovering from the crisis taxation is page out of das kapital from each according to his ability to pay to each according to his need dont economize until after you have promoted or produced if an artist in need of money economized first on materials he would have little or nothing to draw with therefore he would have little to sell so he would have trouble getting out of the financial hole after promotion is well in hand economize and prepare to deliver if you apply the affluence formula and economize when you are in emergency you will either stay in emergency or if you recover the organization will be smaller and of less scope also part of the emergency formula is to change your operating basis or you will head back into another condition of emergency youve got to stiffen discipline you have to stop going down to the pub every night do your homework be little more regular on the job work little harder dont goof quite so much if the activity does not come out of the condition of emergency after that state has been assigned then you have to use discipline because life itself is going to discipline the individual very cruelly cog that is why protecting person from the consequences of his actions is outethics you should give the person consequence beforehand that parallels life but anticipates it if the steps of emergency are not taken successfully even if they are taken and the condition of emergency is prolonged it has to walk forward into an ethics matter because someone must be sitting on most of the comm lines goofing like crazy there must be some ethical problem involved for the condition to be continuing normal operation this is the next condition up from emergency it isnt stable unchanging state because everything in the mest universe either expands or contracts nothing stays really unchanging there are laws against it so in order for normal operation to be stable state it must be continual small increase there must be gradual routine increase the way you maintain small increase is to just let everything continue dont change anything dont put in any harsh discipline ethics and justice is mild and reasonable carefully observe every slightest rise of statistic to see what bettered it and do that for every slight worsening find out why usually it is something nonstandard remedy it jockey change and repair back and forth keep an oic board this keeps your improving statistics going upa statistic that stays level isnt normal operation its emergency because one should be expanding if only to keep up with inflation the stat must keep pace with the world around it for instance salary that doesnt rise over two to three years is stable really down statistic and will tend to crash what looks level is really declining if one then economizes which is the affluence formula then you will really be in an emergency continuing this practice will result in collapse sooner or later matter and everything else in this universe obeys these laws or conditions the roman empire went into affluence brought about bv julius caesar but it violated the affluence formula they didnt deliver and they didnt economize instead they squandered the wealth of the empire on socalled conquest they treated the condition as normal julius caesar violated the commercial pax romana normal op which was stable by going off conquering tribes etc britain was trading with rome very happily then caesar came over and fought added britain to the empire gave them slavery not civilization and the empire collapsed in the year 0 ad or 1 ad the chinese conquered russia in siberia driving people west wave of displacement took place with the russians driving eastern european peoples into western europe rome didnt handle them it didnt resettle them or whatever they had boundaries to defend so they resisted the barbarian invasions and got overwhelmed it was all matter of the wrong condition being applied the russians who were in emergency didnt apply that condition either there is such thing as nocondition state state of emergency persists until it is handled even if one loses one gets stuck in the incident and goes on even after something has gone down to collapse it persists the condition continues all the way down even beyond death the dwindling spiral is really just applying the wrong formula for the condition affluence the condition of affluence is one which is dangerous surprisingly enough for instance gambler who hits it big is in danger of getting himself in debt instantly the first thing to do now is economize you must economize first then make very sure that you dont buy anything with any future commitment to it eg installment purchases dont hire anybody with any future commitments that is all part of that economizing clamp it down find every bill and debt you can pay and pay them now invest the remainder in service facilities make it more possible to deliver discover what caused the condition of affluence and strengthen it conduct research to discover what caused it it is something you are doing doubt power and power change the condition above affluence is power change for instance someone is very successful and gets promotion the correct formula is usually violated the new man errs by changing things the formula for power change is just because power has changed dont change anything new broom sweeps clean violates this formula if the operation was successful as it was running the new exec would be silly to change things but that is what people usually do it is easy to inherit successful hats just step in the boots and dont walk all the pressure points will come to you to make changes but the person before you must have resisted these successfully if your predecessor didnt sign it dont sign it dont do anything keep your eyes open learn the ropes see how the place is running apply normal operation to it if it is in normal op there are only two circumstances that need replacement success or disaster if it is successful there is nothing to change if someone can keep an organization doing well he is eventually promoted creditably and moves up to higher power position he would be leaving his organization or his post in condition of power if you move into the position of someone who left in disgrace so the place is in emergency just apply the emergency formulapromote for starters keep the promotion going until stats start to rise then economize like mad condition of power is most interesting it is peculiar in that it apparently belies what you would normally think or expect to do as an operating thetan because that is condition of power what you mustnt do is disconnect that will bring about catastrophe for you and for anyone else its the violation of that condition alone thats brought about implanting trapping and an antagonism towards thetans guy who becomes powerful on wall street and disconnects from his old home town friends exemplifies this they resent it people are in fact so used to the power formula being violated that they dont expect celebrities that they used to know to talk to them they think you are going to disconnect it is hard to get people to continue talking to you because they feel that you are superior you have to break down the communication barrier when you come back from saint hill people may be in awe of you somewhat again it is up to you to break down the comm barrier people will be sure that you dont want to be in comm anymore beings in the universe fully expect you to violate the power formula if an organization gets to the point where it is fully selfsufficient in need of pcs students etc and disconnects from those around it people in the community will start thinking about implants mistakes and violating any freedom thetan might have they will get very suppressive they are being denied service for one thing one of the most dangerous things we could do would be not to make what we know available when you move out of position on power change the only way you can disconnect is to take ownership and responsibility for your connections the condition of power change is fellow assuming position that has been held from power to disconnect you have to make record of all of your lines you show what is there so that the replacement can then see what not to change make record of your whole post or you will be stuck with piece of that post to the end of time also you might check in once in awhile to see how your replacement is doing guy gets time track by not taking

fifteen years we have always continued session that found the pc in trouble and i myself have audited pc for nine additional hours all night long in fact just to get the pc through newer auditors not trained in the stern school of running engrams must learn this all over again it doesnt matter whether the auditor has had policy on this or notone would think that common decency would be enoughas to leave pc in the middle of secondary or an engram and just coolly end the session is pretty cruel some do it because they are startled or afraid and rabbit run away by ending the session auditors who end process or change it when it has turned on heavy somatic are likewise ignorant what turns it on will turn it off this is the oldest rule in auditing of course people get into secondaries and engrams go through misemotion and heavy somatics this happens because things are running out to end off process or session because of the clock is to ignore the real purpose of auditing the oldest rules we have are get the pc through it b what turns it on will turn it off c the way out is the way through these now are expressed as policy falsified auditors report is also subject to court of ethics any auditor violating this policy letter is liable to an immediate court of ethics convened within 24 hours of the offence or as soon as is urgently possible auditing at all levels works well when it is done by the book the purpose of ethics is to open the way for and get in tech then we can do our job there is modern process that will not work when exactly appliedtherefore in the eyes of ethics all auditing failures are ethics failurespts suppressive persons as pcs or noncompliance with tech for auditors and the first offence an auditor can commit is ceasing to audit when he is most

upset at the beginning of the session or if the session did not start for the pc the latter being simply another indication of the pcs being upset or arc broken but these symptoms must be present as sometimes the session hasnt started merely because of poor tone 40 or because the pc had something he wanted to say before the auditor started the session running owif it is all right with you i am going to run short general process the process is what have you done what have you not done the process is run very permissively until the needle looks smooth and the pc is longer emotionally disturbed where are you now on the time track if it is all right with you i will continue this process until you are close to present time and then end this process after each command ask when that was the last command is there anything you would care to ask or say before i end this process end of process aud are you willing to talk to about your troubles what trouble arent you willing to talk to about wh since the last time i audited you have you done anything you are withholding if pc says yes what was it ptp do you have present time problem what is the problem start of process now i would like to run this process on you name it what would you say to that get pcs agreement if not obtainable choose another process unless old process is not complete middle rudiments in this session

all we are doing is developing systems to handle the public students and staff are colliding with ethics which has the benefit of giving them familiarity with it if you dont have system of law and order you will never have law and order you will just have cruelty duress suddenness revenge sudden acts of surprising retribution etc without uniform justice you would get chaos especially with ots in operation clausewitz said that war is means of bringing about more amenable frame of mind on the part of the enemy in his ignorance of this principle fdr kept world war ii going after germany and japan were ready to surrender by demanding unconditional surrender this was costly and stupid thing to do if you fail to halt war when more amenable frame of mind has been reached you are fool war should not go beyond that point this principle should be kept in mind by scientologists and orgs when under attack there are elements of the society that are at war with scientology because they are stuck in past incidents of fighting enemies you should take action against someone who is trying to keep you from doing your job but how much action just enough to being about more amenable frame of mind all you want to enforce on the entheta artist in the environment is certain degree of politeness dont get fixated on the entheta we want to bring service to the 80 who are doing well and contentedly since fixating on the 20 who are snarling and fuming takes attention from the 80 we should simply cut comm with the 20 once there is set procedure for handling sps once the executive can enforce little more politeness on his environment the exec can then reach because he has method of doing so now there is something he can do about it you want the auditor and the executive in frame of mind to service the 80 not the 20 execs tend to wind up with the entheta comm because they are supposed to handle it one tends to get fixated on the maybe cases the ones that arent running perfectly smoothly there are only two sources of difficulty with cases 1 the auditing comm cycle 2 pts you can make mistakes everywhere else and still get by of course there is also the gae as source of difficulty you can check out both the auditor to review to have his comm cycle checked out and the pc to ethics to see if he is pts the d of p doesnt get chance to talk in detail to the auditor and the pc this can be done in qual you dont just let the poor comm cycle continue hoping that it will get better if the auditor is uncooperative he goes to ethics until he has more amenable frame of mind in an exec cannot handle the isolated goofers he will get savage towards everybody if you cannot handle the criminal you pass suppressive laws that penalize everybody inspection before the fact governments police everybody because of the goofs of few most arbitrary rulings by any authority result from failures to handle the guy who goofed with subsequent desperation and savagery cf earlier statement by lrh that an organization is only necessary when there is failure to handle an individual pc who just wont run on average processing is pts or an sp inevitably and invariably lrh found that we couldnt handle the pts individual with auditing especially with processing below the level of power processing ptss are likely to come to you for help so you had better know that they need ethics or power processing anything else will make the pts individual rollercoaster because someone is arc breaking him faster than you can fix him up when you say that person has been suppressed by the environment faster than youcould process him out of it what you mean is that there is an sp in the environment who wrecks his gains the pts pc often doesnt spot the sp you must get the pts individual to ethics and find the sp suppressive persons commonly speak in total generalities they broaden and generalize entheta so their identity broadens and generalizes people commonly cant spot the sp because of the generality around him check the pts individual for who he is connected to that doesnt like scientology do this check on meter and watch it fall off the pin have the pt individual handle or disconnect if you get the wrong person the pc wont handle or disconnect if you are right he will the pts gives enough trouble so that you may not care to help him forther but when you do attempt to find the sp you should hunt and punch around enough to get good result if you find the right person as the sp the pcs face will light up the ta will blow down and the pc will then handle or disconnect with vgis ta case gain pts or sp trying to process pts will 1 raise his tone 2 thereby double the sps attacks on him 3 therefore cave him in worse than he was to begin with you can tell pts by looking for rollercoaster periodic gains and collapse gain ever or ta less than ten divs sp that is all you need to look for youve got to have ethics to handle this with this data you can make releases handle students cases free scientology center cases etc you dont have to slam the door in anybodys face the pts gets told to handle or disconnect before he gets more auditing the sp gets told that he has very rough case which can only be handled at st hill in couple of years well have auditors here who can handle you here you could say in the meantime stay away because its very restimulative to you this is true too it is an unkindness not to label someone suppressive who actually is an sp one way to handle someone who sends in entheta comm is simply to deadfile him you have to bring about more amenable frame of mind on his part before you audit him or comm with him dont let auditors go on flubbing send them to ethics so that they realize the importance of applying the tech right know also that we will have an impact on this society that organizations will fold up under the onslaught of the technology matter how nice and theetieweetie we are weve got to hold the line and give service while we expand we would like to have organizations smoothly reorganize to run power processing we need all the backup of the organizations ethics d of p and full admin there is one nastier than someone who has been dished by power processes by the way it would be disaster to have someone trying to run power in the field it isnt the d of ping or the auditing that is hard to do it is the fact that it needs to become an assembly line which requires high degree of perfection of organization even on lowerlevel processes it is best to have team to handle ptss sps and admin psychoanalysis had certain degree of workability it got across the idea that psychosomatic illness stems from the mind the mind monitors and dominates structure if the mind is left alone in large number of cases the endocrine treatment as in the time when lrh psychoanalyzed half of group of people who were taking male hormones and found that those he talked with responded better to the hormones than the others will not monitor structure but when you remove few psychic blocks all of sudden it bites and monitors structure you could change diet exercise operating environment anything and it would make difference lrh just used freudian analysis on that project what we would call today straightwire but as subject psychoanalysis has failed because the individual practitioner had way to ride herd on or handle the ptss and sps in his practice furthermore he had free time or attentionto do research he might have discovered power processing if he had the subject never grew because it never developed an organization that would carry forward the research our danger is only that as we move forward the technology will get shattered by alteris that must be guarded against then the technology must be applied now it collides with society psychiatry doctors etc you say all i want to do is go free ok you go into condition of power now the most serious thing you can do is to disconnect its the quickest way to bring about collapse you have been woven into the race and the universe too long to just suddenly pack it up you pack it up itll pack you up we have double route to enlightenment by study and by processing we havent begun to explore what can be done by study alone one area you cant go through with study and thought alone is the r6 bank mere study wont help person beyond release hed finish up at level v grade v there is tiger between release and clear you arent going to go through the h6 bank by just changing your mind that has to be gotten rid of utterly release might or might not occur just from the cognitions you would get from increased understanding the gradation chart actually goes as many as seventy levels below 34 the interpretation of the scale is tricky because it is what the person is aware of not what he manifests that person is always numb does not place him at 10 on the scale numbness what is important is is this person aware of the fact that he is always numb if guy could only be aware of false causes without knowing that they were false then he would be at false cause on the scale if he knew that false cause was false he would be above that level as when he is willing to accept your statement that babies come from under cabbage leaves because it is false cause lets say the guy says hey what do you know i just realized that im always after changes well there he is at 4 need of change you might say that the pcs level on the awareness scale is his cognition level the guy who never cogs is just not being trained or processed at the level where he could cognite he is over his head cogs come on gradient too power processing takes anyone matter where he is and yanks them up with thud to level iv the pc recovers terrific ability to know to be aware without necessarily attaining any more knowledge than he knew before probably this will just be redoubled at clear and ot here also he can create things which he couldnt do before he will not know more about how to do that by having been clear or an ot but his present level of beingness is such that his ability to grasp and act upon the potential of situation to assimilate and accomplish at that particular line whatever line he is in is just lightningfast he only knows what he knew before as well as he knew it before matter how clear you clear him he only knows what he knew before you dont increase his knowledge you increase his awareness of his present environment an individual will never make it without being trained in something the first thing hes going to be aware of as he moves out of comatose wog state into higher level of action is scientology its the first thing there to be aware of to study and it leads to higher ability level the cruelest thing you could do to somebody would be to audit him all the way to clear with auditor training he has this terrific potential to know and you havent made it possible for him to assimilate the technology which has brought him to this state it puts him in dreadful confusion he has understanding he wonders how did i get here wheres here it would be better to audit him up to release then train him up as far as hes been audited level iv then give him tools to go on up to clear then give him an organization to use those benefits in he needs to know how others function let him know then you have given him familiarity with the existence around him he has increased his span of knowledge of what is in scientology he has increased his organizational scope he has come up to an understanding of the usefulness of the various tools of scientology and he has also found out that these new states are moving up into type of civilization that can also exist this will raise his responsibilitywith all this you are not going to have lot of catastrophe you are going to have happy people this is taking totality of responsibility you must take responsibility for powerful knowledge look what happened to the atom bomb the nut who invented that took responsibility for it we have powerful technology for the first time we have total grip on knowledge of the universe and can bring people up with an express elevator we take as much responsibility as possible you have to take responsibility for knowledge to the degree that it is powerful we had better measure up to our

auditor advices staff auditor or interne or organization auditor or any auditor on staff coaudit may seek advices on what to do from any person except the officially appointed person doing the auditing folders seeking advice on cases verbally or in writing from the person not doing the folders is off line except in ethics matters when ethics may be consulted or saint hill advised when an auditor seeks advice offline and accepts it unbeknownst to the official supervising the auditing via the folders random factor is introduced into the running of cases that can be quite fatal at saint hill on power processes such an action is crime as the consequences can be so catastrophic to cases run on power processes the proper sources of instruction are tapes and hcobs adding bits to these that arent there is the commonest auditor error asking for unusual solutions from case supervisor who is doing the folders is sure sign that the last directives have not been followed giving instructions that are unusual is useless because they wont be complied with either the devt situation of asking for advice offline burdens lines and fouls up cases comm cycle and ethics when an auditor has fractured comm cycle very often processing still works on the average pc when an auditor has fractured comm cycle and the pc is an ethics type case sp pts whs mess ensues one can always tell if an auditors comm cycle is poor or if the code is being broken because when put on an ethics type pc things collapse when pc wont run one can be sure that 1 the auditors comm cycle is out and 2 the pc is an ethics type case when both these are present results can possibly occur when only one is present usually the auditing works somewhatcase supervisor puzzle when case supervisor doing folders sees process going wrong he should not blame the process or his own advice if these are even faintly educated instead the pc is an ethics type or the auditors comm cycle is out if neither of these seem to be the case and things still go wrong then the auditor just isnt running what he says he is or running what he is supposed to run if all the above seems not to be the case then the auditor is seeking offline advices and some screwball interpretation has been added to the process clever case supervisor marking folders goes by the textcase running well continue the standard approach case not running well send to review for analysis regardless of any auditing time lost when pc goes to review it is clever to send the auditor to the review cramming section to check over his auditors code and comm cycle with trs if when auditor and pc still dont run well send the pc to ethics review may already have done so ethics if the case supervisor ever finds an auditor not following instructions or seeking or taking offline directions he must at once send the auditor to ethics it is usually an ethics hearing and minor suspension if case supervisor doing the folders finds false report has been made he must send the offender to ethics withholds pc is not sent to ethics because of withholds gotten off in session however on the invalidation button one commonly finds suppressive persons around the pc and the auditor must send the pc to ethics at session end to get the matter disconnected or handled sometimes one finds another persons offences than the pcs in getting off withholds these are reported to ethics for investigation text book d of p work is completely text book pc doing okayget on with it as per the process the next process to be run or the next grade pc

franchise sthil students releases different kinds there are different kinds of releases they all have the similar meter phenomena floating needle and on or near clear read on calibrated mark iv or mark v there is the plain first stage release this occurs in auditing up to grade iv it is not very stable the person is very well off and definitely release but he or she can now postulate and in postulating sometimes gets into the r6 bank the first stage release is eased out of the bank but subject to callback then there is the power process release this is very stable and should be called second stage release or power release to be technically exact you can run only power processes on first stage release these knock out all factors of the track that force person back into the r6 bank and leave the person able to go into or get out of the r6 bank easily this second stage release is definitely homo novis the person ceases to respond like homo sapiens and has fantastic capability to learn and act the third stage release called for few days second stage before terminology was firm is an improved second stage release in that selective areas of learning are handled to return special skills to the person the case state does not necessarily improve but certain zones of knowledge have been polished up there is another state near that of release this is keyedoutoperating thetan at this time it occurs sometimes by accident in power processing but i think i will be able to process second stage release to it directly some day the pc is still pre clear though keyedout ot this really isnt thetan exterior the thetan exterior is quite unstable and can be attained below an ordinary first stage release real clear is of course on the other side of the reactive bank and above all these states it is completely stable one needs to know how to audit to get there real operating thetan is of course clear who has been familiarized with his environment to point of total cause over matter energy space time and thought this accounts for all states of being discussed in dianetics or scientology they are all attainable and only one keyedoutot is not done by routine auditing being an offshoot of it that happens sometimes the first stage release is as high as we got in dianetics so you can see we are five states of being above where we first arrived we are doing these today on routine assembly line basis on all cases orgs do lot of first stage releases saint hill is doing power releases and moving people up to clear through academy and saint hill training lot of cases would have to spend lot more time in power processing if they werent already successfully processed in grades 0 to ivthe majority of cases even when trained will not be able to go clear without being released and of course nobody is going to go ot before they have been audited released trained and cleared all of which are currently standard actions in scientology today we are definitely on our way

then he did more research and plowed himself into the r6 bank then he developed power processes power processes were totally predicted not empirical there they should be and there they were lrh ran the power processes solo when he got to the end all that was there was beginning of track and the r6 bank he backed off and looked for processes that would enable someone to have an ability back he got third stage release va see hcob 28jun65 releases different kinds hcob 12jul65 states of being attained by processing hcob 5aug65 release stages you can run it too far into the bank ie into r6ew but now you are at the correct end of it third stage release can go into and out of the r6 bank at will he is also able to have selective abilities this probably made class vi easier we are getting an interesting reaction from orgs why are you sending us class vii note at this point class vii is power auditor were releasing all the people we want on 0 i and ii the differences between the stages of release are basically differences of stability the fellow has been gotten to state where he can postulate when he is released at level iv person can remain keyedout clear until he makes postulate wrongwayto and keys himself in again and the r6 bank kicks him in the teeth power release is more stable we still dont get keyedout ot at will although it does occur sometimes during power processing it is easy to overrun first stage release we have cleared many people by the book one definition of clear and then overrun them because the auditor didnt recognize floating needle after that the pc could get very arc breaky all that could be done with pc like this is to run him on power and bring him to higher degree of stability power can also be overrun if you overrun power and then audit someone on ordinary processes within power processing you would really be in trouble because where is only one thing there to hack at and thats the h6 bank you could audit some selective abilities with power plus run him up to third stage release playing tag with the r6 bank then go on to audit r6 it is highly unlikely that person will make clear unless he has been released on power the route through the bank is too hard when it lies across an engram that will revivify you are sitting in an engram trying to run r6 and it wont asis properly that is the trouble with it it is interesting to watch raw meat on power they dont know about the r6 bank they feel wonderful and full of awe because they dont know what the hell happened or what is going on after being run on power processes technical advances are out of this world administratively r6 and power look very simple and elementary the trick in instructing class vii note class vii is now power auditing is to get the simplicity of the processes and procedures duplicated when the students are used to complexity confusion has to blow off you run power processes muzzled the study materials have more to them than would at first appear to be the case the evaluation of importances is one area for instance darkroom worker who works for lrh on weekends knows lots of tricks but he doesnt know fundamental importances lrh spotted the similarity to new auditors who arent fully trained in fundamentals they want tricks and shortcuts all of which are interesting but unimportant it isnt the tricks that get anyone anywhere that is what psychiatry and psychology do they collect tricks like stamp collectors but they have effective standard basic tech i have never heard one of them utter one essential piece of information that would have led to the resolution of case fantastic hors doeuvres main course so the study phenomenon is theres the fellow who knows it and can do it and the theres the fellow who knows all the tricks and cant do it it is out evaluation of importances you can take basically sound piece of data eg that pc whonever looks at the auditor or who slews around to sit sideways in the chair is arc broken and twist it to something like never acknowledge pc until he looks at you if you did this on power the pc would go round the bend hed go on automatic there is mainline information and then there are tidbits an auditor in training should differentiate between 1 mainline data which is very senior 2 data you should know to apply the senior data 3 parsley data data that if you use it it will make you look very clever nice data but of great value when someone like lrh shifts senior datum people go adrift for instance audit the pc in front of you was senior before grades and organization an org auditor doesnt audit the pc in front of him at all the auditor now audits the process if he sees bis or runs into trouble he sends the pc to review there is policy letter now with all the things on it that could be wrong with the pc hcopl 7apr70ra green form it is asking too much to expect the auditor to pick up the right one in session with form out of 44 possibilities especially when the pc may have overts on that auditor the pc should be repaired by some other auditor the auditor may be part of what is wrong hence the pc needs another auditor review auditors must be experts in assessment they pick up any read and straighten out whatever needs to be fixed whatever the problem is it is not standard tech that is the problem the review auditor is in different division qual the d of p apparently covers also the cs post at this time is forbidden ever to interview pc or talk to an auditor about pc only what can be statisticized is the concern of the d of p total ta process run hours in session etc if the auditor is trying to talk to the d of p about cases he gets job endangerment chit if pc doesnt gain in processing there are reasons why but knowing little tricks wont tell you what they are you cant put beings together again with cute little trick the auditors job is to audit standard processes on the pc with standard comm cycle on standard gradation program the d of p does standard d of ping he goes over the session and checks ta for the session he picks up the next folder the pcs goal is not to have too much trouble in this session the total ta was 27 divs for 2 12 hour session the pc is not in trouble continue the process next folder goals or gains pc restive didnt want to run any processes how many hours were wasted here all morning and all afternoon the pc was arc broken through it all auditor to ethics and pc to review handled in this way cases keep winning if the pc rollercoasters he goes to review then to the examiner then to ethics if the pc cant spot the sp ethics just keeps working it over there is someone who uses generalities that keep the pc from spotting him if you get the right one the ptss face lights like christmas tree if you get the wrong one it wont and it is like indicating the wrong bpc the condition doesnt change that is the only time ethics lays an egg when the pts situation is handled the pc goes back to the hgc and the auditor takes up from where he left off ethical standard matches case level ethics has as purpose making people better not punishing people suppose the org exec sec sees declining stats in the hgc processing is not as successful as before now is the time to look at all the review chits he finds that auditing cycles are out on several auditors he tells the d of p the d of p sends these auditors for special training and gets their comm cycle in lower classed auditors have lower ethical standards to be an excellent review auditor you must be crackerjack assesser be able to make the meter sit up and sing know the processes called for on the green form be able to audit routine auditing on the grades be able to cs any folder know when to send pc to reviewand when to review auditors know when process is flat know what gis and bis can be read from folder know what process should be run next know what is good ta and poor ta and be cryptographer so you dont get misunderstoods you should know which auditor to assign to which pc your auditors are not all releases and you know that there are quirks that make auditor audit poorly with certain pcs if you drop out one of those skills you are that much less complete auditor there is review for power processing so power processing is done in review with two class viis csing each other an auditor in training is not being trained as onemanband he gets tired and quits auditing if he tries but he should be able to do the above actions so that he understands what is happening when he audits you only change the standard pattern of the session when the pc gets nonstandard the pc goes to review when he is flat ballbearing the auditor should know how to do green form not because he is going to do one in standard session but because as the org grows more review auditors will be needed the effects of outtech are slower to appear in the hgc maybe six months than in the academy few days people are always fighting to own this

division release rehabilitation of former releases and thetan exteriors there are probably great many processes that will recover the state of first stage release or first stage thetan exterior or released ot poorest but easiest of these is plain itsa itsa probably will not recover floating needle but will pull down the ta when its down stopdont press your luck too far the real technical job other than itsa requires expert metering and thorough knowledge of dating on meter and smooth comm cycle best at it would be an auditor who himself was former release and who had himself or herself recovered the state the technically correct procedure is unfortunately delicate one which requires good command of tech on the subject of the time track and perception of the pc and meter alert enough to stop exactly when rerelease occurs and say thats it never say end in such sessions remember all recovery must be by keyout not erasure keyouts are done by finding keyins it is destimulation not restimulation therefore all must be smooth and jolly with forcing or overrun the exact tech follows to regain former release or thetan exterior or keyedout ot released ot 1 loosely locate the session or time in which it occurred 2 get in suppress invalidate buttons on the session or time 3 get in unacknowledged or what was unacknowledged 4 indicate anything found to the pc as bypassed charge 5 find the keyin that was keyed out in that time or session the person went release because something keyed out in that time or session 6 when this is found and recognized by the pc the pc will then return to release or released ot 7 if this does not happen find what keyed in that ended the state and repeat 1 to 6 on it this is all rough to communicate to the pc who is not well trainedthis datum will help standard datum of early dianetics the analytical mind when it becomes aware of point in the reactive mind makes it vanish in other words one needs but become aware of the actual cause of an aberration to have it vanish we see this mainly in cognitions but it is the backbone of all auditing when the person was originally released he had become aware of something that caused the reactive mind to destimulate at that point or become weak and so he released you have to find that point of sudden awareness again as in i to 6 above and if you miss it you can at least find 7 you could find both and in lot of cases will probably do so but if you win on i to 6 for heavens sakes dont go on to 7 if you do 7 you may suddenly turn up with 5 when youve done it realize youve done it and come off of it dont overrun when you have done it tell the person to get trained so he or she can go on to actual clear liability the liability in all this is finding the original thing that was keyed in which when keyed out gave release if this happens you have new keyin in the session you are running right now it is new keyin and is handled as one tech comment this tells us that finding and running out keyins will make first stage release out of someone who has never been one standard grade processing does this l ron hubbard lrh mlrd copyright 1965 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard

fully audited out erased completely one has clear when clear has been refamiliarized with his capabilities you have an operating thetan an ot release then is pulled out of his reactive mind clear has fully erased his reactive mind an operating thetan is one who is cause over matter energy space and time and is not in body the degree and relative permanence of being pulled out of the reactive mind determines the state of release there are numerous things that can pull one back into the reactive mind these are l locks 2 secondaries 3 engrams 4 the whole time track locks by reducing locks as in levels 0 to iv we then remove the ability of locks to pull the being back into his r6 bank locks are mental image pictures of nonpainful but disturbing experiences the person has experienced they depend for their force on secondaries and engrams thus one who has had his locks reduced is first stage release secondaries and engrams when being has had the secondaries and engrams reduced he is far less likely to be pulled into the reactive mind than if he has just had their locks reduced secondaries are mental image pictures containing misemotion grief anger apathy etc they contain pain they are moments of shock and stress and depend for their force on underlying engramsengrams are mental image pictures of pain and unconsciousness the person has experienced when these are reduced one has second stage release the whole track bits and pieces of the whole track remain after the locks secondaries and engrams are reduced these bits inhibit the being from recovering knowledge the whole track is the moment to moment record of persons existence in this universe in picture and impression form when these bits are cleaned up being is third stage release exterior if being is 1st 2nd or 3rd stage release and has also become exterior to his body in the process we simply add ot to the state of release it is secondary in importance to the fact of being release as soon as the being seeks to exert his ot powers he tends to restimulate his r6 bank and so goes back into his body this is all that is meant when person is called first stage released ot the person has not only come out of his bank but also out of his body processes many processes all below class v make 1st stage releases we have been making them for 15 years when audited on low level grades after being released by them the person goes into his secondaries and engrams he can be fished back out again by modem technology and can easily regain the state of first stage release power processes alone can be run on first stage release these vanquish the secondaries and engrams this requires very expert class vii auditors as it is touchy work these make second stage release in doing the earlier power processes the preclear often attains first stage release or first stage released ot only doing all the basic power processes including one called pr pr 6 makes second stage release certain advanced power processes make third stage release these mainly recover knowledge and smooth out ones understanding of the awareness of the environment achieved by second stage release on power processing clear the r6 bank when being has been trained up to class vi and has been given the materials of the basic reactive mind to audit out they took years to find and are too complex to be tackled without training and the actual patterns he can then attain the state of clearthe reactive mind is composed of significance and masses as old as the universe itself and is the basic cause of the decline of the individual each person has his own basic bank but they are all exactly alike the materials are quite useless and inhibiting clear is not under the great stress of this bank and so can be free he uses his own basic purposes and is for the first time wholly himself operating thetan this state of being is attained by drills and familiarity after the state of clear has been obtained real ot has reactive bank is

release rehabilitation refers to and amplifies hcob 30 june 1965 in doing former release rehabilitation if you find the point of keyout of the moment the pc was formerly released and then the moment of keyin afterwards and then get the pc to itsa these alternate points one after the other with bit of guiding when you see fall telling the pc who is thinking the needle fell by saying whats that and then if you get off any unacknowledgment by the auditor in the rehabilitation session and if you handle all such moments in the pcs auditing history recent or distant you will get the ta down and momentary floats of the needle then if you end it with the pc happy and all well in the release rehabilitation session the pc will feel terrific and you will probably have regained the floating needle remember it isnt repetitive alternate question what was keyed out then what was keyed in then but use of these and any such wording one after the other as itsa invitations until you get the ta off it and the ta down and not up again on session comm cycle goofs by hitting the keyout then the keyin in that former session where the pc went release he or she really gets the charge off it and youve regained it i daresay you could take stuck ta at 5 on an oldtime pc and by locating the moments when he or she felt good in sessions and handling each one in turn until you get the pc happy he or she has got it you would eventually get the ta to clear read and momentary or continuously floating needle its gentle the only goof you can really make aside from comm cycle and code breaks is not to quit when the needle floats in your rehabilitation session the rule of all processing is never run process further than it produces floating needle with the ta between 2 and 3 this applies to former

copyright 1965 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6507c27 shspec65 stages of release one of the interesting things about releases is that we have been making them for years and auditors have been going on by them running more processes there were probably releases being made in 1951 from 1957 on when lrh made lots of keyedout clears at an acc the 19th american acc 6jan14feb58 tech bulletins vol iii p 204 auditors should have observed what was happening the longer they cleaned cleans the more upset the pc became in exoneration they didnt realize that it is not ok to run process beyond floating needle this goes from ground zero to clear our main problem is overrun if someone got an fn on selfanalysis it would be goof to run more recalltype processes the first level of the case is recognition of the environment so if you asked person to look around and spot where he was and the needle floated you cant run any cchs or if you got an fn on the first objective process the rest of them are null and void if you go on you are cleaning clean this is the groundwork for quickie grades even on power if the needle floats even if the expected ep isnt there you end off fortunately you can run the rest of the power processes but when one process goes free thats it for that process our main problem is overrun this has happened many times to lrh lrh says he was overrun so much that he must have been running other peoples banks r6 is the exception to ending off when you get an fn because all other processes deal with keyout of the r6 bank whereas r6 is total erasure this doesnt apply to gpms when you get an fn you cant contact them and you are in trouble r6 is the only process which is dealing with total erasure all others deal with locks on r6 the levels ultimately begin with the reactive bank theres just the guy and the possibility that he could get aberrated on top of that the r6 bank is built and then on top of that is built tremendous accumulation that we know as end words and on top of those is erected whole series of whole track incidents and other types of gpms known as implants see fig 28 the latter prevented permanent releases by restimulating the original bank the r6 bank engrams are among and on top of implant gpms secondaries are on top of those with locks on the top engrams are restimulations of endwords endwords are restimulations of the r6 bank the whole trick in running r6ew is to get only endwords not to pick up r6 material itself surrounding the lot is the physical universe which could also be considered sort of bank what you are doing with pc is carving away at this stack of stuff it contains significances and masses spaces and energies it is also plotted against time but that is all there is in it the machinery and circuits in it are just combinations of energies and significances and as such they are just special case of the above this combination of energies and significances comprises mass that sits there in its own madeup space plotted against the pcs experiential track known as time there is nothing else in the bank although the bank says there is freud and psychoanalysis were popular because they had more r6 in their technologies than other systems they had some written endwords on which they were basing everything by transference freud meant that the pc flipped into another valence the freudians recognized recovery in terms of release of affect by which they meant an emotional discharge especially grief they didnt recognize other emotions besides grief nor did they recognize underlying engrams all anyone has ever been trying to do when he was sincerely trying to help somebody with his mind was reduce the effect of this thing called the reactive mind or the subconscious mind or the unconscious mind upon the individual himself there are many such psychotherapies on the whole track if anyone discovered scientology by himself he probably freed himself and took off there is trace of such an occurrence in the bank however there are many instances on the track where people attacked the gpms of the r6 bank chewed an item or two out or crushed one or some such they would take picture of the area where someone had been and hit big clapstick in front of the photograph to make it look like it exploded they did this when the thetan was anaten or comatose the thetanwould get the idea and take his own picture of his misemotional or painful experience and smack it with couple of beams and snap out of it that is what psychotherapy was in the galactic confederacy there were also suppressive technologies which are easily mistaken for helpful technologies implanters developed techniques to have effects on people there are many technologies calculated to have an effect on people when suppressive studies scientology he does so from the viewpoint of trying to have an effect on someone the sp evaluates his action as an auditor by how much effect it had on the pc not by whether it made the pc better the whole subject of alchemy was devoted to throwing the whole r6 level into restimulation throwing the guy into his r6 bank and letting the guy cook thereafter the alchemists had other goal their books writings and practices make it obvious it was the lead of human beings that they wanted to transmute into the gold of spirit transmutation of metals had nothing to do with alchemy it was transmutation of life that they were talking about their books are full of r6 dichotomies if you get one of the guys who has been into alchemy on power and all that comes off is dichotomies he has been plowed into r6 since time immemorial you will have to find the practice that got him into it and fish him out hypnotism is another practice that is only intended to make people more compliant not to better them you have to wake people up to make them better not put them to sleep you dont want suggestibility you want selfdeterminism some states on the whole track had thought tower to pick up hostile thoughts and record them so that the person indulging in crimethink would be turned in for brainwashing this is swindle there never was such thing person was implanted with that idea and placed under compulsion to report to the police if he had bad thought there was another idea on the whole track for controlling thetans you would take piece of thetan and keep it in lab if the thetan escaped they would touch the piece of thetan with hot rods this was also swindle the rule still holds that processing pc who is determined to succumb wont work because there isnt enough agreement in the session that is why you have an argument with hypnotists your purpose is different from theirs the common denominator of suppressive technologies is lies the common denominator of good technology is truth the whole test of sincerity is is the fellow doing what he says hes doing or is he doing something else these two questions have to be answered about any government movement or individual is there falsity on the line all these downgrade subjects have falsity on the line they say they are trying to make people well but their statistics show what is really occurring people assume that the psychiatrist is there to help the person and he isnt its an apparency as mentioned above the question is with psychiatry in charge is the world saner their stats are not just down they are runaway down since psychiatry has entered the field of criminology crime is fabulously on the increase theres falsity on the line what you understand hes doing is not what hes doing psychiatric research is done by deepsixing every scrap of data that doesnt agree with the theory being pushed if you tried that in engineering bridges and buildings would collapse but if some scientist is telling you oh well you have to be very learned to know about this you may swallow it if you are not careful this is also true in the field of art as an auditor you know that when the pc finds and articulates the problem it blows saying that it is something else wont do it so you see that the basic crime in this universe isnt making or destroying things it is altering truth any subject has few alterises in it otherwise it would just disappear but how many alterises does it have that is the question if it has many it will harm instead of helping people it will prove to be striving to create effects on people subjects with lot of alteris are harmful and subjects with relatively little alteris are helpful evil practices are identified by the falsity that is connected with them the worse off pc is the more he thinks hes got in his mind he gets on an additive line he collects and accumulates therapies like pack rat the medical student who gets every disease he reads about is on an additive line and in the direction of additive weactually approach evil on the direction of subtraction we approach good therefore scientology is based on truth the isness not the alterisness is what we care about it is what is in the mind not why is it in the mind cleaning clean brings about the manifestations of evil because since theres not anything there to be cleaned the pc has to put something there you are therefore adding it is adding because there is nothing there to be cleaned therefore the pc and the auditor have to put something there before anything will happen there are only five or six kinds of things in the mind when you are out of one of them you have to put something there to run it out there is reactive mind with certain elements when you have disconnected the pc from that class of element he has ceased to be an effect of it and you can regard it as gone the r6 gpms wont disappear by someone changing his mind or postulates because the r6 bank is tangle of boobytrapped postulates there wouldnt be anything else in the mind if the r6 bank werent there there would be thing or isness pc gets full blanks time track with solid locks because it all relates somehow to some secondary or engram somewhere on the track you start with the r6 bank then on top of it you get wogginess and wooziness on the subject of postulates he accumulates r6ew locks then his own goals as locks get stacked up on this and implants are overlaid on top of this then you get whole track engrams then secondaries then locks eventually with time when the thetan finally became human everything was lock on something earlier in the bank and he made picture of it yesterday runs like an engram he couldnt look at anything in the universe right now without it hanging up on some experience hes had that he didnt like theres the bank so the thetan gets full time track the thetan is also surrounded by the physical universe which gives him problems additionally there are other peoples universes which are different experientially this can also give him ptp that doesnt have anything to do with mental image picture or reactive bank but it can restimulate the reactive bank and thus be harder to solve ptp can exist as such independent of the bank if you get your hand caught in clothes wringer it is ptp it doesnt necessarily have anything to do with the bank the fact that thetans attention is stuck on ptp keeps him from putting his attention on anything else so he makes gain you can usually handle the problem on the basis that it is problem because he doesnt think he can handle it he has entered lie into it so he doesnt try to do anything about it so it continues to be problem the lie in problem is 1 that it exists and is problem or 2 that one can do nothing about it to handle it if the auditor could get the pc to confront the problem to take it apart and get its elements and take the lies out of the problem the pc could probably confront it and it would cease to be problem however the problem isnt necessarily entirely in the pcs mind every time an arc break is situation where the pc feels under some sort of attack from an unknown source in its inception an arc break is actually an incomplete cycle of action in all likelihood there is some big lie entered into it but the main upset is that the pc couldnt complete what he was doing pc isnt auditable when he is in an arc break because he cant put his attention on anything else it is presence of time that makes ptp as human beings all of us have to some degree an underthegun existence the amount of duress that person is under is proportionate to the degree that he thinks it threatens his survival you can tolerate quite bit of it unless you are on the skids already when the pc is upset the auditor cant get away with making mistakes when the pc is feeling good he can get away with some if you have managed to get the pc disconnected from his arc breaks ptps etc and then go on auditing him on them you are invalidating his ability to confront you are giving him theidea that he ought to be bothered by them when you see the fn dont give two more commands dont get him to itsa some more send him to the examiner let the pc have his win one more command and you are cleaning clean he is out of that outrud the connectors to the bank are gone in that area in trying to find an overrun after the fact youre looking in the goneness for the what wentness and youre looking through mass of it wasnt there anywayness afterwards release isnt just disconnected from the bank he has erased stratum of it in rehabbing you are getting rid of additives third stage release grade va leads the pc through the physical environment contact with the bank and ends up cutting off the r6ew top just going off the top of those floating end words you can get the pc off of what pins him into those endwords you can just separate that each of the grade v and va processes is run to fn there are four processes on va one having to do with people one with where the pc has been etc power processing is very close to the truth therefore it must be run very standardly after running va there is nothing between the pc and the r6 bank itself now of course he can dive off the shade of this and he has protective coating between him and the r6 bank it stands there naked and raw hes got the r6ew spans that are lying in and amongst the gpms etc he can run those like shot r6ew can run to fn there is actually fourth stage release on r6ew running gpms one can go to fn thus getting fifth stage release by running gpms but these arent important the state of clear is what is important you dont want to go free of the body and leave some of the bank around to key in later in rehabbing you get the liability that you may

lists l1 use meter at sensitivity 16 use arc break assessment list 1 the questions asked are generalized and without time limiters ie has withhold been missed have you been given wrong goal etc begin with list 1 ask the first line of this list while watching the meter for an instant read if the line does not read say thats clean and move on to the next line of the list and do the same action with this new line if the pc has something to say about line that is clean let him say it acknowledge it and then you ask the next line dont q and if the line when asked has an instant read say that reads then what do you consider this could be or what considerations do you have about this let the pc answer all he wants to while he is giving his considerations mark down any blowdowns of the ta when the pc has given all his considerations say thank you ill check the line on the meter and call the line again if it instant reads say theres another read here then again ask for considerations etc continue these actions until the line goes cleanwhen clean say thats clean then move on to the next line when list 1 is completed and then list 1 then list 1 and so on if running correctly the ta total should increase from session to session the pc should get more and more blowdowns on his considerations then he should get blowdowns on what he considers the main thing is dont q and dont take up or do anything with the pcs considerations dont ever say that still reads its always another read as it still reads makes the pc feel he has not answered the question this process gets charge off

auditor say oh yes im following orders im rehabilitating former release rehabilitation of former release is precise set of actions covered only in the above hcobs and this one one only does those actions given in these hcobs 3 rough comm cycle the roughness of the auditors comm cycle can prevent not only release from occurring but can prevent rehabilitation all auditing is best done muzzled with the auditor drilled on mutter trs 4 meter misuse in step i of hcob 30 june 65 it says loosely locate the session or time in which it release occurred this means meter dating by loosely is meant to the year month and day not the minute you can of course locate to the houradd as the primary step to hcob 30 june 65 1 list and exactly date by meter each and every time the pc has attained state of release in this lifetime that should dispel any doubts about what rehabilitation of former release is aiming to do add also as paragraph in hcob 30 june 1965 if the pcs needle goes free with the tone arm between 2 and 3 on calibrated meter cease rehabilitation at that instant and declare do not continue beyond the floating needle on rehabilitation either if pcs needle floats doing the hco policy letter form 26 june 65 cease at that instant and send to get the state declared do not keep on doing the form past floating needle either in fact dont continue any process or auditing beyond floating needle you can shift from process to process free needle attained on each only in power processing and only on r6 gpmi an auditor must also realize that handling current matters and all on former release in rehabilitation is violating further the rule dont audit past floating needle the whole trouble with the pc was auditing beyond release therefore in rehabilitation even ruds are just more auditing arent they you can only do hcob 30 june 65 and its further hcobs 5 not recognizing floating needle floating needle free needle are the same thing what does one look like once youve seen one youll never make mistake on one again for it floats it ceases to register on the pcs bank it just idly floats about or wont stand up even at low sensitivity the ta goes to any place between 2 and 3 and the needle floats differences in cans used as electrodes and not keeping the meter calibrated with 5000 ohm and 12500 ohm resistors clipped between the two cans and setting the ta to f and m can lead an auditor to find floating needle at ta 38 but ignore it because the meter is out also two meters used can both be out particularly if the wrong cans are used steel cans chromium plated or tin plated like ordinary vegetable soup tin cans are the best electrodes 6 not getting them all not getting every time the pc has been release in this lifetime can be big goof sometimes the last one is just yesterday but omitting it can halt rehabilitation getting whole track before this lifetime former release periods is of questionable benefit but cannot be ruled out 7 pcs own purposesthe leader in making high state of being collapse given an r6 bank is the pcs own purposes person shot up scale can postulate postulating going down scale or an attack on something can collapse state of release protest wanting to get even revenge are some things that pc postulated that made him go back into the bank its goof for pc to postulate himself down scale or to postulate himself right by showing another he is wrong this is why class iv processing service fac can so easily make 1st stage release 8 declare errors sometimes pc is not rehabilitated yet is so declared this causes serious upset sometimes the examiner fails to detect the flaw that the pc doesnt think he was released and passes the pc sometimes the examiner challenges and fiddles about too much this is withhold of acknowledgment of the state and will cause an upset before it can be awarded 9 unalert org an org which is not alert to the way sps go for new releases when the release is still finding his or her feet will make very few that remain stable if an org develops lazy attitude toward auditor and personnel discipline then two things happen auditors and execs alike think it is all right to audit past floating needle on form action or process or b start declaring people who arent released either way is catastrophe the middle road of honest and precise tech is vital auditors with sloppy comm cycles almost never release anyone to floating needle such begin to believe it is all gas so it doesnt matter what they do an org not alert to what bad comm cycle can do to prevent release is for it as tech will fade summary for fifteen years auditors have made and then undone keyedoutclearing all over the world we can then assume that as they had the data about floating needles in 1958 and did not heed

of 3 august 1965 remimeo all students all staff auditing goofs blowdown interruption it is serious goof for the auditor to speak or move during blowdown of the tone arm when tone arm has to be moved rapidly down the needle appears to float to some but it is just falling to see if needle is floating the ta must have stopped moving down blowdown is period of relief and cognition to pc while it is occurring and for moment after it stops therefore it is serious goof for an auditor to speak or move during the blowdown or for moment afterwards this was noted years ago and is given in early materials on goals an auditor must not speak or move during blowdown when the auditor has to move the ta from right to left to keep the needle on the dial and the movement is i divisions or more then blowdown is occurring the needle of course is falling to the right that is period of charge blowing off the bank it is accompanied by realizations for the pc sometimes the pc does not voice them aloud they nevertheless happen if the auditor speaks or moves beyond adjusting the ta quietly with his thumb the pc may suppress the cognitions and stop the blowdown to see if needle floats the ta must be halted for the moment between 2 and 3 on calibrated meter floating needle cannot be observed during blowdown for an auditor to sit up suddenly and look surprised or pleased or for an auditor to say the next command or thats it during blowdown can jolly well wreck pcs case so its real goof to do so to get auditing results one must audit with good comm cycle accept the pcs answers handle the pcs originations be unobtrusive with his auditing actions not hold the pc up while he writes not develop tricks like waiting for the pc to look at him before giving the next command not prematurely ack and so start compulsive itsa and be very quiet during and just after blowdown l ron hubbard lrhmlcden copyright 1965 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor

back in bit he or she does not remain in status quo unchanging state while release first stage release often pulls further out to first stage released ot after processing similarly second stage release may become second stage released ot in their understandable enthusiasmthey feel so much better and bigger and strongera release sometimes seeks additional acknowledgment by requesting further release check pc who has attained first stage can go first stage released ot but cannot possibly go second stage without power processing in short one cant upgrade stages 1 to 2 etc without the actual processing why because key out is just that key out just because one longer has tiger in his lap does not mean the tiger has vanished hes merely stepped out into the hall in the course of life somebody is going to leave the door open the tiger wont come back into ones lap but hell sure sit on the rug and sneer key out means theres still tiger release means hes away one first stage can be more released than another first stage the tiger is further off but when you start upgrading numbers 1st 2nd 3rd etc you are talking about less tiger theres less bank first stage removes few tiger whiskers and the sneer thats the locks going the tiger is near or farthat means more or less 1st stage it doesnt mean theres less tiger second stage removes the tigers misemotion and his front claws the tiger can now be near or far but he is that much tiger he can be so far away one is sure he has vanished but hes just far he remains that much tiger minus whiskers sneer temper and front claws he just isnt evident third stage pulls the tigers ability to paralyze ones wits in effect third stage removes impediments to ones ability to know the tiger though now minus whiskers sneer temper front claws and the ability to paralyze is still about he may at this stage walk off so far that one is positive there is more tiger but its early to break out the champagne maybe he wont be back for years even centuries but he still exists fourth stage release removes the tigers claws all about and blunts his teeth and causes him to hide in closets but though he hasnt whiskers sneer claws or his frightening effect or the old sharpness he is still tiger one can gambol about in the sun cheerily feeling quite sure there is tiger at all only the locks on the r6 bank are gone that r6 bank is still thereat this stage the pc feels he can move mountains singlehanded and is given to chest thumping that he still depends upon body gets overlooked but ahead of him is the big job there is still tiger this tiger if not vanished utterly will sooner or later creep up and eat up the goodies so one has to handle mr tiger once and for all run the total r6 bank and become 5th stage release now and only now with bit of reorientation can one be clear more tiger he is not near or far he doesnt exist and one can go on for the trillions early on my pcs went keyed out clear and went away they stayed that way long time they were sure they had attained the zenith today we are going to have the same problem release is going to feel sure he has gone up in number of release when its only the tiger out for lunch i am the last one to throw cool water over anyones head about release but i have passion for stating truth as i know it when i know it you can always depend on that its not always popular but its honest therefore these are the only ways to go up in number as release to obtain first stage release one must have had lower grade auditing of some sort this removes the locks the distressful moments of life off the reactive mind as these pinned one to it one can now get out of it to obtain second stage release one must have been run on the highest of the power processes this gets rid of the secondaries misemotions and upsets and the engrams moments of pain and unconsciousness and as these pinned one to the reactive mind one can now move out of it and isnt so likely to go back into it as he has secondaries and engrams to call him back to obtain third stage release one has to tackle the beings places and subjects one has long detested and when these are gone one isnt likely to be called back into the reactive mind very soon as bits of his daily life dont remind him of beings places and subjects he once detested to obtain fourth stage release one has to take the lock end words off the r6 bank he has to be an r6 auditor himself to do this properly with these gone the r6 bank is left on its naked basics and one can be very free of it for quite while but now we are down to the concrete and bedrock to obtain fifth stage release one has to have run out the whole remaining reactive mind we are awfully lucky to have the combination to the vault as its been shut thoroughly for the trillions thats done by process known as r6gpmior gpms by items and i assure you 1 it can be done and 2 it was pure hell going it blind when i was trying to find it it took several years and thousands of hours of research auditing to just find the pattern of it this is the longest job r6gpmi and requires now at least 14 months of daily solo auditing and then one is 5th stage and ready for polish and clear now understand at each of these stages one has to go unrelease to make it to the next stage of release this requires gutsand faith one is feeling grand the world is beautiful the unbrave get nervous at the thought of diving back into the asphalt or to keep our metaphor about deliberately whistling up the tigerhere tiger here tiger come out wherever you are so way that is cooked up to avoid this further combat is to pretend an upgrade in number of release without the hard work and scratches necessary to honestly achieve it add to all this that one has present time and body to receive the slings and arrows and one sees that it is complex picture but we have the way it is the way many will come along selling the frightened the idea one can leap up through the numbers without pain or toil or auditing by flexing ones chest or eating wheaties or praying but that isnt the way theres bridge there the main point that will be stumbled on is this nobody has any real

run preclear who has attained stage of release may not be run further on the processes of that stage or below or he will go back into his reactive mind all releases however can have their problems handled their withholds pulled their arc breaks repaired and any release at any stage can be audited on the exact processes of release rehabilitation the states of release differ in that one is more stable than another the reactive mind known also as the r6 bank can only be audited out by someone who is trained up to class vl when the reactive mind is fully audited out erased completely one has clear when clear has been refamiliarized with his capabilities you have an operating thetan an ot release then is pulled out of his reactive mind clear has fully erased his reactive mind an operating thetan is one who is cause over matter energy space and time and is not in body the degree and relative permanence of being pulled out of the reactive mind determines the state of release there are numerous things that can pull one back into the reactive mind these are i locks 2 secondaries 3 engrams 4 the whole time track locks by reducing locks as in levels 0 to iv we then remove the ability of locks to pull the being back into his r6 bank locks are mental image pictures of nonpainful but disturbing experiences the person has experienced they depend for their force on secondaries and engrams thus one who has had his locks reduced is first stage release secondaries and engrams when being has had the secondaries and engrams reduced he is far less likely to be pulled into the reactive mind than if he has just had their locks reducedsecondaries are mental image pictures containing misemotion grief anger apathy etc they contain pain they are moments of shock and stress and depend for their force on underlying engrams engrams are mental image pictures of pain and unconsciousness the person has experienced when these are reduced one has second stage release the whole track bits and pieces of the whole track remain after the locks secondaries and engrams are reduced these bits inhibit the being from recovering knowledge the whole track is the moment to moment record of persons existence in this universe in picture and impression form when these bits are cleaned up being is third stage release the reactive mind when the pc has taken the locks off the reactive mind itself using r6ew he attains fourth stage release the reactive mind when the entire reactive mind has been erased and the person is again wholly himself one could call it fifth stage

officers out tech ds of t course supervisors and how to get it in all students the term out tech means that scientology is not being applied or is not being correctly applied when tech is in we mean that scientology is being applied and is being correctly applied by tech is meant technology referring of course to the application of the precise scientific drills and processes of scientology technology means the methods of application of an art or science as opposed to mere knowledge of the science or art itself one could know all about the theory of motor cars and the science of building them and the art of designing them and still not be able to build plan or drive one the practices of building planning or driving motor car are quite distinct from the theory science and art of motor cars an auditor is not just scientologist he or she is one who can apply it thus the technology of scientology is its actual application to oneself preclear or the situations one encounters in life tech implies use there is wide gap between mere knowledge and the application of that knowledge when we say tech is out we might also say while that unit or person may know all about scientology that person does not actually apply it skilled auditor knows not only scientology but how to apply the technology to self pcs and life many persons auditing have not yet crossed over from knowing about to applying thus you see them fooling about with pcs when skilled auditor sees critical pc he knows bangpc has withhold and pulls it thats because this auditors tech is in meaning he knows what to do with his data some other person who knows lot of scientology has had courses and all that yet sees critical pc and then tries to add up everything he knows about pcs and stumbles about and then decides on zero pc its new thing thats wrong thats never been seen before whats the difference here its the difference between person who knows but cannot apply and skilled technician who can apply the knowledge most golfers know that you have to keep your eye on the ball just before during and after you hit it thats the basic datum of powerful long drives down the fairway so if this is so well known then why do so few golfers do it they have arrived at point of knowing they must they have not yet arrived at point of being able to then their heads get so scrambled seeing all their bad drives which didnt go down the fairway that they buy rabbits feet or new clubs or study ballistics in short not being able to do it they disperse and do something else all auditors go through this all of them once trained know the right processes then they have to graduate up to doing the right processesobservation plays an enormous role in this the auditor is so all thumbs with his meter and unfamiliar tools he has time or attention to see what goes on with the pc so for 15 years lots of auditors made releases without ever noticing it they were so involved in knowing and so unskilled in applying they never saw the ball go down the fairway for 200 yard drive so they began to do something else and squirrel there was the pc going release but the auditor unskilled as technician for all his knowledge of the science never saw the auditing work even though even the auditing done that badly did work do you get the point you have to know your tools very very well to see past them an auditor who squirrels who fools about with pc who fumbles around and seldom gets results just isnt sufficiently familiar with session its patter his meter and the mind to see past them to the pc drill overcomes this the keynote of the skilled technician is that he is product of practice he has to know what he is trying to do and what elements he is handling then he can produce result ill give you an example i told an auditor to look over past session of known date on pc and find what was missed in that session something must have been missed as the pcs tone arm action collapsed in that session and ever afterwards was nil so this auditor looked for missed withhold from the auditor in that session the ordered repair was complete dud why this auditor did not know that anything could be missed except withhold of the hidden overt type he didnt know there could be an inadvertent withhold wherein the pc thinks he is withholding because the auditor didnt hear or acknowledge this auditor didnt know that an item on list could be missed and tie up ta but if he did know these things he didnt know them well enough to do them second more skilled auditor took over and bang the missed item on the list was quickly found the more skilled auditor simply asked in that session what was missed and promptly got it the former auditor had taken simple order find what was missed in that session and turned it into something else what withhold was missed in that session his skill did not include applying simple direct order as auditing looked very complex to him as he had so much trouble with doing it you can train somebody in all the data and not have an auditor real auditor has to be able to apply the data to the pc importances play huge part in this i had newly graduated darkroom photographic technician at work it was pathetic to see the inability to apply important data the virtues of ancient equipment and strange tricks to get seldom required effects were all at his fingertips but he did not know that you wiped developer off your hands before loading fresh film consequently he ruined every picture taken with any film he loaded he did not know you washed chemicals out of bottles before you put different chemicals in them yet he could quote by the yard formulas not in use for 50 years he knew photography he could not apply what he knew soon he was straying all over the place trying to find new developers and papers and new methods whereas all he had to do was learn how to wash his hands and dry them before handling new film i also recall 90day wonder in world war ii who came aboard in fresh new gold braid and with popped eyes stared at the wheel and compass he said hed studied all about them but had never seen any before and had often wondered if they really were used how he imagined ships were steered and guided beyond the sight of land is mystery maybe he thought it was all done by telepathy or an order from the bureau of navigation alteris and poor results do not really come from notknow they come from cantapplydrills drills drills and the continual repetition of the important data handle this condition of cantapply if you drill auditors hard and repeat often enough basic auditing facts they eventually disentangle themselves and begin to do job of application important data the truly important data in an auditing session are so few that one could easily memorize them in few minutes from case supervisor or auditor viewpoint 1 if an auditor isnt getting results either he or the pc is doing something else 2 there is substitute for knowing how to run and read meter perfectly 3 an auditor must be able to read comprehend and apply hco bs and instructions 4 an auditor must be familiar enough with what hes doing and the mechanics of the mind to be able to observe what is happening with the pc 5 there is substitute for perfect trs 6 an auditor must be able to duplicate the auditing command and observe what is happening and continue or end processes according to their results on the pc 7 an auditor must be able to see when hes released the pc and end off quickly and easily with shock or overrun 8 an auditor must have observed results of his standard auditing and have confidence in it case reaction the auditor and the case supervisor must know the only six reasons case does not advance they are 1 pc is suppressive 2 pc is always potential trouble source if he roller coasters and only finding the right suppressive will clean it up other action will there are other reasons for roller coaster loss of gain obtained in auditing 3 one must never audit an arc broken pc for minute even but must locate and indicate the bypassed charge at once to do otherwise will injure the pcs case 4 present time problem of long duration prevents good gain and sends the pc into the back track 5 the only reasons pc is critical are withhold or misunderstood word and there is reason other than those and in trying to locate withhold it is not motivator done to the pc but something the pc has done 6 continuing overts hidden from view are the cause of case gain see number 1 suppressive the only other possible reason pc does not gain on standard processing is the pc or the auditor failed to appear for the sessionnow honestly arent those easy but trainee fumbling about with meter and what he learned in bog of unfamiliarity will always tell you it is something else than the above such pull motivators audit arc broken pcs who wont even look at them think roller coaster is caused by eating the wrong cereal and remedy it all with some new wonderful action that collapses the lot assessment you could meter assess the first group 1 to 8 on an auditor and the right one would fall and you could fix it up you could meter assess the second group 1 to 6 on pc and get the right answer every time that would remedy the case you have list in the hco pol ltr form of 26 june 1965 done for review that covers the whole of any errors that can be made on pc scouting both the auditors application and the pcs reaction to the auditing when i tell you these are the answers i mean it i dont use anything else and i catch my sinning auditor or bogged down pc every time to give you an idea of the simplicity of it pc says she is tired and therefore has somatic well that cant be it because its still there so i ask for problem and after few given the pc hasnt changed so its not problem i ask for an arc break and bang i find one knowing the principles of the mind and as i observepcs i see its better but not gone and ask for previous one like it bang thats the one and it blows completely i know that if the pc says its and it doesnt blow it must be something else i know that its one of six things i assess by starting down the list i know when ive got it by looking at the pcs reactions or the meters and i handle it accordingly also quite vitally i know its limited number of things and even more vitally i know by long experience as technician that i can handle it fully and proceed to do so there is magic touch in auditing like the psychiatrist believes there is only skilled touch using known data and applying it until you have an auditor familiar with his tools cases and results you dont have an auditor you have collected confusion of hope and despair rampant amongst nonstable data study drill and familiarity overcome these things skilled technician knows what gets results and gets them so drill them drill into them the above data until they chant them in their sleep and finally comes the dawn they observe the pc before them they apply standard tech and wonderful to behold there are the results of scientology complete tech is in l ron hubbard lrhmlrd copyright 1965 by l ron hubbard all

release further research has revealed additional data concerning releases which makes it necessary to rename the types of release or else deny preclears all the benefits available from states of release as mentioned in earlier lectures there are several intermediate stages of release between level zero and level five i have finally isolated these and they agree with the gradation chart of levels this changes also in some degree the upper levels of academy training materials without actually adding any but only reassigning the same materials to different levels this discovery came out of survey of the only things that could balk case these also are the main things an auditor has to be careful about in pcs further study revealed the state of release to be available on each of these points and therefore both to make releases and better trained auditors these were fitted in to the gradation chart in natural sequence as the dominant points stressed on each level the points are the same as those covered in the current out tech bulletins and lecture they are communication arc breaks ptps ows continuous overts so as to minimize any upset in introducing these additional levels of release we will cease to call release by stages and call them by grades in earlier material and lectures the terms 1st stage release indicated person released anywhere between level zero and level iv second stage release indicated power process release third stage release was one made by orientation processes and fourth stage release meant one made by r6 ew this was before i found that the additional levels were important or obtainable without wiping out the meaning of these stages we will simply cease to use them to designate releases and designate by grades we will then use the exact processes of the grades that obtain the state of release for the preclear and thus keep things straight this then is the new grading type of release type of process grade vii cleargrade vi release r6 ew grade v release power processes grade iv release service facsimiles grade iii release arc break processes old r4h renamed r3h grade ii release ow processes including the joburg grade i release problems processes such as probs intensive or cchs grade 0 release communication processes any one of the above group of processes can and should be run to floating needle and not one command beyond it with auditors warned of the consequences of running beyond the state of release and people easily rehabilitated to the state even if it is overrun it will be found that the state is attainable at each level with smooth auditing this ties smoothly into training as class of auditor is capable of making class of release knowing why people roller coaster potential trouble source and what an sp suppressive person is and by carefully handling training of auditors in accordance with the out tech materials we can easily attain these states for preclears the discovery is actually contained in the first material issued that calls attention to not further auditing releases they could have their arc breaks ptps and overts handled this when i followed it up showed that additional release states existed for these types of phenomena there are some additional processes that can be run at certain levels and as these are proven out they will be added as alternate processes to the level however it will be found that when preclear goes release at grade it will not be advisable to further audit him or her in that grade on an additional process once the phenomena of release has been attained for that grade it may be that if pc fails to go release on the recommended process for that grade another process for that grade included under the type of process for that grade may be used for instance on problems the pc does not go grade i release in the regular buttons of problems intensive other buttons may be found and used or the preclear may be run on rising scale processes or another process listed for that grade all toward the goal of making the pc release from problems you dont run pc on the next grade just because you couldnt release him on the lower grade you run the additional processes of grade until he releases at that grade at grade zero you run comm processes of whatever kind until you have grade release that means communication release then you do the same at grade i and run any version of problems that affects the persons problems until you have grade i release problems release therefore you are releasing the person on certain subjects at each grade the scale can then be written like this grade vii clear bank erased grade vi release whole track releasegrade v release power release grade iv release habit release grade iii release arc release grade ii release overt release grade i release problems release grade 0 release communication release you can readily spot that under each of these headings we have several effective processes in addition to principal process the most indicated processes for these levels are listed in the first list of grades above if former release went release on let us say problems he can be rehabilitated on the problems release and then audited on any of the other grades from iv down in short anyone who went release on one of these grades from iv down may not be audited further on that grade but can be released on any one of the other grades 0 to iv omitting only grade i release problems of course from v power processes on up it becomes improbable to run lower grade but it possibly could be done on some cases however grade vi release r6 ew cant possibly be run below grade vi and on clear theres bank at all only freedom its also noteworthy that its all but impossible to do grade v power processes on former release that has not been fully rehabilitated on the lower grade in training it is therefore necessary to put meter in the hands of student at zero and have him able to clean tone arm action well at level i be able to detect and clean reads at ii and not clean cleans be able to assess at iii and find service facs at iv this means also that at zero you teach the student all about communication its formula and the comm cycle and trs at i you teach repetitive commands problems intensives assessed by an upper class auditor as we used to do and the cchs which pull the person out of problems and into pt at ii you teach student all about study the genus of overts is the misunderstood and ows at iii you teach the student all about arc and arc breaks and assessment and how to do old r4h in full and expertly and at iv you teach the student all about deds and dedexes history of man and justified ows and suppressives and ptss and how to find and run service facs and at v you review the student and classify fully all lower grades and at vi you teach the student all about r6 and how to do r6 ew and as the student moves to vii you teach power processing and give the student the final materials to go on to clear himself as i promised to do some time ago that neats up all training into form that can be firm finally published in eventual book form and which puts the stress on the most important data in auditing parts of the mind codes scales other background data can be woven into the proper levels without overloading any obviously then you teach the student the theory in the certification course and the drills and key processes for the grade in the classification course of the proper level this neats up both training and processing releasing and clearingthis does not prohibit one from handling arc breaks or ptps or overts in rudiments at any level really handling rudiment is just getting the pc going it puts the heavy processes that handle arc breaks in life and the past the problems etc each in its proper level the rule applies that you must not overrun one of these heavy grade processes and must halt it the moment free needle appears on it or if the ta goes out of it and it hasnt released the pc and hasnt been overrun another process can be run for that grade to handle the subject of that grade but i think you will find that the primary process of the grade will do it uniformly if well audited here then is the additional data that belongs on your gradation chart and modernizes it l ron hubbard l rhmlrd copyright 1965 by l ron hubbard all rights

auditor or scientologist it is obvious then that grade certificates for preclears lapse and are longer issued and are replaced by release awards awarding grade ____release when attained it is also obvious that as these states all existed before they were discovered then rehabilitation of former release is addressed to rehabilitating these grades when rehabilitation is done and the state recovered for the pc grade_ release for the grade actually recovered is issued the same rehabilitation processes as issued are used for every type of release preclears were sometimes released in more than one grade and former release is rehabilitated and sold for each grade the pc was formerly released on all grades formerly attained must each one in turn be found and rehabilitated and each one is separately declared by certs awards therefore pc going release on simple qual division checkout must be urged to get rehabilitation as there may be other former release states there and for anyone rehabilitated as former release many other grades as per chart above are available to be audited up to rehabilitation of former release technically you will find just these phenomena as given in the routing chart of auditor 10 and the 22 sept hcob were the subjects of release sometimes pc was according to him released formerly on some other process or subject than those given on the chart you will however find that it relates to one of the grade subjects comm problems ow arc brks service facs as the total of the grades up to iv example pc reads as released on cchs ok that was problems or comm release why it was because pc came to pt away from his problems of the past or because pc got into comm with the universe just decide which example pc checks as released on the button importance run in brackets or concepts this wasnt any grade vl release it was probably problems that were cleaned up or even ows therefore it was grade i or ii you have to see which release grade it was and thats easy since the pc will tell you even without your asking that he got over his arc breaks or his problems didnt worry him on oldtime processes r212 rising scale even engram running the point where release was attained was because comm block problem an ow an arc break cleaned up it wasnt the old process that determines the grade the pc was formerly released at so much as which of the grade subjects were relieved at the timeerror the biggest error you can make in rehabilitation of former release is to grade him too high and bypass available charge for further releasing in the earlier grades you can go from grade iv release to grade 0 release to grade ii etc they are not entirely consecutive from 0 to iv they are from v up for instance you rehabilitate pc as grade ii release overts and withholds by standard rehab approach he is then declared grade ii release of course however he can be run on comm processes to obtain grade 0 release or on problems to obtain grade i release and better had be as we have formerly released so many on so many different processes the background for rehabilitation is ragged at this time new people can be moved up smoothly from zero to iv older scientologists will go up and down from zero to iv you will find at times that somebody you are trying to audit to certain grade suddenly recalls being released at that grade the proper action then is rehabilitation of the grade not continuing to run the grade all this is really quite simple the biggest error is and will continue to be not noticing state of release occurring while running process and then overrunning it and engulfing it you dont always see the free floating needleit is at times brief nerves for while auditors will be very nervy and err by underrunning processes and failing to flatten them some auditors will see floating needle everywhere some will remain blind to them and grind on and on the thing to do is eventually find the happy medium dont underrun or overrun just notice when the process has produced floating needle and carry on when it has not and listen for those big pc upsurges in tone and halt there and watch for the rising tone arm that goes to 5 mostly its an overrun but some pcs who always were at 5 werent ever formerly released and will need power processes to get them started power processing also combines lot of lower grade results but it is hard to power process pcs who have never had lower grade releasing the power processing becomes very lengthy however real tough cases cant attain lower grade release states and so have to be power processed at once instead of after properly attaining the lower grades these at once power process cases who have had former release grade are pretty suppressive however some pcs tone arms can be at 5 and the pc can act suppressive if it all stems from unnoticed lower grade releasing that was never observed or rehabilitated it is interesting that grade v release power process cannot thereafter be processed below his grade but this is new set of processes you wont find any former release grade vs they just never made grade v before even by accident grade vi releases r6 ew dont easily respond thereafter to power processes but remember thats grade vi release not somebody who came up with few bits of r6 ewyou cant run grade vii clear on anything but he can be drilled on getting about the universe and getting familiar with himself and what he can do grades vi and vii really cannot be successfully audited except by oneselfsolo if somebody else did audit them on pc the pc would not prosper hed be fool and quite confused these grades vi and vii require knowledge without it its pitiful auditors who have tried to audit raw meat pcs on these grades have gotten into serious messes not with us but in their own activities all stemming from trying to make baby be vice president in six easy lessons two such auditors blew scientologythey themselves had real data or release grade or even case gain yet they tried to use vi materials on raw meat and it all went wrong and the pcs today mostly snarl and natter their way is barred by their antagonism it takes real thetan to stand up

fellow who commits daily harmful acts hell never make it criminal pilfering the cash box once week has himself stopped cold as far as case gains are concerned in 1954 i counted some noses i checked up on 21 cases who had never had any gains since 1950 17 turned out to be criminals the other 4 were beyond the reach of investigation that gave my first clue for some years then i watched for nogain cases and carefully followed up those that i could they had major or minor criminal backgrounds this gave the 1959 breakthrough on the meter checks sec checking following it further since 1959 i have finally amassed enough histories to state the person who is not getting case gains is committing continuing overts while this sounds like very good out for us we assume that the auditor at least tried something sensible todaythe running of pc by grades is saving grace for merely tough cases directors of processing are doing well with the modern graded process approach level by level and the d of p washington has just told they were cracking cases with the lowest grade processes dc had never been able to handle well before so given processing by grades the best case approach weve ever had we crack the rough ones but will that be all cases theres still one the case who continually commits overts before during and after processing he wont make it one thing helps this however you have seen the ethics codes appearby putting bit of control in the scientology environment we have enough threat to restrain dramatization the phenomena is this the reactive bank can exert stress on the pc if it is not obeyed discipline must exert just shade more stress against dramatization than the bank does this checks the performance of the continual overt long enough to let processing bite not everyone is continuous overt committer by thousand to one but this phenomenon is not confined to the nogain case the slow gain case is also committing overts the auditor doesnt see therefore little discipline in the environment speeds the slow gain case the one were more interested in the nogain case frankly is one i am not panting to solve if fellow wants to sell his next hundred trillion for the sake of the broken toy he stole im afraid i cant be bothered i have contract with any big thetan to save the world complete it is enough for to know 1 where bottom is and 2 how to help speed slow gain cases bottom is the chap who eats your lunch apple and says the children did it bottom is the fellow who sows the environment with secret suppressive acts and vicious generalities the slow gain case responds to bit of keep your nose clean please while i apply the thetanbooster the fast gain case does his job and doesnt give hoot about threatened discipline if its fair and the fast gain case helps out and the fast gain case can be helped by more orderly environment the good worker works more happily when bad workers see the pitfalls and desist from distracting him so we all win the nogain case well he sure doesnt deserve any gain one pc in thousand and he yaps and groans and says prove it works and blames us and raises hell he makes us think we fail look down in our sthil files there are actually thousands upon thousands of scientologists there who each one comment on how wonderful it is and how good they feel there are few dozen or so who howl they havent been helped what ratio yet i believe some on staff think we have lot of dissatisfied people these nogain characters strew so much entheta around that we think we fail look in the saint hill files sometime those many thousands of reports continue to pour in from around the world with hurrah only the few dozen groan but long ago i closed my book on the nogain case each of those few dozen nogains tell frightening lies to little children pour ink on shoes say how abused they are while tearing the guts out of those unlucky enough to be around them they are suppressive persons every one i know ive seen them all the way down to the little clinker they call their soul and i dont like what i saw the people who come to you with wild discreditable rumours who seek to tear peoples attention off scientology who chew up orgs are suppressive personswell give them good rock and let them suppress it i cant end this hco b without confession i know how to cure them rather easily maybe ill never let it be done for had they had

briefing to review auditors there are three key data that go out in an org and therefore are essential to be known by the department of review that lrh hasnt been able to teach tech qual or orgs you will hit them in review because one else will have gotten them 1 high ta is overrun there is other reason for high ta reviews problem is to find what was overrun and how it was overrun when someone comes in who has never been audited and who has never been near another therapy or practice and whose ta is at 50 he has still been overrun on something you just have your work cut out for you in finding it dont throw away the datum the way everyone else has using this datum you are likely to find some interesting things say someone went release on christianity at age six or on exercise at age twenty and then went on past that point doing it some more releases dont only happen in scientology it is likely to be some wisdom or therapy that released him they are all failed technologies all past wisdoms may have had technologies that have been alterised and lost we almost went that route by not recognizing the state of release and the phenomenon of the fn what has been overrun is not necessarily what the pc was running when the ta went high you might have overrun some earlier release it may for instance be restimulation of an earlier overrun communication release the pc could have been problems release and gotten keyed in again on ruds question if the hgc or field auditor didnt repair it by asking as first question what was overrun they would never solve it they would get the wrong overrun you must find what exactly the release was on which or what one was it get the right when and the right what and the ta will blow down and the needle will float youve got to rehab the right release to get the high ta down there could be other overruns on the case too but there is one that is making the high ta get that and the rehab tech will get it to fn quickly or less quickly 2 rollercoaster case has an sp in the vicinity the anatomy of the pts is that of problem postulatecounterpostulate the persons purpose postulate has been or is being suppressed counterpostulate there is other source of rollercoaster an sp gives the pts problem when the pc rollercoasters he has run into postulatecounterpostulate situation since his last gain pts really does make trouble for the auditor the org and himself ethics exists to get tech in if it is ever used to throw tech out it is being used suppressively search and discovery is used to find the suppressions that person has had in life the s and d question is 1 whats been your main purpose in life 2 who opposed it this often makes problems release in minutes with pts or with any problem you want to solve find the source of the counterpostulate man gets solutions to problems he leaves the two opposed postulates in place not knowing the definition of problem and then solves the resulting collision as in dialectical materialism the anatomy of problem gone mad any idea is the product of two forces is the backbone of dialectical materialism to solve problem look over the whole perimeter of counterpostulates and find what is the source of the problem if you handle the problem for the pc often the problem will evaporate for the other person also problems sometimes evaporate in the physical universe when you find the source of the counterpostulate in ethics when you see that the disconnection or the handle causes an enormous problem for the pts or for the other person from whom they are disconnecting you have invariably found the wrong person pts is the manifestation ofa postulatecounterpostulate find who when where and what you could list what purpose of yours has been thwarted you can get grade i release with this suppressives are now to be ated in review because ethics has flubbed it too much ptss go to ethics after review to have note made of the fact that they ar pts and to get statement made of handle or disconnect pts condition can be caused by suppressive action as well as by suppressive person for instance if you overrun pc past release the pc goes pts to the auditor just as mechanical action selfauditing is potential hidden source of overrun you dont declare the auditor an sp it was suppressive act thats all the definition of pts is connected to suppressive person or action the action could be inadvertent so you find the suppressive person the person may have only been suppressive for five minutes or he may have been suppressive for lifetime someone could be pts and overrun in that case you must get the suppression off and rehab the process suppressive person isnt someone with horns it is someone who has had counter postulate to the pc person may occasionally commit suppressive acts or he may be habitually suppressive someone who is routinely suppressive in life invalidative of scientology and trying to keep people from getting well is social menace he is the subject of ethics he is the one who gets declared not the auditor who overran process from some inadvertent or stupid mistake when you tell person the right sp it is like locating and indicating bpc you should get blowdown and gis if the pc again rollercoasters youve got another sp so there could be several sps on the case you dont go looking for all of them at the same time but after you find one suppressive look for another one if you found all the sps and suppressive actions in persons lifetime he would be problems release and if he goes release on problems he wont go pts again unless he goes home and starts selfauditing he can overrun himself on selfauditing so be aware of that 3 the source of overts is an earlier misunderstood word the source of the overt is the other key datum that has been missed misunderstood word causes individuation which leads to overts the word that student is arguing with the course supervisor about is later than the one that the student really misunderstood any confusion stupidity or upset in study always stems from misunderstood word earlier than the one he is upset about it is always earlier so the source of the overt is in the formula 1 something is misunderstood 2 the person individuates 3 he commits overts against the misunderstood thing if what the person thought was the misunderstood was the misunderstood the problem would have blown so it is always earlier this datum is the key datum in the area of study and comprehension of existence it regulates persons iq the review action is to look for the earlier area and the earlier word that was misunderstood cf method 1 word clearing you can unburden few words earlier than where you think the misunderstood word is then get the misunderstood just before it you can date the time of the misunderstood you should ask what subject the pc was in person isnt upset with studying it is only misunderstood word it is not case and it is not the environment remember that you are handling fringes on endwords so dont push all the way back into r6 just find what was happening before he hit the thing he doesnt understandso these three data are the only ones that are really important in review 1 high ta overrun 2 rollercoaster pts who is the sp that question is the source of hangups on the track you must find the counterpostulate and the source of the counterpostulate 3 confusion

the person is sent again to review as the right sp has not been found further until the person has paid in cash for the review search and discovery ethics may not declare the person longer pts the reason for this is that the person will not pay if the wrong suppressive is found hgc auditors similarly must send pts to review not ethics supervisors must send any student pts only to review review always sends to ethics but only when the right sp has been found and indicated review auditor the review auditor uses search and discovery as will be covered in an hco b if this is not to hand simply

rehabilitation is one in which the auditor discounts the value of his own auditing keys out lock in prescientology period and tells the pc he was release sometime before he was audited auditors have declared pcs released when 9 days old or in 1942 or almost any earlier time all through noncomprehension of the phenomenon of release it leaves some pretty puzzled pcs too when you fell on your head when you were five you were former release because i now have floating needle this auditor statement betrays lack of comprehension of the phenomenon of release of course if you key out major lock you may today get release state because the needle floats today does not mean it was floating just before the pc fell on his head at the age of 5 the pc today with better understanding through auditing can attain release by keying out an incident which made him worse than normal his needle was not floating before he gagged on his bottle at the age of two blowing the lock of gagging on his bottle may now added to his new study the auditors interest and the very powerful technology of just basic auditing make him go release an auditor doing this is downgrading his own presence skill and comm cycle these added to blowing lock make release todayit does not make release years before the pc was ever audited ive never seen natural floating needle in the absence of auditing i never expect to people are normal worried neurotic or psychotic hobby therapy change of surroundings taking up tapestry can move person upscale toward normal they never moved anyone up to release becoming happier doesnt key out bank it causes person to occlude keyedin bankto forget it only auditing keys out bank and an auditor doing rehabilitation using meter using comm cycle using his knowledge of the mind is doing something that was not done before and he makes releases he makes them today by keying out yesterday he does not make them years ago he is not auditing years ago he is auditing todays pc today and making todays release todaylife keys out locks trillions of years of living never undid moment of it come off the mystic mystic kick that one can if he lives long enough experience himself to release or clear thats trap do not unduly complicate your actions in release rehabilitation by misassigning the pcs period of release if you do hell be confused as the datum given him is false if you find in asking for period of release that you get prescientology times realize the pc has found something which if released would cause him to go release today youd get the same response if you asked what period would i have to contact to get you released or give major time of keyin or give major time of change or do problems intensive assessment or do an arc break of former times assessment youll come up with the same date for it treat that period with rehab processes or any of many other processes and youll get the phenomenon of release right before your eyes so dont be telling pcs you were release before you were ever audited i see here you were release just before you fell in the garbage can at two both statements are false lasting results are based on truth alone do what youre doing

to review auditors level iv search and discovery prerequisite knowledge of ethics definitions and purposes the process called search and discovery requires as well good knowledge of ethics one must know what suppressive person is what potential trouble source is and the mechanism of how and why case roller coasters and what that is all this data exists in ethics policy letters and should be studied well before one attempts search and discovery or further study of this hcob ethics is not merely legal actionit handles the whole phenomena of case worsening roller coaster after processing and without this technology an auditor easily becomes baffled and tends to plunge and squirrel the only reason case roller coasters after good standard auditing is the pts phenomena and suppressive is present three types there are three types of pts type one is the easy one the sp on the case is right in present time actively suppressing the person type two is harder for the apparent suppressive person in present time is only restimulator for the actual suppressive type three is beyond the facilities of orgs not equipped with hospitals as these are entirely psychotic handling type one pts the type one is normally handled by an ethics officer in the course of hearing the person is asked if anyone is invalidating him or his gains or scientology and if the pc answers with name and is then told to handle or disconnect from that person the good indicators come in promptly and the person is quite satisfied if however there is success in finding the sp on the case or if the person starts naming org personnel or other unlikely persons as sp the ethics officer must realize that he is handling type two pts and because the auditing will consume time sends the person to tech or qual for search and discovery it is easy to tell type one pts from type two the type one brightens up at once and ceases to roller coaster the moment the present time sp is spotted the pc ceases to roller coaster the pc does not go back on it and begin to beg off the pc does not begin to worry about the consequences of disconnection if the pc does any of these things then the pc is type twoit can be seen that ethics handles the majority of ptss in fast manner there is trouble about it all goes smoothly it can also be seen that ethics cannot afford the time to handle type two pts and there is reason the type two should not pay well for the auditing therefore when ethics finds its type one approach does not work quickly ethics must send the person to the proper division that is handling search and discovery type two the pc who isnt sure wont disconnect or still roller coasters or who doesnt brighten up cant name any sp at all is type two only search and discovery will help search and discovery the first thing to know is that case worsening is caused only by pts situation there never will be any other reason as soon as you doubt this datum and think about other causes or try to explain it some other way you longer prevent cases from worsening and longer rescue those who have worsened the second thing to know is that suppressive is always person being or group of beings suppressive is not condition problem postulate problems and counterpostulates come into the matter but the sp as being or group must always be located as being or group not as merely an idea as the technology is close to and similar to that of service facsimile poorly trained auditor can get confused between them and produce condition he says is the cause persons who cannot confront and who therefore see persons as ideas not people are the ones most likely to fail in doing search and discovery the third thing to know is that there can be an actual sp and another person or being similar to the actual one who is only an apparent sp an actual sp actually suppresses another an apparent sp only reminds the pc of the actual one and so is restimulated into being pts the actual sp can be in present time type one pts or is in the past or distant type two pts the type two always has an apparent sp who is not the sp on the case is confusing the two and is acting pts only because of restimulation not because of suppression search and discovery as process is done exactly by the general rules of listing one lists for persons or groups who are or have suppressed the pc the list is complete when only one item reads on nulling and this is the itemif the item turns out to be group one does second list of who or what would represent that group gets the list long enough to leave on nulling only one item reading and that is the sp an incident is not person or group condition is not person or group and group is not person what you want is one being the emeter signs are unmistakable and the good indicators come in strongly when the actual sp is found this is the entire action it is liable to the various ills and errors of writing and nulling list such as overlisting underlisting arc breaking the pc by bypassing the item or getting an incomplete list these are avoided by knowing ones business as an auditor and being able to handle an emeter with skill and confidence when one goofs on search and discovery and finds the wrong actual sp the signs are the same as those where type two is handled as type onenot sure good indicators roller coasters again etc the actual sp can be back track but it is seldom vital to go far out of pt and usual for lifetime person to turn up done correctly the pcs good indicators come in at once the pc cognites the meter reacts very well with blowdowns and repeated long falls and the pc ceases to roller coaster care should be taken not to get too enthusiastic in going far back track on the pc as you run into whole track implants etc easily handleable only at level v the pc can get over whumped if you go too far back and youll wish you hadnt this normally happens however only when the pc has been arc broken by the auditor when the right item has been by passed and the list is overlong or when 2 or 3 items are still reading on the list incomplete list locating service facsimile is quite similar to search and discovery but they are different processes entirely only the doingness is similar in search and discovery the end product is being in service facsimile the end product is an item or concept or idea dont get the two mixed handling type three the type three pts is mostly in institutions or would be in this case the type twos apparent sp is spread all over the world and is often more than all the people there arefor the person sometimes has ghosts about him or demons and they are just more apparent sps but imaginary as beings as well all institutional cases are ptss the whole of insanity is wrapped up in this one fact the insane is not just bad off being the insane is being who has been overwhelmed by an actual sp until too many persons are apparent sps this makes the person roller coaster continually in life the roller coaster is even cyclic repetitive as cycle handling an insane person as type two might work but probably not case for case one might get enough wins on few to make one fail completely by so many loses on the manyjust as you tell type two to disconnect from the actual sp wherever found on the track you must disconnect the person from the environment putting the person in current institution puts him in bedlam and when also treated it may finish him for he will roller coaster from any treatment given until made into type two and given search and discovery the task with type three is not treatment as such it is to provide relatively safe environment and quiet and rest and treatment of mental nature at all giving him quiet court with motionless object in it might do the trick if he is permitted to sit there unmolested medical care of very unbrutal nature is necessary as intravenous feeding and soporifics sleeping and quietening drugs may be necessary such persons are sometimes also physically ill from an illness with known medical cure treatment with drugs shock operation is just more suppression the person will not really get well will relapse etc standard auditing on such person is subject to the roller coaster phenomena they get worse after getting better successes are sporadic enough to lead one on and usually worsen again since these people are pts but removed from apparent sps kept in quiet surroundings not pestered or threatened or put in fear the person comes up to type two and search and discovery should end the matter but there will always be some failures as the insane sometimes withdraw into rigid unawareness as final defense sometimes cant be kept alive and sometimes are too hectic and distraught to ever become quiet the extremes of too quiet and never quiet have number of psychiatric names such as catatonia withdrawn totally and manic too hectic classification is interesting but nonproductive since they are all pts all will roller coaster and none can be trained or processed with any idea of lasting result matter the temporary miracle remove type three pts from the environment give him or her rest and quiet do search and discovery when rest and quiet have made the person type two note these paragraphs on the type three make good promise given in dianetics the modern science of mental health to develop institutional dianetics the modern mental hospital with its brutality and suppressive treatments is not the way to give psychotic quiet and rest before anything effective can be done in this field proper institution would have to be provided offering only rest quiet and medical assistance for intravenous feedings and sleeping draughts where necessary but not as treatment and where treatment is attempted until the person looks recovered and only then search and discovery as above under type two l ron hubbard lrhepcden copyright 1965 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard

were an origin by the pc when it happens and querying it by asking whats happening this twoway comm is not tone 40 commands smoothly enforced physically when necessary tone 40 full intention auditing position auditor and pc ambulant auditor in physical contact with pc as needed process purpose to demonstrate to pc that his body can be controlled and thus inviting him to control it to orient him in his present time environment to increase his ability to duplicate and thusly increase his havingness absolute auditor precision drops from tone 40 flubs total present time auditor on pcs right side auditor body acts as block to forward motion when pc turns auditor gives command gives pc moment to obey then enforces command with physical contact of exactly correct force to get command executed auditor does not block pc from executing commands method of introduction as in cch l freezes may be introduced at the end of cycle this being after the thank you and before the next command maintaining solid comm line to ascertain information from the pc or to bridge from the process this being the acknowledgement thank you after the command turn around cch 1 and cch 2 were developed by l ron hubbard in washington dc in 1957 for the 19th acc cch 3 name hand space mimicry auditing commands auditor raises 2 hands palms facing pcs about an equal distance between the auditor and pc and says put your hands against mine follow them and contribute to their motion he then makes simple motion with right hand then left did you contribute to their motion acknowledge answer auditor allows pc to break solid comm line when this is flat the auditor does this same with half inch of space between his and the pcs palms the command being put your hands facing mine about 12 inch away follow them and contribute to their motion did you contribute to their motion acknowledge when this is flat auditor does it with wider space and so on until pc is able to follow motions yard away auditing position auditor and pc seated close together facing each other pcs knees between auditors kneesprocess purpose to develop reality on the auditor using the reality scale solid communication line to get pc into communication by control and duplication to find auditor auditor should be gentle and accurate in his motions all motions being tone 40 giving pc wins to be free in 2way communication process is introduced and run as formal process if pc dopes off in this process auditor may take pcs wrist and help him execute the command one hand at time if pc does not answer during anaten to question did you contribute to their motion auditor may wait for normal comm lag of that pc acknowledge and continue process tone 40 motion intention without reservation twoway communication one questionthe right one history developed by l ron hubbard in washington dc 1956 as therapeutic version of dummy hand mimicry something was needed to supplant look at who am i and find the auditor part of rudiments cch 4 name book mimicry auditing commands there are set verbal commands auditor makes simple motions with book hands book to the pc pc makes motion duplicating auditors mirrorimagewise auditor asks pc if he is satisfied that the pc duplicated the motion if pc is and auditor is also fully satisfied auditor takes back the book and goes to next command if pc is not sure that he duplicated any command auditor repeats it for him and gives him back the book if pc is sure he did and auditor can see duplication is pretty wrong auditor accepts pcs answer and continues on gradient scale of motion either with the left or right hand till pc can do original command correctly this ensures invalidation of the pc tone 40 only in motions verbal 2way quite free auditing position auditor and pc seated facing each other comfortable distance apart process purpose to bring up pcs communication with control and duplication control and duplication communication give pc wins it is necessary for auditor to duplicate his own commands circular motions are more complex than straight lines tolerance of plus or minus randomity is apparent here and the auditor should probably begin on the pc with motions that begin in the same place each time and are neither very fast nor very slow nor very complex introduced by the auditor seeing that pc understands what is to be done as there is

originally misdated as 1 march 1965 remimeo post public hco division 1 ethics suppressive acts suppression of scientology and scientologists the fair game law due to the extreme urgency of our mission i have worked to remove some of the fundamental barriers from our progress the chief stumbling block huge above all others is the upset we have with potential trouble sources and their relationship to suppressive persons or groups potential trouble source is defined as person who while active in scientology or pc yet remains connected to person or group that is suppressive person or group suppressive person or group is one that actively seeks to suppress or damage scientology or scientologist by suppressive acts suppressive acts are acts calculated to impede or destroy scientology or scientologist and which are listed at length in this policy letter scientologist caught in the situation of being in scientology while still connected with suppressive person or group is given present time problem of sufficient magnitude to prevent case gain as only ptp can halt progress of case only arc breaks worsen it to the ptp is added arc breaks with the suppressive person or group the result is nogain or deterioration of case by reason of the suppressive connection in the environment any scientologist in his own experience can probably recall some such cases and their subsequent upset until the environment is handled nothing beneficial can happen quite the contrary in the most flagrant of such cases the scientologists case worsened and the suppressive person or group sent endless reports to press police authorities and the public in general unless the potential trouble source the preclear caught up in this can be made to take action of an environmental nature to end the situation one has pc or scientologist who may cave in or squirrel because of case gain and also hostile environment for scientology this policy letter gives the means and provides the policy for getting the above situation handled potential trouble source may receive processing until the situation is handleda suppressive person or group becomes fair game by fair game is meant may not be further protected by the codes and disciplines of scientology or the rights of scientologist the families and adherents of suppressive persons or groups may not receive processing it does not matter whether they are or are not scientologists if the families or adherents of suppressive persons or groups are processed any auditor doing so is guilty of misdemeanor see hco policy letter of 7 march 1965 issue 11 potential trouble source knowingly permitting himself or herself or the suppressive person to be processed without advising the auditor or scientology authorities is guilty of crime see hco policy letter of 7 march 1965 issue ii suppressive acts suppressive acts are defined as actions or omissions undertaken to knowingly suppress reduce or impede scientology or scientologists such suppressive acts include public disavowal of scientology or scientologists in good standing with scientology organizations public statements against scientology or scientologists but not to committees of evidence duly convened proposing advising or voting for legislation or ordinances rules or laws directed toward the suppression of scientology pronouncing scientologists guilty of the practice of standard scientology testifying hostilely before state or public inquiries into scientology to suppress it reporting or threatenirig to report scientology or scientologists to civil authorities in an effort to suppress scientology or scientologists from practising or receiving standard scientology bringing civil suit against any scientology organization or scientologist including the nonpayment of bills or failure to refund without first calling the matter to the attention of the chairman at saint hill and receiving reply demanding the return of any or all fees paid for standard training or processing actually received or received in part and still available but undelivered only because of departure of the person demanding the fees must be refunded but this policy letter applies writing anti scientology letters to the press or giving antiscientology or antiscientologist evidence to the press testifying as hostile witness against scientology in public continued membership in divergent group continued adherence to person or group pronounced suppressive person or group by hco failure to handle or disavow and disconnect from person demonstrably guilty of suppressive acts being at the hire of antiscientology groups or persons organizing splinter group to use scientology data or any part of it to distract people from standard scientology organizing splinter groups to diverge from scientology practices still calling it scientology or calling it something else calling meetings of staffs or field auditors or the public to deliver scientology into the hands of unauthorized persons or who will suppress it or alter it or who have reputation for following standard lines and procedures infiltrating scientology group or organization or staff to stir up discontent or protest at the instigation of hostile forces 1st degree murder arson disintegration of persons or belongings mutiny seeking to splinter off an area of scientology and deny it properly constituted authority for personal profit personal power or to save the organization from the higher officers of scientology engaging in malicious rumourmongering to destroy the authority or repute of higher officers or the leading names of scientology or to safeguard position delivering up the person of scientologist without defense or protest to the demands of civil or criminal law falsifying records that then imperil the liberty or safety of scientologist knowingly giving false testimony to imperil scientologist receiving money favours or encouragement to suppress scientology or scientologists sexual or sexually perverted conduct contrary to the well being or good state of mind of scientologist in good standing or under the charge of scientology such as student preclean ward or patient blackmail of scientologists or scientology organizations threatened or accomplishedin which case the crime being used for blackmail purposes becomes fully outside the reach of ethics and is absolved the fact of blackmail unless repeatedsuppressive acts are clearly those covert or overt acts knowingly calculated to reduce or destroy the influence or activities of scientology or prevent case gains or continued scientology success and activity on the part of scientologist as persons or groups that would do such thing act out of self interest only to the detriment of all others they cannot be granted the rights and beingness ordinarily accorded rational beings and so place themselves beyond any consideration for their feelings or well being if person or group that has committed suppressive act comes to his her or their senses and recants the hco secretary tells the person or group to stop committing present time overts and to cease all attacks and suppressions so he she or they can get case gain b requires public announcement to the effect that they realize their actions were ignorant and unfounded and stating where possible the influences or motivations which caused them to attempt to suppress or attack scientology gets it signed before witnesses and published broadly particularly to persons directly influenced or formerly associated with the former offender or offenders the letter should be calculated to expose any conspiracy to suppress scientology or the preclear or scientologist if such existed b1requires that all debts owed to scientology organizations are paid off c requires training beginning at has at their expense if division 4 training and processing will have the person or the group members d makes note of the matter with copies of the statement and file in the ethics files informs the chairman at saint hill and forwards duplicate of the original copy which shows signatures any potential trouble source owing money to any scientology organization is handled the same as any other scientologist failure to discharge financial obligation becomes civil ethics matter after normal withinorg avenues of collection have been exhausted any pts who fails to either handle or disconnect from the sp who is making him or her pts is by failing to do so guilty of suppressive act civil court action against sps to effect collection of monies owed may be resorted to as they are fair game until suppressive person or group is absolved but not during the period when the person requests and has committee of evidence or an amnesty occurs scientology ethics other than this hco policy letter applies to such persons committee of evidence may be called to punish any scientologist or person for any offenses of any kind against the suppressive person except to establish in cases of real dispute whether or not the person was suppressing either scientology or the scientologist the homes property places and abodes of persons who have been active in attempting to suppress scientology or scientologists are all beyond any protection of scientology ethics unless absolved by later ethics or an amnesty such persons are in the same category as those whose certificates have been cancelled and persons whose certificates classifications and awards have been cancelled are also in this categorythe imagination must not be stretched to place this iabel on person errors misdemeanors and crimes do not label person as suppressive person or group only high crimes do so committee of evidence may be called by any convening authority who wishes more concrete evidence of efforts to suppress scientology or scientologists but if such committees findings passed on establish beyond reasonable doubt suppressive acts this policy letter applies and the person is fair game outright or covert acts knowingly designed to impede or destroy scientology or scientologists is what is meant by acts suppressive of scientology or scientologists the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics requires that actions destructive of the advance of the many by scientology means overtly or covertly undertaken with the direct target of destroying scientology as whole or scientologist in particular be summarily handled due to the character of the reactive mind and the consequent impulses of the insane or near insane to ruin every chance of mankind via scientology potential trouble source scientologist connected by familial or other ties to person who is guilty of suppressive acts is known as potential trouble source or trouble source the history of dianetics and scientology is strewn with these confused by emotional ties dogged in refusing to give up scientology yet invalidated by suppressive person at every turn they cannot having ptp make case gains if they would act with determination one way or the other reform the suppressive person or disconnect they could then make gains and recover their potential if they make determined move they eventually succumb therefore this policy letter extends to suppressive nonscientology wives and husbands and parents or other family members or hostile groups or even close friends so long as wife or husband father or mother or other family connection who is attempting to suppress the scientology spouse or child or hostile group remains continuingly acknowledged or in communication with the scientology spouse or child or member then that scientologist or preclear comes under the family or adherent clause and may not be processed or further trained until he or she has taken appropriate action to cease to be potential trouble source the validity of this policy is borne out by the fact that the us government raids and other troubles were instigated by wives husbands or parents who were actively suppressing scientologist or scientology the suppressed scientologist did not act in good time to avert the trouble by handling the antagonistic family member as suppressive source or disconnect fully disconnection from family member or cessation of adherence to suppressive person or group is done by the potential trouble source publicly publishing the fact as in the legal notices of the auditor and public announcements and taking any required civil action such as disavowal separation or divorce and thereafter cutting all further communication and disassociating from the person or group unwarranted or threatened disconnection has the recourse of the person or group being disconnected from requesting committee of evidence from the nearest convening authority or hco and producing to the committee any evidence of actual material assistance to scientology without reservation or bad intent the committee must be convened if requested before publicly disconnecting the scientologist would be well advised to fully inform the person he or she accuses of suppressive acts of the substance of this policy letter and seek reform of the person disconnecting only when honest efforts to reform the person have not been cooperated with or have failed and only then disconnecting publicly such efforts should not be unduly long as any processing of the potential trouble source is denied or illegalwhile the connection exists and person not actively seeking to settle the matter may be subjected to committee of evidence if processed meanwhile the real motives of suppressive persons have been traced to quite sordid hidden desires in one case the wife wanted her husbands death so she could get his money and fought scientology because it was making the husband well without handling the wife or the connection with the woman the scientologist as family drifted on with the situation and the wife was able to cause near destruction of scientology in that area by false testimony to the police and government and press therefore this is serious thingto tolerate or remain connected to source of active suppression of scientologist or scientology without legally disconnecting the relationship or acting to expose the true motives behind the hostility and reform the person money particularly may be accepted as fee or loan from person who is family to suppressive person and therefore potential trouble source there is source of trouble in scientologys history greater than this one for frequency and lack of attention anyone absolved of suppressive acts by an amnesty or committee of evidence ceases to be fair game anyone found guilty of suppressive acts by committee of evidence and its convening authorities remains fair game unless saved by an amnesty this policy letter is calculated to prevent future distractions of this nature as time goes on rights of suppressive person or group truly suppressive person or group has rights of any kind as scientologists and actions taken against them are not punishable under scientology ethics codes however person or group may be falsely labelled suppressive person or group should the person or group claim the label to be false he she or they may request committee of evidence via their nearest hco the executive with the power to convene committee of evidence must do so if one is requested for recourse or redress of wrongs the person or representative of the group labelled suppressive is named as an interested party to the committee they attend it where it convenes the committee must pay attention to any actual evidences that the person or group that is accused of being suppressive may produce particularly to the effect of having helped scientology or scientologists or scientologist and if this is seen to outweigh the accusations proof or lack of it the person is absolved any knowingly false testimony forgeries or false witnesses introduced by the person or group accused of being suppressive can result in an immediate finding against the person or group any effort to use copies of the testimony or findings of committee of evidence called for this purpose or holding it to scorn in civil court immediately reverses any favourable finding and automatically labels the person or group suppressive failing to prove guilt of suppressive acts the committee must absolve the person or group publicly if the findings as passed upon by the convening authority demonstrate guilt the person or group is so labelled as suppressive person or group recourse of potential trouble sourcea person labelled potential trouble source and so barred from receiving auditing may request committee of evidence of the nearest hco as recourse if he or she contests the allegation the committee of evidence requested must be convened by the nearest convening authority if evidences of disconnection are given or if the alleged suppressive person or group is clearly and beyond reasonable doubt shown not to be guilty of suppressive acts or is shown clearly to have reformed the committee of evidence findings and the convening authority must remove the label of potential trouble source from the scientologist and the label suppressive person or group from the suspected person or group but should the former potential trouble sources state of case show gain after reasonable time in processing any executive of division 4 training and processing may order new committee of evidence in the matter and if it and its convening authority reverses the former findings the labels are applied but auditor may be disciplined for auditing either during the period between the two findings recourse of an auditor an auditor disciplined for processing potential trouble source or suppressive person or member of suppressive group may request committee of evidence if he can persuade the potential trouble source and the suppressive person or representative of the suppressive group to appear before it the auditor so requesting may also have named as an interested party or parties with himself the person or persons who supplied the information or misinformation concerning his actions damages or costs may be borne by or ordered by committee of evidence in cases involving potential trouble sources or suppressive persons or groups when the potential trouble source or suppressive person or group representative fail to appear before committee of evidence on bill of particulars labelling persons as potential trouble sources or suppressive persons or groups at the published time of its convening the bill of particulars stand as proven and the convening authority is bound so to declare evidence of disconnection any hco secretary may receive evidences of disconnection or disavowal or separation or divorce and on finding them to be bona fide may publicly announce them on public board and legal notices in the auditor the hco secretary must place copies of such evidences in the ethics file and in the cf folders of all persons named in them the disconnecting person then ceases to be potential trouble source the procedure for recanting suppressive person or group is outlined above evidences of suppression it is wise for any scientologist hco secretary or committee of evidence in matters concerning suppressive acts to obtain valid documents letters testimonies duly signed and witnessed affadavits duly sworn to and other matters and evidences which would have weightin court of law momentary spite slander suits charges of scientology separating families etc are then guarded against if matters concerning suppressive acts are given good and alert attention properly enforced they will greatly accelerate the growth of scientology and bring new calmness to its people and organizations and far better case gains where they have not heretofore been easy to achieve preclears with present time problems arc broken with associated but suppressive persons will not obtain case gains but on the contrary may experience great difficulty observance of these facts and disciplines can help us all l ron hubbard lrhmlcden copyright 1965 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications

minimum per day assists scientology processing very markedly data on vitamin applied to other fields is available from webber pharmaceuticals ltd 14 ronson drive rexdale ontario canada an excellent popular book on vitamin in its various uses is available from booksellers it is your key to healthy heart the suppressed record of vitamin by herbert bailey published by the shilton company philadelphia the shute foundation for medical research london ontario canada pioneered the subject and will give general advice in johannesburg due to high altitude pc may be processed who is not taking at least 600 mg per day of vitamin the apparent action of this vitamin is to oxygenate the blood and inhibit the body from pulling in mental masses due to oxygenenergy starvation in areas where it is against the law to recommend vitamins this hco b does not apply vitamin according to bailey is suppressed because it cures heart disease which furnishes 50 of the revenue of the us medical doctor i read the book by bailey and did some experimental work with vitamin with interesting success webber pharmaceuticals has airmailed further literature it is useless i believe to take less than 600 mg per day and lesser doses have little or reaction on processing one has to take it for two or three days before it begins to have any effect the most direct result is quite measurable on an emeter reads of the needle become longer tone arm action increases it works by itself but is best taken with an oldtime guk bomb the formula of the bomb is variable but is basically 100 mg of vitamin b1 15 gr of calcium 500 mg of vitamin c if you add 100 mg of oldtime nicotinic acid not niacinamide and take it daily it becomes dianazene for radiation prevention dont include nicotinic acid in the formula with vitamin unless you are trying to get rid of radiation or radiation sickness the nicotinic acid is not necessary to smoother processing and will not assist it 100 mg of vitamin b1 lasts for only 47 minutes so far as processing is concerned but it helps in general tone vitamin does not have quick reaction so far as processing is concerned one merely takes it and as the days go by processing is easier to do it doesnt wear out in session but you have to keep on taking it daily 600 mg is the minimum there is maximum but some heart cases take up to 1250 shutes in treatment of disease recommend 400600 mg per day for the average sized woman and 600800 mg per day for the average sized male it doesnt seem to matter to processing whether the vitamin is alpha tocopherol synthetic or what just any vitamin apparently worksvitamin assists great many ills including diabetes and may have some effect on many others it even with guk will not by itself release or clear anyone when dosage is discontinued what it cured might relapse but while it is being taken one feels fine and theres reason to stop taking it to get the best results one should probably take 600 mg and guk bomb each day preferably after eating one person in million is said to get an adverse side effect from taking vitamin but it is not fatal and this may not even be true the side effect is said to be temporarily raised blood pressure if anyone makes this up into single tablet be sure that the tablet is not pressed so hard that it wont dissolve easily in the stomach dianazene for radiation fails utterly when all ingredients are pressed together into one tablet vitamin is generally available but sometimes has to be specially ordered it is useless to buy it in less than 100 mg tablets preferably 200 mg tablets of it should be bought however it is bought just be sure theres enough of it 300 to 600 mg small quantities dont produce any effect at all which is why the medicos earlier missed its value anyones auditing can benefit from it but at levels vi and vii it becomes quite vital oxygen causes the body to attract mental image pictures less carbon dioxide pulls mental images hard in on the body vitamin oxygenating the body acts mentally like taking oxygen the body can go longer on less oxygen and becomes less exhausted when taking vitamin in sufficient quantity the body is of course carbonoxygen engine running at temperature of 986 degrees f there is possibly less oxygen in earths atmosphere than there was and the body runs better when it can better utilize what oxygen there is vitamin assists it to do this and so it doesnt pull in mental masses at least thats the theory ive been able to work out to account for the observed increase in emeter action in the preclear who is daily taking sufficient vitamin when the vitamin is longer administered in about 24 hours the preclear begins to run less easily same as before vitamin plus any auditing gain and the needle read size returns to what it was before vitamin was used when vitamin is again daily administered in two days meter behavior improves again i have not had time to do many series but the observational data is so marked that its like proving stones are solid one doesnt feel like repeating the experiment endlesslyit is so obvious mental subject addressed reads longer more reads in the presence of vitamin than in its absence but clears more thoroughly leaving less mental mass i only insist that persons in england on the level vi and vii courses should use vitamin and that saint hill preclears for grade v be put on it and only forbid pcs to be processed without it in high altitude johannesburg the cost of it is the pcs org is to supply it webber pharmaceuticals ltd can probably direct one to better supplies or brands of itwe are not in the vitamin business or even in the health business anyone else using it in processing does so at his or her own choice this hco b is release

tech and qual personnel 20 dec 1965 level iv search and discovery data how suppressive becomes one search and discovery is being made and auditors are finding on one person and another myself well just amongst us girls of course you are going to find it one of the best reasons you are going to find it is that it is part of the r6 bank the other reason you are going to find it is that after person is totally overwhelmed by suppressive he assumes the valence of the suppressive and person you would find that on has actually been pretty suppressive what youre doing is you are pushing s d to point where you are clearing suppression it wasnt intended to go that far if you were to ask the listing question however name myself or give myself name you would then get the suppressive but this is getting very adventurous because it is part of the r6 bank it is getting very adventurous to do anything about it we seem to be happy about having myself i would just let them go right on being happy about it with skill you probably could bring out the identity of this person whose valence had come over them it would all depend on the auditor who is doing it if i were doing it id go ahead and break it down but not class iii auditor who is not sure what he is going up against who is repeating the word several times repeating the question trying to check it to make sure the listing question is clean dont you see you are never going to get that listing question clean that i assure you that question cant be listed out that is the mechanism of suppression overwhelming person oddly enough you will only find it on persons who are suppressive and of course youve walked into the real mechanism of how does suppressive become suppressive he becomes suppressive by taking over the valence of suppressive then when you list it out you get myself and this is compounded by the fact that its part of the r6 bank so you dont dare do much with it but it will let bunch of steam off the case with some very very very very upstage auditing very careful indeed give them the auditing question once then say go on and answer the question but never repeat it never check the thing to find out if its clean listyou probably would get at least one recent sp out of that combination how we do that at that stage when ive not worked with it technically i would not be able to tell you but i just know that it would be very risky it makes feel like maybe i shouldnt do anything about it at all because its too risky but i can see somebody getting messed up the main trouble in s dyour main trouble in s d is much worse than thatit is simply an inability to assess and auditors since time immemorial have had trouble assessing they have two troubles in assessing they underlist and they overlist its almost an accident that an auditor ever lists the right lists the right way im not saying that sarcastically but it has been my experience in teaching auditors to assess that they have two faults they underlist and they overlist if they do either one of these things they are going to arc break the pc and then the list isnt going to be nullable because the pc is not responding to the auditors voice as well and it quite often was the first one on the list which is where they never looked more fundamental than that is simply the problem of reading an emeter those technical facts are in the road of s d assessing an s d actually an auditor who can assess can pass off an s d so fast it would be like dealing cards done by monte carlo vingtetun player he could just roll them off left right and centre theres real trouble in it its very fast action it all depends on how much you want to keep the pc under tension in the action because an assessment isnt auditing to begin with you would start session with sit down im going to assess you now do you have some answers to this question brr brr brr and the pc says i want to tell you about all right good im glad youre going to tell about that but right now i want some answers to this question see then brrrrr on down and then youll notice your needle relax then you say all right now im going through this list ratatat etc thats it all right thanks very much pc cognites 10 minutes pc cognites and the meter blows up and good indicators come in and youve done an s d there is nothing more complicated than that youve got auditors who were trying to do an s d in session you got them that are afraid the pc has already given it on the list you got them that havent learned how the meter reacts when youve got complete list meter just falls flat when youve got complete list the needle goes clean and youve got them that arent sure that theyve got any sp and they just didnt see that the meter did surge on one of them then you get somebody who has overlisted and hes just ploughed the guy in so he cant assess it back easily then you get the fellow who had four of them fall certainly if youve got four falling theres two things that can be wrong at this point which makes it very difficult to run back in one you have passed it its above the four which are falling youve missed it and the pc is simply discharging on it and actually you can ask the pc which one was it and hell say well it was joe of course thats above the four practically every one after the right one will read because its actually blowing down all the time hes longer paying any attention to the auditor then the other thing is you just havent completed the list you have to make an opinion as to whether or not youve overlisted or underlisted you can also pick up dirty needle and an arc broken pc or protesty pc if youve gone by the right one here are the evils of listing and here are the evils of assessment showing up on s d they are simply auditor goofsits just lack of experience on the part of the auditor and lack of understanding of what hes supposed to be doing but an auditor who can really assess can knock these things off id spot what auditors can assess reliably and id give them specialized jobs of that character that require listing this is very very highly skilled action you save lot of time by pulling such an auditor back into specialty review actionin review you have to do it sometimes when its been done so you have the additional answer of how do you patch up an assessment thats already been goofed and where is the list that was lost youve got the problem of the list that was completed out of session and i got home and was lying in bed and so forth so in review you always assume the pc continued the list after the session if the pc is there as flat ball bearing you just automatically assume the pc thought of it afterwards or something it isnt that the tech auditor always got it ill give you tip in qual if you assume automatically that standard technology has not been applied as your first gambit in anybody that youre putting back together again youll about 99 be right somehow or other it slipped by in tech it slipped by somebody thought he did it somebody thought it was on the report and therefore it looked like it didnt work or something something was there and in all of my d of ping i have not found it possible to detect all departures from tech by auditors ive never been able to bat 1000 on that naturally its nearly impossible technically what you have to do doesnt mean that you have to invent technology because there are very standard answers to all these things l ron hubbard lrhmlrd copyright 1966 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedcertainty vol 13 2 february 1966 official periodical of scientology in the british isles psychotics l ron hubbard in footnote early in the book dianetics the modern science of mental health i promised to publish material someday on the subject of institutional psychosis recently i was fortunate enough to make breakthrough on this subject i had supposed that it would be necessary to undertake considerable amount of research work in institutions to complete that which i began so many years ago researching recently on the reasons cases worsen after they become better the answer tumbled out all unexpectedly and shed an entirely new light on the whole subject of insanity we are confronted in our modern society with growing statistic for insanity the number of psychotics is increasing apparently faster than the population growth this could mean many things it could mean that the psychiatrist was inept in applying what he knew it could mean that there were insufficient numbers of psychiatrists as they state or it could mean as they tell the legislators that insufficient funds are being appropriated for the handling of psychosis but the answer is apparently none of these if one wished to halt an epidemic it would be necessary to isolate the germ or virus which was causing it this has become accepted procedure in the field of public health and is intensely effective however scientific methodology has never really been applied to the field of psychosis it is such frantic and desperate field that anyone associated with it has little time for careful consideration the patients are in such dangerous condition their families and friends are so desperate that noone could be expected to look for the actual cause of the situation thus the true facts concerning psychosis have been masked if you want to know why people are having trouble with something it is good thing to look at the something there you will find that things have not been defined there is true acceptable definition of psychosis the root word psych refers only to being or soul and the osis could loosely be defined as the condition of therefore in actual fact it is not much of word and if we look it up in the larger dictionaries we will find some long complex dissertation or sweeping generality which frankly would never be accepted in the physical sciences as definition for anything reflecting as it does wholly opinion the word psychosis is not however completely inept as it at least indicates that it is something about spirit or soul or its quality of animation thus we can suspect if the thing has never adequately been defined that great many misconceptions exist concerning it and furthermore it would seem pretty obvious that if man had not defined what it was then he was very far from being able to identify the source of itwe all have some idea of what we mean when we say insane or crazy or nutty but half the time we only mean that we dont agree with the action things which are unreasonable to us or not understood we commonly refer to as insane or crazy or nutty thus man does not make differentiation between what he disagrees with and an actual deteriorated mental state dangerous to the society and the individual so the first thing we can know about psychosis is that it is becoming more widespread for two reasons 1 man has not adequately or workably defined it and 2 the true source of it has not been identified there follows naturally third fact that it has not been cured quite obviously because it is getting worse the whole subject has been so wrapped up in untested opinion that the ordinary scientist has found it quite unapproachable the whole field bristles with authoritarian differences of view and bitter arguments the number of types of psychoses which have been listed over the years have become so great that classification has become relatively meaningless further the names given mean different things to different schools of psychiatry examining this sea of turmoil human misery mistreatment and failure one would not ordinarily expect to find any ready solution if one intended to find solution one could have expected to search for some years amongst the institutional population observing and taking notes until at last one had identified some common denominator of the illness which might lead to relief the orderly mind of research scientist would however begin to take the problem itself apart on the basis of excluding those things which had not led to ready solution and the fact i am about to give you here should have been realized long time ago psychosis has not been solved because it has been studied in the wrong place this is the first observation which might lead to resolution of the problem the source of psychosis is rarely to be found in the artificial atmosphere of an institution therefore the problem was not earlier solved after all it didnt occur in the institution the person was sent there after it occurred so the source of psychosis is obviously outside institutions further psychotic patient is seldom able to discuss accurately his life outside so the institution would only give one evidence on the results of the source of psychosis the source would be elsewhere the true psychotic is not always found in an institution behind those grey walls you mainly discover his victims the true psychotic is one who causes hysteria apathy misconceptions and the reactions of stress in others that is the identity of the being that is the source of psychosis he is by and large rather unconfrontable as being talking in the widest generalities and sounds quite sane unless you listen to him closely then it will be found that the reasons he gives do not quite make sense but are all directed toward the necessity of smashing or brutalizing anyone and everyone or selected groups or material objects the actual psychotic is covertly or overtly destructive of anything the rest of us consider good or decent or worthwhile sometimes such being is successful in life but the end result of his activities are what you would expecttotal smash some notable examples were hitler and napoleon not even historians are quite brave enough to state that these two beings were totally completely andincomprehensibly separated from reality and acted without good cause reason or justification other than an obsession to destroy ruin and bring misery to millions how napoleon for instance justified beginning an attack on russia too late in the year for his troops to operate there at all is very hard to see why hitler had to destroy the jewish people in germany as necessary act in prosecuting his war against the world outside of germany has other answer other than madness the true psychotic brings about an hysterical apathetic or deranged mental condition in others he or she does it for many good reasons does it for reason at all or doesnt even notice that he is doing it the true psychotic worships destruction and abhors reasonable decent or helpful actions although history affords us innumerable examples they are so common in the society around us that one does not have to go into study of mass murderers to find them the phenomenon is by means rare and at the absolute minimum is 2l2 of the population this individual fills the institutions with victims the hospitals with the sick and the graveyards with the dead the statistics of psychosis are not going to lessen in the society until this type of personality is completely isolated and understood the first problem one confronts in identifying the true psychotic is that anyone detecting in himself or herself some destructive urge is likely to believe that he or she is psychotic this is definitely not the case one of the primary characteristics of the true psychotic is total lack of introspection total irresponsibility to the pain or suffering of others coupled with logic which explains it all away but uses reasons which are not sensible to any of the rest of us an actual psychotic never for moment suspects his madness you and i have often wondered about our own sanity particularly since nobody could define it but psychotic never does further he would not help his fellow man if his own life depended upon ithe would rather perish this being is difficult to spot because he does not ordinarily fling himself about and make scenes he is often entirely emotionless completely coldblooded and apparently perfectly controlled the control however is only apparent as this being is in the grip of force far more powerful than himself and is thoroughly controlled being he or she must destroy and must not help or assist in any way such case is almost impossible to treat even when identified they do not easily respond to therapy since their level of responsibility is too low to experience even hope or despair about themselves thus they never assist anyone seeking to help them and indeed are far more likely to turn on any benefactor than to permit assistance by them therefore under the subject of psychosis we have the actual psychotic and the victims of the psychotic as long as we only studied the symptoms of the victims we could not discover the source of their difficulty any theory is only as good as it can be proven or as it works theories are not good because they are appealing or because they are uttered by famous name but are only good if they are useful the question isdo they lead to resolution of the problem therefore does the theory that the psychotic is ordinarily not in the institution and that the institution contains mainly his victims open the door to solution of psychosisone could be charged with oversimplification or total ignorance of the subject or lack of experience but none of this would alter the fact that solution which worked was the true solution to the problem i never promised to resolve the whole field of psychosis i was only interested in institutional psychosis for i do not think that an actual psychotic by the above definitions is likely to be salvaged even if one were able to apply the solution to his case there are several reasons for this the first and foremost is that he wouldnt sit still or stand still long enough another is that he isnt likely to be caught very easily and the third and most powerful is that he usually cannot be persuaded to forego his destructive actions long enough to receive any benefit from treatment another reason is that when people are able to identify him they do not wish to help him with those reservations the actual psychotic probably could be handled so far as technical actions are concerned but these need to be applied before they can hope to work and the application of them in this particular case is prevented by nearly insurmountable difficulties of noncooperation disdain contempt and total lack of desire on the part of the actual psychotic to salvage himself last and not least any true psychotic can be counted upon to attack or attempt to destroy scientology groups or activities as these help people the source of such attacks traces back usually to pretty dangerous psychotics who arent in institutions or even suspected some in public places where not only scientology groups suffer from their actions thus it isnt likely that scientologists will do much to help cure them even if scientology was in the business which it is not it is easy to handle large number of those persons who are the victims of actual psychotics these are found in majority in institutions as well as other places once again one has the problem of accessibility and communication but with those limitations institutional psychotics can be helped as i have said the proof of any theory is its workability and it will take considerable number of case histories to display the success of the observations but if person were sick from certain germ and one knew what that germ was and one killed that germ and then that person became well one would have to conclude that he had located the source of the illness the total indicated therapy cure for an institutional psychotic who is after all only the victim of an actual psychotic is to locate the actual psychotic in that persons life there is very magic response to this action the technology now exists it is called search and discovery it is commonly observed that whole families will exhibit psychotic tendencies this is too great generality in such case it should be stated the whole family except one exhibit very obvious traces of insanity the actual psychotic is most probably that one this person is continually performing acts often hidden atrocious in nature which destroy the confidence and reality of those about him the others exhibit the hysteria or apathy commonly associated with the illness psychosis they never once locate until it is done for them the actual source of their obsessions and confusions whether or not victim exhibits one or another symptom depends largely upon what has been done to the person to catalogue these is not easy and indeed is not helpful in each of the cases it is only necessary to find the source of menace an actual psychotic which has made them as they arei have not tried to give you this as learned paper it is rather discussion of subject into which man has made almost inroad today class iii auditor could expect some success in the field of institutional psychosis providing they were well trained and we permitted him to practice in that field today in institutions the treatment of the psychotic differs from that administered in bedlam centuries past in that today they have cleaner beds otherwise there is real change instead of whips they use electricity instead of chains they use brain surgery to incapacitate the person great deal could be done in the field of institutional psychosis and being able to isolate the germ in the society which causes psychosis is only small step in the direction of lessening the degree of psychosis in the society but it is at least step in definite direction and if this leaves you wondering whether or not you are insane all you have to do is ask yourself the questions 1 have i ever helped anybody or wanted to 2 am i violently opposed to those who help others if you can answer yes to 1 and to 2 there is slightest doubt about your sanity you are quite sane and those times in your life when you have wondered about your own wits you were only in connection with an actual psychotic somewhere in your environment the actual psychotic sometimes climbs to high places in the society as witness napoleon and hitler but even so he can be identified those who advocate violent measures as the only means of solving problemssuch as advocating warthose who are violently opposed to organizations which help others are easily identified and in the smaller world when you see cold indifferent smile to the agony of another you have seen an actual psychotic we do not consider psychosis field of practice in scientology and scientology was not researched or designed as cure for psychosis or substitute for psychiatry but in the course of research i have discovered these things and found them to be workable i trust they may be of some use to you who who knows may someday become involved with an actual psychotic or his victim and need the

looking for good and bad indicators to see if he was correct in his assessment when the right sp is found the good indicators flood in and the pc does not cave in in 36 to 72 hours the bug in s d is that one can almost get the right item an item can be found that is nearly the right one if the nearly right one is accepted the pc will be doubtfully more cheerful and may insist this is it the pc however is still not quite sure inevitably that is the sign of nearly right item the real reaction to the correct person is an of course doubt about it reaction it is the action of nearly finding the right one that may make the pc ill in the next few days or week one has restimulated the bypassed charge of the right one without finding it remember that the real suppressive person sp was the one that wove dangerous environment around the pc to find that person is to open up the pcs present time perception or space its like pulling wrapping of wool off the pcthe sp persuaded or caused the pc to believe the environment was dangerous and that it was always dangerous and so made the pc pull in and occupy less space and reach less when the sp is really located and indicated the pc feels this impulse not to reach diminish and so his space opens up the difference between safe environment and dangerous environment is only that person is willing to reach and expand in safe environment and reaches less and contracts in dangerous environment an sp wants the other person to reach less sometimes this is done by forcing the person to reach into danger and get hurt so that the person will thereafter reach less the sp wants smaller less powerful beings the sp thinks that if another became powerful that one would attack the sp the sp is totally insecure and is battling constantly in covert ways to make others less powerful and less able scientology flies into the teeth of an sp one will go to the most extraordinary lengths to try to injure scientologists or an organization or staff member but sps existed long before scientology and finding the basic sp around the pc just because of scientology or the pc is scientologist is in actual fact unlikely childhood is the most fertile area in which to locate the sp on the case child is weak and at the mercy of adults it is this fact alone that gave all the cures freud ever stumbled onto the analyst accidentally located an sp when his work was successful but then he proceeded to overrun and restimulate the patient without erasing in other words he would not let the patient have his item an hour with meter in the hands of an expert auditor who can assess correctly will produce everything the analyst or freud ever hoped to achieve and will do it invariably compared to the small results analysts did achieve but if you get one almost right and not get the really correct sp then you get the same phenomena that dogged the analystthe pc gets better for moment and collapses i am not saying you can permanently injure persons the analyst techniques operated far more restimulatively than our s d they made the person talk about it for years but you can still give pc nasty cold if you miss on an s d so dont miss do it

issue ii remimeo franchise level 0 letting the pc itsa the properly trained auditor the most painful thing i ever hope to see is an auditor letting pc itsa i have seen auditors let pc talk and talk and talk and talk and run down and talk and run down and talk again until one wondered where if anywhere that auditor had been trained in the first place such an auditor could not know the meaning of the word itsa the word means it is now how an auditor letting pc talk believes he is getting pc to spot what it is is quite beyond this pc has been talking all his life he isnt well analysts had people talk for five years and they seldom got well so how is it supposed to happen today that pc let talk enough will get well it wont the auditor does not know the very basics of auditing skills thats all these are the trs an auditor who cant do his trs cant audit period instead he says he is letting the pc itsa if by this he means he is letting the pc drive all over the road and in both ditches then this isnt auditing in auditing an auditor guides he gives the pc something to answer when the pc answers the pc has said it is and thats itsa if the pc answers and the auditor acknowledges too soon the pc tends to go into an anxietyhe has been chopped so he talks more than he wanted if the pc answers and the auditor does not acknowledge then the pc talks on and on hoping for an acknowledgement that doesnt come runs dry tries again etc so premature or lateornever acks result in the same thingthe pc running on and on and on and they call it letting the pc itsa bah if pc talks too much in session he either is getting cut off too fast by the auditor or hasnt got an auditor at all it isnt itsa its lousytrs the one single exception is the pc who had years in analysis but even he begins to get better with proper trs used on him the proper cure is to drill the auditor until the auditor realizes 1 the auditor asks the questions 2 the pc says what is the answer its 3 the auditor acks when the pc has said it to the pcs satisfaction and 4 the auditor acks when the pc has finished saying its and thats itsa scientology auditing is precision skill not gag blop goo slup guck blah 1 the auditor wants to know 2 the pc says it is 121212 etc tech savvy now an auditor who doesnt know his technology about the mind and his processes of course never knows what to ask so he or she simply sits like lump of sacking hoping the pc will say something that makes the pc feel better sure sign that an auditor doesnt know an engram from cow about processes is seeing pc itsa on and on and on in scientology we do know what the mind is what being is what goes wrong in the mind and how to correct it we arent psychoanalysts or psychiatrists or harley street witch doctors we do know the data about beings and life is there in scientology to be learned it isnt our idea of how things are or our opinion of scientology is precision subject it has axioms like geometry two equilateral triangles arent similar because euclid said so theyre similar because they are if you dont believe it look at them there isnt single datum in scientology that cant be proven as precisely as teacups are teacups and not saucepans now if we get person fresh out of the study of the mystical metaphysics of cuffbah hes going to have trouble his pcs are going to itsa their heads off and never get well or better or anything because that person doesnt know scientology but thinks its all imprecise opinion the news about scientology is that it put the study of the mind into the precise exact sciences if one doesnt know that ones pcs itsa by the hour for one doesnt know what he is handling that he is calling pc by my definition an auditor is real auditor when his or her pcs dont overtalk or undertalk but answer the auditing question and happily now and then originateso how to tell an auditor how to determine if you have trained one at last is do his pcs answer up or do they talk on and on if i had an auditor in an hgc whose pcs yapped and yapped and ran dry and yapped while the auditor just sat there like chinese pilot frozen on the controls i would do the following to that auditor 1 remedy book of case remedies 2 remedy b book of case remedies 3 disagreements with scientology technology and orgs and scientology personalities all found and traced to basic and blown 4 grind study assignment of the scientology axioms until the auditor could do them in clay 5 memorization of the logics qs prelogics and axioms of dianetics and scientology 6 trs 0 to 4 until they ran out of his or her ears 7 trs 5 to 9 8 op pro by dup until flat 9 hard long study of the meter 10 the arc triangle and other scales 11 the processes of level 0 12 some wins and id have an auditor id have one that could make grade zero release every time and its lack of the above that causes an auditor to say i let the pc itsa with the pc talking on and on and on scientology is the breakthrough that made the

office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 9 february 1966 remimeo release grades replaces hco bulletin of 30 aug 1965 release stages there are five grades of release when one of these is attained the next one up can be run preclear who has attained grade of release may not be run further on the processes of that grade or below or he will go back into his reactive mind all releases however can have their problems handled their withholds pulled their arc breaks repaired and any release at any grade can be audited on the exact processes of release rehabilitation the states of release differ in that one is more stable than another the reactive mind known also as the r6 bank can only be audited out by someone who is trained up to class vi when the reactive mind is fully audited out erased completely one has clear when clear has been refamiliarized with his capabilities you have an operating thetan an ot release then is pulled out of his reactive mind clear has fully erased his reactive mind an operating thetan is one who is cause over matter energy space and time and is not in body the degree and relative permanence of being pulled out of the reactive mind determines the state of release there are numerous things that can pull one back into the reactive mind these are 1 locks 2 secondaries 3 engrams 4 the whole time track locks by reducing locks as in levels 0 to iv we then remove the ability of locks to pull the being back into his r6 bank locks are mental image pictures of nonpainful but disturbing experiences the person has experienced they depend for their force on secondaries and engrams thus one who has had his locks reduced is grade 0iv release secondaries and engramswhen being has had the secondaries and engrams reduced he is far less likely to be pulled into the reactive mind than if he has just had their locks reduced secondaries are mental image pictures containing misemotion grief anger apathy etc they contain pain they are moments of shock and stress and depend for their force on underlying engrams engrams are mental image pictures of pain and unconsciousness the person has experienced when these are reduced one has grade v release the whole track bits and pieces of the whole track remain after the locks secondaries and engrams are reduced these bits inhibit the being from recovering knowledge the whole track is the moment to moment record of persons existence in this universe in picture and impression form when these bits are cleaned up being is grade va release the reactive mind when the pc has taken the locks off the reactive mind itself using r6ew he attains grade vi release the reactive mind when the entire reactive mind has been erased and the person is again wholly himself one could call it grade vii release but that is really clear operating thetan when being once more has recovered his full abilities and freedom state much higher than man ever before envisioned is attained this state is

1966 issue ii remimeo tech hats qual hats ethics hats tech recovery my study of nov 1965 plummeting hgc completion statistic indicates certain policies are necessary in all hgcs and qual divisions the following errors were found 1 the hgc ceased to look for former release grades to rehabilitate and ignored opportunities to do so on the basis that outer orgs have rehabbed them all already this came out in the comm ev held on d of p of that period of course if the hgg failed to rehab earlier grades or earlier life overruns it could achieve later grades or grade v this alone would have ended completions promptly on all grades and wiped out the graph 2 invalidation of the appearance of free needle and invalidating any auditor who thought he saw one this wiped out all release attainments and made for total overrun of all pcs of all grades this error existed for 15 years so it is not surprising that it got back in again 3 whenever an overrun occurred rehabilitation of it was done by running different new processes instead of standard rehab routine as in hco bs ie doing arc break ptps rudiments anything but real rehab of that process that was overrun 4 abandonment of standard tech in favor of unusual solutions this is always present when collapse of tech occurs 5 one sp was found in the middle of all this but after his departure the statistic did not recover so one can assume another sp was in the middle of it still or that the hgc remained pts and didnt separate from the sp found because he was so convincing so reasonable and so persuasive as to why tech statistic must remain down it is interesting that 1 aboveceasing to rehab lower gradeswould be absolutely fatal to any upper grades therefore this becomes policy upper grade of release may be begun newly on pc until all lower grades are fully rehabbed to free needle this applies to all grades 0 to vii regarding 2invalidation of what free needle isand thus running past all free needles let it be noted that this is an auditors code breakcontinuing process that has ceased to produce changeand is therefore crime this was wrong too long to be allowed to go wrong again thus we get the policy an auditor who has been found to have overrun free needle on preclear must be given an ethics chit and if the action is several times repeated ethics must order full review of the auditors case including an eyesight test and conduct thorough ethics investigation and hearingnote that mark v meter run with too high sensitivity does not give marked change when needle floats thus sensitivity must be reduced in ordinary running and increased only to get in rudiments then free needle becomes more visible mark v cranked up to 128 sensitivity looks like floating needle all the time at casual glance on most pcs sensitivity 5 is ample also meters go out of 5000 ohm calibration and dont read on the m and f clear reads and change of electrodes can change m and f clear reads free needle if process is overrun vanishes with just one extra command so an auditor must be alert please also note that this has been part of the auditors code for agesrunning past flat point of process has been forbidden since the first formulations of the auditors code regarding 3rehabilitation by using other processesthe hco bs on rehabs are very explicit to run another process would clobber the pc thus we get the policy rehabilitations must be done by rehabilitating the pc only on the process overrun and only by standard hco bs on rehab procedure re 4unusual solutionswe get the policy any auditor accepting an unusual solution without filing job endangerment chit or found using an unusual solution must be charged with crime and given an ethics hearing failing to report an unusual solution advised or used is also so handled an unusual solution is one evolved to remedy an abuse of existing technology on 5statistic failing to recover after an sp is spotted in department gives us the 2 policies whenever an sp is discovered and declared in an organization all his associates in that portion of the org must be checked out for or given an s d and when an sp is discovered in an organization is dismissed or removed and the statistic does not recover another sp must be looked for it is noted that the general condition of the completion statistic of dec 65 to jan 66 could be attributed to the above gross errors it is now certain that l rehabilitation of earlier grades 2 free needle and 3 rehabilitation by standard practice are primary targets in our technology for anyone seeking to mess it up and that unwitting tampering with these three things and lack of hco enforcement on them will reduce hgc statistics and prevent their recovery of course one could also go mad in the opposite direction i rehabilitate earlier grades endlessly on pc regardless of how many times free needle had been obtained 2 call anyloosening up of needle free needle and 3 refuse to even 2way comm with pc under repair for overrun for fear it violates standard procedure for rehab the middle course is the correct course in this case relax and just be very sure the pc has been properly rehabbed to free needle on each grade up to the one one is going to start by demanding the awards of release that were granted and if these werent ever awarded then do the rehabs necessary grade by grade the only sticky point in this is that if pc had ever been run on higher grade without rehab of lower one must rehab from the top down at times tackling the highest overrun first but nevertheless doing all of them that were bypassed eventually the way to recognize free needle is watch for one when it happens you will see one then you will never afterwards wonder the free needles available on case can all be swallowed up by failure to rehab all grades ever bypassed or overrun if free needles show up on case at all then partially rehab any grade available for rehab back and forth until one has one of them go free needle and then get free needle on the remainder life can also be an overrun and pc never audited will respond to rehab of something overdone this doesnt mean the pc went release before scientologyit means that purpose overrun then jamsrehab of life situations of overrun consists of hitting the purpose that was overrun and when this is hit the pc goes release in pt and was not release in the past an example is an overrun located in 20 ad when the person alert to christianity decided to be good made it and then overran it for 1945 years when the purpose was found to be good and dated and the overrun spotted the needle went free rough auditing bad trs letting the pc itsa etc can swallow up free needles also totally arc broke meter that wont read at all with bad indicators all over the place wont record read looks sometimes like floating needle the difference being the pc has total bad indicators sour mean sad etc free needle occurs most often after big cognition and the unskilled auditor looks at the pc who is being bright and interesting and just doesnt see the needle float asks more questions and overruns and the free needle vanishes when pc is cogniting look at the meter not the pc and the instant the ta starts up and the needle goes sticky suspect an overrun and check as for doing something else rather than standard procedure for rehab plain ignorance can cause it the auditors desire to help the pc if unaccompanied by solid tech background leads to wild efforts new processes and anything but cool standard procedure when the person checking out pcs is also the case supervisor unusual solutions creep in the most errors ive seen made by case supervisor were made after he had seen the pc or talked with the auditor cases have to be run by report only and auditors have to be supervised and their sessions listened to by somebody else besides the case supervisor tech is tech there is such thing as standard tech pc wild tales and hollow eyes and auditor hobbyhorses have to be kept off case supervisor lines so there must be person who checks out pcs and supervises auditors and their auditing performance but who never opens his or her face to suggest instructions about the pc and only writes down that the auditor is rough or the process is flat or the process is overrun the case supervisor lives in an ivory tower sounds strange but unless its done that way wild departures from standard rehab procedure and from standard tech in general will occur hell all psychiatry went down that drainthe desperate patient the desperate measures squirrelling stems from the case supervisor being the auditor supervisor and the pc interviewer oil water being in two divisions commies and fascists dogs and cats wont mix neither will the personal contacter of auditors and pcs and the case supervisor ever successfully stay crossed the individual practitioner breaks down only because he does both auditing and case supervision auditing is an organization action which is why today we have field staff members and hgcs additional notes of things discovered in the investigation of the plummeted statistic on completions were1 auditors rabbiting out of uncertainty and so stumbling past end phenomena and floating needles 2 case supervisor getting auditors to ask leading questions on pr pr 2ask the pc if he is interested in medical practices 3 d of p find out what the needle is floating on 4 case supervisor told auditor that floating needle was not the end phenomenon of process in which the ta had to be run out 5 lack of knowledge and understanding of the technology and not knowing the difference between such things as anaten secondaries and engrams by case supervisor d of p and so confusing auditors of course the one thing one cant technically overcome is an sp keeping an area messed up his case doesnt improve because of his intentions and overts and fear of people getting better or being bigger than he when an sp dominates an area only ethics actions can handle the primary indicator of the presence of an sp in an org is plummeting statistic immediately after he starts handling portion of it indifferent leadership even inaction cant drive statistic down only active suppression can so watch the statistics and dont get reasonable when they fall either outside the org suppression has been brought down on that portion of the org making it pts or there is an sp there the final answer is what happened just before the statistic fell if new appointment was made and it fell unappoint it fast if nothing cures the down statistic find the sp or handle the pts situation because one or the other is there completions stayed down for 15 years then we found auditors never noticed free needles now for heavens sakes 15

sussex hco bulletin of 11 february 1966 remimeo all students all scn staff franchise free needles how to get them on pc free needles can be obscured only by overruns and auditor goofs in the rehab session and arc breaks in past auditing when ta goes up or is up it means an overrun in life or on process or grade of release the only place you cant get an overrun is at grade vii all grades below that are subject to overrun life subjects are subject to overrun before scientology the mechanism is this one conceived purpose he or she succeeded in it then kept on and overran it in auditing one hits the purpose and the overrun of it and gets free needle on it that doesnt mean the person was release then it means that the spotting of the purpose and the overrun by auditing produces free needle today it may be necessary to find whole track overruns on some pcs in rehabilitation of grades if lot of levels have been run past free needle it may be necessary to take apart the mess like bundle of yarn to get the first free needle in such case one rehabs any grade the pc has been run on that the pc can remember one handles this briefly until the pc is happy but not necessarily to free needle one then finds another overrun does the same one goes on and on looking for moments the pc felt good about processing at one or another time if you keep this up suddenly you will see free needle on the pc establish what grade it is free on then quickly get the needle free on the remaining overrun grades but not grades pc was never run on it may be necessary to take into account whole track overrun of purpose or even the purpose to get release clear or ot it is all very quick deft auditing very much on procedure using standard rehab techbut repetitive grind you wont see freeing up of needle unless you set your sensitivity on mark v to stiff needle for the pc you can increase sensitivity or decrease it as the pc progresses but by setting the sensitivity so the needle is pretty still and stiff you will see easily freeing up of the needle and then free needle using sensitivity 128 will obscure every free needle as the needle is too loose already for the auditor to see any change pcs are most apt to go free needle after big cog so dont be so engrossed in looking at the pc during cognitions keep an eye on that needle and if it goes free dont ask anything else just gently give the pc thats it and without chop of comm ease the pc off to declare in qual or if field auditor start the next grade gently gently smooth trs get you free needlesa dirty needle is always caused by auditor chops flubs etc you can always trace dirty needle right back to tr error by the auditor if needle goes dirty in rehab session get the list 1 out right now and quickly find why its always an auditor goof on the trs or tech procedure rehabs are not substitute for processes if grade hasnt been run you cant rehab it of course in rehab never use new process to cure an overrun rehab the process that was overrun not new ruds and see hco pol ltr 10 feb 1966 on this subject you can get free needles on pcs it just requires standard trs standard tech standard rehab and wanting to get one

remimeo staff auditors hats tech hats the dangerous auditor we long have had term for an auditor who consistently did things that were upsetting to pcs case we call this dangerous auditor there are certain exact specific actions or omissions that make such an auditor dangerous these are 1 breaks the auditors code or ignores it as only applying in certain cases 2 audits past floating needles or directs additional auditing on that process when floating needle has occurred 3 ceases to audit process before the needle has gone free 4 starts new grade of release without rehabilitation or making sure at least by record that an earlier grade has been rehabbed and was not overrun 5 does not locate the right sp on s d but over or under lists or misses while assessing 6 goes on auditing the pc after an arc break without caring for the arc break and believes it possible or usual to continue past one 7 consistently has hostile and derogatory opinions about his pcs these are the really dangerous points that make an auditor who does them dangerous this list is composed by tracing back upset cases to the errors which made the upset an auditor who merely makes the five gross auditing errors is just bad auditor see hco b 21 sept 65 out tech dangerous auditor often seems to be quite accomplished but does the above on some pcs he seems to get away with it and so will argue the virtue of his approach or violations but on the next pc he doesnt and has mess on his hands careful auditor is not necessarily not dangerous one doesnt audit carefully one audits with relaxed competence that follows the rules and avoids the errors listed above there is compromise for knowing ones business most auditors when they are trained and longer make the 5 gross auditing errors become very excellent

that they are separate and distinct and stand by themselves as processes in the book of case remedies we find on page 25 remedy and remedy b these two remedies are and b because they handle primary source of worry to supervisors and auditors auditing style each level has its own basic auditing style the auditing style of level ii is guiding style the secondary style is guiding secondary style or guiding s style assists an assist is different from auditing as such in that it lacks any model session assists are normally short periods of auditing but not always i have seen touch assist go on for months at the rate of 15 minutes day two or three days week and it may take hours to do touch assist on an accident victim what characterizes an assist is that it is done rapidly and informally and anywhere coffee shop auditing isnt really an assist as it is usually done over coffee too casually to be dignified by the name of auditing the pc is never informed at all of the existence of session the pc in an assist is however informed of the fact and the assist is begun by this is the assist and ended by thats it so an assist like session has beginning and an end the auditors code is observed in giving an assist and the auditing comm cycle is used as an auditor one sets out in an assist to accomplish specific thing for the pc like relieve the snivels or make the ache in the leg better so an assist also has very finite purpose secondary styles every level has different primary style of auditing but sometimes in actual sessions or particularly in assists this style is altered slightly for special purposes the stylealtered for assists is called secondary style it doesnt mean that the primary style of the level is merely loosely done it means that it is done precise but different way to accomplish assists this variation is called the secondary style of that level remedies remedy is not necessarily an assist and is often done in regular session it is the remedy itself which determines what auditing style is used to administer it some remedies as well as being used in regular sessions can also be used as assists in short that process exists as remedy has bearing on whether it is used in an assist or model session guiding style the essence of guiding style is 1 locate whats awry with the pc 2 run repetitive process to handle whats found in 1 in essencesteer the pc into disclosing something that needs auditing and then audit it guiding secondary style guiding secondary style differs from proper guiding style and is done by 1 steeringthe pc toward revealing something or something revealed 2 handling it with itsa guiding secondary style differs from guiding style only in that guiding secondary style handles the matter by steer itsa guiding style proper handles the matter with steer repetitive process definitions processing definitions processes when used as remedies are normally processed by guiding secondary style both remedies of the book of case remedies and b are guiding secondary style in their normal application one would expect them to be used by class ii auditor one would expect the assist to last 10 or 15 minutes perhaps more but less than regular session would take one would expect that any case in pe class any student that was getting nowhere would be handled by the instructor with guiding secondary style using remedies and b as precision processes remedy patter one would not expect the person or student in trouble to be turned over to another student for handling its too fast sharp and easy to handle that trouble oneself if one is class ii orabove and far more certain you can do it while youd be finding another student to do the auditing it would be uneconomical in terms of time not to just do it right thenno meter leaning up against desk the auditors patter would be something like what follows the pcs responses and itsa are omitted in this example i am going to give you short assist all right what word havent you understood in scientology okay its preclear explain what it means okay i see you are having trouble so what does pre mean fine now what does clear mean good im glad you realize you had it mixed up with patient and see that theyre different thank you thats it in between the above total of auditing patter the student may have hemmed and hawed and argued and cognited but one just steered the pc straight along the subject selected and got it audited and cleaned up if the student gave glib text book definition after challenging the word preclear we wouldnt buy it but would give the student piece of paper or rubber band and say demonstrate that and then carry on as it developed and that would be remedy you see it is precision auditing and is process and does have an auditing style and it works like dream you see this is steer itsa as to its style and that it addressed the immediate subject what makes remedy is not that it handles scientology definitions but that it handles the immediate subject under discussion or study remedy b what makes remedy b remedy b is that it seeks out and handles former subject conceived to be similar to the immediate subject in order to clear up misunderstandings in the immediate subject or condition remedy b run on some person or student would simply be bit more complex than remedy as it looks into the past person has continuous confusion with policy or auditors etc so one runs b like this the following is auditor patter only im going to give you an assist okay all right what subject were you mixed up with before scientology im sure there is one okay spiritualism fine what word in spiritualism didnt you understand you can think of it good ectoplasm fine what was the definition of that all right theres dictionary over there look it up im sorry it doesnt give the spiritualist definition but you say it says ecto means outside whats plasm well look it up all right i see ecto means outside and plasm means mould or covering note you dont always break up words into parts for definition in b remedies yes ive got that now what do you think spiritualists meant by it all right im glad you realize that sheets over people make ghosts ghosts fine glad you recalled being scared as child all right what did the spiritualist mean then okay glad you see thetans dont need to be cased in goo all right fine good you had ectoplasm mixed up with engrams and you now realize thetans dont have to have bank and can be naked fine thats it note you dont always repeat after him what the pc said but sometimes it helps student departs still cogniting enters scientology now having left spiritualism on the back track doesnt keep on trying to make every hco bulletin studied solve ectoplasm the buried misunderstood word that kept him stuck in spiritualismdefinitions purpose the purpose of definitions processing is fast clearing of held down fives jammed thinking because of misunderstood or misapplied datums preventing someone getting on with auditing or scientology remedies and b are not always used as assists they are also used in regular sessions but when so used they are always used with guiding secondary stylesteer itsa as comment people who seek to liken scientology to something oh like christian science are stuck in christian science dont say oh it isnt like christian science just nod and mark them for fast assist or session the moment the chance offers if they seem very disinterested or aloof when asked to pe course theres weapons in that arsenal auditor use them as remedies and b stand as the first and second given in the book of case remedies so before large number of potential scientologists stands the confusion of definitions we have made scientology definitions easy for them by compiling dictionary using words new to people only when useful but those that dont come along at all are so wound up in some past subject they cant hear or think when that earlier subject is restimulated and that earlier subject is held down only by some word or phrase they didnt grasp some poor pawn howling for the blood of scientologists isnt mad at scientology at all but at some earlier practice he got stuck in with misdefinition of its terms you see we inherit some of the effects of the whole dullness of man when we seek to open the prison door and say look sunshine in the fields walk out some who need remedy b say oh the last time somebody scratched the wall that way i got stupider why say hey im not scratching the wall im opening the gate why bother he cant hear you but he can hear remedy b as an assist thats the channel to his comprehension understanding when person cant understand something and yet goes on facing up to it he gets into problems situation with it there it is over there yet he cant make it out infrequently fortunately for us the being halts time right there anything he conceives to be similar presented to his view is the puzzle itself aaa and he goes stupid this happens rarely in the life of one being but it happens to many people thus there arent many such messes in one person in one lifetime that have to be cleaned up but there are few in many people the cycle of misdefinition is 1 didnt grasp word then 2 didnt understand principle or theory then 3 became different from it commits and committed overts against it then 4 restrained himself or was restrained from committing those overts then5 being on withhold inflow pulled in motivator not every word somebody didnt grasp was followed by principle or theory an overt was not committed every time this happened not every overt committed was restrained so motivator was pulled in but when it did happen it raised havoc with the mentality of the being when trying to think about what seem to be similar subjects you see you are looking at the basic incident its locks as in chain of incidents the charge that is apparently on the lock in present time is actually only in the basic incident the locks borrow the charge of the basic incident and are not themselves causing anything so you have basic misunderstood word which then charges up the whole subject as lock then subject charging up similar subjects as locks every nattery or nonprogressing student or pc is hung up in the above 1 2 3 4 5 cycle and every such student or pc has misdefined word at the bottom of that pile if the condition is new and temporary its scientology word thats awry if natter progress etc is continuous and doesnt cease when all is explained in scientology or when attempts to straighten up scientology words fail then its an earlier subject at fault hence remedies and b hence guiding secondary style hence the fact that definitions processes are processes and vital processes they are if one wants smooth organization smooth pe smooth record of wins on all pcs and if one wants to bring people into scientology who seem to want to stay out of course these remedies and b are earlyon processes to be audited by class ii or above on level 0 or i pc or student however some in scientology as of this date are studying slowly or progressing poorly because and b havent been applied one expects that very

march 1966 official periodical of scientology in the british isles what is greatness l ron hubbard the hardest task one can have is to continue to love ones fellows despite all reasons he should not and the true sign of sanity and greatness is to so continue for the one who can achieve this there is abundant hope for those who cannot there is only sorrow hatred and despair and these are not the things of which greatness or sanity or happiness are made primary trap is to succumb to invitations to hate there are those who appoint one their executioners sometimes for the sake of the safety of others it is necessary to act but it is not necessary also to hate them to do ones task without becoming furious at others who seek to prevent one is mark of greatnessand sanity and only then can one be happy seeking to achieve any single desirable quality in life is noble thing the one most difficult and most necessary to achieve is to love ones fellows despite all invitations to do otherwise if there is any saintly quality it is not to forgive forgiveness is much lower level action and is rather censorious true greatness merely refuses to change in the face of bad actions against one and truly great person loves his fellows because he understands them after all they are all in the same trap some are oblivious of it some have gone mad because of it some act like those who betrayed them but all all are in the same trapthe generals the street sweepers the presidents the insane they act the way they do because they are all subject to the same cruel pressures of this universe some of us are subject to those pressures and still go on doing our jobs others have long since succumbed and rave and torture and strut like the demented souls they are to resave some of them is dangerous undertaking were you to approach many ruling heads in the world and offer to set them free as only scientologist can they would go berserk cry up their private police and generally cause unpleasantness indeed one didhe was later assassinated by desire of ours but because of the incompetence of his own fellowsabout him he could have used scientology instead he promptly tried to shoot it down by ordering raids and various berserk actions on scientology organizations that he was then shot had nothing to do with us but only demonstrated how incompetent and how mortal he really was as we become stronger we can be completely openhanded with our help until we do we can at least understand the one fact that greatness does not stem from savage wars or being known it stems from being true to ones own decency from going on helping others whatever they do or think or say and despite all savage acts against one to persevere without changing ones basic attitude toward man fully trained scientologist is in far better position to understand than partly trained one for the scientologist who really knows is able not only to retain confidence in himself and what he can do but also can understand why others do what they do and so knowing does not become baffled or dismayed by small defeats to that degree true greatness depends on total wisdom they act as they do because they are what they aretrapped beings crushed beneath an intolerable burden and if they have gone mad for it and command the devastation of whole nations in errors of explanation still one can understand why and can understand as well the extent of their madness why should one change and begin to hate just because others have lost themselves and their own destinies are too cruel for them to face justice mercy forgiveness all are unimportant beside the ability not to change because of provocation or demands to do so one must act one must preserve order and decency but one need not hate or seek vengeance it is true that beings are frail and commit wrongs man is basically good but can act badly he only acts badly when his acts done for order and the safety of others are done with hatred or when his disciplines are founded only upon safety for himself regardless of all others or worse when he acts only out of taste for cruelty to preserve order at all is an insane act one need only look at the possessions and environment of the insane to realize this the able keep good order when cruelty in the name of discipline dominates race that race has been taught to hate and that race is doomed the real lesson is to learn to love he who would walk scatheless through his day must learn this never use what is done to one as basis for hatred never desire revenge it requires real strength to love man and to love him despite all invitations to do otherwise all provocations and all reasons why one should not happiness and strength endure only in the absence of hate to hate alone is the road to disaster to love is the road to strength to love in spite of all is the secret of greatness and may very well be the greatest secret in this universehubbard communications office saint hill

the original copies should be returned to the hco area sec dianetic auditing course the first requisite of any auditor trainee is to find and run secondaries and engrams on preclear preferably fellow student and to have secondaries and engrams run on self due to the fantastic speed of results today it is not possible for student to get enough auditing experience using the standard tech of 0 to vi to remedy this we use dolls for model session practice and learning the processes but even further training is needed using live preclears the tech used is that of book i dianetics the modern science of mental health but omitting the countdown and canceller this not being necessary today and using instead simple start of session and end of session and then running the engram do not try to use past track incidents the preclear may eventually fall into these but try instead for current lifetime try first for secondaries moments of misemotion particularly loss try to find these on gradient first trying for minor losses and eventually locating the death of loved one certain pcs black vs they used to be called are not able to run track incidents but try to coax them through incidents of loss on gradient small losses first and then get on with it they usually will get visio on incidents turned on if this is done there is complete method of running engrams on anyone developed by about three years ago whereby the date is found then the duration of the incident this always permits an incident to be run with visio dont try for sonic get the pc to regress to the moment of the incident dont try to run them conceptually with the pc in present time emphasize getting the pc to start at the beginning and go through to the end several times dont be too keen on repeater technique to get phrases they show up if you get the pc to run through the incident few timeswhen the pc can run secondaries successfully try for actual engrams once again try for light incidents like pinprick and graduate up to real engrams moments of real pain and unconsciousness most students shy off actual secondaries and engrams and try to run conceptual blah that could never have affected anyones life with the pc in pt this alone is the cause for failure of case gain running secondaries and engrams dont try to pull withholds etc or handle present time problems but send the pc who arc breaks with the auditor not with life to qual at once for an arc break assessment dont continue to audit an arc broken pc who has arc broken with an auditor all ethics data appliesdont audit potential trouble source if you encounter an sp case gain matter what you do send to ethics lack of ethics facilities and ethics know how was the primary reason dianetics occasionally didnt work so the new student has to be genned in on 1 if pc starts chopping auditor send to qual at once 2 suppressives 3 potential trouble sources 4 the org pattern showing tech div and qual emeters must be used and regardless of whether the student knows anything about them or not the pc must be on the cans we dont care if the student learns much or little about meters at this stage but bright student will catch on fast there is emeter training at this stage the texts supplied the student are those which cover i to 4 above dianetics the modern science of mental health which he must buy or own and an emeter he must buy or borrow but may not be lent by the school there is real magic in running secondaries and engrams i have seen the most fantastic recoveries from running merely secondary most spectacular recoveries with secondaries were obtained from running the death of an ally i have seen severe physical ailmentsheart disease arthritis malfunction allergies impotency frigidity lameness etc through the catalogue of human illsvanish or reduce on properly running engrams to erasure we are not in healing but we have fantastic success with dianetics in this activity auditor will ever be worth very much unless he has come in the right waythrough dianetics the concept of physical and mental difficulty stemming from mental image picture was great discovery and the technology of erasing such pictures as developed must not be lost in our trained scientologists this very instant i know of 3 cases with whom i am in daily contact whose whole lives would be changed by finding and running the incident necessary to solve the case i have seen woman who looked 60 appear 20 after 9 hours of auditing out single secondary the recent death of her husband when we originally tried to teach this technology running of secondaries and engrams 19501952 we had ethics we were at that time already drowned with sps auditors werent duplicating tech they often couldnt even state the basic definitions of secondary or engram they steered the pc all over the track or let him wander like lost soul they tried to force the pc to run the auditors aberrations and it was jolly old mess but those few i taught personally and simply had as any oldtimer will tell you the most fantastic successes with incredibly low effort by the auditorits just picture secondary or engram the whole of the technique is just finding the incident the pc is in running the pc through the incident beginning to end several times and not letting him digress and letting him come up the tone scale past boredom to enthusiasm by doing so when i think of the millions of words i have had to speak or write just to get that terrible simplicity across i see it can be bent as technology in thousand thousand ways the student has today guides he never had in 195052 he has the auditors code the actual responses of the emeter ethics and the final solution of how to turn on visio even in sps as per three years ago the startling gains of the exact tech of 0vii of course overawe the old plodder of 1950 but there is sting here as far as training goes understanding of the mind is complete without thorough grasp of secondaries and engrams and running them i have seen person trained up to high level who suddenly flopped at v because he had faintest notion of what he was auditing the budding psychoanalyst gets the shock of his life when he sees there is something there before us people thought the brain had short circuits in it psychologists and psychiatrists or that beast called censor lived in dungeon in it freud or that evil spirits haunted one christianity the whole answer to the mind is mental pictures and masses created by the thetan there is other source or cause of aberration unless student knows this he will never make good auditor and scientologist the only early way to get reality on it is to audit secondaries and engrams and be audited through them one does encounter all this phenomena by the time one is grade vii even though not audited on dianetics but students beginning their training are not grade vii and unless they have actually audited or been audited on secondaries and engrams they will never even though grade vii really have reality on why people act as they do or the complex nature of the bank dianetics the modern science of mental health was written before whole track was known it made releases like mad but they were then overrun like mad it failed only on sps and ptss it was and is the answer to psychosomatic ills and human aberration my results with dianetics were not often duplicated because 1 i stopped when the ability of the pc on any one subject was regained 2 i audited smoothly 3 i didnt use the subject to invalidate the pc see original thesis on why auditing works many auditors did duplicate my results and made clears which we now call releases due to total clear being so much higher that we are today making total clear as well as operating thetans is completely out of comparison with what dianetics was trying to do scientology is the route from human being to total freedom and total beingness dianetics was the route from aberrated or aberrated and ill human to capable human this step had never before been achieved in mans history oddly the step from human being to spirit had been achieved if rarely but was not generally credited buddhism other spiritual practices even christianity scientology really achieves it and for the first time with total stability relapse and invariably one for one nevertheless man had an inkling of the goals of scientology even though he considered them almost beyond godbut man had inkling whatever of dianetics none this was the bolt from the blue man was hacking and sawing and shocking and injecting and teaching and moralizing and counselling and hanging and jailing men with enthusiasm without any idea at all of what caused man to behave as he did or what made him sick or well the answer was and still is dianetics as we can now go directly toward total freedom on precise and narrow roadway without any ifs and as it can be done by human being in about year minimum time due to my discarding of all nonessentials by developing the exact steps and techniques of administration and as the result is so hugely startling grade to grade compared to anything anybody had ever even dreamed of and as the final result was never before known in this universe we tend to turn up our noses at poor little old dianetics but it was the grandpa the ancestor the basic discovery which led to and the reason for scientology and we have the gigantic problem amongst us that scientology works too fast in an auditors hands and forbids him to overrun result therefore how can he ever learn to audit he cant running scientology as hell never get enough practice on live pcs dianetics however has virtue we never would have called one in 1950 it is slow you can grind away on secondary for hours you can one by one whittle down chain of related engrams for days even weeks you can audit pc for long long time and you can get auditing practice now just one changehave the pc sit in chair in dianetic sessions reason to use couch thus the auditor has the same setup as in grade auditing the same approach and patter he will use in his standard scientology grade auditing must be used in this dianetic auditing or the practice will not train one to do scientology auditing yes i know the pcs will roll up in ball or leap into the air but this is hazard of the trade put such pc seated on the floor after one roll off from chair and one supervisor caution tell such students to watch that tone arm for reading at clear read and watch the needle for float and if they see the release phenomena occur to gently ease off the session without even one more command to go on or any other command unless you watch this you will overrun some pc on release grade also tell him what to do in case of pc refusing to cooperate or chopping the auditorsend to qual quick dianetics is easy to do 1 you say start of session 2 you locate an incident an actual past happening 3 you tell the pc to go to the beginning of it 4 when the pc says hes there the auditor tells the pc to go through it to the end and say what is happening as he goes along 5 when the pc reaches the end of it the auditor tells the pc to go to the beginning of the same incident 6 when the pc has the auditor tells him to go through it not again and say what is happening 7 repeat 5 and 6 repeat 5 and 6 repeat 5 and 6 8 when the pc is up to tone 40 cheerful on it repeat 29 on the new incident repeat 3 to 7 10 when the new incident has come up to tone 40 repeat 2 11 repeat 3 to 7 12 when the new incident has come up to tone 40 repeat 2 13 at end of the body of the session tell the pc to spot the environment few times 14 end the session by saying end of session thats dianetic auditing refined one can handle bouncers or denyers etc but frankly i found the pc would only reach to these when he was in over his head and the gradient of incident selected had not been followed if you choose incidents in the pcs conscious recall not by flash answer or meter the refinements arent necessary you just do 1 to 12 the original version of dianetic auditing was all done on gradient one searched nothing out by meters or trick questions or tests or flash answers one got what the pc could comfortably face and audited it if the auditing was smoothly done the next incident was tougher but the pc was comfortable in facing it in that way the incidents secondaries or engrams become progressively more horrifying but the pc is quite comfortable facing each one in turn this is what is meant by gradientit is steepening or an increasing from the slight to the heavy but you see the pc smoothly audited is gaining ability and confidence all the time and so can face more and more violence in his past its all there in pictures blackness is either his unwillingness to face things or his basic bank it cures vanishes if you do it by gradients and the pc soon can see pictures very well therefore if your student is becoming good auditor all you need to do is look at his pc if the pc is more confident and cheerful then the auditor is learning and doing well if the pc isnt the auditor has rough spot and should go to cramming if this doesnt work training being good then the auditor is probably an sp who has idea of helping the pc at all but is using auditing to bust somebody up dianetics is too easy really for the student to conceive that his minimum mild actions will produce such fabulous results so the auditor feels called upon to add additives are what checked dianetic results in the vast majority of cases that were checked the pc who wants to psychoanalyze talk by the hour isnt getting audited and isnt going to get any better this pc simply isnt under auditor control so the auditors control and trs are at fault pcs explain this sometimes by saying theyre cogniting whereas cognition is rather quick not an hours maundering the pc has to be told what is expected of him were going to find an incident in your life of which you have an exact record then by sending you through it at the moment it happened several times were going to erase it just do what i tell you and all will be well do you have any questions about that that exact quote must be made to the pc who has not been dianetically audited which includes many scientology pcs too and the pc must understand it and be satisfied he does before locating and running incidents very bad off pcs jump about on the time track and really need only grade auditing such pcs should be rejected for the purposes of this dianetic auditing and sent to any hubbard guidance centre some pcs just wont get the idea and just wont run incidents simply reject for these purposes and send to the hgcsome pcs are so snarly and choppy even before meeting the auditor they have to be sent to qual and afterwards only to the hgc as theyre good for this theyll make it but are not easy enough to afford any training to student some pcs are simply ethics cases sps and pts and these too should be rejected for this purpose the pts is known by roller coastering coney island fast up and down quarter mile of aerial railway they slump so theyre ethics cases if pc arc breaks suddenly or seems very sad after auditing its an arc break with the auditor and needs qual attentionand the student auditor should be looked over very carefully as possible ethics case engrams are hard to run in room full of auditing teams so if possible one should assign the auditing to be done after class hours in their lodgings the way to fit this programme of dianetic auditing into training in general must be worked out and is left to the org exec sec ww who may from time to time issue through the org executive secretarys communicator for tech sec eds covering its arrangements and materials to study check sheets in the absence of such sec eds an academy may make up its own it is possible to make it whole new course with an equivalent of the old hubbard dianetic auditor certificate and one recalls that course not even vaguely as good as this one can be was the course on which all others have been based since 1954 the course outlined herein is smoothed version of the course i personally taught in 1950 to thousands secondary in its original use meant moment of loss and incidents should be chosen on that basis secondary derives all its power from an underlying engram containing real pain and unconsciousness therefore many many secondaries which bury engrams must be taken off the case first and the job thoroughly done before engrams should be approached in auditing secondaries may again be approached when engrams seem to have been all cleaned up this alternation of 1 take off lot of secondaries 2 take off lot of engramsshould be followed one after the other past life incidents are handled just like any other secondaries and engrams past life and memory of it is buried under the terrific loss of possessions and body and natural recall can be restored by just general dianetic auditing as given in this hco b special attention is required do not run prenatal or birth engrams unless they come up naturally the pc must run only consciously recalled incidents he need not recall the details consciously only that the incident happened the state of release attained by dianetic auditing is probably below grade 0 and should be regarded as such and is declared by qual as dianetic releaseno grade number being giventhe material in this hco b takes precedence over any dianetic material books or tapes including dianetics the modern science of mental health where conflict may or

1966 lrh was holding the mockup his body together with sticking plaster the organization was going fine tech was wrapped up lrh put things on wait his case for one thing he decided to take vacation he spent thirty days in palmas the organization was running fine clear 1 john mcmasters was made during february of 1966 while lrh was in palmas lrh decided to go to south africa he wanted to locate an alternate base for ots in case of war or political takeover he couldnt figure out why he couldnt do this the reason was that he hadnt defined the purpose of such base the purpose was 1 an alternate base for scientology in case of war or political takeover 2 to serve as base from which to put in ethics on the planet so tech could go in 3 to put in economics so that people can support orgs and the orgs can flourish see later part of this lecture lrh went to rhodesia he conceived of type of constitution they could use to solve their difficulties the government liked it lrh recalled that he had some assets in south africa he decided to invest them he bought house and learned that he could buy hotel in the wilderness for 5500 pounds and did he bought farm he was watching the economics and behavior of the wog world and getting kick out of being out there making friends with tough characters his usual friends rhodesian culture is still victorian it is small civilization in the middle of howling wilderness it is more sophisticated than london rhodesia has lots of land minerals precious metals and beautiful climate it is untouched and could easily be developed lrh met the governmental highups he was very acceptable to them he didnt discuss scientology at all he was examining the wog world and he didnt want to unwog it he went on tv and radio he had authority but he was solving lots of problems each individual rhodesian would agree with lrhs solutions but warned him that other rhodesian would agree with him because the solutions were too advanced lrh went down to his hotel at lake kariba he supplied the hotel with twoton trucks local industry started to use his trucks to transport goods and the area boomed lrh started furniture factory colony started to sprout just the fact of lrhs being interested in the country and seeing hope for it caused production to rise then lrh wondered how he was going to leave to go back to saint hill he was woven too tightly into the picture with staff of nine personal staff and twentynine general staff the pick of the exconsular domestic staffs white rhodesians kept telling lrh how to handle the african he realized that they didnt know anything about africans because they didnt recognize that they were people they would say they are sullen youve got to watch them but the reason they are sullen is acknowledgment bad 8c overexpectation and outgradient they were taking people with experiential background in politics or economics and expecting more of them than they were trained to do lrh made his staff happy by telling them that they werent rhodesians anymore that they were americans they were very spitandpolish enthusiastic and hardworking so in four months lrh was very acceptable to both races and even to extreme moderates as well as to extreme rightest whites reporter from the london daily mail told the minister of information what bad fellow lrh was the minister instantly told prime minister smith what bad fellow he was smith told the cabinet the same story and the next morning the rhodesian front committee was charging down to see lrh when they found out that his visa wasnt going to be extended because they knew that it was all lies smith had been built up as too fair and too honest his popularity had begun to decline because he hadnt worked miracles and because his communication was going out then he told the committee various things such as thatlrhs business associates were complaining about him lrh had in fact only three business associates and one of them was there and denied the story smith said that lrh had been deported from australia but lrhs passport had record of having entered australia he said that lrh was wanted all over and had criminal record these people however knew that lrhs credit was in the stars all over the world they saw smiths feet of clay and walked out so lrh could leave covered with laurels as result of this expedition lrh found out that you cant locate base that you dont know the purpose of that was why he had trouble locating ot base now he knows what ot base has to do it has to put in ethics on planetary basis so that tech can be gotten in as you associate with the public and try to tell them about scientology you have trouble with the public because their ethics are out and for other reason one sp in rhodesia has wrecked the country and is keeping the whole scene enturbulated the only real threat to scientology is that an atom war or political takeover could prevent the organization from going ahead to clear people in addition to ethics but less vital than ethics economics has to be gotten straightened out economics is very simple subject with very plain laws it has nothing to do with politics and ideology actually economics exists as subject the purpose of which is to get people enough to eat etc man violates the laws of economics all the time for ideological and political purposes the already existing economic systems of the planet are usable in modified form and we need them to improve in order to allow for an expansion of our organization there has to be workable enough economics on the planet so that people can support orgs and the orgs can flourish and expand total subsidy of processing doesnt work because there is contribution from the pc people have to contribute to benefit from auditing so the economic purpose is secondary purpose of ot base also ethics is hard to get in on starving people ethics is out on earth and the out ethics prevents easy dissemination nearly every human being on this planet that is in trouble is in trouble because ethics are out in england someone stole and sold lrhs research papers which were then represented as the current practice of scientology very different thing people are killed in wars because of one sp in the government the only reason for war is few sps we could go and sort out key sps in international situations what we would do about it is something else political systems exist only to solve the problem of succession of rulers otherwise everyone could agree on benevolent monarchy the answer is of course not to have successors clear the monarch but political systems are not concerned with the happiness or productivity of people the only source of our individual personal difficulties is not having ethics in in the society around us the only reason why you are having difficulty as an individual is not having ethics in in your immediate environment weve got to shift gears in our emphasis we have been getting ethics in on our fellow scientologists with great enthusiasm now we are familiar with the system and how it works we have erred by getting ethics in too heavily on scientologists and too lightly on the environment it is time to reverse the emphasis there isnt any point in getting ethics in on willing person just because he is stupid doing that just makes the person sullen ethics should be directed at willful acts of sabotage real sp is not just anyone he intends to damage you he is real nut he intends to knock you down he is not just difficult person he is real monster upgrade your idea of what an sp is like sps amount only to 25 of mankind find out if the guy is driving people into sanitariums strewing social wreckage about and smashing statistics we have only had one real sp on staff just because person shows up on an s and d doesnt mean that he is real sp maybe he is just making someone unhappy dont fling the title around lightly within scientology outside scientology dont worry about making mistake and accusing someone wrongly just get ethics in real hard first and correct the mistakes later weve got to put in ethics fast to prevent disasterit was great to find that the organization could continue without lrh it was great to find that you could make more clears you made 22 to celebrate his return lrhs immediate program is to finish his own clearing he has found that people dont make it with their grades out then he will start ot research every time he tries to put together the scope of ot he has to run off the invalidation any statement you can make about ot falls short of the truthhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 20 july 1966 remimeo required for level iv students to review auditors to ethics officers the type two pts it has been revealed at saint hill that hgc auditors and review auditors are permitting their preclears to be sent through to ethics for writing disconnection letters to any person or group which the preclear thinks to have been suppressive of him and then continuing the search and discovery to find the sp on the list this is improper the auditor should continue the proper auditing of an s and d until the proper item on the list is found an ethics officer should only accept from type two pts the proper sp found upon the completion of an s and d properly listed and nulled to one sp l ron hubbard lrhlbrrd copyright 1966 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6607c26 shspec71 the classification chart and auditing auditing means to listen and compute and to get result on pc who is person with aberrations and difficulties auditing has to be done in professional standard manner since the beginning of wogdom there has been offbeat activity going on that is reason to perpetuate it the psychiatrist exists for the good of the society and to hell with the patient our situation does not compare with earlier mental therapies we are not even trying for the same result we are clearing people by erasing reactive minds unlike psychotherapies auditing is not social criticism we know the answer to why the pc behaves the way he does we also know why the wog behaves the way he does scientology is road out that increases the persons abilities taking him out of his identification of aaa the road has milestones which we call grades there are also levels on grades there are certain abilities gained but these grades are not composed of single points despite the names given on the gradation chart that is the rough public rendition it is really not possible to enter the upper grades without having attained the lower grades trying to do so results in disasters the whole track falls between grade v which enables the pc to confront whole track and grade vi but it doesnt necessarily appear in either though it may besides the disasters that occur from an out gradient other disasters come from not following standard tech standard tech is contained only in hcobs not in any books if i havent signed it it isnt true some day we will publish then all in consecutive order all corrected the main bugbear of someone studying scientology is that he conceives that every time he reads something new it wipes out the old this concept is based on the fact that he didnt understand the old material that he had read in the first place so he doesnt realize that it can be integrated with the new material that has just been issued something developed later doesnt replace something developed earlier the new does not wipe out the old the old generally correlates well with the new there are very few corrections one significant correction is contained in the newlyfound fact that you can overrun things lot of old processes failed because they worked so fast that the auditor didnt spot the release point when it occurred this accounts for the poor results of r212 when it went wrong it works very fast we didnt know about overrun in those days with dianetics you can have one release per chain so dont try to escape from confronting engrams by going release pcs are entitled to make rapid gains and soar on up the line that doesnt apply to students like great singer student has to suffer to be great he learns what errors can be made by being pc who gets messed up someone who has never been overrun doesnt appreciate why it is undesirable getting bad auditing isnt necessarily disastrous it teaches the student not to give bad auditing i have been audited by dianetic auditors who were trained in an academy that taught only the bubble theory nothing will help an aberrated being short of processing standard tech is very very narrow path and its very easy to stray off of its edges it is bounded on all sides by wrong things to do in auditing one wrong thing is to fail to handle pcs while auditing them you must keep the pc handled in order to audit him one way to suppose that you couldnt handle pcs while auditing them is to think that you cant do anything about something which is above pcs grade you can always run an advanced process on pc as rudiment as something to straighten the case out in hurry for instance even though problems grade 1 you can always run level 1 as rudiment for level 0 in fact if the pc has ptp you had damn well better it is not im sorry we cant talk about your problems because thats grade 1 and you are only working on grade 0 and at the problems level you may run into service facs eg the pcs lumbosis these can give you hard time in making problems release after all the reason why the chart is the way it is is that the gradation chart is made up only at the level of the grades of those things which you cant audit in the face of and that is the genus ofthe chart the real reason why i found the grades and why there are certain things that if you dont pay attention to them prevent all progress in auditing and in life so therefore they must be the keys to aberration and thats where we got the chart only these factors have appeared as barriers to case gain when not handled these are the super barriers to the track 1 ptps give rise to ta asising inability to concentrate inability to answer auditing commands and perhaps some degree of rising ta 2 missed withholds and overts cause nattery choppy and mean pc 3 arc breaks give the pc sad effect 4 communication problems lead to communication unconsciousness is communication problem the cdei scale can be applied to communication for instance ow must be higher grade than problems because person could confront having problems when he couldnt confront an overt dont think that because someone is grade iv release he will never again have outruds of any sort the product you have is gross product the release can last quite awhile or not it is not gold it is gilt and it can tarnish sometimes it turns green it is the temporariness of this state which is after all state of keyedout clear that boobytrapped the whole research line in the field of the mind there are lowerscale harmonics of everything the thetan can do or be the state of thetan exterior is what the buddhists called bodhi it is not permanent state however even though it is not permanent release should not be underrated it is accompanied by the experience of overcoming that which the person has been released on and that improves his ability to confront also bit of erasure has occurred which desensitizes the whole thing so the releases made nowadays are more stable than the releases that were made in 1950 now we are approaching release on gradient and we know what grade of release we are making always be willing to give the pc win the clear cog is im mocking it up clears follow the rules of life until they themselves have changed their minds about the rules and when they do that of course they are ots oddly enough ot processes are upper harmonics of the same things that prevent auditing only they arent processes if you want to audit you must handle whatever rud is out when its out if the pc at grade iv isnt talking he may be communications release but you will get nowhere until you get him in comm communication is the carrier wave of all processing someone whos release is less likely to have outruds but these things can still occur having the grades doesnt mean that you wont get arc broken with yourself and with the auditor if you want good auditor at grades vi and vii become one there are interim release points on the chart that you are probably neglecting someone could get an fn on communications process without being released on every aspect of communication so he isnt necessarily communications release lot of processes were dropped out of the lineup that shouldnt have been dropped you will have to use tech from another grade in running grade at level 0 you have valence processes as well as the usual comm processes you have some more complicated comm processes at grade 1 all along the line there are lots of processes that someone could be released on r4h r2h recall an arc break date it assess indicate bpc cchs were on grade ii also arc processes plus case remedies at level iii you get auditing by lists and overtjustifications there are also physical processes meter dating and cause and effect processes dont ignore grades processes as rudiments pcs dont ever object to auditors unless theyve got overts on them matter how lousy their auditing is pull the withhold pc audited over an arc break protests then screams then fusses then gets tired and then gets sad and sadder neglecting rudiments will ruin case you will have to use them on all pcs at one time or another dont ever fail to notice outruds or fail to put them in when they are out that and going nonstandard is the only thing that could bar person from going clear6608c02 shspec73 suppressives and gaes normally there is penalty for crime of omission in this society it is being there and communicating that are the crimes that are mostly punished but there are also crimes of omission for an auditor not being there and not communicating are the highest crimes in the area of tech we have gone from total change to total nochange the materials are all there the road to clear from raw meat to grade iv is very fast that is something you can have trouble with is an auditor it is over before you notice there is difference between wog and raw meat wog isnt even trying some processes are dangerously quick so they are not even in the lineup because they overrun too easily r212 is one of these the route is so fast that only gaes can prevent someone from going watch out here come quickie grades every thetan wants out at least for himself even the suppressive suppressive is special breed of cat he is someone with case gain the sp knows that he belongs in the soup so he is sure that you want to put him in an sp could be described as someone who is always totally surrounded by martians matter who you are as an auditor he will do nothing but commit gaes he wont just commit few he wont audit at all but he will say see i try to audit these guys and it doesnt work so its worthless fraud he rewards only down statistics he goofs up and vilifies every effort to make people better the trouble with scientology in south africa is that they are afraid that lrh will teach it to africans if registrars kept this nocasegain fact in mind it would save us lots of trouble we wouldnt try to audit them an sp will make case gain and cant resist bragging about it the registrar could route them to the ethics officer anyone has the right to complain about one auditor but not about all auditors as an auditor the suppressive is only happy when the pc gets worse and he is sad when the pc gets better an sp is in state of constant attack on scientology he commits overts 24 hours day you very seldom find out about it another characteristic is that he attacks wrong targets he attacks those who are trying to help him he will not complete cycle of action if by chance he does complete one he will reverse it at time during this lecture have i said that all existing governments on the planet today reward down statistics choose wrong targets fail to complete cycles of action or commit continuous overts i have not said that and your inference on that subject is your own responsibility an sp believes that you are trying to trick him into letting down his protective mechanisms long enough so that you can stab him in the back if as an auditor you observe all these things and the pc is getting case gain you know that tech is out because it isnt working you as an auditor can be an ethics officer if need be you should know some ethics tech you have to know how to locate overts that are so unreal that they dont read on meter the heads of governments are suppressives they do commit continuous overts and they do the other things that sps do they would get case gain if you audited them having them in the drivers seat is dangerous situation ethics must be gotten in not on police state basis but on very narrow precise basis the world is also full of pts people they are the ones who cause most of the trouble hence the name the pc who gets and loses case gain is rollercoastering he has an sp somewhere on his lines either directly or by restimulation auditing is fast but it isnt fast enough to overcome the sp you could take the pts out of his restimulative environment audit him up to grade v let him go back to the environment and he would collapse the reason why the pts individual rollercoasters is that the suppressive person or valence will try to destroy himif he makes case gain therefore dont audit pts you may kill him pts person could make it however if he made it as far as the clearing course grade vi is the makebreak point at grade vi you could barely make it in the presence of an sp below this it is not possible another way to handle the pts individual is to do an s and d to find the suppressive the s and d is an assessment not auditing it is an ethics action therefore you cant have gaes during an assessment because it is not auditing you ought to get the arc break handled by assessment first before doing an s and d what can you do for an sp the only known action that will change an sp is the last power process he is the real psycho the only place that it can be done is in an org that has class viis who could run it and registrar who will throw him out when he comes in complaining of case gain because getting him to answer the question could be very difficult if you did do power on him his next action would be grade 0 or lower but until you have total control of the environment and padded cells send him to ethics if it turns out that he has been well audited with case gain you are taking your life in your hands to put him in the hgc an sp got to be one by switching valences man is basically good but he mocks up evil valences and gets into them an sp is in false mockedup valence to which he has earlier assigned or postulated evil purposes or actions evil is the declaration and postulate that evil can exist thats all in the absence of such postulates man is good scientology would be very dangerous if that were not true the suppressive first mocked up badness in another then took on that valence the suppressive got in the bad valence committed overts then was attacked by other beings he is stuck in that second incident it is far more real than pt he is living nightmare anybody has few of these realerthanreal pictures but when most of us run into them we are running back into them the sp never left you and i may go back to an incident of trauma but an sp has never left it the incident is more real to him than pt to the sp all life is the threat of this incident and the personnel in it all life is this incident and everyone in pt is one of the attackers that is all there is to an sp he continuously commits overts because he thinks he is defending himself you could get in this state only if you had lots of overts before it this makes the sp choose wrong targets he cant complete cycles of action because he is stuck in time that is why the last power process works person commits overts stacks up the bank until he cant move on the track then gets the business institutions contain few sp they mostly contain ptss power processes can blast the sp loose from his stuck point on the track so that he can then be normally audited but how can he be audited on power processing in the first place by someone who is perceived as an enemy how can cop or the roman legion audit him psychiatrists fail to put in ethics on their own profession that is lrhs criticism of them lrhs quarrel with governments and politics is the same any system that permits an evil man to rise to power is bad system as an auditor you are only at liberty to handle ethics if you yourself have clean hands and if you have certainty that it is not your auditing that is the cause of case gain you must be satisfied that you dont commit gaes before you can accurately spot an ethics problem the difference between confident and an unconfident auditor is that the unconfident auditor is one who feels that he may be committing gaes the benefits of doing trs are the benefits of the auditing comm cycle itself apart from the processes used we know that the tech is not inadequate if you omit tech or add to tech it fails to work there was an additive until recently auditors were quitting when ta went low saying that the pc could then only be audited on power the truth is that case that is chronically below 20 is in chronic apathy and wont really get over it until he gets power processing but he can get gains on gradesthe easy way to know whether it is your error or the pcs condition that is causing auditing problems is to know the five gaes your judgment on an ethics problem depends entirely on your confidence in avoiding gaes they are very obvious you could detect them on tape of your auditing be interested in what is going on with the pc observe how he is doing getting and keeping pc in session is under the heading of observing the pc which depends on willingness to confront the pc real justice can never occur in the absence of an understanding of the human mind never our justice leaves artificial justice behind it justice is only necessary in an aberrated world

existence of the bank or the mind 2500 years ago 10000 years ago there was monk named dharma dharma made the mistake of believing that you didnt have to do anything but become wise from him comes the basic philosophical assumption that if you become wise you become free this is in the woof and warp of todays culture the idea that an individual can exteriorize and that by doing so he can become free was part of gautama siddhartha buddhas teaching that hasnt become part of the popular culture yet so we are slightly ahead of our time it seems to take 10000 years for such ideas eg dharmas idea given above to become central to culture so buddhas idea see above has 7500 years to go and scientology on the same time table has 10000 minus 16 years to go in other zones of the universe the existence of the mind is known in the galactic confederacy they have psychotherapy that consists of recognition of the fact that at moment of fatal accident to thetan picture is made however they think that it is location not picture they take picture of the location where the thetan was hurt and show it to him with movie clapsticklike thing slapped in front of it then the thetan is supposed to follow suit by doing the same thing to his picture and thus be free of its effects that is their way of making releases that therapy is administered to the releases in that society that pass for ots they are ot releases that is the closest other therapy to scientology todays concentration on education universities etc is result of dharmas ideas on wisdom the idea that education leads to freedom that you cant have freedom and ignorance he had tough time 10000 years ago man was more of an animal than he is today so it was more difficult for dharma to communicate with them it is interesting that education is an outgrowth of desire for wisdom hence scientology is in this mainline this would be an interesting topic for lecture or chapter of book the estrangement of wisdom from education it was terrific advance to get the idea of becoming free by becoming wise across to the savages of this planet 10000 years ago this idea is now so widely accepted that the secondlargest expenditure of taxes after the military is for education at dharmas time there was the knowledge that freedom was attainable but there was tech 7500 years later buddha discovered exteriorization gautama siddhartha buddha first exteriorized under bodhi tree he thought you did it by becoming wise one of gs buddhas other ideas was that you should be civilized and polite and buddhism civilized three quarters of asia but exteriorization was not generally doable to any great degree the tibetan lamas came along later and squirreled trying to develop an explanation of exteriorization or technology to accomplish exteriorization we are the gainers from this history to the extent that there is history and acceptance of the idea that the soul exists our gain is that the idea of the soul has been accepted by many for long time the idea that there is soul that goes somewhere after death has dominated graeco roman and mohammedan thought for 2000 years socrates originated this idea in the present philosophical tradition there is verbal tradition about socrates in greece that socrates held forth for the existence of personal being or thetan buddhism advanced into the west through the essenes and christianity later the nicene creed developed from the dead sea scrolls hundred years after its development it was advanced by jesus of nazareth powerhouse with an already existing philosophy the christian church today has to contend with the embarrassing fact that the dead sea scrolls predate christ and yet contain the new testament this is just the advance of buddhism in the western world christ studied in the east for thirty years by the time gautama siddhartha buddhas ideas had gone from india through greece spain ireland etc they were alterised to man has soul but it is over there and belongs to god etc buddha thought became unrecognizable there has never before been clear only releases the most that was achieved by any of these former philosophies was release1 dharma release by wisdom 2 buddhism release by exteriorization 3 christianity release by repentance and being good in scientology we just let bodhi ie exteriorization happen it is not even that significant to us because we are going for permanent state however if in the course of auditing someone he goes exterior you stop right there if you go on you bang him back into his body and into his bank and he will be arc broken pc exterior is on harmonic of ot but cant have it he has had bunch of losses in the past bad experiences like deaths associated with exteriorization and he snaps back in very soon scared he is not competent to cope with it he isnt ready for it you can take someone who has been insane and have him go totally sane by exteriorizing him you can also have someone go out come back in and never know it the formula for popping someone out is try not to be three feet back of your head buddhism spread like wildfire because it was such clearcut truth in one fell swoop we have capitalized upon the idea that man who is improved becomes free we have brought buddhisms twenty year effort to exteriorize down to twenty seconds we have found what kept dharmas efforts from perfection and what barriered buddhism in culture that only accepts dharmas idea but not yet buddhas dont be discouraged by failures to get instant acceptance for scientology but notice also that earlier missionaries had bank and therefore havent had pure version of the truth that they were spreading the christians civilized things somewhat but there were too many vias to get very good results with christianity from buddha through socrates through the original form of christianity through organized christianity through various arguments of christianity buddhism spread faster than christianity because buddhas ideas were closer to those of dharma buddha was capitalizing on dharmas idea that wisdom would make you free which was acceptable to his society it carried the implication that it was possible to be free asia knew that there was possibility of man becoming free very hard message to get across matter how information is conveyed if it is conveyed at all and it is truth it will take root so scientology wont really take 10000 years to get across it will be more like fifty years at the outside given how fast buddhism civilized asia and japan and given 1 the result that we can produce 2 modern communication 3 the slightly more barbaric conditions 2500 years ago if you take half century to get scientology around you are really slow man you notice i said you when you first address being then you are capitalizing on the past indoctrination and belief of the being you must take this into account the magna carta is direct result on education in dharma through the church the spanish civil war of 1936 was also the result of the philosophy of dharma because in the decade just before the war paperback books were introduced people read french and english philosophers and got the idea that now that they knew something they should be free they actually resisted freedom though so it backfired where you fail in disseminating is where you run into someone who doesnt have this assumption people have to learn that individuals should be free or educated government that skimps on education is either one that hasnt heard of the philosophy of dharma or one that suppresses this philosophy out of fear in the west you are talking to christian people who unfortunately think of the soul as an owned commodity that they should not play with they are stunned to think of someone exteriorizing they are really not up to the idea of buddha though they have gotten theidea of dharma such people have gone past dharma but havent reached buddha it is to such people that you are trying to teach scientology so dont go in over their heads fortunately they do agree with the gradation scale of release they understand the idea of clear as someone who doesnt have barriers to his thinking or to freedom of his mind but they will not understand exteriorization which is in the realm of ot so talk about clear but dont talk about ot there are many undercuts that you could teach him dianetics is not the lowest undercut only relatively enlightened public will accept dianetics the public will understand the idea of communication release as person who gets rid of his barriers to communication they can get the idea that person can communicate better that person can be released from an inability to communicate wog who cant communicate will think that communications release is great for stammerers and backwards children etc he thinks its great for others in short but he will buy the idea likewise with problems wog will buy the idea that man would be better off if he could handle problems and so on up the line there is high probability that you will make connection somewhere the idea that wisdom leads to freedom is basic on this chain it releases man from imprisonment by ignorance and that is your first form of release teach person that if he learned something he would be freeer and he will be released from the idea that he cant know this is the earliest stage of release you would do well to argue with people on the basis of this first premise the dharmic fundamental because dharmas idea is the direct ancestor of scientology there is lower level of release one you would use in processing animals it is the idea that an animal could get an idea across to another animal this is not communication you have to know youre in something before you can get out of it that is the main difficulty with communicating levels of release and people psychologists etc are not aware of the mind they see another bloke they dont see any mind so he says there is such thing as mind only brain which can be seen but in fact the brain is just sort of neural shock absorber looking at scientology as philosophy is agreeable to people when you put it this way you are in agreement with the idea that person can become freer released from some of his travail by becoming wiser so use dharma in dissemination your next level of release that is acceptable to the world at large is that man is spiritual being buddhas idea however dont use this wundt of leipzig wiped out buddha in the west in 1879 when he introduced the idea that man was an animal so it was ok to kill him this is like the christian philosophy advanced in the second or third century ad that man was conceived in evil and was evil so it was perfectly ok to kill maim etc it was and is justification for overts the christian has not found out that the psychologist is an atheist this is partially due to the inarticulateness of the psychologist the populace thinks that psychology is silly but suppressives and governments support it because it prevents releasing sps support sp subjects and technologies that is why the government supports psychology and psychiatry in disseminating you could say you are christian arent you then he has admitted that he is spiritual being reincarnation was only barred in christianity in the last few hundred years the former idea was that guys who hadnt been good enough had to come back and live it all over again if you can get someone to buy the idea that he is spiritual being he is released from truth that could trap him possibly this is where you could introduce the idea of exteriorization but i dont advise it dianetics can give one release from this one lifetime that is terrific release you have made an immortal the terrible consequences of death go away you can start with the idea that there is mind looking at b doesnt see bs mind so he doesnt know that b has mind he may think that b only has brain you have to put across the idea that because this fellow the fellow that you are talking to has mind that that person has mind with dianetics it would follow that he is immortal then he is released from the idea that man is matter and that he only has one life fortunately people do know that there is such thing as mind and mental things they havent gotten totally sold on the psychologists theory thatmind brain so you can move in and introduce the idea of the mind being composed of pictures with little dianetic auditing the person will realize that he is immortal and you will have released him from the idea that he is matter so you should be aware that you can release people just by talking to them up to point but remember always stop at the fn vgis dont try to just communicate the data up the chart to do so overwhelms people they have to come to realize it as you progress up the grade chart it becomes progressively more impossible to talk them out of what they are sitting in at levels vi and vii it would be fatal an ultimate release would be release from the universe when we say release we mean freeing we can free someone from an idea that entraps him ideas are the only real traps and one can get released from them there are many grades of release below zero at zero and up we are starting to free someone directly from his reactive mind treating him as spiritual being at level 0 we are pulling him out of mass that tells him that he cant communicate so we have to pull him out of mental masses as well as out of ideas at level vii and up we dont pull him out of mental mass we erase it we turn around and eat the tiger that is form of release that we call clear but this being at this level is still in the universe and associated with the body there are therefore grades of release above clear not many people below the level of clear look any higher though because clear is pretty triumphant level when you get an fn shut up because you have just released the pc from something you have to know why he got the fn to get him through qual ie you have to know what he is released on get this data from the auditing notes not from the pc most stages of release have only relative degrees of stability but release never unreleases to the same degree of stygian darkness that he was in before the release clear is someone who has erased the barriers to his postulating freely he can at this point easily postulate bank and some have done so not realizing that that was what they were doing clear can postulate bank and then not realize that he has done so or that he can simply blow it we are making dianetic clears the trouble we had doing it earlier came only from over auditing people also dont ever try to teach guy something that he already knows it is an overrun released person doesnt tend to relapse but he may run into the next higher levels sticky plaster they havent unreleased they are just enterprising and speculative and this drives them into the next level someone who has been released and comes in the next day with fn has just gotten into the next mass that he is going to confront releases want others to be released and cleared but dont release people to make them better for others sakes being released is something that is reward not right6608c18 shspec76 study and intention the name of the source becomes identified with the product like kleenex the name dharma became identified with the product rather than with the source of the product so that today you cant find correct definition of dharma anywhere the word dharma does not have its original meaning preserved according to dictionaries it means 1 supreme law 2 the caste system of india 3 fate 4 love 5 the way in buddhism 2500 years ago gautama siddhartha said that the age of love was to begin in the west in 2500 years we started the age of love by making clears they talk about love lot we are longer in the age of reason thank god student should be aware of his intention in studying faulty source may be important in study student tends to assume that the source that he is studying from has some validity but this isnt necessarily the case in fact it frequently isnt the case difficult exams in universities dont correlate with excellence of graduates because for one thing study is an area that attracts suppressives like the areas of government or healing for instance in navigation the method used is what is tested in exams but the fact that you can navigate is all the sea cares about textbooks on navigation are often so complex that you have to know all about the subject before you can understand the bock many textbooks on the sea are full of nothing but disaster in great detail coast pilots are particularly full of warnings and disasters you could write any subject up to make it suppressive subject by making it seem too dangerous to practice on the other hand you can not give any cautions about the subject like leaving out the fact that wronglydone s and d that gets the wrong suppressive will make the pc sick because it restimulates and bypasses the right one the mind has been made too dangerous to study the writers of textbooks need knowledge of study materials as you study what do you intend to do with what you are studying for what purpose are you studying until you clarify that point you cant study intelligently the trouble with university education is that students study to pass exams not to use the materials in practice that is scholastic or academic study which isnt worth much this is why you get failures in practice after certification if someone studies just for examinations he doesnt have to know the exact meanings of the words thus we get very educated dumbbells some subjects are taught suppressively and are therefore ethics subjects where subject is very suppressive it can be studied for examination needing only to be memorized and spat back but it cant be applied because there was nothing there to be understood study gone wild leads to suicides cf french universities at exam time people who are very successful in life are frequently the dropouts who realize that university texts are not arranged to let you apply anything not single philosopher except mills stayed in school subject that is written up with slant or curve is relatively inapplicable too economics is good example economics hardly exists in its simple purity anymore similarly psychoanalysis has relation to freud anymore scientology is studied along the same lines that it was researched on it has curve to it if anything is inapplicable you

pattern wouldnt fit scientology org because business orgs have never isolated the principles of organization in scientology org you are handling life as commodity and you are handling life with vessel made out of life this is like trying to pour water into pitcher made of water in this situation you will find out every frailty in an organization but one law businesses have not violated any organization is better than organization individuals as such operating together will fall apart when they collide with an organized group brilliant leadership can only go so far it needs execution otherwise it fails an organization will normally win unless it is confronted with superior organization an organization consists of group of individuals with common goal or purpose there will never be an org that is perfect because it is composed of individuals who are to greater or lesser degree informed of the rules and in agreement with the purpose an organization must to some degree consist of sentient irreducible individuals it must depend on the individuals for instance literacy is prerequisite for democracy england does better than some other democracies because it has high level of education individuals in the us have so many and varying prejudices that none can really take hold it also has high level of education therefore it is the richest country in the world business management in the us is very tight in spite of bad leadership that will eventually cause trouble the us is doing well organization also has drawbacks 1 limited power of choice of the individual 2 an organization often swallows up the talents and potential contributions of the individual 3 it often plays hobb with the very principles that it is trying to forward 4 wrongly led an organization becomes machine that goes straight over the cliff to destruction but the plus points prevail over the outpoints organizations endure better than individuals on the whole track orgs best survived when led by keyedout ot you would think that these individuals would be unorganizable because of their differences of opinion yes they do have differences of opinions but they still realize that it is better to be organized than not they also recognize the liabilities of orgs higher posts shift lot in ot organizations the ots are minority group in charge of fantastic majorities an individual who puts together an organization without knowing how to do it makes mess law of organization large organization is composed of groups and small organization is composed of individuals when large org is composed of individuals the individual gets devalued you get lack of comparability between the individual and the group of which he is member therefore the individual feels oppressed the people vs john jones makes paranoid therefore the ideal form of organization is individuals composed into subgroups if you try to produce group that is all composed of individuals and expand it it goes all to pieces an org will remain small group as long as it is composed of individuals income tax is violation of this principle because the individual must report to the government once year thus quite apart from the economics of income tax eg penalizing up stats this will make the country grow smaller each person can be jumped on by the government without buffer you must cut out the situation of having an organization vs an individual and stick to the situation of the organization vs group group does have an optimum size seven or eight subordinates is lot if person had only two subordinates he would loaf so the optimum is somewhere between two and eight so we can say that five is optimal big group then would be ten and small group would betwo or three by the time you are getting up into group of seven or eight it is best to split things up into two groups the members of each section look to their section leader this also means that an executive spends one sixth of his time consulting with higher management and five sixths of his time dealing with his five subordinates director only looks to his section leaders and an executive secretary only looks to directors danger condition would consist of an exec sec giving orders to section leaders bypassing the director when this happens the org will get smaller you could move this organizational scheme out to where the org could contain the population of the planet size means nothing if you know this law of organization therefore you need an expandable and contractable system the lowest number in group should be five to six people two people isnt really group it is pair when the state breaks down the family as group the church etc the state shrinks when manager becomes overworked his area wont expand therefore if you want to expand make sure your manager isnt overworked you cant have section that is independent of other sections if you try to have such section it will float free and collapse it must have service and communication connections with the rest of the group there are seven divisions on the org board the org board is cylinder circle to show this fact we put the seventh division in front of div 1 you enter the org board at the first department of the first division the org board is organized to impel particle from the first division on out through the back door any particle entered early will shunt late div 7 doesnt necessarily catch what is ejected at div 6 so there is way out of the org board if you violate the position of anything on this chart you cut your throat the order of departments was found by trial and error earlier on we got into trouble because we tried to put origin or construction in dept 9 now 1976 the department of records assets and materials in div 3 it belonged at origin so construction had to be back towards source if something is mispositioned on the board it will be nonfunctional and will cease to work the order of the divisions is 1 hco you have to start with communications 2 dissem dissemination is necessary with the communication you must tell people what you are going to make 3 organization division treasury this is the division that organizes the mest for the assembly of products 4 tech this division has to do with production 5 qual this division deals with correction or adjustment 6 distribution this division is to get rid of the product this is also sales division when they are busy getting rid of the product they are also making new customers that enter at div1 7 executive the first department would be the office of the ed or general manager the problem in an organization is one of succession but if you get management you dont need succession the lrh comm approves anything that is not against policy that the ed wants to do the us should have the office of george washington each department should have less than or equal to five sections or it should be written up again then you get subsections units subunits etc the org board is flow chartan other primary law of management the fastflow system of management dont inspect before it goes wrong this just holds up the activities of the organization and puts in arbitraries you dont run an organization by being supernervous you let something happen then you act dont put in permanent preventers let the flow go an organization must produce something everyone must have stat the org pattern would do for government it is far more socialistic than socialism and far more communistic than communism socialism and communism are relatively conservative in comparison you would introduce individual companies into your organization as service or production units the reason why divisions are in units of three departments is that you have the head of the division representing the thetan and the three departments representing the mind body and product respectively6608c25 shspec78 the antisocial personality reference hcob 27sep66 or introduction to scientology ethics pp 914 the antisocial personality lrh has made complete list of the characteristics of suppressive person the purpose of ethics is to get technology in ethics doesnt intend social betterment it only intends to ensure case advance by getting suppressives out of the environment an auditor must know about this so that he can recognize and handle pts and suppressive pcs this ability to recognize and handle can prevent an auditor from having loses and invalidating himself when an sp doesnt make case gain when pcs rollercoaster dont blame the past auditor or the hgc blame the sp pc who is critical of an auditor has missed withhold from that auditor the pc who goes on nattering about the thousands of hours of auditing that he has received with gain is another matter you can be too propitiative towards people whereupon you cant help them anymore you exert control and dont give effective help lrh never owed scientology to anyone one of the earliest techniques for controlling pcs taken from early dianetics was to walk out on pc who refused to be controlled with the rfactor that the session would resume when the pc decided to follow the auditors directions at that point lrh hadnt run into failed psychoanalytic cases and people who had been roughed up by psychotherapy there were lot of these people in the first foundation they were generally pts or sps these cases are much harder to handle with auditing than criminals the sp on the case may be nowhere near the pts individual or the trouble that the pts causes in early dianetics pc who got better and then crashed was said to have been on manic person who is manic and then gets depressed however has just run into an sp and has gone pts there is such thing as manic its just that psychiatrists hate people in that condition and so they promptly cave them in the guy says wow at last i realize that i can be sane and isnt the world wonderful the psychiatrist says ohmigawd youre in manic weve got to give you eighteen extra shocks or pills etc the psychiatrist says that euphoria is very bad this explains away persons getting better and this will be used by sps against you as an argument against scientology the only reason for cavein or roller coaster is an sp joe winters overt was making deal with the publisher of book one to write book to get the mds into dianetics doctor looks at dianetics he claimed that dianetics was an art knack that couldnt be taught this led to complete squirrel nonstandard tech being spread all over the place with results i couldnt hold in tech because i 1 didnt have control of it and 2 didnt have ethics until ethics was gotten in in organizations it was impossible to keep tech in and working fully because there was way to hold the line and way to get the suppressives off tech lines an auditor who doesnt recognize ethicstype cases ie sps and ptss is setting himself up for loses and for eventually quitting auditing there is such thing as case who doesnt have wall there only picture of wall the universe for such person is very flimsy mockup consisting of dubin you can run contact processes on such person cchs and he will come back into contact with the wall that you and i see occasionally he will be startled while doing objective processes to see the wall getting shaky and disappearing you may think that you are making him ot but you arent because the wall is still there for you if he were ot it wouldnt be he will realize that his mockedup wall is not the wall that is there this individual doesnt have to be an sp to have mockups in place of walls for the sp people every one of us are mockups too we arent there god knows what is there in the place where we are standing paranoid is mild version of this an sp is not paranoid paranoid just thinks people are against him an sp is person who is surrounded by identities which others dont see the paranoid may see purely imaginary people who arent there at all the sp creates his enemies out of the real whole cloth of you and he doesnt see his enemies unless another real person isthere to be turned into pink alligator crazed indian or the priests of the spanish inquisition what is really there in the sps universe is something else other than people something very threatening and dangerous yet mostly this person looks totally sane he doesnt hallucinate he is just delusional he is stuck on the track really stuck he has never moved beyond the stuck point on the track an sp doesnt make case gain because person needs to have at least concept of motion on the time track to get from one end of an engram to the other the sp cant run an engram because he is stuck in past moment in time and cant move through through the successive moments of the engram you or i might have had an incident there for long time without noticing it but the sp has had the world there for long time and hasnt noticed it the antisocial personality has been looked at before but it has never been fully described in earlier therapies we call such person suppressive because that is more explicit and accurate term these are the qualities of the suppressive 1 we speaks only in generalities he is always talking about they and everybody this effects ptss so they echo it but somebody told the pts newspapers speak of 850 dead on holiday but they neglect to state that 85 million people were on holiday that makes it all look sort of dangerous governments likewise govern the people or the masses not the individuals who are actually there this is where the sweeping generality comes in 2 he deals in bad news continually and exclusively he is critically hostile he never relays good news but may twist good news to bad bad news will be relayed and worsened very sp person is so batty that when he moves up in the world he makes this the norm 3 he alters any communication he never duplicates cf the game of telephone 4 he doesnt respond to treatment reform or psychotherapy the really bad sp wont come anywhere near an auditing chair the one thing this fellow can not do is confront his own mind the sp feels that he would go totally insane if he had to take one tiny little look at his mind that is why the sp goes mad at the idea of getting people to look at their own minds an sp is afraid that if he deals with the mind even slightly those spooks will move slightly sps cannot be reasoned with on the subject of the mind your crime is that you have almost made them confront something that they dont dare confront and you have almost exposed them because they are not under good control and if they love control they will be put away 5 he is surrounded by others in one or another state of ruin and cavein ptss around such person we find associates who are cowed ill failing or not succeeding if not actually driven insane when you try to treat these associates they dont keep their gains 6 he habitually selects the wrong target this is not conscious it is not just getting mad at the boss because somebody is mad at you it is very reactive in the sp for instance psychiatrists wreck people and sps in governments attack us there is complete dissociation it is bill failed at college so therefore we should go on diet not bill failed at college therefore we shouldnt send his brother pete because the sp attacks the wrong target he doesnt succeed very will on job this is saving grace 7 he doesnt complete cycles of action if he finds out that he has completed one he has to redo it he mustnt arrive and he doesnt arrive because his time sense is loused up he doesnt have the idea of consecutive events 8 he will often confess to alarming crimes with sense of guilt or personal responsibility whatsoever he doesnt know that there is difference between good and bad behavior 9 he supports and approves of only destructive downstat and criminal groups and attacks constructive ones10 he approves of destructive actions and disapproves of good actions he says it is probably good thing that we had the war because 11 helping others is an activity that drives him nearly berserk however activities that destroy in the name of help are closely supported the idea is to get rid everybody or to make them all miserable 12 he has bad sense of property he thinks that the idea that people own things is pretense made up to fool people nothing is ever really owned to the sp delusions of grandeur and desires to dominate have nothing to do with suppressiveness the concept of ones own importance does not have any bearing here an sp may or may not have the feeling of being very important as may nonsp there is nothing wrong with dominance this is not the same as suppression it is what person does with dominance that counts an auditors skill depends on his recognition of the situation in which he finds himself auditing when you manage to isolate series of characteristics that give you certain expectancy knowledge of this data becomes valuable if you can see several characteristics on an sp in person you can predict the rest and unload this is an ethics case an auditor should know that there could be more than one sp on the case he should locate the other sps if the first s and d doesnt get permanent results even though it was well done you could do successful s and d and at much later date the pc could find another sp and rollercoaster from that6609c01 shspec79 gradients and arc lrh coaches with the intention of making his student sound and look like an auditor coaching is happy medium between so many flunks that the student quite and so few that he turns into lousy auditor any coaching can be improved it is easy to coach if you know what the tr you are working on is supposed to do the reason for security measures with upperlevel materials is because you have to judge the ferocity of the material against the power of the individual that you are giving it to the only thing wrong with 1950 dianetics was that people were thrown in over their heads the clearing and ot materials look so what when one has finished them but not before if you skip half page or glance ahead accidentally while running them you will get sick the gradient approach has been primary and regulating factor in all of scientology it is new idea as an overall idea thetan in particular responds very well to this approach he responds better than body does you can do gradient that is too shallow or too steep for your pc if you dont correctly judge his reality level confront etc just little bit tough all the way is best but not so tough that you get failures it should just be hard work there are pcs to whom everything is automatic they have trouble on some process because they dont perceive the things in the process they have reality in cchs there are people who will go through it with change at all they are aberrated as coots there is reality to it they dont have to confront doing the process because they arent doing it at person with reality on lions or tigers can walk though cage with lions and tigers in it you must estimate the degree of persons aberration to draw up an estimate of what gradient to apply to it if you cant make eg grade 0 release either 1 the pc is already grade 0 release or 2 grade 0 is completely over his head it is obvious which of these two things is the case if you know what you are looking for you can undercut it if you need to by raising other corners of the arc triangle for instance if the pc doesnt go release on grade 0 you could audit the pc on various processes to raise and r for instance dianetic auditing eg lock scanning words as an undercut this works even on the insane there doesnt have to be anybody else there but the auditor ie the auditor runs the bank usually it is r that you raise affinity occurs in the process of doing this you still have to estimate correctly what the pc can run if the pc is in desperate condition dont do something desperate an early entrance point is mimicry doing mimicry on someone makes you real to them it is low level of communication but it works very well especially as point to at ack with someone who doesnt attain grade 0 release if you imitate little kid or if you communicate with him he will like you he will pick you out in roomful of people not because he knows you but because you are real to him below grade 0 ie if comm is really out or is very difficult you approach with reality as the entry point on the arc triangle so you could use mimicry however if you validate insanity too long you will stick the pc in win for his insane behavior but you cant invalidate him either say the guy complains of spiders all over the wall and himself dont invalidate him pick out the real reality in what he said wall or to hell with the spiders and focus on that and dont agree about the spiders that is lie and basically he knows it so he will know that you are crazy if you agree about the spiders ask what kind of wall wouldnt spiders be on or what kind of wall do spiders like best or who would you have to be not to have spiders on you and you will shift his realityyou could get clever with raising reality lrh did in the late forties unfortunately lots of therapies sprang from his ran various things in 1949 every time i audited anybody while others were watching it became school of psychotherapy because they couldnt integrate it so it ill by itself became an approach like gestalt therapy they didnt have the basic data gradient scales arc triangle etc they just copied one thing used in one case the error was made that because this was successful as an entrance point with one individual the same gradient had to be used on all individuals for instance if the pc has policemen on his front porch he at least has porch now the chances are that he has all porches identified aaa if you can introduce differentiation amongst porches you get an increase in reality and an improved state of case but the squirrels would be stuck in asking the pc about walls or worse spiders not realizing that in this case the proper entrance point would be porch point of mutual reality you would get the pc to differentiate between porches and drop the aaa the squirrel never cognited on what lrh was doing he thought that lrh had knack mathematics is in kindergarten on this planet people on this planet dont understand symbolic mathematics symbolic math is not doing algebra with symbols it is solving vast number of nonnumerical variables by the use of comparisons similarities identities and differences and you cant write it down you mustnt follow the lead of math in applying the suppressive generality of number to the specific entity eg an apple person etc which is being calculated two plus two does not equal and never will equal four you have to specify two what when you answerwhat nonspecifically you have an insanity mans math is insane zero is wild variable you must specify zero of what in what interesting universe is this zero of nothing so every time formula involves zero as in nuclear physics it is guess which in fact is based on experiment and not on mathematical prediction these guys really dont know what they are doing in higher math logic ultimately depends on you and your concept of reality math is actually lowgrade expression of r and c r and c add up to understanding mathematicians along with others in denying that you being exist has dropped out that which uses the math and understands it mathematics cannot exist without live interpretation it is always you who asks the question and you who receives the answer if there are live beings to understand there is mathematics math could be defined as method of memory devised by living being to make inanimate objects or other things appear to think or act you will be able to be as much at cause over the whole thing as you are ot because the more livingness you exert the more logical you can be about it you will be as good logically as you are clear eventually you can run up to point where you dont need mathematics one of the baffling things about dianetics and scientology is the question how did he figure it all out there are lots of formulas but it is an old line one lrh is very familiar with its simple matter of arc of potential understanding you cant stand back and hate men and find out any r about them you cant have total unreality about men sitting in some ivory tower someplace and hope to get understanding of or reality on man and communication you cant go about it being careful of what you say and by being afraid to hear anybody who is easily offended had better never go into the business of understanding because it winds up only with prejudice this of course explains somebody whos terribly offended by scientology hes so offended by what he hears shut down communication he cant understand anything in the first place the first requisite on studying life is to be alive not dead or disciplined or approved of in wogs death really gets people together to approve something as in dont speak ill of the dead therefore the basis of all scientologic and dianetic research has been understanding there was mystery involved just arc plus fear of saying things or looking at things awareness depends on how alive you are im not trying to say im more alive than others i just am reality goes lower further south than communication and affinity goes lower in reach than reality this sounds odd but it is observationally true insane people with very lowreality can yet feel enough affection to go sane because i asked them to education doesnt work in the absence of r and c r and c are the three pins on which you adjust any auditing session and how you select what you do all auditing sessions go by gradients there is need to depart from what is laid out in the grade chart in auditing but what about the zone between the org and the world around you it is problem in 1 gradients 2 r and c for instance there are two ways to handle intrafamilial relations 1 individual processing on gradient this is the best way it is very senior to education when ethics is used to get tech in it is used to force the family members to act in such way that tech can go in it is not to give advice 2 r and c this is limited if one is present to understand if they dont understand they wont even start the process of getting into better arc this is the problem here we keep looking for some marvellous solution to any individual or organizational problem just realize that theres solution at any time superior to the ability of the person asking for it to understand there is math that would help figure it out mathematics is as good as it can be employed with understanding and as good as the understanding of who asks and who receives the answer the answer to becoming better at mathematics is to became clearer the answer to any problem is to become more alive and more capable of understanding that is the answer which pays off how do you do this you get processed and you process people you are not in position in society to reform society educationally you cant educationally inform the public all you can say is that there is way the worlds reality on communication is extremely faint what they are using the communication media for is total malicious waste the newspaper is the modern gossip r and c in the world today is not good higherlevel data from scientology is totally outr so what can clear 0t or release do he can remember r and c in disseminating and he can just be dont let affinity overwhelm the reality get the affinity and the reality in dont kid yourself you can feel on affinity and get reality never allow others to cut you back from communication then you will understand understanding washes away everything understanding is universal solvent communication is always within the reality of the person who can hear it so your communication must be within the reality of the individual you err when you tell people any more than they need to know namely that there is way out if you tell them more you bedazzle their understanding an 0t could overwhelm guy he could put him in awe or in religious frenzy but the ot is actually putting the other person in complete unreality is he does this the more vulnerable person is the less capable of understanding he is and vice versa at this particular time our power exceeds our understanding though not by much and this wont continue to be true so we get into crisis situation do we get so tired of them we just overwhump them or do we stay true to our own beliefs and continuing to suffer the slings and arrows that are thrown at us still go along in high state of arc there is real argument the answer is the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics so the question is beginning to come up what are we going to do with this planet the only mathematics that will solve this question and the question of how to protect people at lower levels of awareness is the mathematics of arc and the axioms we have to be gingerly because those on the way up the bridge need protection the power of scientology will inevitably be used for the greatest good of the greatest number of dynamics the question is how to minimize the casualties along the way but lrh doesnt have any canned answersabout what we will do with the planet he has plan for keeping scientologists from being wiped out in cataclysm we are at crossroads as our power increases we have been very forbearing we have to rely on good sense and on keeping our reality from degenerating to where it longer matters what happens to the little guys every religious organization of the past has flunked this test i hope we dont luckily arc increases as one goes up the levels towards ot6609c08 shspec80 states of identity apparently there is boundary beyond which you dont have thetans you have endowment of form with life the little things that wiggle for instance the amoeba or the cell is endowed an ot comes along and says let there be chicken he leaves puddle of theta to animate it this is the concept of how bodies are built there is some truth in the idea that talking to flowers makes them grow better way back someplace the thetan probably did something like this the green thumb phenomenon is perhaps lowerscale harmonic of this there do seem to be people with green thetan other natural abilities of thetans sometimes get preserved in or by individuals in an outofcontrol state so you get telekinesis telepathy child geniuses etc jung had trouble with poltergeists actually he was subject to form of belowawareness telekinesis some skills that are on automatic will temporarily vanish in the course of clearing suddenly you find that you cant do it anymore but when it comes back it is you doing it instead of machine or something jung went into only one past life that of the english druids anything wrong with thetan is lower harmonic of that he can do higher up on the scale when that goes wrong his ability on it goes into an inversion or goes out of his control and still happens in his vicinity as with jung and puzzles him it is just little facet of his ability that has been brought down with him and not yet eaten up boy wonders tend to fold up because they dont know that they are doing it it is not under their control the musical child prodigy has probably been good musician in the near past as you go upscale you tend to lose circuits if we exempt endowed states of wiggle we can find out how far down in the fifth dynamic thetan can go the answer is someplace in the insect or animal kingdom above that you get thetans below that wiggle sometimes you run into horse who is thetan and sometimes you run into one that isnt or bee who was and bee who wasnt when nothing much is required of an animal or insect you can get survival as just piece of automatic machinery unchanging in habit pattern etc it is shadow of thetan because thetan made it you occasionally find vegetables in the human race bodies without thetans maybe sometimes some thetan picks up the body and it changes spectacularly body can survive although not well without thetan when it has been totally guided by thetan and the thetan leaves the body isnt on any automatic functioning and it wont do well also if thetan caves body in the body wont do well body will only get as good as you take away what is caving the body in most mammalian bodies live six times as long as it takes them to grow up thus mans lifespan should go to 110120 years the reason why it doesnt is that the human body is driven by thetan an aberrated thetan causes sick body thetan with service fac is quite capable of keeping body from getting well as society becomes more aberrated it becomes more sick one form of endowed life may destroy another form so it shouldnt upset you that you can cure up the thetan and the body doesnt get well there are variety of illnesses that body suffers from because it is being messed up by thetan who with his intention and aberration is influencing his physical body that body will get as well as you relieve the aberration of the thetan in those sectors where the thetan is causing the body to get sick therefore dont assume that all that is wrong with the body is the mind but in addition to the effects of the thetan on the body there is also different seement of illness caused by endowed life units that are designedly contrary to the bodys life units eg disease germs parasites worms etc then there is physical injury if you hit body with battering ram it doesnt matter what state the thetan is in the body is going to go splash if body is badly guided it issmashed often so you can reduce this category of bodily ills by fixing up the thetan so that he has fewer accidents however some accident is pretty inevitable in an uncleared environment another factor is the repairing ability of the being if one were really upscale as thetan he could patch up or repair the body directly or he could mock up new one lower scale manifestation the thetan stops knocking the body about upper scale manifestation the thetan can put the body back together again so there are three sectors of attack on body 1 endowed life attacking the endowed life of the body 2 aberration of the thetan influencing the body 3 mechanical damage to the body this would include chemical damage poisons lack of air etc and there are three basic means of cure 1 the thetan can repair the body directly 2 you can use beneficial endowed life units as in antibiotics to help the body 3 you can repair the body mechanically as with surgery here you can repair damage or misplaced parts eg from faulty construction of the body or cut out endowed life forms infected tissue or cancerous tissue that attack the endowed life of the body chemical repair could be in this category also eg antidotes oxygen water etc therefore to assume that you can cure everything with auditing is as silly as to assume that you can cure fear of spiders by means of neurosurgery beings do tend to an allness cure all propensity as long as you are not able to endow matter with life you have to settle for what youve got you have to live with the body youve got or do without one so you have to decade whether you are looking at 1 endowed life forms countering each other 2 pure mechanical injury 3 something the thetan is doing to the body you are better off in the last sphere the first two need to be handled in an emergency but the thetan is quite capable of preventing body from recovering eg with service fac so auditing can act as before or after adjunct to the handling of 1 or 2 above you could make thetan less susceptible to 1 or 2 and you could come along after the fact and speed up healing to the degree that the thetan was preventing it from happening your only mistake is to run the incident while it is still going on treat it first and dont get into an allness about auditing and its healing effects the mechanism of miracles using religious relics or tokens eg saints knuckle bone is restimulation of the curative abilities of thetan if they existed that is the thetans idea of his own power is restimulated by demonstrating that there is power somewhere nut this is mental intervention faith healing restores momentarily thetans ot ability to do something with the body it has drawbacks since every now and then when body was endowed by thetan when thetan b comes along and puts some life into it it will get sicker some faith healers have not lost the ability to endow life or change the life endowment of body you can look around the eyes and get the stars that you can see surrounding them these are little gold balls throw them away and put in your own and you can get sicker bodies dontlike having their anchor points messed around with or exchanged to complete the experiment throw your gold balls away and get the other ones back there are many things that man didnt know about beingness or life therefore he made fantastic mistakes dont make these mistakes recognize mans limitations relative to this recognize also that they are not your limitations but that they are mans therefore you need an understanding of states of beingness cavedin thetan is on reverse he is totally the unknowing effect of his own cause anything he can do is being done but he is not doing it he has lost some of his ability to have even that happen he is totally gone so estimate how far down he can go he can go down to being the effect of the effect of the effect etc of himself but this is way beyond his reality so dont expect him to got any reality on how he is doing it when you get body animated by thetan as opposed to having body that is merely endowed you go into fringe that is well below being oneself or being conscious one is sort of automatically awake automatically existing with responsibility for being alive awake or existing just below that you get unconsciousness below where he has clue that he is conscious you are getting down to the lower dregs of thetanhood and the upper strata of the human race the thetan conceives that he is body endowed life and more he is removed something he is an identity body he can be picked up rapidly from there to the state of grade 0 release quite distance grade 0 release is less the effect of causes but he is not up to causative alertness he is awake or groggy on an effect basis as he improves he gets to be less the effect both of his own cause and of others cause guy who is really low down on cause is the effect of anything that occurs anywhere he worries about train wrecks 8000 miles away he could go downscale from that point so that he doesnt worry anymore because he doesnt exist and isnt worth anything so it doesnt matter what he is the effect of he can go down below that into faith i have an automatic regulator of my destiny so i dont have to be alert or be concerned about anything because something somewhere is taking care of this isnt necessarily connected with religion people will mock this state up for themselves without even knowing that they are doing it at this point the thetan is totally irresponsible going downscale from there he goes into sort of numbness further release from responsibility below this he is subject to any number of automaticities which if triggered would produce total certifiable insanity the majority of the human face is about quarter of an inch above that that is why many people dont listen to you their state of beingness isnt up to it you must keep the above in mind when asking wog to look at responsibility an individual asked to look at his mind as cause or an effect can get into such anxiety instead of looking into himself that he goes frenziedly mad say that we were in an arena someone let in tiger and you said to joe jump over the railing and deal with the tiger he would think that you were joking at first but if you tried to force him over the railing you would have fighting screaming person on your hands who would be liable to say most anything so it is with the sp when you get him to look at his mind eg to look at breakfast sps arent trying to disprove scientology there is doubt in their minds that you could make them do things and the thought terrifies them the sp thinks that you are likely to drive him mad sps think that they are public benefactors who are discrediting scientology so that people wont have to look at their minds an sp is below being able to be the effect of anything even an automaticity so when you bring him upscale the first thing he has to confront that he might possibly be the effect of is the mind and he goes sting he goes bit insane sps are below the level of insanity so they have to come up through band of insanity cf rd laings idea that the path to sanity is through insanity they are below the level of being the effect of anything good or bad any effect is bad so they have to be an automatic thing cause that has an automatic effect actually they are and aing with an endowed self your presence however can bring them upscale you can be up to the point where your ability to endow is on automatic and you get guys twitching around you when you get to ot that comes under controlthere has always been way up and road out but it hasnt been pursued because philosophers are thoughtful types they are noted for being reasonable and getting themselves martyred but few stand up strongly when the firing squad marches down the street voltaire got reasonable breakthrough like this isnt scholarly affair it has to be done with here goes nothing attitude to follow up on scientology person would either have to be very reassured in very quiet environment for considerable period of time if the person was pretty bad off ie normal he would have to be calmed down before he could confront something the percent of people who can confront is the upper one percent of the planet when you have the ability to confront it is possible that you could exert enough influence on the environment possible is horrible understatement to calm it down to point where he could confront and disenturbulate it enough to make gains to handle the insane you go down to what he can confront being still in still environment with one worrying him with one solid stable object you could let him disenturbulate in this environment the psychotic doesnt have engrams that make him insane he is insane because his ability to confront the environment in his immediate vicinity is so low that he could never possibly take his mind off his environment long enough to look at his mind it is too dangerous just as your super sp screams when you tell him to confront his mind the psychotic screams when you tell him to confront the environment hence quiet environment is the only cure for insanity insanity is study of environments its not study of the mind there is reason to audit the insane at all when the environment is very safe and the individual is longer actively insane then on very light gradient you could get him to confront the mind scientologys problem is not the problem of making one ot if clears have trouble communicating with wogs ots have even more trouble you could endow crippled boys leg with life and heal it this would be ok unless you tried to explain what happened possibly he would come upscale to faith but he would be more likely to go into terror than into faith your main line is the improvement of the being who is willing to be improved doing this you will get enough improved beings to handle the problems in society that must be handled to snap the society out of being insane you dont want to lift people up by faith though but by hope the hope that maybe some day they could do something about it first you give him the hope that you can do something for him or about it then that he can do something about himself and it then the small hopes materialize states of beingness that man will recognize do include saints gods miracle men and messiahs all sorts of beings because man is familiar with superman batman etc he tends to attribute these characteristics to anything that is step forward for man in the past they would have attributed the characteristics of saints to scientologists in greek society it would have been the characteristics of gods man is capable of conceiving of such beings as long as they are unreal and exterior they are ok if looked at through holy book or something what man can conceive and what man can confront are two different things catholic priest professes belief in supernatural phenomena but what would he do it christs hand suddenly appeared disembodied and started turning the pages of his breviary similarly what being can conceive he can become and what he can confront being there is gap between these two things we need further definition to distinguish clears and ots clear has lost the matter energy space and time connected with thing called the mind he is not an allknowing being he moves up through becoming cause over the matter energy space and time of his mind an ot is being who is knowing and willing cause over life thought matter energy space and time that definition doesnt say mind life includes endowed cells not only or necessarily other thetans the ot may or may not be able to handle another thetan but he can handle this commodity called life so there is big gap between clear and ot clear makes nottooaberrated human being almost fly into pieces this happens to minority of people but it does give an element of fear connected with clears you are making peopleconfront something that is somehow little bit within their ken you will not find them tracing the source of it it isnt bad for them if they sat around long enough they would run out all the pictures clear puts normal people at effect without trying to do thing he just has sufficient zone of beingness that what falls into that zone is liable to be asised or go into some sort of action sometimes people fear clears little and dont quite know why they feel that way they dont necessarily associate the feeling with the clear even grade iv release can be so much calmer and more at cause than the environment that his presence can be therapeutic so as you come downscale to grade iv release they stand out rather remarkably and they are still little bit out of reach as you go downscale from there you get person who is more able to disseminate because he more closely matches the reality level of the rest of the environment as you go down the release stages you get closer and closer to an ability to influence another without causing mess directly immediately understandably and without restimulation the bridge stays in as gradient for dissemination even the book one clear was looked upon with considerable awe bodhi is probably below dianetic release it is stable for from two seconds to two years but buddhisms promise to make bodhi was enough to civilize three fourths of asia having moved out of the reality of wogs the scientologist tends to compare himself with other scientologists he is unaware of his state of beingness until he is surrounded by wogs that makes him somewhat unhappy in the company of wogs as you go up towards clear this is less true if you go out in the wog world as clear they dont spot you as source you tend to produce certain phenomena you give the impression of being in command even when you dont do anything to command people will say i have to concentrate to talk to you or you have such command of the situation when nothing is being commanded you dont bother to use this mainly life becomes easier the pity of these states of beingness is that there is limit to what one being can do for another you can do lot but you cant live anothers life for him what you can do is 1 provide safe environment 2 show way methodology 3 provide for the ethical application or administration of methodology 4 give advice 5 pervade the environment with calmness 6 mock up new leg for crippled boy but that is the limit the rest is up to the other guy unless you lead the person to increase his own beingness he will never arrive this is the point that has been missed in all prior attempts to better man the only miraculous intervention there is or ever will be comes from the person himself he must overcome the terror of becoming the effect he must be led upwards by an unenturbulated environment to destimulate enough so that he can put his own feet on the road out and walk you can help him only with those first steps helping the individual is the only way to help

scale releases arc straight wire dianetic there are several grades of release below zero in the minus scale of the original complete gradation chart many of the minus scale can be attained by simple assessment and ceasing to assess the moment the release occurs is vitaldont keep on assessing as the same session auditing action there are three specific grades of release below zero and above the lower minus scale these are from lowest straight wire release dianetic secondary release dianetic engram release old arc straight wire is not at grade zero or grade iii but way down below the dianetic releases the original purpose still holdsto make person able to run secondaries and engrams our tech is still valid you know despite the 1950 origin of arc straight wire arc straight wire was fantastically effective in moving person from neurotic to normal but in running arc straight wire one must use meter and cease to audit the pc the moment the needle goes free dont keep making the blunder of the 50s and early 60s the pc released by arc straight wire can now have secondaries run when needle goes free on secondary one again must cease to audit secondaries the dianetic secondary release can be run on engrams when the needle goes free while running engrams one ceases to audit the pc at once declares for these lower release grades can be confirmed by qual and even declared by certs and awards by small note from the director of certs and awards thus you can possibly get release on the minus scale by assessment of the minus scale higher release by running arc straight wire an even higher one by running dianetic secondaries and yet higher one by running dianetic engrams and then by good trs and standard tech as usual get grade 0 as many people go grade 0 release easily these lower bands get overlooked but those who dont go grade 0 release easily unless it is overrun as the reason for release they can be begun by minus scale assessment then arc straight wire etc back up to zero for another try thereall pcs could be started on the minus scale with harm qual note remember there are several overruns that can require repair these are life overrun in past life on some subject straight wire including self analysis earlier repetitive processing locational etc dianetic secondaries dianetic engrams some cases hang and wont go release at grade 0 unless the above are rehabbed or if never run actually audited on the pc arc breaks can cause failure to go release on grade zero or any other level and can prevent rehabs and poor trs can block the lot l ron hubbard

east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 27 september 1966 remimeo the antisocial personality the antiscientologist there are certain characteristics and mental attitudes which cause about 20 of race to oppose violently any betterment activity or group such people are known to have antisocial tendencies when the legal or political structure of country becomes such as to favor such personalities in positions of trust then all the civilizing organizations of the country become suppressed and barbarism of criminality and economic duress ensues crime and criminal acts are perpetuated by antisocial personalities inmates of institutions commonly trace their state back to contact with such personalities thus in the fields of government police activities and mental health to name few we see that it is important to be able to detect and isolate this personality type so as to protect society and individuals from the destructive consequences attendant upon letting such have free rein to injure others as they only comprise 20 of the population and as only 2l2 of this 20 are truly dangerous we see that with very small amount of effort we could considerably better the state of society wellknown even stellar examples of such personality are of course napoleon and hitler dillinger pretty boy floyd christie and other famous criminals were wellknown examples of the antisocial personality but with such cast of characters in history we neglect the less stellar examples and do not perceive that such personalities exist in current life very common often undetected when we trace the cause of failing business we will inevitably discover somewhere in its ranks the antisocial personality hard at work in families which are breaking up we commonly find one or the other of the persons involved to have such personality where life has become rough and is failing careful review of the area by trained observer will detect one or more such personalities at work as there are 80 of us trying to get along and only 20 trying to prevent us our lives would be much easier to live were we wellinformed as to the exact manifestations of such personality thus we could detect it and save ourselves much failure and heartbreak it is important then to examine and list the attributes of the antisocial personality influencing as it does the daily lives of so many it well behooves decent people to become better informed on this subject attributes the antisocial personality has the following attributes1 he or she speaks only in very broad generalities they say everybody thinks everyone knows and such expressions are in continual use particularly when imparting rumor when asked who is everybody it normally turns out to be one source and from this source the antisocial person has manufactured what he or she pretends is the whole opinion of the whole society this is natural to them since to them all society is large hostile generality against the antisocial in particular 2 such person deals mainly in bad news critical or hostile remarks invalidation and general suppression gossip or harbinger of evil tidings or rumormonger once described such persons it is notable that there is good news or complimentary remark passed on by such person 3 the antisocial personality alters to worsen communication when he or she relays message or news good news is stopped and only bad news often embellished is passed along such person also pretends to pass on bad news which is in actual fact invented 4 characteristic and one of the sad things about an antisocial personality is that it does not respond to treatment or reform or psychotherapy 5 surrounding such personality we find cowed or ill associates or friends who when not driven actually insane are yet behaving in crippled manner in life failing not succeeding such people make trouble for others when treated or educated the near associate of the antisocial personality has stability of gain but promptly relapses or loses his advantages of knowledge being under the suppressive influence of the other physically treated such associates commonly do not recover in the expected time but worsen and have poor convalescences it is quite useless to treat or help or train such persons so long as they remain under the influence of the antisocial connection the largest number of insane are insane because of such antisocial connections and do not recover easily for the same reason unjustly we seldom see the antisocial personality actually in an institution only his friends and family are there 6 the antisocial personality habitually selects the wrong target if tyre is flat from driving over nails he or she curses companion or noncausative source of the trouble if the radio next door is too loud he or she kicks the cat if is the obvious cause the antisocial personality inevitably blames b or c or d 7 the antisocial cannot finish cycle of action such become surrounded with incomplete projects8 many antisocial persons will freely confess to the most alarming crimes when forced to do so but will have faintest sense of responsibility for them their actions have little or nothing to do with their own volition things just happened they have sense of correct causation and particularly cannot feel any sense of remorse or shame therefore 9 the antisocial personality supports only destructive groups and rages against and attacks any constructive or betterment group 10 this type of personality approves only of destructive actions and fights against constructive or helpful actions or activities the artist in particular is often found as magnet for persons with antisocial personalities who see in his art something which must be destroyed and covertly as friend proceed to try 11 helping others is an activity which drives the antisocial personality nearly berserk activities however which destroy in the name of help are closely supported 12 the antisocial personality has bad sense of property and conceives that the idea that anyone owns anything is pretense made up to fool people nothing is ever really owned the basic reason the basic reason the antisocial personality behaves as he or she does lies in hidden terror of others to such person every other being is an enemy an enemy to be covertly or overtly destroyed the fixation is that survival itself depends on keeping others down or keeping people ignorant if anyone were to promise to make others stronger or brighter the antisocial personality suffers the utmost agony of personal danger they reason that if they are in this much trouble with people around them weak or stupid they would perish should anyone become strong or bright such person has trust to point of terror this is usually masked and unrevealed when such personality goes insane the world is full of martians or the fbi and each person met is really martian or fbi agent but the bulk of such people exhibit outward signs of insanity they appear quite rational they can be very convincing however the list given above consists of things which such personality cannot detect in himself or herself this is so true that if you thought you found yourself in one of the above you most certainly are not antisocial selfcriticism is luxury the antisocial cannot afford they must be right because they are in continual danger in their own estimation if you proved one wrong you might even send him or her into severe illness only the sane wellbalanced person tries to correct his conductrelief if you were to weed out of your past by proper search and discovery those antisocial persons you have known and if you then disconnected you might experience great relief similarly if society were to recognize this personality type as sick being as they now isolate people with smallpox both social and economic recoveries could occur things are not likely to get much better so long as 20 of the population is permitted to dominate and injure the lives and enterprise of the remaining 80 as majority rule is the political manner of the day so should majority sanity express itself in our daily lives without the interference and destruction of the socially unwell the pity of it is they will not permit themselves to be helped and would not respond to treatment if help were attempted an understanding and ability to recognize such personalities could bring major change in society and our lives the social personality man in his anxieties is prone to witch hunts all one has to do is designate people wearing black caps as the villains and one can start slaughter of people in black caps this characteristic makes it very easy for the antisocial personality to bring about chaotic or dangerous environment man is not naturally brave or calm in his human state and he is not necessarily villainous even the antisocial personality in his warped way is quite certain that he is acting for the best and commonly sees himself as the only good person around doing all for the good of everyonethe only flaw in his reasoning being that if one kills everyone else none are left to be protected from the imagined evils his conduct in his environment and toward his fellows is the only method of detecting either the antisocial or the social personalities their motives for self are similarselfpreservation and survival they simply go about achieving these in different ways thus as man is naturally neither calm nor brave anyone to some degree tends to be alert to dangerous persons and hence witch hunts can begin it is therefore even more important to identify the social personality than the antisocial personality one then avoids shooting the innocent out of mere prejudice or dislike or because of some momentary misconduct the social personality can be defined most easily by comparison with his opposite the antisocial personality this differentiation is easily done and test should ever be constructed which isolates only the antisocial on the same test must appear the upper as well as lower ranges of mans actions test that declares only antisocial personalities without also being able to identify the social personality would be itself suppressive test it would be like answering yes or noto the question do you still beat your wife anyone who took it could be found guilty while this mechanism might have suited the times of the inquisition it would not suit modern needs as the society runs prospers and lives solely through the efforts of social personalities one must know them as they not the antisocial are the worthwhile people these are the people who must have rights and freedom attention is given to the antisocial solely to protect and assist the social personalities in the society all majority rules civilizing intentions and even the human race will fail unless one can identify and thwart the antisocial personalities and help and forward the social personalities in the society for the very word society implies social conduct and without it there is society at all only barbarism with all men good or bad at risk the frailty of showing how the harmful people can be known is that these then apply the characteristics to decent people to get them hunted down and eradicated the swan song of every great civilization is the tune played by arrows axes or bullets used by the antisocial to slay the last decent men government is only dangerous when it can be employed by and for antisocial personalities the end result is the eradication of all social personalities and the resultant collapse of egypt babylon rome russia or the west you will note in the characteristics of the antisocial personality that intelligence is not clue to the antisocial they are bright or stupid or average thus those who are extremely intelligent can rise to considerable even headofstate heights importance and ability or wish to rise above others are likewise not indexes to the anti social when they do become important or rise they are however rather visible by the broad consequences of their acts but they are as likely to be unimportant people or hold very lowly stations and wish for nothing better thus it is the twelve given characteristics alone which identify the antisocial personality and these same twelve reversed are the sole criteria of the social personality if one wishes to be truthful about them the identification or labelling of an antisocial personality cannot be done honestly and accurately unless one also in the same examination of the person reviews the positive side of his life all persons under stress can react with momentary flashes of antisocial conduct this does not make them antisocial personalities the true antisocial person has majority of antisocial characteristics the social personality has majority of social characteristics thus one must examine the good with the bad before one can truly label the antisocial or the social in reviewing such matters very broad testimony and evidence are best one or two isolated instances determine nothing one should search all twelve social and all twelve anti social characteristics and decide on the basis of actual evidence not opinion the twelve primary characteristics of the social personality are as follows 1 the social personality is specific in relating circumstances joe jones said the star newspaper reported and gives sources of data where important or possiblehe may use the generality of they or people but seldom in connection with attributing statements or opinions of an alarming nature 2 the social personality is eager to relay good news and reluctant to relay bad he may not even bother to pass along criticism when it doesnt matter he is more interested in making another feel liked or wanted than disliked by others and tends to err toward reassurance rather than toward criticism 3 social personality passes communication without much alteration and if deleting anything tends to delete injurious matters he does not like to hurt peoples feelings he sometimes errs in holding back bad news or orders which seem critical or harsh 4 treatment reform and psychotherapy particularly of mild nature work very well on the social personality whereas antisocial people sometimes promise to reform they do not only the social personality can change or improve easily it is often enough to point out unwanted conduct to social personality to completely alter it for the better criminal codes and violent punishment are not needed to regulate social personalities 5 the friends and associates of social personality tend to be well happy and of good morale truly social personality quite often produces betterment in health or fortune by his mere presence on the scene at the very least he does not reduce the existing levels of health or morale in his associates when ill the social personality heals or recovers in an expected manner and is found open to successful treatment 6 the social personality tends to select correct targets for correction he fixes the tyre that is flat rather than attack the windscreen in the mechanical arts he can therefore repair things and make them work 7 cycles of action begun are ordinarily completed by the social personality if possible 8 the social personality is ashamed of his misdeeds and reluctant to confess them he takes responsibility for his errors 9 the social personality supports constructive groups and tends to protest or resist destructive groups 10 destructive actions are protested by the social personality he assists constructive or helpful actions 11 the social personality helps others and actively resists acts which harm others12 property is property of someone to the social personality and its theft or misuse is prevented or frowned upon the basic motivation the social personality naturally operates on the basis of the greatest good he is not haunted by imagined enemies but he does recognize real enemies when they exist the social personality wants to survive and wants others to survive whereas the anti social personality really and covertly wants others to succumb basically the social personality wants others to be happy and do well whereas the anti social personality is very clever in making others do very badly indeed basic clue to the social personality is not really his successes but his motivations the social personality when successful is often target for the antisocial and by this reason he may fail but his intentions included others in his success whereas the antisocial only appreciate the doom of others unless we can detect the social personality and hold him safe from undue restraint and detect also the antisocial and restrain him our society will go on suffering from insanity criminality and war and man and civilization will not endure of all our technical skills such differentiation ranks the highest since failing other skill can continue as the base on which it operatescivilizationwill not be here to continue it do not smash the social personalityand do not fail to render powerless the antisocial in their efforts to harm the rest of us just because man rises above his fellows or takes an important part does not make him an antisocial personality just because man can control or dominate others does not make him an antisocial personality it is his motives in doing so and the consequences of his acts which distinguish the anti social from the social unless we realize and apply the true characteristics of the two types of personality we will continue to live in quandary of who our enemies are and in doing so victimize our friends all men have committed acts of violence or omission for which they could be censured in all mankind there is not one single perfect human being but there are those who try to do right and those who specialize in wrong and upon these facts and characteristics you can know them l ron hubbard founder

by reporting false data to course supervisor as to why the examination was failed any student who feels that he has been incorrectly failed on an examination can report the matter to ethics this is the proper line for any complaint the student may have concerning an examination if such still seems incorrect after taking it up with the qualifications division l ron hubbard founder lrhrd copyright 1966 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6611c01 shspec81 government and organization good government is in the realm of invention at this point man is so afraid of bad turn in benign monarchy that he cant have one he is afraid of an sp getting into power also benign monarch cant wear all of his hats what makes government bad is that it gets an sp into it one sp breeds others as an sp wants other sps around him generals that advocate wars of attrition are sps they are just trying to knock off as many troops as possible the best military training is to do the most in the least time at the least expense and to keep your own people from being banged up the objective is to win that is the proper conduct of war you also want to inflict the least possible damage to the enemy because you will have to put the enemy back together again if you win this is proper war but the last four wars were wars of attrition all governments consist of body of beings against the individual the better government is the less against the individual and the more for the individual it is total suppression exists where the government is everything and the individual is nothing the opposite extreme can be equally suppressive anarchy where the individual is everything and the government is nothing in an anarchy any bum or suppressive is totally at liberty to knock anyone on the head there is perfect government the individual is as close as you will get to perfect entity why do you need government because any organization can win over individuals we thetans got to where we are today because we didnt organize as body of thetans instead we let the bad guys organize into body to get us this is the only big omission on the track ots didnt handle it on their own feet any group of organized humanoids can defeat any ot however this requires that one know something about the laws of organization without an organization the individual would have to maintain constant vigilance because he only has to lose one battle to lose everything you want an org that is minimally restrictive and maximally effective in benign monarchy the individual doesnt have to have much say because everything is taken care of when you turn over the government to group however confidence in the government is shaken and the individual must have say of course you dont let individuals make all the decisions this would lead to clown government individuals can all know enough to be meaningfully involved in every little thing there never has been democracy the greeks never had democracy just fifty landowners formed senate the senators didnt even represent anyone therefore it was not even republic republicanism is mean between the extremes if you make proper qualifications necessary for the holding of office eg that person not be below grade iv that person and other similar ones forming senate being specialists in the issues at stake could be sufficiently informed and have enough time to think about it to actually govern so if scientology took over you would have republican government after you have chosen the governor he is free to govern without any yak yak unless some weighty issue comes up for referendum eg change in the status quo or in the form of government englands failure to allow the american colonies representation in parliament was an error in tech that caused rift when group feels that it cant be heard it arc breaks this is the sort of arc break that always precedes war hitler said something that wasnt acknowledged and vice versa so thirty million men were killed in emergency situations benign monarch is the best system there is time to consult anyone anyway but in time benign monarch gets tired and overworked and he cant acknowledge everybody who speaks so unless he gets backed up by representative body you get dissolution of the organization the nominal head of the organization should be out of the way except in an emergency while the country is run by representative body corporate such body has greatliabilities there is lack of total responsibility to the constituents so individuals in the group dont think fast enough therefore it is best not to have generalized body corporate running the government it must be specific in its representation unlike the pattern of board of directors each member of board of directors nebulously represents the stockholders however here there is crossrepresentation this generality goes into suppression if the people are represented then they could logically only be represented by one person that is why benign monarchy works there is crossrepresentation but as soon as the monarch gets body of advisors that doesnt represent the people more than one representative would have to represent exact segments of the population when too many people are represented by one person the distance becomes too great and the people feel unrepresented but if they can communicate with their representative and get action they feel that their governmental hat is well taken care of so they can relax the us has two senators per state this violates the above principle of representation electoral districts however do have direct representation there is further representation in state government which can receive certain orders from the federal government the us government however has representative in colorado it only has covert agencies there the colorado state assembly cannot address the us government there is direct line from the state assembly to the us assembly or the senate before you can have governmental system that is any good you have to have the tech of scientology to detect and improve abilities in people and ethics tech to detect suppressives you also need the communication formula arc triangle arc break tech etc if the people have senator why have representative the outcome is that the individual states and the us government are in violent conflict hence the civil war when these comm lines dont exist an individual goes into apathy you get dictatorship of the people vs the individual or you get situation where every man is the dictator representation can be pretty big because not everyone appeals at once but if everyone does appeal at once then the representative had better do something fast war is caused by incompetent government which causes breakdown in the comm line between constituent group and the society that surrounds it the society that surrounds it may be so incompetently governed that the inner group has to be nearly perfect to work its way forward scientology has this quality we also keep trying to be better at least whenever there is down statistic in scientology there are lots of builtin safeguards in the system so there is immediate need for elective representation in the future elections will be required when scientology gets bigger then exact representation will occur junior governing body may be given orders by any senior governing body in which it is not represented conversely very senior governing bodies should not give orders to junior governing bodies from which they do not have representative that ensures twoway communication situation the advisory council the international advisory council would be made up of representatives of continental parts of the world and executives who represent types of divisions of orgs it would have about fifteen members rule one may initiate motion unless that motion has been formed into an issuable directive if person wants policy letter framed he must write it up rule the chairman is given the power of absolute veto unless three quarters of those present vote to continue discussion or voting this will prevent endless hobbyhorsing proposal could be referred for special study elsewhere to be brought up later this way point of origin of policy letters is stated since that person wrote up the policy letter before it was passed members of the international advisory council represent the continental advisory councils but they also represent all orgs on that continent therefore someone from part of that continental area who feels that he is being done in or something could write to his representative in the international body as the system expands out the individual would find out that he had representative in his local continental bodya member of the ad council on majority signatures can get an urgent directive out on short notice provided b of i is convened later to determine if it was the right action unless policy change occurs an ad council directive is only in effect for year unless policy letter is issued the purpose of this rule is to prevent arbitrary laws from being arbitrarily introduced needlessly the advisory council has representatives from five continental areas plus one from st hill and divisional organizer for each division he represents every divisional secretary of that division in the whole world his job is to compile all the materials and specifications it is too much work for such person to do this and hold another hat at the same time so if person cant get books for instance he would write the div 2 divisional organizer if the stat of the divisional organizer is down he would get into being an authority he can get militant in the ad council the ad council can then issue what the divisional organizer has already written up in advance it is issued on the flash color of that division and it applies only to that division the divisional organizer is not operating those orgs so he does not act as bypass of the oes of those orgs conversely we will have the st hill or ww representative in continental ad councils lrh comm can also serve this purpose he has authority but he can be talked to and he can explain what ww is doing every divisional secretary in orgs becomes member of the ad council for that org the lrh comm is also on that orgs ad council to represent hco thus we get an eightman ad council sooner or later we will need representative of the ad council in each of the divisions of the org with continental org that has three other orgs plus itself you get four ad councils composed of secretaries and exec secs thus you get tenman ad council composed of the seven divisional heads plus the lrh comm plus the oes plus the has each junior org would have to have representative in the senior org we are dealing with basic ethics and organizational tech it really helps to have all beings in the org crosspoliced by stats stats dont ever happen they are always made and you have got to find out what is making them in downstat situation the errors are always gross the greatest source of downstats is personnel on the post at all if you get stuck flow going on for too long with return flow you get an apathy on the other end cf the so 1 line people want to talk to lrh to find out if he is there it is to get the backflow going the main problem is in the relationship between the individual and the corporate body corporate body that cant act swiftly will cause lot of upset situation where any citizen can clobber the corporate body is equally suppressive because that person will also clobber other individuals the problem is to set up something that resolves the relationship between the corporate body and the individual 1 the individual must be able to get justice from the corporate body 2 he is entitled to bright management 3 the corporate body can expect contribution and compliance from the individual all it takes to make an organization is to avoid violating these when you get the consent of the people and respect for the government the thing will go on and on on other planets empire selection of governors was based on state of casewhen you put in government put in review of that government this happened to some extent in the us with amendments to the constitution but one reported back to the original body that created the government governed people who do not understand the theories or postulates of the government or the laws can be pretty dismayed and confused they are afraid that the relationship between the government and the individual will not be safeguarded they may even be represented and dont know it6611c29 shspec82 ot and clear defined majority of scientologys major executives are now clear lrh noticed that the statistics of divisions were in roughly the same range as the case state of their heads we have tried to put together scientology dictionary it requires work from lrh to make sure that the definitions are complete he will take students requests on cards and define the words ot operating thetan operating means manipulating handling you operate car etc also oneself can operate one is operative thetan is from the greek letter theta traditionally used to mean thought the letter n is added to theta to make the noun thetan we mean by thetan life unit being an individual who is alive and who is capable of thinking and being spirit inhabiting the body in greek times theta was the thought in person as opposed to his body the thetan inhabits the clay and moves it around to that degree anyone who can move is operating as thetan but ot means someone who can operate without body being who is cause over thought life matter energy space and time someone who is being cause is being source of action or impulse as in causedistance effect this state is quite different from the state of clear it is someone who can operate without the encumbrances of the common clay there are degrees of operation wog common everyday gardenvariety humanoid he is body he doesnt know hes there etc he isnt there as spirit at all he is not operating as thetan the term comes from worthy oriental gentleman from the days of the british in egypt humanoid is one who has human characteristics by which we do not mean that he is human in his treatment of things he isnt it is simply that he is body he isnt there as spirit at all he will develop philosophy that says that everything is matter including the self wog is not the bottom end of the scale which would include psychotic neurotic catatonic etc this would be someone who didnt even know that he was mest ot isnt the top end of the scale either at the top you would have harmonic of the wog thetan who didnt have to operate at all in an almost unattainable absolute outside of mest altogether so he would be serene calm and dissociated with the physical universe not in the timestream someone at the bottom of the scale is the effect of everything he has to cause everything and can cause nothing someone at the top would be potentially able to cause everything but wouldnt have to but this is nogame condition and thetans are idiotic enough to like to have game going ptp exists when one has to do something about something when audited thoroughly person is longer affected by the problem similarly in serenity one doesnt have to do anything about it but one of the native characteristics of thetan is messing around he gets bored at tone 40 so just below 400 you get ot at the beginning of the universe the thetan was potentially omniscient and omnipotent but he had experience and knew nothing he was pretty stupid when you put someone back to the state of ot you are putting somebody back who is different from anyone else on the track he is operating with experience when we say ot we mean clear ot released ot is someone who is exterior and feeling great feeling powerful for just plain ot we can just call it exterior there has hitherto never been anything but released ot there are two parallel lines 1 how much is someone out of his bank and 2 how much less bank does he have using techniques developed in 1952 you can bang nearly anyone out of his head he then exhibits the characteristics of being who is not influenced by body this state can last third of second or it can last three hundred years it will make someone sane who is insane but since one has aberrations as being not just as body exteriorizing doesnt get rid of all his aberrationsgautama siddhartha was exteriorizing people in 523 b making state called bodhi we can make bodhi buddha in thirty seconds the lamas in tibet developed practices to assist exteriorization when the lamas couldnt exteriorize people they redefined bodhi to mean someone who was calm refined serene and had benign conduct it is the mental mass that prevents exteriorization this mass is composite of the thetans own pictures and aberrations that pins him to the body some people are harder to exteriorize than others it is the mental mass called the mind with its pictures and masses that prevents some people from exteriorizing thetan exterior is simply outside body this happens inevitably at death it is only the worry about getting body that makes thetan unhappy an operating thetan is thetan exterior who can have but doesnt have to have body in order to control or operate thought life matter energy space and time nirvana was added to buddhistic doctrine at later date the original idea was just to get away from the continual cycle of rebirth there is goal to operate in buddhism however someone who is thetan exterior but not clear or ot may be in very bad shape he may barely be able to get to maternity ward he has power of choice over what body he gets etc and sometimes thetan suddenly regains his ot abilities without knowing how he did it this is quite rare it frightens observers suleiman in the arabian nights produced big scare about thetans lrh describes the embarrassment of the thetan in battle who hasnt noticed that his body has been killed and who just keeps hewing away at the enemy on the battlements until he notices that what he thinks is his sword goes through the enemy without touching them then he looks down in the mud and sees his old body very aberrated ot could exist he might accidentally discover that he can move mest make sound etc he is liable to do most anything because he is operating automatically he is not able to control these manifestations eg he may produce poltergeist phenomena this would be released ot those beings can be upset this is higherscale wog amongst thetans it is also possible to be exterior knowingly but unable to move anything or cause things one eventually gets tired of this and wants new body previous released ots had one with whom to associate person who went thetan exterior had hope of anything else he had shut track therefore the game of being body became functional actually an ot could mock up body out of whole cloth how else do you have body an ot like the above with or without the ability to move objects is not clear ot he is released ot since he doesnt understand his state or what he is doing but the scientology definition of ot is clear ot clear ot knows what he has done and what he is doing he is clear who can operate like billyo clear thetan without bank in or out of body the source of the bank the being himself he is making himself the unknowing and unwilling effect of his own bank he is causing himself to receive unwillingly and unknowingly the effect of his own bank the person compulsively makes up pictures when he is bad off all hes got is blankedout picture black mass that covers up the picture or pressure that crowds the picture into oblivion the black five below that you get random pictures that flick by on automatic the word bank is taken from electronic computer terminology meaning card system file system the machine pulls out certain data cards and puts them into operation or computation in the machine so that the machine can solve problems the bankbound thetan is peculiarly affected by and operates on banks there is such thing as crazy thetan there is thetan who is mocking up craziness that he is the effect of otherwise there would be hope you can ask guy with fixed picture or chronic picture what part of that could you be responsible for this is good process for the guy who doesnt know that he has mind someone can be so notised that he isnt aware that he has mind the level of not believing in mind is below the level of not being able to see the mind or pictures above being able to see the mind is not having one all mental masses do is not furnish you with data as they seem to do but charge the area of the data up so that you cant directly recall it and you get hit by the picture or mass andyou think the picture is giving you the data so therefore you mustnt get rid of the picture because if you got rid of the picture then you wouldnt have the data this is silly because if you didnt have the picture then you could recall it all without consequences clear doesnt have mind in that he is not the effect of this picture mechanism but the clear still has the mest universe around and he still uses body that isnt very strong and is made of cells that arent invulnerable so the fact that person is clear doesnt say that he wont get sick because there are such things as bacteria and viruses and the body has finite strength it is idiotic to measure clear by his health when clear exteriorizes he may be clear exterior unable to talk etc like baby having to learn to walk the state is stable since he has bank to snap him in again when person is clear he can more easily become exterior there are 140 clears as of this date according to lrh getting someone from clear to ot is job of proofing him up so that even if he mocked up bank he wouldnt be the effect of it cleared ot is proofedup being who wont hit the banana peel you could probably fix up clear exterior so he would go exterior to the physical universe you could use command like try not to be outside the physical universe this would make him exterior from the universe but that would be unstable until he was longer at effect relatively to the physical universe he would be unstable since he is still the effect of mest life and thought but person who can be at cause over something is not necessarily at total effect of it that doesnt mean however that he has nothing to do with it because you can fix car is reason why you cant enjoy one our adversary is the complexity of the wisdom of the ages suppressed and combined to keep people from doing it it takes lot of blood sweat and tears to face this sort of thing there is nothing mild about the way course supervisors continue to do their job there is probably greater distance between clear and ot than between wog and clear clear ot is walking miracle who comprehends the miracle so knowing and willing cause is part of the definition of ot it is not an accidental or automatic state you get to point where you can turn automaticities on and off doing it on an unknowing basis is far inferior if this crosses up your own reality in any way shape or form by all means dont change your own reality just run your auditing questionhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex

ii for the first time in known history there is ethics you cant lie to do people in and get away with it in scientology people who protest ethics say who determines who is suppressive that is easy suppressives have definite characteristics this universe got formed and is going to pieces on suppression an organized minority is all that has been making this universe mess it could have been good universe but ethics would have had to go in early and because thetans were acting as individuals and suppression was organized all we have to do is reverse it so that thetans without forgoing independence can organize the other side just little bit we are eventually going to become an organized majority we already have numerical superiority also they cant think straight we have overt intentions towards suppressives we are just trying to go about our business but you yourself should not go out of your way to obtain amusement by the torturing of sps simply because their valence is there to slip into the mocking up of suns is far more fun but when you do it do good job analytical mind this could be anything that thetan set up which collected data and used it to resolve problems the basic purpose of the mind is the resolution of problems relating to survival now if thetan does this you could say he is mind an analytical mind cannot exist independent of thetan man has been so caved in on the subject of the reactive mind which he knew not wot of of which he was not aware that he now discredits the whole idea of mind he says ill just do it all myself reactive mind reactive mind is an unwanted unknowing series of computations which bring about an effect on the individual and those around him it contains things like the computation all horses sleep in beds it is an obsessive stratum of unknown unseen uninspected data that is forcing solutions unknown and unsuspected on the person it is subawareness activity an analytical mind could be of use to an operating thetan it could exist if it was knowing and willing mechanism for instance much of dianetics and scientology was resolved by the construction of philosophical machines something you would draw up which would give some data that you could then combine with some other data and get some answer but you are setting down and lining up the data you are just doing think which is recorded so that you can knowingly observe relationship of data and get an answer so an analytical mind is knowing and willing resolution of problems related to survival this can get you in trouble when it is of lasting duration when it is set up to run forever without inspection and observation an analytical mind cannot exist without inspection and observation an astronomical computer being operated by competent scientist could be likened to the analytical mind but without inspection and observation an analytical mind would become reactive the reactive mind is like the opposite of the analytical mind it is like computer that uninspected picks up the data to resolve problems that had not been suspected and turns out answers that uninspected then by law become total effect upon population ie to avoid reactivity you must retain the option of total monitoring total circuit like an automatic elevator may still be analytical if it can be inspected the human body falls into the class of machines that operate without understanding such machine where thetan does not know how or why it operates is reactive the fellow who is there doesnt know when it is going to get sick or quit the body line is running uninspected and it is aberrative it has reactions and effects upon the thetan that he cannot predict it is an aberrative machine because it is running uninspected it has instruction book this is major omission beware of buying bodies without directions in them so willingness and inspection is what makes the difference between the analytical and the reactive minds the difference between dianetics and scientology is that one scientologyincreases the awareness of the thetan and the other dianetics just erases the bank the trouble you run into in disseminating comes from peoples lack of awareness of the reactive mind you have to show it to them if you handle persons reactive mind directly you get the situation where the person was not aware that he had lumbosis and is not now aware that it is gone the way you handle reactive mind is to increase the thetans awareness of it so he can control it it ceases to be reactive when you are talking about the analytical and the reactive mind you are talking about the awareness level of the individual only the reactive mind is opposed to the thetan the analytical mind is mind that is temporarily set up willingly and knowingly to assist in the resolution of problems problems inevitably relate to survival and anything hes set up to do this of which he was aware and which was inspected would be included under the rubric of analytical mind committee set up to get data and to coordinate the activities of another area or body of factory or something like that would be the mind of that factory even though they are thetans doing it in fact they would have to be thetans doing it for it to be analytical one of the reasons why you should know policy is that otherwise the solutions and combinations unknown to you make it have an effect on you because it is somewhat reactive if policy isnt inspected and reformed to meet the condition of operation it too would become reactive mind as with us government law from the point of view of the society scientology is somewhat reactive mind to the degree that they are not aware of our existence or our effect if scientology had evil intentions it would be very easy to operate on subrosa level however it would be bad for the planet on the whole it is hard anyway for society at its low awareness level to be aware of scientology it is likewise hard for them to be aware of thetan thetan should probably go by the rule never explain dont feel that you need to explain your motives to others when you dont intend to hide them their level of awareness of you is already so low that explaining wont help at all after all they cant tell your motives be as obvious plain and straightforward as you like but if the ordinary evidences which lie around them dont justify your actions then theres sense in explaining it to the person whos challenging them he wouldnt be able to understand them anyway any analytical mind can become reactive mind so setting up an analytical mind is always dangerous to some degree power the amount of force that can be applied in unit of time actually the physical definition states that power is the amount of work that can be accomplished in unit of time power has the connotation of being potential unlike force which is actual power doesnt necessarily mean the use of force power is not exerted whereas force tends to be therefore person is powerful when he is able to use force not when he is or isnt using force but if he is forceful he is using force right now the smarter person gets the less he employs force to get others to change their opinions etc implant unwilling unknowing receipt of think an implant is an intentional wreck of somebodys ability to make pictures perceive and remember its intentional an intentional installation of fixed ideas contrasurvival to the thetan in an implant someone is intentionally giving the thetan perceptions and ideas all hypnotism is is restimulation of past implants engram those perceptions unknowingly contained in the force duress pain and unconsciousness of an incident this is not the same as an implant because it is not necessarily intentional for one thing intent is the difference the person makes mental image picture by his reaction to an experience he goes out stop it in the process of doing this hes made sort of stuck wave because he didnt prevent it and just as you would make an embossed impression of something he embosses the environment if you were to press your handagainst brick for split second you would have picture of the brick and moment or so later you would have the indentations of the brick because you pushed something at the brick similarly if you pull on rope you make an impression this would be analogous to secondary the thetan pushes back against what is pushing him or he pulls in against what is leaving him it is at the point where he resisted the motion most that he gets stuck thetan can make and exert energy when he tries to fend something off or hold something in he pushes or pulls back against something he gets picture of the moment when his resistance was great that could be an engram secondary lock or implant problem intention counterintention goal countergoal or purpose counterpurpose goals problem mass the gpm is so named because when there are two intentions counteropposed one has problem and the opposed forces or goals tend to produce mass the russians statement of this is dialectic materialism that all ideas are born out of the meeting of two forces that is backwards when two ideas oppose each other they create force that shows you where they are on the tone scale if you hit guy hard enough hell think gpms consist of pairs of opposing ideas two opposing ideas produce mass the thetan cannot asis either side hence the mass remains the mass of gpm is mental energy mass but it can be in the physical universe too pandeterminism and selfdeterminism pandeterminism is the ability to see or asis both sides of conflict or problem if one is totally pandetermined he has mental mass because hes seen both sides of everything he can see two ideas at once even though they are opposed selfdeterminism is laudable because it is rare but it is not as good as pandeterminism if guy justifies what he does you know immediately that he is selfdetermined not pandetermined this is the quickest test there is wholly reactive person will oppose any idea put to him conservative or reactionary tends to be against everything you propose so if you give him his own ideas you give him problem because his first impulse is to be against them cf symptom prescription and the interpersonalists this is such horrible thing to do that it is normally looked upon as fightin words like you think youre pretty good dont you you have made the guy resist his own ideas the above type of person is on lowerscale mockery of pandeterminism he can carry out raging argument with second person that doesnt say word the whole time like well youre going to say and you think but there is ability of thetan that doesnt have lowerscale mockery or exaggeration emotion response by wavelength affecting as individual or another which produces sensation and state of mind intention something which one wishes or intends to do it is an impulse towards something it is an idea that one is going to accomplish something he means to do it affinity affinity has nothing to do with emotion its the ability to occupy the space of or be like or similar to or to express willingness to be something i like you means i would just as soon be you i would just as soon occupy your space when two individuals dont like each other they wont occupy each others space or viewpoint they dont want to be like the otherperson etc dissimilarity must exist when this becomes sufficiently strong person enforcedly becomes like the other fellow which is an overwhelm home universe the universe thetan made for himself here we find the rock which we audited for and assessed out meaning shape of something on which we could then run process we had in the past theory that it was the first object on the track that the fellow had made we would run fiveway help on it and make fast stable release of very high order religion religion means basically the search for truth deddedex deduced something or other it means that the overtmotivator sequence went backwards deddedex is the overtmotivator sequence wrongway to so that you hit joe and then he hits you thats deddedex the original connotation was that although it went this way you had it figured out that he must have hit you first so you invented something that he did to you to motivate your hitting him its phony overtmotivator sequence it is what guy does to justify an unmotivated overt it means the overt act explained the fact of having hit someone without provocation plus means of explaining having hit him is the deddedex after you commit the first action you invent something to explain it deddedex deeddeed explained somatic mind this idea was added to the first book by donald h rogers john w campbell and the publisher i found it in the glossary so there it is its the mind that runs the body independent of the body and the reactive mind it is physical coordination switchboard system in view of the fact that we dont know how it runs we really have business declaring the existence of mind that we dont really know about the early introduction to dmsmh with the part about the wheel and the arch describes the book its first line was written by walter winchell and the rest was written by the publisher anchor point something the thetan put out to make space buttered all over the universe very badly disoriented and dispersed when someone in this case condition is asked to spot spots where he is an improper process the proper process is to have him spot spots where he is not he will point all over the universe this is the reaction of this very dispersed case to this question from which this term is taken he will think that he is everywhere it is an im over there case perhaps this condition comes from leaving anchor points all over the place and appearing in one or another of these points tiger drill one of the drills that has been adequately discussed in bulletins it uses tiger as nonreactive word computationto figure out 2 x 2 4 computing psychosis one who from his psychosis figurefigures hes inconstant in his conduct hes computive hes got crazy explanation hes obsessively solving problem that doesnt exist dramatizing psychotic one patterned action which is insane and which the person runs over and over when he is not doing that particular action the dramatizing psychotic is remarkably sane he is consistent in his conduct arbitrary something introduced into the situation without regard to the data of the situation arbitrary means stand alone someone says x must be done or x is true if that is introduced without observation without any refutation of what was there previously into formula situation admin action of line it will cause ripple this ripple then needs to be solved so someone else will introduce an arbitrary solution to the introduced arbitrary it leads to further arbitraries being introduced to handle resultant outnesses this is the stuck five held down five phenomenon an urgent action may be an arbitrary as in the tech of handling an urgent directive this must be replaced by something based on observed fact it is only in force until data can be gotten an example of an arbitrary would be an education that boy never understood like an education without purpose harmonics any wavelength action or scale has reverberations up and down by doubles or halves in the field of art it means agreement with in scientology upper harmonics refers to welloff cases in scientology it means similarity or repetition of something at higher or lower point on scale lower harmonic is lower similarity which is nutty related to higher harmonic this is based on the tendency of wavelength to repeat itself the lower you go in terms of awareness the more weird the repetition is in music it means co action or similar action like resonating strings for instance lower harmonic of figuring out math table is doodling it is similar action but less aware therefore harmonics apply to the awareness scale the term lowerscale mockery expresses the idea of harmonics more usefully for our purposes ridicule is based on this you can feel that your ideas are crazy even if they are not if you hear them expressed or mocked by nut or true believer like caricature i was trying to figure out what to do with the org i was trying to figure out what england would do by trying to figure out what she should do to straighten things out politically i was trying to figure out which way this was going to go to figure out if i should expand the organization or whether to enter dollars into the country or hold them out and i ran into guy outside the door who said that he was disraeli and was going to help england6612c13 shspec84 scientology definitions part iii scientology is an extension of the work of gautama siddhartha 2500 years ago gautama sought to end the cycle of death and rebirth by showing an individual that he was spirit not dependent on bodies we accomplished his goal of exteriorizing people more successfully in 1952 but the wisdom of buddhism was enough to civilize threefourths of asia it is the oldest and biggest religion on this planet it predates christianity by 500 years probably the shreds of buddhism came into the middle east with the silk and spice merchants who following alexanders ventures to india in about 333 b discovered that there was europe and made trade contact with europe this sparked religious revival buddha predicted that in 2500 years the entire job would be finished in the west thats in the pali canons well we finished it buddha never pretended to be other than just man and his movement the first international religious movement was open to anyone buddhism has moved in its technology not one inch further than it was pushed in tibet until 1952 when we started exteriorizing people the essence of religion is the fact that man is spiritual being all religions hold this in common but only in buddhism was this ever proven any forward push like buddhism runs into sps who are afraid that if you got better you might knock them off or at least stop their games the basic goal of psychiatry today is to wipe out religion they say anyone who is religious is psychotic if they succeed in knocking out our church they will go after bigger ones this is really all that its all about as long as religion brings solace to man as long as churches stand in any way for the spiritual freedom of man psychiatry will not really be able to progress therefore psychiatry should not be allowed to wipe out small church and then go on to bigger church and bigger church and so take it all over the government has right to comment upon religious beliefs or practice they are telling us that we must not do something we are not doing we are not treating the sick and the insane there is law against increasing peoples ability or intelligence and that is all that we are doing psychiatry is demanding its right to kill or maim any human being after it states that hes crazy if they can do that they can control the planet politically but they will fail because they cant complete cycle of action or choose right target there is law against making people better or more intelligent also when someone tries to cut pure theta line it tends to blow up against him our victory was the victory of the individual over fate and the universe if we win everybody wins crushing the opposition on the way up is hardly worth doing inversion it should go one way and it goes the other way it inverts it collapses in on itself downward when person is introverted he would look in on himself its reverse scale as one factor progresses the other factor degresses it goes backwards exteriorization an action which i have just described as the history of buddhism thetan walks out of or exists out of body exteriorization is the action of moving out of body psychiatrists boobytrap this by claiming that insane people can exteriorize in fact if they do exteriorize they are sane while they are exterior interiorization people who are interiorized interiorization is not the reverse of this it means going into it too fixedly and becoming part of it not just going into your head you could interiorize into work or into most anything exteriorization means the spirit moving out of the bodyrestimulation the reactivation of an existing incident some approximation of the original incident causes it to go into play there is point where it was restimulated the restimulation is usually unknown to the person if it were known he would immediately recover unknown it tends to have an effect upon the person by picking up restimulations you can knock out of action sn engram without running it it is as though the engram sat over in locker undisturbed and not troubling the person then one day he passes truck and the engram drops out of locker and the person doesnt know what it is so he becomes the effect of it if you picked up the moment of its restimulation it would drop back into locker and cease to trouble the person it is upon this fact that the whole subject of releasing depends the erasure that occurs is the erasure of these points of restimulation destimulation destimulate means to take away the restimulation it does not mean the erasure of the original incident it is the knocking out of the point of restimulation genetic entity cytology the study of cells conceives of an endless stream of protoplasm passing through time with branch tracks that are bodies your current body is supposed to have originated from sea of ammonia by the process of reproduction it is supposed to have dome down to pt if that were the case then somewhere along the line blueprint for body would have had to enter the line in the days of dianetics good way to account for past lives was to say that they were incidents on the ge line cf history of man the darwinian theory is an explanation of this unending stream of protoplasm we find that this theory doesnt actually hold good man is spiritual being you should be able to find the blueprint in the body we used to think that it showed up on the emeter actually it doesnt only you do first overt this would be the first on chain of overts if guy has an impulse to commit given overt you could trace back down the chain to the first one and theoretically he would blow the impulse cf expanded dianetics but you should not try to process specific type of aberration its quite fatal because in the first place its an eval for the case also it is condemnatory negativetype process it doesnt validate the person at all you dont validate the person by finding his nasty habits and trying to process them the percentiles of successes when specific aberrations are addressed is too low this procedure is not successful because you are not validating whats right with the person you dont have to find out whats wrong with person to make him right you just get the guy to be able to communicate then you get him to look at his problems and you find out that he has been resolving them by committing overts you get him over doing this then you find that he is very arc broken with life and you get him over that then he gets to where he discovers that he has great solution to everything and every time he has bad break he goes and lies down and is horse or something but we are not interested in his solutions and were not treating him for that reason all of these things are simply increasing the abilities of spirit not healing whats wrong with it entrance point to this universe classified information many times on the time track one has been told that he just entered this universe it is big swindle ot activities those programs conducted by ots to assist scientologyanchor points gold balls body is constructed in space framework you can see these things at least some people can when person has dark hollows under his eyes it is all the little gold balls grouped together under the eyes that have caved in and gone black if you could shift the gold ball framework of the body you could probably bend joints backwards etc every once in awhile somebodys face is out of shape or something and you get him to pick up the gold ball and put it back where it belongs or something or you get him to put bunch of balls out there to remedy his havingness of that particular ball this is anchor point processing from way back when all of sudden instead of lying against his face the gold ball goes back where it belongs and the pc reasserts his sense of balance his face will actually change shape this has to do with the structure of bodies and what the space is in which the body is formed it is apparently one of the ways in which bodies are mocked up i wouldnt look for them if i were you its rather fraught with disaster in some cases gold balls are used in mocking up the body in space first and second postulate if you find the first postulate that was made relating to certain situation you can ignore the second postulate about 1952 lrh tried to make an endall of this he looked for the first postulate that one ever made on the track we now find that its not necessary to have that energy potential of motion or power the modern physics definition is that energy is small waves flowing it is force or flow or potential force or flow from something to something or ability to accomplish work or to accomplish movement rather doubtful idea that we are taught to believe is that if something moves from point to point b 1 you need energy 2 you develop energy if you really know about the system of energy you wont need huge amounts of energy to move particles if person really understands something he can do remarkable things with it modern physics hasnt done that well with rocketry it is not very efficient so energy is potential or actual motion or force flow progress of particles impulses or waves from point to point b or in any direction there is direction to it which rather outlaws the idea of dispersal dispersal is not flow flow has the connotation of being somewhat directional if something flowing off mountain is getting wider and wider it can cease to be flow and become flood energy is flow of particles waves etc in some direction flow is limited and directional progress of particles through space thought not to be confused with life and the spirit thought is spaceless positionless product of thetan containing meaning the greeks confused it with life the original mistake is in the word theta for the greeks theta meant life or thought thought is not life and it is not spirit lambda life in the dianetic axioms dianetic axiom 11 it is an unused symbol today nothingthis implies that the thing is but is being noted you couldnt notis something that wasnt in the first place its an assertion against fact counteremotion the emotion which greets the emotion it is point exerting an emotion against point b emotion is normally something that has flow wavelength and meaning mixed up with it any emotion could counter any emotion so counteremotion means any emotion that is countering an existing emotion when you take apart the emotion in bank you can pick out the emotion and counteremotion counteremotion is the emotion that is used to meet situation and which does meet it counteremotion is an interesting study it is related to politics and control of humans for instance the counteremotion to hitlers rage in germany was enthusiasm the advertising field is also very interested in counteremotion the advertising exec comes up against it because he tries to counter want with an emotion but want isnt an emotion so there is counteremotion so you have to know what emotion could create desire for the product and counter that memory and recall there is difference between these two terms thats significant to the auditor recall however implies that you bring it up to present and look at it it has that connotation whereas memory has the connotation that you simply knew it had happened so the two terms have two different connotations but they are very easily interchanged because person doesnt have to bring things up to pt when he is clear he doesnt do this any longer there are lot of things that he doesnt bring up to pt to recall them he can recall them in detail and tell you exactly where they are without having them brought up into the present to review to that extent the modern clear is far in advance of the book one definition of clear the reason one cant recall is totally contained in the fact that his memory is totally surrounded by mass which prevents him from recalling if you got rid of all the mass of the mind you wouldnt have anything to recall correct actually it doesnt work that way at all when you get the mass off recall is easy it is undue duress in the incident that prevents recall so the individual gets picture of the incident to read it because he cant enter the incident where it is the mental energy you used in bailing out of lions cage would prevent you from remembering that you had been in the lions cage therefore amnesia is the situation where person is protecting himself from so many dangers on the track that the mass prevents penetration because the part of the track for which he has amnesia is so heavily charged confidence an expression of trust degree of trust inflation is an expression of confidence in the government money is symbolized idea that goes bad when confidence in the issuer drops that is why they put pictures of kings and presidents etc on money they try to associate money and its issuer trust and distrust is composed of past experience total trust is looked on as total idiocy but it is the only condition under which you can exist we didnt arrive through suspicion certainty the degree of willingness to accept the awareness of an isness it is very conditional thing since in the first place it is questionable whether any mass has mass scientologist does not start out from where did the wall come from but just from is the wall there and if it is there the scientologist can have certainty on it it is possible to generate uncertainty by asking what is brainwashing is the trick of mixing up certainties to unconfuse someone it is only necessary to have him regain some certainties person arc breaks if his certainties get shifted an education can be made hypnotic by qualifying everything so that it becomes sort of generality and definitely an uncertainty generalityany unspecific statement tends towards generality its the substitution of plural for singular or greater for lesser this may or may not be intentional dispersed people talk in generalities classifying anything comes under this heading for instance it is not really boys it is boy boy boy etc cf korzybskis general semantics classifying is necessary but it is very dangerous classifications occur in the bank they is always one person you will always find out exactly who they is on meter the generality is the primary tool of the sp it is used to prevent reach as in everything is all covered with germs johnny suppress to squash to sit on to make smaller to refuse to let reach to make uncertain about his reaching to render liquefy by heating or lessen in any way possible by any means possible to the harm of the person and the fancied protection of the suppressor the sp often expresses generalities to the suppressed person thus surrounding him with generalities the invention of germs was bit suppressive the suppressive uses tricks and mechanisms to prevent reach postulate to generate or think concept concept is think thought to postulate implies requirement that something goes stops turns white goes blue or remains blue or that it is something or that it isnt something or that some action is going to take place etc postulate implies conditions and actions rather than just plain thinks postulate is associated more with intention than it is with thought it has dynamic connotation havingness the feeling that one owns or possesses it is possible to wear coat without having coat mere possession does not make havingness confronting ability to front up to confronting is derived from withfronting so there is dim connotation that if you confront the door the door is confronting you coaction is implied but this does not actually exist in our meaning of the word confront is the ability of the individual to face up to look at stand up to stand in front of be near see visualize or otherwise perceive something by extension if you cant confront something you cant handle it thetans have been steamrolled by confronting total confronting is not the total answer there are times to stand up and glare and there are times not to when person can selectively confront or not confront anything then of course he has total power these do go together when thetan doesnt want to confront something he tends to mask it to turn away from it and it tends to make him an effect if he cant make an effect on it it can make an effect on him however in fact to stand in front of an automobile going 60 mph and to let it run over you just to demonstrate that you are not afraid of confronting it is assininity if you ask person whether he can confront an automobile going 60 mph and he comm lags you know that he is down into an obsessive confront and feels that there is some sense in your asking him to do it he has the idea that there is something wrong with him if he wont go and do this willful and knowing confronting or willingness to conceive the idea of or to confront or not to confront these concepts are all contained in the single idea of confronting if you felt that you had to be able to stand up to anything that would be to confess that you couldnt stop anything from occurring im willing to confront putting my arm out to an automobile traveling 60 mph and having it stop to that extent i am willing to confront this is not conditional confronting what are the conditions under which you would be willing to confront this is not fair question one wants to lead life of ruin though some have made it into virtue eg the stoics it is philosophical booby trap theypersuade people that they should be willing to live life as dopeaddicts bums and in total ruin in order to demonstrate that they can confront this kind of life that is suppression it has precious little to do with sanity but it is terrific process in that the individual will come up to finding out what he is obsessively confronting as well as what he is willing to confront and what he doesnt have to confront one thing he might find out is that he doesnt have to go on confronting forever in fact he is quite tired of standing there so desire to have challenge concerning existence only relates to being willing to engage in larger game as the power to confront or not arises selectively an individuals selfdeterminism arises accordingly very often thetan who never likes to be moving explains the fact that he got run over by x by saying that he was perfectly willing to confront it he is happy that he got run over by x because now he has had such an experience he says well it was good experience but i never want to do it again when person can control things he can selectively confront when he loses that ability he says well at least i can confront it the thought that you cant do anything about anything is very humanoid and deadly there is suppression at work if person gets the idea that because he has the ability to confront anything he must therefore confront everything this is an invalidation of his ability to control and change undesirable aspects of the environment this is sp talk it is very different from being willing to confront anything it is only when you lose the ability to handle situation that you justify your inability by the thought that you can confront the disaster that thereby ensues weve run out of time i leave you confronting your sins thank youhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 25 june 1971 r remimeo revised 25 november 1974 tech qual all students supervisors word clearing series 3r supervisors course cramming word clearers barriers to study there are three different sets of physiological and mental reactions that come from 3 different aspects of study they are three different sets of symptoms 1 education in the absence of the mass in which the technology will be involved is very hard on the student it actually makes him feel squashed makes him feel bent sort of spinny sort of dead bored exasperated if he is studying the doingness of something in which the mass is absent this will be the result photographs help and motion pictures would do pretty good as they are sort of promise or hope of the mass but the printed page and the spoken word are not substitute for tractor if hes studying about tractors you have to understand this data in its purityand that is that educating person in mass that they dont have and which isnt available produces physiological reactions that is what i am trying to teach you its just fact youre trying to teach this fellow all about tractors and youre not giving him any tractorswell hes going to wind up with face that feels squashed with headaches and with his stomach feeling funny hes going to feel dizzy from time to time and very often his eyes are going to hurt its physiological datum that has to do with processing and the field of the mind you could therefore expect the greatest incidence of suicide or illness in that field of education most devoted to studying absent masses this one of studying the something without its mass ever being around produces the most distinctly recognizable reactions if child felt sick in the field of study and it were traced back to this one the positive remedy would be to supply the massthe object or reasonable substitute and it would clear it up2 there is another series of physiological phenomena that exist which is based on the fact of too steep study gradient thats another source of physiological study reaction because of too steep gradient it is sort of confusion or reelingness that goes with this one youve hit too steep gradient there was too much of jump because he didnt understand what he was doing and he jumped to the next thing and that was too steep and he went too fast and he will assign all of his difficulties to this new thing now differentiate herebecause gradients sounds terribly like the 3rd one of these study hangups definitionsbut remember that they are quite distinctly different gradients are more pronounced in the field of doingness but they still hang over into the field of understanding in gradients however it is the actions we are interested in we have plotted course of forward motion of actions we find he was terribly confused on the second action he was supposed to do we must assume then that he never really got out of the first one the remedy for this one of too steep gradient is cutting back find out when he was not confused on the gradient then what new action he undertook to do find what action he understood well just before he was all confused what did he understand welland then we find out that he didnt understand it well its really at the tail end of what he understood and then he went over the gradient you see it is most recognizable and most applicable in the field of doingness thats the gradient barrier and one full set of phenomena accompanies that 3 there is this third one an entirely different set of physiological reactions brought about througha bypassed definition bypassed definition gives one distinctly blank feeling or washedout feeling notthere feeling and sort of nervous hysteria will follow in the back of that the manifestation of blow stems from this 3rd aspect of study which is the misunderstood definition or the not comprehended definition the undefined word thats the one that produces the blow the person doesnt necessarily blow on these other twothey are not pronouncedly blow phenomena they are simply physiological phenomena this one of the misunderstood definition is so much more important its the makeup of human relations the mind and subjects it establishes aptitude and lack of aptitude and its what psychologists have been trying to test for years without recognizing what it was its the definitions of words the misunderstood word thats all it goes back to and that produces such vast panorama of mental effects that it itself is the prime factor involved with stupidity and the prime factor involved with many other thingsif person didnt have misunderstoods his talent might or might not be present but his doingness would be present we cant say that joe would paint as well as bill if both were unaberrated in the field of art but we can say that the inability of joe to paint compared with the ability of joe to do the motions of painting is dependent exclusively and only upon definitionsexclusively and only upon definitions there is some word in the field of art that the person who is inept didnt define or understand and that is followed by an inability to act in the field of the arts thats very important because it tells you what happens to doingness and that the restoration of doingness depends only upon the restoration of understanding on the misunderstood wordmisunderstood definition this is very fast processing there is very swift wide big result obtainable in this it has technology which is very simple technology it enters in at the lower levels because it has to this doesnt mean it is unimportant it means it has to be at the entrance gates of scientology it is sweepingly fantastic discovery in the field of education and dont neglect it you can trace back the subject person is dumb in or any allied subject that got mixed up with it the psychologist doesnt understand scientology he never understood word in psychology so he doesnt understand scientology well that opens the gate to education although ive given this one of the misunderstood definition last it is the most important one l ron hubbard founder lrhntrdjh

some material on it which i tested and redeveloped he said the subject of study has been abound with authorities and boobytraps forever and day but until ron researched this field of human endeavour and published his findings on tapes hcobs and policy letters nobody has ever made any progress toward the resolution of study itself as problem in this very day and age we find physical punishments of students the rule rather than the exception and even the use of instruments like canes sticks shoes and such like articles in order to teach student create arc is accepted as normal practice the phenomena of secondaries and engrams resulting thereof which inhibit study are not known about or completely ignored and often handled by further duress and many once bright keen young student throws

and sds 2 auditors need direct mechanical technology to do these three processes effectively remedy remedy locates the misunderstoods person has in scientology originally it read misunderstood words words of course will emerge in the general run of misunderstoods remedy is done only by listing it must not be done verbally alone it is level iii process the listing question is in the subjects of dianetics or scientology who or what has been misunderstood the item is found on the list and given to the student that is all there is other step the rules of listing all apply if the student wont have the item it is not correct and the list must be straightened up with the general auditing rules that govern listing remedy b the form of this process is changed it is done by three lists these three may only be done by formal listing and the general tech of listing as governed by level iii tech the lists make the form of an ilist 1b this is done to locate what in the scientology pt is giving trouble it is done as list and the item is found the listing question is in your studies of dianetics and scientology who or what are you having trouble with the item is found and given to the student this step is governed by all the tech of listing list 2b the item found on list 1b is now listed in order to find the past track subject similar to what is giving trouble in present time the listing question is in your past who or what was similar to item found in list 1b it is highly illegal to limit the question to this lifetime all the rules of listing apply the item is found and given to the student list 3b the third list of the process is now done the listing question is who or what was misunderstood in the item found on list 2b the listing is covered by the general tech of listing as found in level iii the item is found and given to the student this completes the remedy b if floating needle occurs any time during the process with good indicators thoroughly visible in the student the process is concluded at that point the process is used on anyone having trouble studying dianetics or scientology the trouble as it doesnt clear up with remedy is coming from some prior subjectmore than one of these can be done if all steps are done for each one s d search and discovery of suppression is called an s and d it locates the suppressives on the case i have several times undercut gotten processes that reach deeper on s ds the earliest process asked merely who might have been suppressive to the pc this is still valid but i have found 2 flaws in it 1 the auditor does not do listing type s d at all but just chattily brushes it off 2 the list from this question contains an actual suppressive that is passed right over therefore i undercut the question and obtained much better results because the new question reached deeper the new question was who or what might have suppressed you then i recalled an even deeper question this was what purpose has been suppressed this was given to qual div sh some time ago it would have 2 lists the first is for the purpose as above and the second would be who or what suppressed purpose found for some reason probably because one did 2 lists this undercut was neglected therefore i researched further and developed what we will now use as an s d it is one of these killer processes it is very strong so it isnt to be carelessly done if you get wrong item on an s d you can make the pc ill so one has to do an s d right and follow all the rules of listing as given in level iii tech also i find now that when list item found is generality multiple subject not specific such as dogs or the public the list is simply not complete one does not have to settle for generality and then list the generality he will find that the pc will eventually list the specific nongeneral item anyway of course one can also do represent list of general item found if that seems best the real question for an s d was established only when i found purpose all suppressives have in common and is very fundamental effort in suppressives this effort by suppressives when found then permitted to form the question the key s d question is who or what has attempted to unmock you unmocking an effort to reduce or make disappear is the primary effort of suppressives therefore the listing question on test delivers up items totally overlooked by the earlier types of s d the question needs to be cleared carefully for nonscientology if it has to be rephrased watch out as the meaning may vanish tried to make nothing of you might substitute but at this writing only unmock has been tested and question for others than educated scientologists will be developed and issued and made part of the enclosure for the bookthis s d question must be done by listing only and with great care to follow level iii listing tech as it being powerful will backfire on the pc if done carelessly and wrong item is found the item is found by listing and given to the pc which is the end of the process if generality results it may be represented but listing continued will give the same result of single item general item must not be given to the pc as the final result this process will now be standard review s d l ron hubbard founder lrhjpcden copyright 1967 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead

2426 notes on the lectures pgs 52661121 13 when person is not functioning well on his post on his job or in life at the bottom of his difficulties will often be found unknown basic definitions and laws or false definitions false data and false laws resulting in an inability to think with the words and rules of that activity and an inability to perform the simplest required functions the person will remain unfamiliar with the fundamentals of his activity at times appearing idiotic because of these notdefined and falsely defined words verbal hatting is the main source of false definitions and false data someone who knows tells someone else definition or datum the person now thinks he knows the definition even though nothing in the field makes any sense to him the word may not even read on the meter during misunderstood checks because the person thinks he knows politician is told by an advisor it doesnt matter how much money the government spends it is good for the society the politician uses this rule and the next thing you know inflation is driving everybody to starvation and the government to bankruptcy the politician knowing he was told this on the very best authority does not spot it as false data but continues to use it right up to the point where the angry mobs stand him up in front of firing squad and shoot him down and the pity of it is that the politician never once suspected that there was anything false about the data even though he couldnt work with it there is field in all the society where false data is not rampant experts advisors friends families seldom go and look at the basic texts on subjects even when these are known to exist but indulge in all manner of interpretations and even outright lies to seem wise or expert the cost in terms of lost production and damaged equipment is enormous you will see it in all sectors of society people cannot think with the fundamentals of their work they goof they ruin things they have to redo what they have already done youll find people whose estimate of the environment is totally perverted to the point theyre walking around literally in fog the guy looks at tree and the reality of the tree isblurred by the fact that trees are made by god so he wont take care of the tree because he is convinced what were trying to cure in people is the inability to think with data this was traced by to false data as phenomenon additional to misunderstood words although the misunderstood word plays role in it and will have to be allowed for when person is having difficulty in an area or on post when he cant seem to apply what he has learned or what he is studying or when he cant get through specific drill or exercise in his training materials you would suspect he has false data in that area or on those materials if he is to use it at all effectively he must first sort out the true facts regarding it from the conflicting bits and pieces of information or opinion he has acquired this eliminates the false data and lets him get on with it inability to hat we are looking here at brand new discovery i have made which is that it can be nearly impossible to hat anyone who is sitting on false data on the subject you are trying to hat him on this is the primary reason people cannot be hatted and false data stripping therefore enables person to be hatted even though other approaches have failed this is very valuable discoveryit solves the problem of inability to hat or train sources false data on subject can come from any number of sources in the process of daytoday living people encounter and often accept without inspection all sorts of ideas which may seem to make sense but dont advertising newspapers tv and other media are packed with such material the most profound false data can come out of texts such as stanislavsky russian actor and director and even mothers have hand in it such as children should be seen and not heard where subject such as art contains innumerable authorities and voluminous opinions you may find that any and all textbooks under that heading reek with false data those who have studied study tech will recall that the validity of texts is an important factor in study therefore it is important that any supervisor or teacher seeking to use false data stripping must utilize basic workable texts these are most often found to have been written by the original discoverer of the subject and when in doubt avoid texts which are interpretations of somebody elses work in short choose only textual material which is closest to the basic facts of the subject and avoid those which embroider upon them it can happen if you do false data stripping well and expertly without enforcing your own data on the person that he can find whole textbook falsemuch to his amazement in such case locate more fundamental text on the subject examples of false texts eastman kodak lord keynes treatises on economics john deweys texts on education sigmund freuds texts on the mind the texts derived from the work of wundt leipzig 1879father of modern psychology and joke textbook on proper conduct for sheep written by wolf use of false data stripping false data stripping should be used extensively in all hatting and training activities current society is riddled with false data and these must be cleared away so that we can hat and train people then they will be able to learn useful data which will enable them to understand things and produce valuable products in lifefalse data stripping can be done on or off the meter it can be done by an auditor in session by supervisor cramming officer or word clearer or by an exec or any administrator students and staff can be trained to do it on each other not lot of training is required to deliver this procedure but anyone administering it must have checked out on this hcobpl and have demoed and drilled the procedure if it is going to be done on the meter which is preferable the person doing it must have an ok to operate an emeter gradients it will be found that false data actually comes off in gradients for example student handled initially on false data on particular drill will appear to be complete on it he goes on with his studies and makes progress for while and then sometimes he will hit bog or slow in his progress this is usually an indication that more false data has been flushed up restimulated or remembered as result of actually doing studies or drills at that point more basic false data will come off when asked for the reason for this is when you first give student false data handling he doesnt know enough about the subject to know false data from the true when he has learned bit more about the subject he then collides with more false data hitherto buried this can happen several times as he is getting more and more expert on the subject thus the action of stripping off false data can and must be checked for and used in any training and hatting the rundown has to be given again and again at later and later periods as student or staff member may come up against additional faulty data that has been notised it can be repeated as often as necessary in any specific area of training until the person is finally duplicating and is able to use the correct tech and only the correct tech exactly theory there is philosophic background as to why getting off false data on subject works and why trying to teach correct datum over false datum on the subject does not work it is based on the socratic thesisantithesissynthesis philosophical equation socrates 470 bc 399 bc great greek philosopher thesis is statement or assertion antithesis opposing statement or assertion the socratic equation is mainly used in debate where one debater asserts one thing and the other debater asserts the opposite it was the contention of socrates and others that when two forces came into collision new idea was born this was the use of the equation in logic and debate however had they looked further they would have seen that other effects were brought into play it has very disastrous effects when it appears in the field of training where the person has acquired false thesis or datum the true datum you are trying to teach him becomes an antithesis the true datum comes smack up against the false datum he is hanging on to as it is counter to it in other words these two things collide and neither one will then make sense to him at this point he can try to make sense out of the collision and form what is called synthesis or his wits simply dont function synthesis unified whole in which opposites thesis and antithesis are reconciledso you wind up with the person either attempting to use false unworkable synthesis he has formed or b his thinkingness locks up on the subject in either case you get an impossibletotrain impossibletohat scene glibness probably we have here the basic anatomy of the glib student who can parrot off whole chapters on an examination paper and yet in practice uses his tools as door stop this student has been mystery to the world of education for eons what he has probably done in order to get by is set up circuit which is purely memory the truth of it is his understanding or participation is barred off by considerations such as nothing works anyway but one has to please the professor somehow the less person can confront the more false data he has accumulated and will accumulate these syntheses are simply additives and complexities and make the person complicate the subject beyond belief or the collision of false data and true data without the person knowing which is which makes him look like meathead therefore in order to cure him of his additives complexities apathy and apparent stupidity on subject in addition to cleaning up misunderstood words it is necessary to strip the false data off the subject most of the time this is prior to the true data and so is basic on the chain where this is the case when that basic false data is located and stripped the whole subject clears up more easily false data prone some people are prone to accepting false data this stems from overts committed prior to the false data being accepted the false data then acts as justifier for the overt an example of this would be student studying past misus on subject cheating in the exam and eventually dropping the subject entirely then someone comes along and tells him that the subject is useless and destructive well he will immediately grab hold of this datum and believe it as he needs something to justify his earlier overts this actually gets into service facsimiles as the person will use the false data to make the subject or other people wrong so if you see someone who is very prone to accepting false data on particular subject or in general the answer is to get the prior overts pulled then the person will not need to justify his overts by accepting any false data that comes his way procedure you may not easily be able to detect false datum because the person believes it to be true when false data stripping is done on meter the false datum wont necessarily read for the same reason you therefore ask the person if there is anything he has run across on the subject under discussion which he couldnt think with which didnt seem to add up or seems to be in conflict with the material one is trying to each himthe false datum buries itself and the procedure itself handles this phenomenon when the false datum is located it is handled with elementary recall based on 1950 straightwire straight memory technique or straightwire so called because one is stringing line between present time and some incident in the past and stringing that line directly and without any detours was developed originally in 1950 as lighter process than engram running cleverly used straightwire removed locks and released illnesses without the pc ever having run an engram once one had determined whatever it was that was going to be run with straightwire one would have the pc recall where and when it happened who was involved what were they doing what was the pc doing etc until the lock blew or the illness keyed out straightwire works at lock level when overdone it can key in underlying engrams when properly done it can be quite miraculous steps determine whether or not the person needs this procedure by checking the following 1 the person cannot be hatted on subject 2 crashing misus can be found on subject yet it is obvious they exist 3 the person is not duplicating the material he has studied as he is incorrectly applying it or only applying part of it despite word clearing 4 he is rejecting the material he is reading or the definition of the word he is clearing 5 you suspect or the person originates earlier data he has encountered on the materials that could contain false data 6 the person talks about or quotes other sources or obviously incorrect sources 7 he is glib 8 the person is backing off from actually applying the data he is studying despite standard word clearing 9 he is bogged 10 he cannot think with the data and it does not seem to apply b establish the difficulty the person is havingie what are the materials he cant duplicate or apply these materials must be to hand and the person must be familiar with the basic true data on the subject being addressed c if the action is being done metered put the person on the meter and properly adjust the sensitivity with proper can squeeze d thoroughly clear the concept of false data with the person have him give you examples to show he gets it this would be done if the person was receiving false data stripping for the first time the following questions are used to detect and uncover the false data these questions are cleared before they are used for the first time on anyone they do not have to read on meterand may not do so as the person will not necessarily read on something that he believes to be true 1 is there anything you have run across in subject under discussion which you couldnt think with 2 is there anything you have encountered in subject under discussion which didnt seem to add up 3 is there something you have come across in subject under discussion that seems to be in conflict with the material you are trying to learn 4 is there something in subject under discussion which never made any sense to you 5 did you come across any data in subject under discussion that you had use for 6 was there any data you came across in subject under discussion that never seemed to fit in 7 do you know of any datum that makes it unnecessary for you to do good job on this subject 8 do you know of any reason why an overt product is alright 9 would you be made wrong if you really learned this subject 10 did anyone ever explain this subject to you verbally 11 do you know of any datum that conflicts with standard texts on this subject 12 do you consider you really know best about this subject 13 would it make somebody else wrong not to learn this subject 14 is this subject not worth learning the questions are asked in the above sequence when an area of false data is uncovered by one of these questions one goes straight on to step fhandling f when the person comes up with an answer to one of the above questions locate the false datum as follows 1ask have you been given any false data regarding this and help him locate the false datum if this is being done on the meter one can use any meter reads one does get to steer the person this may require bit of work as the person may believe the false data he has to be true keep at it until you get the false datum if the person has given you the false datum in step then this step will not be needed just go straight on to step g g when the false datum has been located handle as follows 1 ask where did this datum come from this could be person book tv etc 2 when was this3 where exactly were you at the time 4 where was the person book etc at the time 5 what were you doing at the time 6 if the false datum came from person ask what was the person doing at the time 7 how did the person book etc look at the time 8 if the datum has not blown with the above questions ask is there an earlier similar false datum or incident on the subject under discussion and handle per steps 17 continue as above until the false datum has blown on the meter you will have floating needle and very good indicators do not continue past point where the false datum has blown if you suspect the datum may have blown but the person has not originated then ask how does that datum seem to you now and either continue if it hasnt blown or end off on that datum if it has blown h when you have handled particular false datum to blow going earlier similar as necessary you would then go back and repeat the question from the detection step that uncovered the false datum if there are any more answers to the question they are handled exactly as in step f location and step g handling that particular question is left when the person has more answers then if the person is not totally handled on the subject under discussion one would use the other questions from step and handle them in the same way all the questions can be asked and handled as above but one would not continue past point where the whole subject has been cleared up and the person can now duplicate and apply the data he has been having trouble with i conditional if false data stripping is being done in conjunction with crashing misu finding one would now proceed with the crashing misu finding j send the person to the examiner k have the person study or restudy the true data on the subject you have been handling end phenomena when the above procedure is done correctly and fully on an area the person is actually having difficulty with he will end up able to duplicate understand and apply and think with the data that he could not previously grasp the false data that was standing in the road of duplication will have been cleared away and the persons thinking will have been freed up when this occurs matter where in the procedure one ends off the false data stripping on that subject and sends the person to the examiner he will have cognitions and vgis and on the meter you will have an fn this is not the end of all false data stripping for that person it is the end of that false data stripping on the person at that particular time as the person continues to work with and study the subject in question he will learn more about it and may again collide with false data at which time one repeats the above process notefalse data buries itself as the person may firmly believe that it is true sometimes the person will have such faith in particular person book etc that he cannot conceive that any data from that particular source might be false one artist being false data stripped had received some false data from very famous painter even though the data didnt really add up and actually caused the artist tremendous problems he tended to believe it because of where it came from it took persistence on the part of the person administering the false data stripping to eventually blow this false datum with resulting freeing up of the artists ability to think and produce in the area misunderstoods misunderstoods often come up during false data stripping and should be cleared when they do one would then continue with the false data stripping one person being false data stripped knew he had some false data from particular source but the false data was complete blankhe couldnt remember it at all it was discovered that he had misu just before he received the false data and as soon as this was cleared up he recalled the false data and it blew this is just one example of how word clearing can tie in with false data stripping repeated use false data stripping can be done over and over as it will come off in layers as mentioned before if false data stripping has been done on specific thing and at some later point the person is having difficulty with drill or the materials the stripping of false data should be done on him again in such case it will be seen that the person recognizes or remembers more false or contrary data he has accumulated on the subject that was not in view earlier as he duplicates drill or his materials more and more exactly former interpretations he had notised incorrect past flunks that acted as invalidation or evaluation etc may crop up to be stripped off cautions code false data stripping is done under the discipline of the auditors code evaluation and invalidation can be particularly harmful and must be avoided all points of the code apply rudiments one would not begin false data stripping on someone who already has outruds if the person is upset or worried about something or is critical or nattery then you should fly his ruds or get them flown before you start false data stripping overrun one must be particularly careful not to overrun the person past blow of the false datum the stress in recall is that it is light action which does not get the person into engrams or heavy charge keep it light if you overrun someone past the point of blow he may drop into engrams or heavy charge just take the recall step to blow and dont push him beyond it datelocate datelocate is another way of getting something to blow if false datum does not blow on the recall steps despite going earlier similar then it could be handled with datelocate in session as ordered by the cs this would normally be done as part of false data stripping repair list datelocating false data would never be done except in session as ordered by the cs or as directed by the false data stripping repair list the auditor must be totally starrated on date and locating and practiced in it before he attempts itfalse data stripping repair list the false data stripping repair list is used in session by an auditor when false data stripping bogs inextricably or the person is not fn gis at exams or gets in trouble after false data stripping has been done bogged false data stripping session must be handled within 24 hours new students students who are new to scientology should not use this procedure on each other as they may be insufficiently experienced to deliver it competently in this case the supervisor or someone qualified would administer false data stripping to those students who need it summary the problem of the person who is unable to learn or who is unable to apply what he learns has never been fully resolved before misunderstoods were and are major factor and word clearing must be used liberally now however i have made major breakthrough which finally explains and handles the problem of inability to learn and apply mans texts and education systems are strewn with false data these false data effectively block someones understanding of the true data the handling given in this hcobpl makes it possible to remove that block and enable people to learn data so they can apply it with the ability to learn comes stability and the production of valuable products with stability and the production of valuable products comes the achievement of ones purposes and goals high morale and happiness so lets get to work on stripping away the false data which plagues man clogs up his ability to think and learn and reduces his competence and effectiveness lets increase the ability of individuals and the human race l ron hubbard founder lrhgal copyright 1979

ethics must be in to get tech in ethics is personal thing by definition the word means the study of the general nature of morals and of the specific moral choices to be made by the individual in his relationship with others american heritage dictionary when one is ethical or has his ethics in it is by his own determination and is done by himself justice is the action of the group against the individual when he has failed to get his own ethics in in the culture in which we live justice is so savage and often so unreasonable that it tends to inhibit the individual from confessing minor misdemeanors and crimes this aberrates him because it prevents him from getting off his withholdsthis leads to bad health bad eyesight deafness and other things as can be proven in auditing results it also leads to out communication and it inhibits the individual from reaching out with what he has learned and applying it the slow student the glib student the student who cannot apply are all students who are withholding this is true of any course and any materials and has always been true but one ever worked it out since they had real command of the subject of the mind before dianetics and scientology the culture itself encourages dishonesty and therefore has not been able to solve fully the problem of study only an honest student really reads really does what he is supposed to do and really applies pilots there were several pilot courses to find this material the one which finally proved it was course of about 12 students they were very slow they were unable to apply the materials during an apprenticeship it was then found none of them had done an honest primary rundown they had know bested their way through it cheating and had falsely attested then further investigation showed each one of them had come to the course with his ethics badly out confessional was then done on each of them and they were restarted to again do full primary rundown student hat and the materials only then did they succeed in their application of what was studied this was also true of their supervisors each one of whom had done his supervisors course with his ethics out so one should not blame the students only case supervisor in training could not case supervise well it was found he had not even read the case history section sample programs because he already knew yet attested he had prior to all this his ethics were out when his withholds were handled he could then supervise cases and did well confessionals the technology of confessionals has been upgraded enormously in the last year with this vast improvement it becomes possible to remove the barriers and counter intention to getting his ethics in and studying in an ethical fashion and being able to reach with the materials studied and so apply themif any student beginning in school or on course is given standard confessional before beginning serious study he will proceed much more rapidly will study honestly will apply study materials and if actual study tech is used will become successful student of that subject and will be able to apply what he learns study tech used by itself will succeed somehow in large number of cases but when it is preceded by well done and thorough confessional its results are more thorough and far more rapid when i was first working on evaluations of study in 1971 the dishonesty factor appeared as very general why but it was not worked with at that time as there seemed easy way to handle it by improving the technology of confessionals on another entirely different research channel the problem of the student also became clear only the honest student is good student and credit to his class and the subject and himself the only reservation then is that the confessional itself has to be done competently and honestly but honest confessionals breed honest confessional auditors and this can be closely supervised as an expert action this opens the road to improvement and wider success in the already winning and successful subject of study tech man is not happy unless he is honest white black red or brown this is true of all times and all races and it is true of all students in all schools the honest student is the most successful student and the technology of the confessional can make him so rapidly and easily l ron hubbard founder

the theory section of the course is on duplicating and understanding the correct data the student must duplicate the data before he can understand it however simple duplication with the use of memory machine does not mean that the understanding is present if the student understands the data he will find that he has little difficulty in duplicating retaining and applying it i have tried out method of coaching theory on the saint hill special briefing course that has gotten amazing results when it was correctly applied what do you consider that means coaching orill the student and the coach sit opposite each other each holding copy of the material to be learned step one the coach has the student read aloud the rule axiom definition sentence or short paragraph to be learned the coach must ask for only one major thought at time when the student has read what was asked for the coach acknowledges the coach repeats this step until the student reads the exact material as written step two the coach asks the exact question what do you consider that means and always acknowledges whatever answer the student gives step three repeat step one and step two until the student duplicates the material to be learned in response to the question what do you consider that means the coach then asks the question do you understand what it means if the student doesnt or is not sure the coach gets the student to define each word on the line clearing up any that he was not sure of or hesitated overwith good dictionary the coach makes sure that all definitions of word are cleared and gets the student to use them in sentences until he undersrands them then he repeats steps one and two until the student is able to duplicate the material and understands what it means the coach then takes up the next major thought sample what do you consider that means coaching sessioncoach read the 1st arc break rule aloud student all arc breaks are caused by bypassed charge coach good what do you consider that means student well pause all arc breaks are caused by bypassed charge coach thank you do you understand what it means student yes all arc breaks are caused by bypassed charge coach very good now read the 2nd arc break rule student to turn off an arc break find and indicate the bypassed charge left out correct coach ok read that again student to turn off an arc break find and indicate the oh correct bypassed charge coach thank you what do you consider that means student goes into an explanation coach when student is finished thank you read the 2nd arc break rule student does so coach thank you what do you consider that means student shorter explanation coach thank you read it again student does so coach thank you what do you consider that means student lets see in order to handle an arc break find and indicate the bypassed charge coach thank you read it again student to turn off an arc break find and indicate the correct bypassed charge coach good what do you consider that means student to turn off an arc break find and indicate the correct bypassed charge coach thank you do you understand what it means student yes coach good read the next sentencestudent charge can be bypassed by one going later than basic on any chain without further search for basic coach good what do you consider that means student well you can bypass charge by going after something closer to present time than the basic on the chain and stopping there without further search for basic coach exact word for word duplication not being necessary for something not in capital letters good do you understand what it means student yes coach good read the next sentence etc another example coach read the 1st arc break rule student all arc breaks are caused by bypassed charge coach good what do you consider that means student all arc breaks are caused by bypassed charge coach thank you do you understand what it means student im not sure coach has the student define each word and cears up any word he is not sure of with good dictionary the coach makes sure that all definitions of word are ceared and gets the student to use them in sentences until he understands them student does so coach good what do you consider that means student gives an explanation coach good continues steps one and two until student gives exact duplication of the rule in response to what do you consider that means good do you understand what it means student yes coach good read the 2nd arc break rule etc tips to coaches the exactness of duplication required is dependent on the importance of the material axioms rules stable data in capitals and patter must be duplicated word for word and understood definitions must be closely duplicated and understood general theory and examples must be understood if you are in doubt whether the student has duplicated the data well enough continue the drillthis coaching method works well only if it is tightly muzzled any extra questions or additives to the exact procedure of steps one two and three are destructive the coach may understand and acknowledge student originations but he must do nothing else not designated in the drill coaches will flnd that some students may spend some time on the first few bulletins coached in this manner however the students ability to duplicate and understand will improve rapidly and his learning rate will come way up if the student has too much difficulty doing this drill run reach and withdraw on the material to be learned to flat point and return to the drill if you havent done this drill you wont know that it works do it do it exactly as written and youll be winning from there on out in learning theory issued by fred hare revised reissued as btb by flag mission 1234 ic cpo andrea lewis 2nd

education by importance is alright as long as you are in terrific arc with your people if you are not in terrific arc with the people vou have to get them to relax about the body of data you are teaching before the importance of data shows up person can be hung up on the allimportance and everythingness of subject he is so nervous of dire consequences that he will eventually have an accident people are often thoroughly educated into this attitude it is all so important it will kill him if he doesnt know this inhibits his power of choice and ability to evaluate data education today is taught by consequence not by the fact it is sensible thing to do in the world importance essentially means punishment to teach someone subject just have him select out the unimportances of the subject he will start to think everything is important but coax him on with arc and 8c and he will eventually come up with something unimportant ie you are teaching him how to drive tractor he will find the coat of paint on the crank unimportant you acknowledge and ask him to find something else unimportant keep at this repeating it and repeating it and eventually allness will start to disintegrate he will select down to the most important controls of the tractor and the next thing you know he can drive tractor he wont have craving to know anxiety and wont be nervous at all you are teaching by deevaluation of importance it is interesting that person who never selected out the importances of scientology or any subiect and believes every datum must be memorized you will find has history of being punished within an inch of their lives there is direct coordination here education is basically fixing date unfixing data and changing existing data either by making it more fixed or less fixed

education by duplication and repetition this method is fantastically simple with very successful results in raising iq level and cause over learning accepting and knowing data the first step is given in the sample below and is the first gradient coach i am gomg to say three numbers one two three what did i say student one two three coach good do you remember what i said do you remember what you said used alternatively student one two three coach good this is done using variations of the three numbers checking how the student is doing every now and then until the student is comfortable and relaxed without any physical pain or tension and he can recall without difficulty what you said and what he said check before going on if he can remember the first set of numbers you gave him then we go up one gradient and have the student reject or accept data at will example coach all chairs are purple what did i say student all chairs are purple cosch okay both of us said all chairs are purple student yes coach are they student coach alright you could disbelieve something i said and throw it out couldnt you student yesthis step is done using examples of nonsignificant data which are totally incorrect when he has regained his power of choice we go on to the next step that of teaching and getting across the actual datum you want to teach him example coach preclears should always be acknowledged what did i say student preclears should always be acknowledged coaeh is this true student well i dont know coach alright now give graphic exalmple of that using these two items student the glass as the preclear says ive had enough im leaving the coke bottle which is the auditor must always acknowledge the preclear and says ok coach its not very workable is it alright modify it student if you want good auditing results aiknowledge your preclear coach if you want good auditing results acknowledge your preclear student good coach thank you end of session so in this way you can teach person datum without duress let him think about it and argue it out get him into agreement there is rote set of commands it consists of twoway comm hased on the above format and getting him to

trainingduplication learning is not the same as study person could do whole course and get good study stats yet not learn anything he might even pass an exam yet not have learned the data so that it can be applied the subject of study has been researched and completed by l ron hubbard who did the bulk of the work prior to 1964 the study technology has been in full use in scientology organizations for many years the subject of learning was started by l ron hubbard in the early 50s and required only small amount of research and correlation for the data to be issued in the final form to evolve the most effective of the many learning drills which had been researched in previous years number of the most successful drills were used on 3 group of students of various levels of training with before and after tests to determine which drill raised the students ability to learn and apply data the following drill was found to produce the best results on all levels of students in every instance it was evolved from the lrh tape lecture of 24 january 1962 training duplication we have named it simply the learning drill the drill is not designed for use on study or course materials it is used to improve the ability to study and increase the learning rate the learning drill would be done at the beginning of courses or as needed then the student would study his course materials or anything in the standard way with study technology applied and with twin checkouts demos clay demos etc the learning drill position student and coach sit facing each other across table purpose to develop judgement by duplication and understanding training stress 1 the first step is duplicationthe coach takes sentence or phrase trom alices adventures in wonderland the line used is unimportant the coach reads it to the student trs should be in although not stressed the student then repeats the line exactly as the coach read it coach merely tries to get the student to repeat line of sounds you dont need to call them words it is not rote memory it is duplication the coach repeats the line each time the student flubs until the student has duplicated it exactly 2 the second step is understanding after the student has correctly duplicated what the coach read coach asks give an example of that student gives example or examples until both are satisfied coach then asks how do you feel about that and if ok they continue to next line if the student has any uncertainties with examples the coach goes back to 1 and starts the drill from the beginning using the same line if the student still has trouble with examples coach would ask are there any misunderstoods on this line and any found cleared up dictionary should be used where required remedy if the student continues to have trouble with examples the coach could say give an example of how the datum isnt that way and student gives examples until both are satisfied then give an example of how it is until both are satisfied always end off with how it ts the student should feel good about the datum after duplication and understanding and should start having realizations as he is further drilled eventually using the two basic steps the student will learn judgement the drill should be coached on gradient it should be ended on good win student should have vgis the end result on each student is the ability to

that must be done with person you are disseminating to there is set patter nor any set words you say to the person there are four steps that must be accomplished with the individual and they are listed in the order that they should be done 1contact the individual this is plain and simple it just means making personal contact with someone whether you approach them or they approach you 2handle if the person is wide open to scientology and reaching this step can be omitted as there is nothing to handle handle is to handle any attacks antagonism challenge or hostility that the individual might express towards you andor scientology definition of handle to control direct handle implies directing an acquired skill to the accomplishment of immediate ends once the individual has been handled you then 3salvage definition of salvage to save from ruin before you can save someone from ruin you must find out what their own personal ruin is this is basically what is ruining them what is messing them up it must be condition that is real to the individual as an unwanted condition or one that can be made real to him 4bring to understanding once the person is aware of the ruin you bring about an understanding that scientology can handle the condition found in 3 this is done by simply stating scientology can or by using data to show how it can its at the right moment on this step that one hands the person selection slip or ones professional card and directs him to the service that will best handle what he needs handled these are the steps of the dissemination drill they are designed so that an understanding of them is necessary and that understanding is best achieved by being coached on the drill coaching the drill position coach and student may sit facing each other comfortable distance apart or they may stand ambulatory purpose to enable scientologist to disseminate scientology effectively to individuals to enable one to contact handle salvage and bring to upderstanding another being to prepare scientologist so that he wont be caught rlatrooted when being attsoked or questioned by anotherpatter there is set patter the coach plays the part of nonscientologist and displays an attitude about sclentology upon being approached by the student the student must then handle 6alvage and bring the coach to understanding when the student can comfortably do these steps on given coachs attitude the coach then assumes another attitude etc and the drill is continued until the student is confident and comfortable about doing thcsc steps with any type of person this drill is coached as follows the coach says start thestudent must then 1 contact the coach either by approaching the coach or being approached by the coach the student introduces himself and scientology or not depending upon the mockedup situation the student then 2 handles any invalidation of himself andor scientology any challenge attack or hostility displayed by the coach the student then 3 salvages the coach in this step the student must locate the ruin problem or difficulty the coach has with life and point out that it is ruinous and get the person to see that it is when 3 has been done you then 4 bring about an understanding that scientology can do something about it example the coach has admitted problem with women the student simply listens to him talk about his problem and then asserts well thats what scientology handles we have processing etc etc whe4 the coach indicates realization that he did have problem and that something might be done about it the student purpose him with selection slip or card routing hlm to the service that would best remedy the condition the coach must flunk for co nm lags nervousness laughter or noneoniront the coach would similarly flunk the student for failure to 1 contact 2 handle 3 salvage and 4 bring to understanding training stress stress giving the student wins this is done by using gradient scale in the coachs portrayal of various attitudes and staying with any selected untl the student can handle it comfortably as the student becomes better the coach can portray more difficult attitude stress bringing about for the student the accomplishment of the purpose of this drill list of things to handle and another of ruins to discover can be mxde up and used do not specialize in either antagonistic attitudes or an eagerness to know about sclentology use both and other attitudes one meets them all l ron hubbard founder lrhmlsdjk copyright 1965 1979 by l ron hubbard all rights

you do this by bringing about an understanding of what scientology can do thus creating desire for service now in order for you fsms to achieve your purpose and obtain your product you have to have local org which has wellpresented intro services and an adequate array of department 17 courses intro services are defined as immediate and fast free one evening or 12 to 1 hour services the successful ones are te6tings intro tapes and lectures information intro films personal efficiency intro lecture and new book sales these are for raw public friends etc and are used to gain interest and involvement and to get signups for dept 17 services or even major services dept 17 paid services are those services which give the public what is needed and wanted to handle tbeir ruins they bring the public up to the recognition that scientology and dianetics contain the data needed to handle life im going to give you the steps that lead up to your need of org services and how you utilize them its little program to follow and if you do these things plus apply the data you have obtained on the specialist fsm hat you will have guaranteed successes as an fsm 1 you approach the individual 2provide him with some kind of an introductory service 2a alternate sell him book 3find his ruin on the spot 4get him onto dept 17 course which will handle his ruin 5collect the commission right then and there 5a sell him book 6 monitor his progress on his dept 17 courses and get him selected for major service the minute hes ready for onean example routine that you would follow as an tsm would be to get the guy down to an intro lecture at your local org and then talk to him and find his ruin and then recommend him right on through dept 17 course collect the commission for the dept 17 course and then select him up the line to other dept 17 courses or major service you must remember that you can always select for major service or major training as your first option you may very well encounter individuals who are ready for major service after reading book for example fsms are to demand org services now theres point that must be made here it is your hat as an fsm to demand these services from the org and it is the orgs hat to supply you with the services you are demanding if the org doesnt have the course that your selectee needs you have an alternate lrh books you should have command of what books contain data which will help the person you are handling you can always sell book as an alternative because the data will always be in book if you do this handling and dept 17 service is still called for then you must recommend that the course he needs gets offered by the org this is especially true ii you find particular ruin is coming up with your selectees and is becoming dominant if your org isnt providing you with intro and dept 17 services then go to the orgs distribution secretary or the executive director and tell him what is occurring and what you need remember also that you always have recourse through the so 1 line so if the org isnt delivering despite going to the above named execs then write to and i will see that the scene is sorted out but fast working department 17 that is effective efficient and upstat can save you endless hours of making sales talks and endless weeks of wasted time with prospects team work intro services and dept 17 courses are the answer to an fsms prayers they are part of your tools and activity as much as you need the orgs for these services she orgs need you as youre supplying them with their future and dont you let them forget it as team working towards expansion of scientology you cant help but prosper l ron hubbard founder lrhgal copyright 1979 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 15 september 1959 franchise holders hco secs assn secs dissemination tips for very long time we have been working on optimum dissemination to find out if there was such thing over the years we have found that in order of importance the following methods were workable personal contact this by far is the very best method of dissemination it is better done on individual basis rather than talking to groups since there is the tactor in groups of being able to escape by saying they arent talking to personal contact then means just that matter whether it is done to fnends and then to other people or secondarily to total strangers there is nothing better than personal contact books personal contact usually requires books to back it up but books make personal contact all by themselves if they can be put in the right places if the library nearest you had some book about dianetics and scientology granted by you to them and your name and address was in the front as donor you would get people calling on you hco ww book admin recently made books available for this purpose at very reduced cost you send in the cost of the books and the books are sent to your local libraryproviding you give hco ww lhe addressand the books are sent with your name and address in them straight to the local library books placed in bookstores works mildly but it should be done books such as problems of work or dianetics evolution of science should be on hand in plenty to put in peoples hands hco ww is making stacks and stacks of these available to you at very small cost as soon as we can get enough copies you can get them by the hundreds from saint hill and trom your central org when this gets going dianetics evolution of science is available now in small edition in the uk and you can get it only from saint hill at 2 for 50 copies at crack thats less than they cost us books we have learned the hard way must be heavily in circulation or we get nobody in the front door you can always tell central org slump is coming whenever booksales drop off central org boom occurs about two or three months after book sales go up all central org promotion gen begins with given books in circulation then so you can easily see that the success of any neighbourhood depends on getting books into circulation in that neighbourhood at 40 discount an auditor can get them into bookstore without losing on it comment we are trying so hard to make hco saint hill self supporting because we want to get books collected in quantity and out at low cost if you are trying to work without books to pass around youre in trouble casualty contact fruitful source of has coaudit people is casualty contact this is very old is almost never tried and is always roaringly successful providing the auditor goes about it in roughly the right way using his ministers card an auditor need only barge into any nonsectarian hospital get permission to visit the wards from the superintendent mentioning nothing about processing but only about taking care of peoples souls to find himself wonderfully welcome ministers almost never make such rounds some hospitals are sticky about this sort of thing but its only necessary to find another its fabulous what one can get done in hospital with touch assist and locational processing dont pick on the very bad off unconscious cases hit the fracture ward and the maternity ward go around and say hello to the people and ask if you can do anything for them now heres how auditors have lost on this one they omit the following steps they fail to have card with their ministerial name on itwith their phone number they fail to have telephone answering service they fail to tell the people they snap away from deaths yawning door that they can have more of this stuff simply by calling in they get so involved in the complexities of medical treatment and so otitraged at some of the things they see going on that they get into rows with medicos and the hospital staff and also they pick unconscious patients or people who are halfway exteriorised already this is pretty routine drill really you get permission to visit you go in and give patients cheery smile you want to know if you can do anything sor them you give them card and tell them to come arountl to your group and really bet well and you give them touch assist if they seem to necd it but only if theyre willing and you for sure make sure that somebody is on the other end when they ring up giving them schedule of your has co audit will avail much ive got book scheduled the sick person as working title that will make good fodder for this but your statement the modern scientific church can cure things like that come around and see will work its straight recruiting newspaper ads costly and hard to get taken sometimes newspaper ads still work very well for the has coaudit the best ad to date on actual test is matter how bad your problem is something can be done about it phone also body mind spirit who are you phone also works talking to groups this seldom produces much results and when you give away literature too this isnt cheap i am sure it is worthwhile for good speaker and has been done with success but it is mostly useful in the production of future contacts and is not very useful otherwise in general experience cooperating with groups this is almost totally unworkable according to past record group is composed of individuals as group it normally has different goal than you business firms in some areas responded well but in the us the record of this is very poor it is far far better to spend weeks getting to meet the man in charge and then handle only his personal problems and only then get into what his group is doing straight attack on groups is waste of time newspaper stories letters to editors these are all more or less liability and should be avoided radio ads have produced results but only when accompanied by lectures on the subject radio spot ads are worthless posters and billboards have produced now and then some very spectacular results this depends on what they say in the area bunch of posters scattered around town once produced very heavy attendance this has the advantage of being cheap general comment what you are up against in disseminating scientology is the generality of what we do when you cover all of life and all living things you dont have enough point of concentration for people in general to follow you they get such hazy ideas of it all and life to them is wrapped in such covert obscurities that they dont track with you they just go into their engrams and know that whatever it is youre talking about must be beyond them to disseminate successfully you have to have an apparent goal that is understandable to the audience or person at his tone level and with which he will agree show him then something about himself and the battle is pretty well won we try too often for total etfect on people and try to tell them everything there is in single moment the motto here is dont try to overwhelm just penetrate if we attack with our eyes open we will guide this penetration just as we guide session we dont try to sell scientology then we give an apparent and understandable goal of what were doing and then put the person or persons to whom were talking into state of being interested in their own cases the use of the dianetic idea of the reactive mind is almost infallible i once told casual fellow passenger on short train ride say did you hear about them isolating the freudian unconscious i said this because helooked like scholarly bloke and he said who did that and i said oh some scientists and i said yes they found it was the sum of all mans bad experiences and nothing more mysterious than that and he said thats interesting and i said what was your last bad experience and he said well he was in session and called up later another fellow i met on bus i said theyve found the dynamic principle of existence and its about time and he said what and i said yes they know what makes man tick now it looked for while like the machine would win and he said what was it and i said the urge to survive and he said well i always thought it would be something like that and i said i dont know have you ever had the urge to succumb and of course he was in session too only i had to get off i once tied up the whole us senate lunch room with these remarks and if you can get senator to listen instead of talk youve done something another time on boat i said dreamily so girl could overhear i wonder if man really does have soul and she said oh i dont think so really isnt it all lot of religious talk and i said try not to be three feet back of your head gave her an hour or two of processing and shes still interested dont try to persuade penetrate dont try to overwhelm penetrate and even newspaper reporter will fall in your lap the last one that came down to see what mud he could sling didnt sling any because i showed him an emeter told him not to say anything and then located by asking questions which only the meter answered his last car wreck who was hurt and what part of his body was injured and how many years ago it was man he looked at that emeter like he was bird and it was cobra but he sailed off into full run of the engram and i walked him through it three times until he had good somatics turned on told him i wasnt going to really put him in it because it would hurt and ended the demonstration he didnt write any mud take an emeter to boy scout meeting and watch the fun send notes to their parents when you found them in bad way use an emeter as dissemination weapon when you can do these things to people they know we know what were talking about you dont have to explain dont explain penetrate dont overwhelm penetrate and youll have has coaudit going in time we are the first group on earth that knew what they were

above are appointed herewith field staff members of their nearest scientology organization their rank is field staff member provisional they come directly under the department of clearing director of clearing of their nearest org the purpose of the field staff member is to help lrh contact handle salvage and bring to understanding the individual and thes the peoples of earth their pay shall be in terms of commissions and therefore should be equal to that of general staff members in the orgs themselves depending only on the activity of the field staff member the field staff member is not on proportionate pav anc is not on payroll for tax purposes the situation is this the idea of the practitioner setting up practice to audit preclears must be wrong because it is used with poor success by new doctors and psychiatrists it also has worked poorly for doctors as groups as they more and more require government subsidy personally require large borrowed sums to set up new practices and depend for affluence on laws passed to protect them and give them monopoly monopoly held in place by force alone soon vanishes further their system took over 700 years to establish them to point where they could demand the legislation needed to protect them proof examine the status of medical man in the centuries betueen the great plague and today century by century and see the tiny progress each century in the standing of their profession and their security we neither have nor need 700 years civilization is successful only because it is team the individual in our present society has rough time we are team we have big job to do we need every one aboard hence the appointment this appointment should come as surprise as we were waiting only for the completion of technology to press the boom buttons and one of them was to reclaim and enrol as staff members everyone we have ever trainedcommissions the official scientology organization to which the field staff member is attached will pay the field staff member percentage of all training and processing fees received by that organization through its field staff members this system has already been piloted some years ago and its administration design is now smoothed out however it must be followed closely the field staff member selects the person to he trained or processed after direct personal contact with the person and issues to that person paper stating the contacted person has been selected this paper bears the hour date and place of the selection the paper is in quadruplicate the original goes to the person selected selectee the second copy is sent promptly to the field staff members orgs advanced booking registrar the third to the director of clearing and the fourth copy is held by the field staff member if the selectee appears at the org presents the selection paper to the cashier and enrols for training and processing and pays the org sends at once commission of 10 for total cash there is waiting in sending the commission the org sends the sum at once 10 is also paid in memberships bought by the selectee if accompanied by another selection paper marked membership also issued by the field staff member example of commission selectee presents the selection paper at the org accounts office and pays for the services bought totally in cash the org promptly sends the field staff member 10 of the whole payment example selectee presents the selection paper of the field staff member at the org accounts office and pays for the service in cash the org promptly sends the field staff member 10 of the total sum these both end the transaction there is later amount owing the field staff member when the credit extended is paid off if any fieid staff member gave the selectee another later paper the selectee then used again commission would be paid by the org the person selected is directed by the field staff member to reception at the nearest organization the name and address of which is given to the selesctee cash for memberships may be taken by the field staff member as memberships must be paid for only to the org accounts cashier the preclear or student may be selected as often or as many times as the field staff member can do so if the person is not however selected again by the field staff alember after training or processing the org may select the person once more and commission is paid the org does not have to have selection paper to train or process person the org will honour and pay commission on the selection papers presented to accounts by the selectee it is the responsibility of the field staff blember to inform the selectee to present his or her selection paper existing centres existing scientology centres are not official orgs the field staff member is not attached to unofficial orgs however centre or group or group of auditors may send selectee as student or pc providing it is field staff member that signs the selection form centres may not have field staff alembers of their own unless the centre if owned and operated by scientology and field staff members may not send pcs or students to any but official orgs to do so constitutes suppression of scientology official orgs as this is scientology org activity not designed for centres or franchise holders to use until they are officialized and theirservice can be supervised remember to use this system all centre has to do to use the field staff member system is become official and meet requirements for new org forms where forms exist the field staff member can write on plain paper preferably pink the org flash colour for accounts matters and using carbon or hand copying can make the forms himself the form must bear the hour date and place the block printed name and address of the selectee and the block printed name and address and certificate initials and certificate number of the field staff member and what the selectee is selected for membership training or processing and some approximation of arrival date at the org orgs may care to furnish forms but this is all they contain membership and rate cards the field staff member should be supplied with book lists membership descriptions and the org rate card he or she should give copies of these to the selectee if the field staff member has them books the field staff member may buy books from an org and sell them for his own profit any discounts are arranged with the org and regulated by the director of publications saint hill org members other org staff members may not use this system as they are general not field staff members but where they have had personal pcs before taking org employment they may handle the matter as field staff member would if done within the first three months of org employment and the selection was done before org employment certificate reouired any auditor who has any certificate including hubbard book auditor may become field staff member classification is required other stipulations may be locally made pitfall this is all taken from my own experience when i was the only field auditor there was i was hammered at by many to process them and became quite overworked i was only saved by org formation to which i could turn over my traffic the moment field auditor starts individual processing he becomes too pinned down to promote and in year or so fails therefore or has to turn to other activitiesi got my pcs by casual personal contact and by letting book circulate the original thesis and by local personal promotion i ran pe type course not as high as an has and at one time had even psychiatrists demanding i process their wives after they had heard one lecture the demand for my own processing cut back my time and nearly stopped everything until i turned everyone over to the org and got on with my local public promotion i refused to process people myself and therein lies the secret of expansion only an org with its organization and facilities and teamwork can handle pcs and students even very small org doesnt dare process pcs or train students it does best when it only promotes and it should send its pcs to bigger org it should limit itself as i did after orgs took my pcs over to short assists pe courses and small coaudits dissemination formula ive now discovered the dissemination formula weve wanted so long and its easy central orgs have it and train field staff members on it in the staff training programme being tech it has part of this policy letter it takes four or five hours to learn theory and practical the org will have all such programmes of staff training payment of commission accounts receives the selectees selection paper from the selectee when that person arrives at the acccunts window accounts must write on the invoice the auditors name who did the selection accounts will at once or within week of registration make out cheque for 10 of the cash payment made to the field staff member and mail it to him or her when the commission is paid accounts sends an invoice copy of the payment and of the pc or students training processing or membership payment to the dept of clearing the department staples these to the field staff members copy and files it under the field staff members name the commission is only given on the actual amount the selectee paid in intensives this should be for at least one intensive however if at that appegrance the selectee bought several grades worth of intensives or several courses the commission is also given for those time there is time stipulation as to how often selectees may be selected and the org has period of grace wherein person may only be selected by the org itself if an org procures pc or student however directly the org not one of its general staff members gets the commission professional rates commission is also paid on professional rates but not to the auditor himself or friend who will refund the commission the professional rate applies only to auditing there is professional rate for training or courses disputeswhere one field staff member claims he or she sent in pc or student and another also claims it the director of clearing should be appealed to to settle the dispute the org always pays on the selection paper handed in by the selectee not on the earliest contact at least one of the claims must be paid two commissions may not be paid on the same matter to settle dispute field staff member who feels an error has been made can write the director of inspections and reports in his nearest org who will handle it disputes between field staff members in any disputes between two field staff members either may appeal to the chaplains court department of success in their nearest org which may hear the matter by mail and render decision such an action does not make any scientologist liable to further action forming orgs as official orgs are now on the lookout to form orgs and as distant service is not as easy as close service the hco area sec should be approached concerning the formation of new local org such an org would be owned and operated by scientology from saint hill the hco area sec will base decision upon the amount of traffic coming from that area and the successfulness of the field staff members there final permission for new org must come from saint hill the new org will be only class zero org at first with very limited services but all orgs grow such an org must be formed and conducted like any other official org it is prohibited for an old org to finance new org in any way the new org pays percentage of its gross to the founding official org and the new org pays 10 commissions as above to the field staff members on its staff but only if it is fully official and only when authorized to have an hgc until it has an official hgc it continues to operate on commissions and pays percentage to the forming org but still receives them its pe and coaudit activities and commissions paid in students and pcs sent into the founding org support it hgcs and academies hubbard guidance centres of official orgs only may be sent pcs and academies of scientology only may be sent students by field staff members as long and arduous experience has determined that great quantities of trouble can come from courses and clinics which are unofficial and usually offical orgs have to clean the resulting mess up notable examples were sydney and the us pacific north west in 54 there have been dozens of such instances with many people hurt the names hubbard guidance centres and academies of scientology are protected by law only their service is supervised by saint hill or myself field staff member regulation field staff member comes under the same discipline as any other org staff member and is subject to the same codes of ethics auditing org pcs or students is forbidden to all staff members acceptancethe field auditor should write his or her nearest official organization addressing his letter to the director of clearing who would be his superior in an org giving his acceptance of appointment or declining it in return he will receive his credentials as field staff member provisional which consist letter signed by the hco secretary signifying his or her appointment to be followed after year by more formal credentials in writing the director of clearing head the letter re field staff member appointment and give current address and any other particulars if there are any questions or hitch write to at saint hill provisional the first appointment is provisional meaning not permanent at the end of one year the appointment expires unless renewed on being confirmed at the end of one year the provisional is removed and more extensive credentials are issued when field staff member provisional has been one for ten months he or she should write the director of field activities requesting the full appointment be made and giving any evidence of good work at that time the director of clearing will cause to be issued new set of credentials to the field staff member declaring him or her to be field staff member activity is the criteria of issuing full credentials if any difficulty develops in obtaining full credentials contact at saint hill the names or short lists sent to the field staff member for selection or collection are considered to be org prospects the field staff member may only select them to the org or collect from them for the org and if the field staff member processes or trains for his own fee prospect names sent by the org he is subject to discipline by the distribution secretary private practice any field auditor with private practice who wishes to retain it should advise his organization or association secretary of the nearest official org and explain why centres any centres wishing to become class zero orgs should advise the hco area sec of their nearest org they are accepted when authorized by the office of lrh and when the earlier mentioned conditions for new org are met meanwhile they operate in relation to their nearest org as group of field staff members if they accept appointment as field staff members franchise holders existing franchise holders may retain their franchise and status so long as they remain in good standing at saint elill new courses and processing field staff members hca and above may have the professional rate now for hgc intensives if international members in good standing courses for field staff members are given at the same fees as for any other international member or staff member there is professional rate for courses only for intensives they are however given short briefings on pertinent subjects at such times as the secretary of their org makes it available however the better trained field staff member is the better he will succeed and therefore this appointment should not interrupt training plansdebts field staff members may be requested by the department of accounts to collect overdue accounts on which 10a commission of any sums collected will be paid by the org but they may not be ordered to do this accounts may release to field staff members in an area lists of overdue accounts in that area by using arc break technology and assists the field staff member may collect the sums in cheque form only payable to the org and forward it with any details to accounts in the org accounts must inform inspections and reports of any such issue of lists or any collections received by this method all such assists are given at the field staff members own discretion without org reimbursement general and executive staff member selections the general staff member of any org may select students or pcs or memberships applicants by issuing them selection papers to their own orgs in this case any commission is paid to the staff members own org and the selection paper is of different appearance the general or executive staff member receives any benefit through org pay along with the rest of staff saint hill field staff members any auditor trained to any level at saint hill is similarly appointed by this policy letter all saint hillers are therefore appointed field staff members saint hill when working as general staff member or executive for an org the 10af is paid to that org not the staff member personally so that all its staff may benefit they may select to the saint hill course or hgc the same stipulations and procedures as for other orgs as above in this policy letter apply to saint hill field staff members commissions are paid on the saint hill briefing course and saint hill hgc if the student or pc sent is sent expressly to saint hill as above acceptance of appointment from saint hill does not prohibit being as well field staff member of local org senior org prfference field staff member trained and certified at senior org may be field staff member of that org even while employed on staff by junior org but the commission is paid to the junior org the junior org is paid the commission on any pc or student he sends to the senior org not his own memberships alone are denied commission in such case as the junior org can also sell them such field staff member for senior org employed in junior org must not distract students or pcs already selected by field staff member of the junior org before they can present selection papers being on two staffs any field auditor can be field staff member to more than one org but is actually on the staff of the nearest org to his address and may not use another appointment to another org or saint hill to set aside the nearer orgs requirements of him or her in changing location thefield staff member must inform the director of clearing of the org he has been nearest to and inform the director of clearing of the org he will now be nearest to in case he is field staff member saint hill also he should inform the director of clearing saint hill l ron hubbard

franchise franchise who may have it and how to maintain it ad 15 the franchise programme has been part of the broad public dissemination of scientology for long time now almost six years the purpose of this programme is to build up really fine group of professional auditors practicing and disseminating scientology in the field professional auditors who could help carry out the goals aims and ideals of scientology and who could in the practical aspects of training processing and like activities help other people to higher levels of awareness and beingness to accomplish this purpose we had to ensure to the franchise holder and to the general public that they would get the very best data and technical information with which to succeed the dissemination and help of scientology relying wholly on technical working in the hands of those who apply it not just those who are closely supervised in its application but in everyones hands so we had to provide the service of seeing that this technical information was relayed as fast as possible each week on established communication lines that there was someone to answer and handle the natural queries that result from new technical information that the general public be advised throughout our various magazines that these franchise holders were the elite corps from whom the best technical could be expected in the field and that we could do everything possible to promote the activities of the franchise holder through advertising technical information and administrative advice in return for such information and services we ask that ten percent of the weekly gross income of the franchise holder be sext along with weekly report to help defray the expenses involved to help pay for the advertising arld to help pay for the research involved in the development of new technology thus twoway flow is maintained with affinity reality and communication new promotion and new technical bridge have been originated to increase even further the effectiveness and reach of our franchise holders this new promotion and new bridge via the training and processing levels will bring about more success and more wins and more people to cope with this forward reach and progress we would like to ensure that those who are now franchise holders will continue to be franchise holders in the future and to ensure that the members of franchise holders are increased first lets review the definition of franchise holder professional auditor with classification to level iii or over who practices scientology full or part time for remuneration who conducts processing and training privately or to groups whose understanding and experience of scientology is sufficiently broad for him to be publicized to others as stable terminal who has signed franchise agreement who receives bulletins policy letters advice advertising technical information services and administrative data from hco wwand who in return for same maintains regularly weekly report and weekly payment of ten percent of his gross income to hco ww contained in this definition are all the agreements which create the reality of the communication flows and which help to maintain affinity in common purpose and understanding the administrative actions which we engage upon to maintain the franchise programme are much more complicated and time consuming than the fifteen or thirty minutes and even less in the case of some very efficient franchise holders required to write out supplied report form and check cheque but this difference is made up in the hours and time devoted to handling processing and training people by the franchise holder we would like to see in the future more franchise holders and franchise holders so busy and successful that they need to hire someone to file their report to hco ww to enroll all the people to answer the telephone and to keep that overfull appointment book the future of the franchise programme is bright lets keep it that way by maintaining the agreements upon which it is founded and by gathering together new members with the same aims and goals l ron hubbard lrh lb cden copyright 1965 by l ron

groups it is pretty hard to handle downstat one with low declining statistics it is easy to handle an upstat in world which is taught by the old school that it is dogeatdog jungle world one has incompetent governments wars pressure groups conflicts economic pushes and generally hard environment in which to operate the humanitarian objective of scientology isto make safe environment in which the 4th dynamic engram can be audited suppressed and insecure society is hard one in which to operate the answer then is to generally increase the security of races groups individuals true democracy is possible only when the group is made up of sane thinking individuals we can produce these and out from them goes zone of greater security however it is perilous to neglect the further out surroundings and it is necessary that one give some thought to other dynamics beyond the first dynamic self we are not engaged in conquest or to achieve some planned utopia all we are trying to do is lessen the turbulence and insecurity in the society which is the basic role of church by organization and an orderly approach to the problem we can achieve this in several ways main one being gung ho group activities 1 gung ho group asks individuals in the society what should be done 2gung ho group publishes the results 3gung ho group contacts humanitarian group to see what each can do to forward 2 4 society revitalizes 5 auditing occurs on wider perimeter 6 gung ho group repeats all above now if the gung ho group works only with social questions and gets individual public citizens to state what should really happen or be done on it and if getting it done is achieved by liaison with existing groups and if pressure groups such as political lobbies are ignored if they wont cooperate and other type groups are coordinated then things will start going right vitality returns to society when common purposes are restimulated at present so many special group interests are so in conflict with other special groups that social progress is impededif you can get one commonly expressed purpose these actually done by liaison with interested social or humanitarian groups the knot starts to untangle the combined strength of many social groups using all their connections to achieve one gain cannot help but produce it instead of all the force vectors lying about in random confusion opposing each other you add up some of the vectors all in one direction and achieve thereby concentration which brings result even small local campaign so coordinated will work it wont work if you go to groups for the purpose and ignore the men in the street groups get individuated each group is to some degree attacked or opposed and each is trying to do something this brings about stagnation of action you also get disinterested often disloyal society you get dope addiction immorality bad indicators in general real society is one in whicll the majority are going in some direction toward desirable goal but it has to be tlteir goal this rekindles interest action and hope it revitalizes society also we begin to stand for something they all stand for if as we progress lot of people also get processed then theres also the effect of their beneficial influence added to it example we poll an area or country regarding desirable social targets with what should be done to improve human rights we get lot of answers we boil these down to an honest common denominator we find whatever we find maybe its parking tickets should be given to the person not left on cars so we liaison with any and all civic groups and put this up to them what can each one do about it we keep it rolling suddenly the practice is effected people wake up to the fact that something can be done about something so we do it all over again using perhaps the same original question to individuals now that example is developed from preconceived question you can do it with much more general approach what should be done in this city to better it the choice of the question of course to some degree regulates the campaign the improvement of human rights will be found to be very generally acceptable if you choose question which then runs too contrary to the forces of law and order even more confusion will result so one tries to get theta approach to things people are usually able to agree with getting something stopped this is not always bad sometimes thats all you can get them to agree with today we have government by special interest it ignores to huge degree what the average citizen really wants this winds up usually in some weird special interest utopia mess like the book george orwells 1984 the number of utopia planners around would amaze you the average individual shuns utopias like the plague one has to go to the individual member and go to many individuals in many strata of society to find out whats really wanted its usually pretty simple the way the question is worded should guide toward simple action not some long term complex actiona lot of actually done easy actions each one completed will straighten out lot of vectors the hco pol ltrs on targets can help the one purpose selected via individuals becomes major target for the programme our overall major target is of course our humanitarian objective with scn orgs and gung ho groups as primary targets and keeping scn going as vital target and revitalizing society as the operating target each programme developed by polling individuals has the majority goal as its major target we are weary of rule by special interests its about time we helped make society of which every one can be proud and where they all win l ron hubbard founder lrh ldmeird copyright 1969 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard

organized activity to persist and expand it must have worhwhile purpose to which its members and activities are aligned the purpose of dianetic counseling group is to create an environment of well happy human beings who being freed from bodily considerations and the present time problem of the body can now achieve the scientology results of free powerful and immortal being to this purpose there is hidden secret intention it is purely and simply as stated it is envisioned that with the expansion of the group and others like it sanity and calm will spread into the society around as people become aware of the fact that someone really can help them and as they themselves become well their attention freed from being fixed on their body well society is sane society being who is stuck with pain and suffering much of which is so suppressed he is hardly aware of it cannot be at ease with his fellows and cannot easly achieve the spiritual freedom that he seeks the purpose of the group is to ease this and make well happy human beings who freed from bodily considerations and the present time problem of the body can move on up to the spiritual freedom achievable through scientology you will probably be the first dianetic counseling group in your area and as such you have the responsibility for the whole area this is not something to be afraid of but challenge to rise to never before has anyone had the precise rapid power to relieve the suffering of mankind that you have the pastoral counseling procedures you will be using are unique in their precisiop and results to date people have been subjected in the name of mental healing to brutalities even torture and murder mental healing apart from dianetics has not been developed in recent centuries as science or study to relieve man but rather has been aborted to use as means of political control treatments such as electric shock have killed or permanently crippled millions through the violence of the convulsions it creates prefrontal lobotomy makes man into vegetable it is true it calms him down but he can never become well again if he even survives the operation drugs can kill through the severity of their effects on the human body mental healing has become almost totally associated with brutality and control and is used for the most sordid purposes your purpose is pure you are uniqueyou will do well to place sign in place that it is clearly visible stating this group exists to create an environment of well happy human beings who being freed from bodily considerations and the present time problem of the body can now achieve the scientology results of free powerful and immortal being also place another sign not quite as bold this group will not recommend or condone pqlitical nental treatment such as electric shocks or brain operations or convulsive drugs and condemns utterly this fascist approach to mental health by extermination of the insane because we will not agree to brutality and murder under the guise of mental healing or to the easy and lawless seizure of persons n the name of mental health for political reasons our associate organizations are fought ceaselessly by those who seek domination of this country through mental treatment you are safe so long as we live place these well so that visitors know exactly what you stand for the whole of your activity will be aligned to this purpose and you will progress to the degree that as group you agree with and follow it this is what dianetics is for your power in the society will be judged by your ability to make good this purpose the technology of dianetics is refined to the point that applied exactly as your auditors are taught and hacked up by scientology review you cannot fail you will succeed 100s your purpose takes you right into the public you will be contacting many people the product that your group will deliver is one that has been searched for since time immemorial it is your task to deliver that product exactly and flawlessly within the society there is other group which has the technology to do what your group will be engaged in you will be in competition with one in applying standard dianetics you will work in cooperation with medical doctors and in some cases they are essential it is important that working understanding be established between the dianetic counseling group and local medical doctor or clinic this is covered fully in later paper the position of the group is to be operating harmoniously within the society providing product which is needed and wanted by that society and where necessary in liaison with doctor or clinic backed up by the local hubbard scientology organization the group will play valuable role wo ken delderfield cs6 and flag public officer lrhkdrweicden

boots they were little boots little kids boots there wasnt anything to them and whatd you do you just threw some space out that big thats all you narrowed the space down to the universe of one man and you found out he was highly representative man and then you took look the boots were very wearable theyre very simple boots but what do you know these boots have catch to them they arent just one mans boots they were every mans boots and because i assayed to take few steps in them and square them around and find out where the road was and what leather they were made out of didnt absolve single individual who cared to benefit from those boots from wearing them and that is the grimmest joke ol all person has to come up the scale so that he can take responsibility for himself and all of his fellows and the whole cockeyed condemned universe before he can walk down that road out isnt that fascinating he cant even run his engram bank unless he says its my business and i mean to make it so isnt that interesting if on the other hand hes down the tone scale he knows all knowledge is inhibited he knows all things are inhibited he knows everything is scarce he knows death is inevitable he knows all these things he knows he has space he knows that life is an object not an animate glorious thing and as long as he knows that then he will know more actually at that level one knows practically nothing the bank will sit there and some of the little incidents in it might be quite bright and it might be interesting but boy is it of narrow scope itll be little tiny bank those real big ridges standing out there have to he handled by big guy if you re going to handle them all the way now we have the modus operandi of how you get to be big guy there isnt any gimmick factor whereby you all of sudden discover you have to make up your mind to be self determinedyou could take preclear by the nape of his neck and hold him up there and bang his head against the wall with our techniques and get result if you start him on that line youd never have to explain thing to him hed finally wind up somewhere but hed never walk out of this universe with your help hell only walk out of this nniverse if you permit him to recover enough force so that he can have responsibility for whats going on there isnt any hidden gimmick there isnt anything else he has to think there isnt anything he has to believe in really to amount to anything to go this way you could boot him up this line quite artificially but what youre really doing is taking him and putting these boots on him he has to he fitted with these boots and these boots are called responsibility the ability to handle force and take the responsibility for the use of it the ability to create and handle space of any dimension and take the responsibility for handling it hes got to be able to take responsibility for all enforcement and all desire way up the line and all space before hell walk any place unfortunately for your sakes this isnt fiction i wish it were if it were just pleasant afternoon we could all go on being slaves but unfortunately it doesnt happen to be fiction as the chair of physics in one university said the diabolic accuracy of these predictions will be borne out by the most exacting research and investigation our techniques are diabolical because they take slaves away from those who would have slaves they set men free theyll even set men free who dont want to be free at all i think that is the grimmest jest when it comes to any of these techniques they all add up to something ive talked to you about before time and time again freedom freedom is lots of space and the ability to use it thats all freedom is its exactly what it says it is it is the most idiotically literal thing imaginable freedom lots of space and thc ability to use it complete freedom is above the level of not even needing space and not even having to agree that is above the level of freedom that is cause itself you never saw cause itself ever being worried prime cause has nothing which could enslave it except itself just like theres really nobody ever going to really pick up this preclear and carry him out of this universe nohodys ever going to do that he can have his boots put on but hell still have that last mile he has to walk himself that means that hell have to take responsibility for what he does and his force not only for that but everything that goes on around him we find out that there is bigness which has to grow in the person and if you dont see that bigness growing hes not on his way out the difference between the preclear that has to be chained down to have the boots put on him and is i never wanted to be slave and i never had to be thats all i never agreed
