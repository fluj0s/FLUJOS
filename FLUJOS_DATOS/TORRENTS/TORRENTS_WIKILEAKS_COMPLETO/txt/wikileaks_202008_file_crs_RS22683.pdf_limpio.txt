significant changes to the united states bankruptcy code3 many changes were intended to remedy perceived abuses of the bankruptcy system several of bapcpas provisions regulate communications of the newly created category of debt relief agencies by both mandating certain disclosures and restricting the content of certain forms of advice these communication provisions are found in sections 526 527 and 528 of the bankruptcy code some examples of these provisions are prohibiting advice to incur debt in contemplation of bankruptcy 526 requiring disclosures of the types of services available from credit counseling agencies 527 and requiring advertising to include the statement indicating that the advertiser is debt relief agency and helps people file for bankruptcy relief 528 the statute neither explicitly includes nor explicitly excludes attorneys from the category of debt relief agencies if attorneys are considered debt relief agencies they would be subject to bapcpas communication provisions these prov isions would both restrict and compel attorneys speech the resulting question is to what extent does the constitution permit the government to regulate attorneys speech critics challenge the communication provisions as unconstitutional arguing that they have chilling effect on attorney speech 4 in addition they claim that these provisions impede the ability of attorneys to best protect their clients5 and increase confusion among those receiving attorneys advice6 this controversy involves tensions that were evident during bapcpas enactment the legislative history indicates that some believed that the communication provisions were necessary to prevent debtors from taking advantage of loopholes in the bankruptcy system and to reduce the number of unnecessary filings 7 banks and other lenders who supported the adoption of the communication provisions contended that these provisions were necessary to eliminate bankruptcy mills which they argued allowed bankruptcy attorneys to handle their clients cases without having sufficient attorneyclient contact8 some opponents of the provisions worried that their burdensome 1 the original report dated june 27

considered the constitutionality of bapcpas communication provisions however the issue has been presented to several district courts survey of these cases reveals that district courts have been increasingly willing to find that one or more of the communication provisions violate the first amendment right to freedom of speech attorney plaintiffs have argued that they are not included in the definition of debt relief agencies which would mean that the communication provisions would not apply to them at all alternatively they have argued that if they are considered debt relief agencies the

of debt relief agency and the communication provisions imposed on those agencies whether attorney plaintiffs have suffered sufficiently concrete injury to have standing to bring their claims whether attorneys are included in the definition of debt relief agency whether the prohibition against advising an assisted person10 to incur additional debt in contemplation of filing for bankruptcy violates

bapcpa defines the term debt relief agency as any person who provides bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person for payment or who is bankruptcy petition preparer14 this definition contains certain exceptions none of which expressly includes attorneys15 on october 17 2005 the date that bapcpa became effective16 the bankruptcy court for the southern district of georgia on its own limited motion considered whether the members of the bar of this court are debt relief agencies17 the court concluded that they were not it then found that the bankruptcy codes provisions regu lating those agencies did not apply so long as the activities of the admitted attorneys fall within the scope of the practice of law and do not constitute separate commercial enterprise18 two other courts have also determined that attorneys do not fall within the bapcpa s definition of debt relief agency19 other courts however have found that attorneys are included in the definition of debt relief agencies and therefore would be subject to the communications provisions that are not unconstitutional20 13 olsen v gonzale z 350 br 906 913915 dor 2006 reconsidered adhering to original decision 368 br 886 d or

bapcpa prohibits debt relief agency from advisi ng assisted persons either to incur additional debt in contemplation of filing for bankruptcy or to pay an attorney or bankruptcy petition preparer fees in exchange for bankruptcy services21 attorney plaintiffs have had success in challenging the constitutionality of this provision four us district courts have held that the provision violates the first amendments guarantee of freedom of speech 22 these courts all concluded that the provision is too broad in scope because it restricts more speech than is necessary to prevent debtors from being able to manipulate the system therefore the courts have reasoned this restriction prevents attorneys from being able to best protect their clients advising client to incur additional debt is not illegal so long as there is intent to avoid repaying the debt23 there may be legitimate nonabusive reasons to counsel client to incur additional debt client might be able to at least postpone and possibly avoid bankruptcy by refinancing mortgage at lower rate purchasing car with financing might be necessary to enable client to continue to commute to job24 other legitimate reasons to incur additional debt include acquiring secured loan or borrowing from family or friends to hire an attorney or pay the filing fee so as to begin the bankruptcy process and benefit from the protection of the automatic stay provisions25 at least one court has also argued that the restriction could also be found unconstitutional because it is underinclusive non profit organizations are excluded from the definition of debt relief agency and may therefore freely advise debtors to incur more debt in contemplation of bankruptcy26

bankruptcy and information on how to value assets complete bankruptcy schedules and determine what property is exempt27 each of the two courts to have considered the question have found that the disclosure requirements in section 527 pass constitutional muster28 both courts reasoned that subjecting attorneys to regulation of their professional activities is justified by the governments significant interest in ensuring that debtor clients are adequately informed 29 the courts applied intermediate scrutiny analysis 1 is there substantial government interest 2 does the legislation advance that interest 3 is the restriction reasonable in proportion to the interests served intermediate scrutiny is generally applied to restrictions on commercial speech content neutral speech and where there is an incidental burden on expression some in the legal community question whether it was appropriate to apply intermediate scrutiny when analyzing the constitutionality of requiring the disclosures instead they would argue that strict scrutiny should have been used since the speech was mandated and not content neutral30 under strict scrutiny analysis the government interest must be compelling rather than significant and the statute must be narrowly tailored to advance that compelling interest requiring long list of lawyer disclosures cannot be reconciled with the first amendment this provision is unlikely to survive the strict scrutiny applicable to mandated speech 31

challenges as the other communication provisions one district court s found 528 to stand up under fourpronged intermediate scrutiny analysis35 however another court applying the same test held that the section failed constitutional scrutiny as applied to attorneys36 it found that the provision both failed to advance the governments stat ed interest and was not narrowly drawn37
