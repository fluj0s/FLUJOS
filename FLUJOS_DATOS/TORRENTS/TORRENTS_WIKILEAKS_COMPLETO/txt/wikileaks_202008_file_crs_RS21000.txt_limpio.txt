provisions of the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 gregg esenwein specialist in public finance government and finance division summary the economic growth and tax relief

points for joint returns by 3000 with the increase phased in over 7year period starting in calendar year 2002 the joint committee on taxation estimates that the combined cost of all of the marriage penalty relief provisions will be 63 billion over the fiscal year period 2002 through 2011 all of the egtrra tax cuts including the marriage tax relief provisions are scheduled to expire at the end of calendar year 2010 in the 107th congress the house passed several bills that would have extended the egtrra tax cuts beyond 2010 the senate however did not adopt these bills it is likely that the 108th congress will revisit the issue of making the egtrra tax cuts permanent additionally in response to continued sluggish economic performance president bush unveiled new tax stimulus plan in early january 2003 as part of his stimulus plan president bush has proposed accelerating the phasein of some of the egtrra tax cut provisions the presidents proposal includes accelerating the increase in the standard deduction for joint returns and the increase in the width of the 15 tax bracket for joint returns the treasury department estimates that the 10year revenue cost of these two changes would be 58 billion this report will be updated as legislation action warrants background congressional research service the library of congress crs2 defining the married couple as single tax unit under the federal individual income tax tends to violate the goal of marriage neutrality marriage neutrality means that the tax system should not influence the choice of individuals with regard to their marital status however under the current federal income tax system some married couples pay more income tax than they would as two unmarried singles marriage tax penalty while other married couples pay less income tax than they would as two unmarried singles marriage tax bonus the three most important structural features affecting the marriage neutrality of the income tax are the earned income tax credit eic the standard deduction and the tax rate schedules under the current income tax system single individuals heads of households and married couples are subject to different standard deductions and tax rate schedules the eic amounts and phaseout ranges also vary according to filing status these differences give rise to structural marriage tax penalties and bonuses because of these asymmetries when the income of one spouse is added to the income of the other spouse married couple might find themselves paying either more federal income tax marriage penalty or less tax marriage bonus than they would by filing as two singles two singles or some combination of singles and heads of households contemplating marriage might find that their federal income tax liability increases marriage tax penalty or decreases marriage tax bonus by filing joint return in general the division of income or income split of the two individuals determines whether they will have marriage tax bonus or penalty the largest marriage tax bonuses occur when one spouse earns 100 of the income the more evenly divided the income the more likely married couple will experience marriage tax penalty the largest tax penalties occur where the income is evenly divided between the two spouses 5050 income split for example consider the case of two married couples where each couple has 60000 of income one couple is oneearner household where one spouse earns all the income while the other couple is twoearner household where each spouse earns 30000 under the federal income tax rate structure in effect in 2001 the oneearner couple has marriage tax bonus of 4326 that is they pay 4326 less filing joint return than they would if they filed as two single individuals while the twoearner couple has marriage tax penalty of 406 that is they pay 406 more filing joint return then they would if they filed as two single individuals eliminating marriage tax penalties and bonuses and creating marriage neutral income tax are elusive equity goals marriage neutrality conflicts with two other concepts of equity progressivity and equal taxation of couples with equal incomes regardless of how these three concepts of equity are juggled an income tax can achieve any two of these goals but cannot under current definitions simultaneously achieve all three crs3 over time congress has switched emphasis among these three equity goals of marriage neutrality progressivity and equal taxation of couples with equal incomes1 the changes in the 2001 act which are described below will provide tax reduction to all married couples filing joint return regardless of whether or not they currently incur marriage tax penalty married couples who currently experience marriage tax bonus they pay less filing joint return than they would filing two single returns will see their bonus increase married couples who currently experience marriage tax penalty will see their marriage tax penalty reduced or eliminated the 2001
