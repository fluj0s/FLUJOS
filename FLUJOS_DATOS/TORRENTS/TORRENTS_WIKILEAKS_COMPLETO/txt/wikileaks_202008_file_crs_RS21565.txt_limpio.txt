since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 the bush administration and congress have placed renewed emphasis on us public diplomacy efforts in the middle east these efforts have culminated in the establishment of number of programs and policy initiatives designed to promote us values and interests foster communication with young people and encourage socioeconomic reform in the arab world in march 2002 the broadcasting board of governors bbg1 launched radio sawa an arabic 1 the bbg is quasiindependent entity responsible for all us government and government sponsored nonmilitary international broadcasting congressional research service the library of congress crs2 language radio station that combines western and arab popular music with news broadcasts and specialized programming the state department also implemented the shared values program 15 million television advertising campaign that promoted positive images of muslim life in america in december 2002 secretary of state colin powell announced the formation of the middle east partnership initiative mepi to fund civil society projects that foster political economic and educational development in the arab world2 it is within this context that policymakers have formulated further step in the development of public diplomacy in the region the middle east television network metn or alhurra arabic for the free one members of congress from both parties together with administration officials and private industry leaders believe that alhurra will enable the united states to get its message across to millions of people in the middle east where one third of all households with television reception have either cable or satellite tv3 advocates of alhurra argue that the us government needs to compete in the arab television market with regionally based broadcasters like aljazeera the controversial 24hour arab news network based in qatar4 they stress the need for the united states to control the distribution of its own media without having to rely on httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21565 others for example in egypt radio sawas signal can only be picked up sporadically on an am radio frequency out of cyprus due to the egyptian governments refusal to allow sawa to be broadcast locally over stronger fm signal5 the experience of radio sawa although radio and television are different media supporters of ussponsored arabic television have highlighted the success of radio sawa in attracting listeners across the middle east according to officials at the bbg sawa blends popular western and arab music to attract younger listeners to its news broadcasts and specialinterest shows such as sawa chat free zone and ask the world now6 the bbgs own research has concluded that this strategy has been successful in penetrating the 17 to 28yearold demographic group in places likes amman jordan and in morocco7 bbg officials point out that prior to the establishment of radio sawa only 2 of arab listeners tuned in to 2 for more information on the middle east partnership initiative see crs report rs21457 the middle east partnership initiative an overview 3 vying for eyes ears of iraq angeles

focused on us policy in the middle east 7 according to survey research from acnielson 73 of all persons 15 and older in casablanca and rabat morocco tuned to radio sawa every week more than any other station see high radio sawa ratings survey bbc monitoring media april 5 2004 crs3 the voice of americas voa arabic broadcasts8 survey in amman jordan revealed that 42 of young people who listen to popular music said that sawa is the station they listened to most9 however according to arab media analyst mamoun fandy my own observations are based on really sort of long conversations with these age groups in two countries saudi arabia and kuwait and my feeling was i came out with the conclusion that people were listening to radio sawa in terms of music but in terms of political programming they go somewhere else10 on october 13 2004 the washington post reported that draft report prepared by the state departments inspector general criticizes radio sawa for having focused too much on gaining audience share and not enough time on presenting discussions of us policies11 bbg officials have defended the approach of radio sawa noting that combination of music and news is the best way to reach its target audience alhurra programming alhurra began broadcasting in february 2004 it resembles typical american commercial network but with more time devoted to news programming this format is httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21565 similar to existing arab satellite variety channels though it differs from the allnews format of aljazeera alhurra which is based in springfield virginia features the usual array of network programming morning talk shows childrens education and entertainment programming womens shows soap operas sitcoms movies and nightly news shows as alhurra is still in its startup phase it relies more heavily on re broadcasting existing american shows and movies with arabic subtitles although hurra has foreign bureaus of its own it partners with associated press television news aptn which provides facilities for alhurras foreign correspondents based in the middle east12 bbg officials have been adamant in insisting that alhurra will not show inflammatory pictures of violence in troubled areas in the region or use inflammatory language13 reflecting similar policy radio sawas editors use the descriptive term of suicide bomber rather than the religious term of martyr to describe suicide terrorist this policy differs sharply from the strategy of aljazeera which is well known for airing leadin segments to news reports which often feature montages of violence in the west 8 interview with joan mower director of communications broadcasting board of governors june 18 2003 9 reaching arabs via airwaves diplomacy angeles times aug 26 2002 10 interview

president july 1 2004 media analysts note that in the arab market live coverage of events in iraq the west bank and gaza and elsewhere is one of the primary ways of drawing large numbers of viewers jazeeras credibility with many arab viewers is largely based on its ability to have its reporters on scene particularly in war zones 13 interview with joan mower director of communications broadcasting board of governors june 18 2003 crs4 bank and gaza strip afghanistan or iraq these short snippets contain flashes of provocative pictures usually of human suffering accompanied by dramatic background music since its inception alhurras programming has received mixed reviews some observers have praised its roundtable discussion programs such as all directions for featuring mix of arab and us political analysts who have raised numerous questions regarding the us role in iraq domestic arab politics in egypt lebanon and syria and the consequences of israels gaza withdrawal plan alhurra also has had extensive coverage of the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal the recent killings of hamas leaders and the preliminary deposition of former iraqi leader saddam hussein there is also evidence that viewers enjoy alhurras lifestyle and documentary shows on the other hand some arabs have been put off by alhurras symbolism in its promotional spots which show scenes of wild horses running free and eyelids slowly opening while accompanying messages encourage viewers to decide for themselves some arab critics believe the name alhurra the free one is patronizing as it implies that arab viewers have alternative but to watch statecontrolled television according to shibley telhami an expert on arab media at the brookings institution survey research from httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21565 various arab countries indicates that arabs dont consider alhurra first choice for news and that only 38 picked it as second choice14 alhurra the policy debate overview like other tools of public diplomacy alhurra has supporters and detractors essentially the debate over the ability of alhurra to improve the image of the united states in the arab world is microcosm of much larger debate over public diplomacy tactics in the middle east some officials want to direct us activity toward arab young people other observers want more open discussions with broader arab audiences and elites over us policies some commentators want nongovernmental organizations to carry the torch of public diplomacy in the region lastly some commentators dismiss public diplomacy efforts entirely so long as us policies remain deeply unpopular in the region according to nihad awad executive director for the council on americanislamic relations the problem isnt what you say in the news it is the position that the united states has taken in the palestinian issue15 these critics believe that arabs dont need to be sold on the positive aspects of us society furthermore they maintain that aljazeera is popular precisely because it is perceived as being more independent even though it is financed mostly by the qatari government and that alhurra would be discredited in the region for its ties to the us government supporters of alhurra alhurras supporters often assert that the indigenous arab media will neither explain nor analyze us policies in the region favorably or even objectively many us policymakers deeply distrust staterun arab media organizations and have even less confidence in the ability of allnews networks such as aljazeera to deliver fair and accurate reporting of us involvement in middle eastern affairs hurras supporters feel emboldened by perceived success of both past and existing us 14 voa changes prompt staffer protests usa today july 12 2004 15 radio mogul heads us arabic tv network wall street journal mar 26 2003 crs5 broadcasting activities in the middle east and elsewhere some officials at the bbg have expressed pride in the ability of radio sawa to reach mass audience and feel that television network would only build on this success according to pattiz we thought by creating musicdriven format that we could attract the largest possible audience to what was also our public diplomacy mission the greatest message in the world doesnt mean lot if one is listening furthermore to those who accuse government sponsored entities such as radio sawa of not having editorial independence the bbg stated that it is committed to being accurate and objective in its newscasts 16 the bbg believes that its mission is to serve as firewall to protect the professional independence and integrity of its broadcasters substance and style issues for those contesting the direction and format of alhurra but not international broadcasting itself there is fear that alhurra will overemphasize style over substance critics point to radio sawa as an example of us sponsored endeavor that inundates listeners with popular music while skirting discussion of the issues that matter most to us policymakers iraq the war on terrorism and the israelipalestinian peace process in response to us officials arguments that several of radio sawas daily shows devote time to more newsworthy topics observers counter by httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21565 noting that most of radio sawas discussion programs are focused more on social and cultural issues relating to young people such as marriage and westernization than on controversial discussions of us policies critics believe that alhurra would be more effective if it tried to foster an honest dialogue with arab audiences over current events even in cases where us perceptions differ from arab attitudes rather than avoiding the tough issues these pundits believe that in order for alhurra to have an effective public diplomacy strategy it must try to win the battle for ideas in the middle east as an alternative to alhurra robert satloff middle east expert at the washington institute for near east policy suggests that it would be much cheaper to offer tax incentives to us broadcasters to perform the service of dubbing and then duplicating their news in arabic the fact that cnn and fox news are nongovernmental enterprises ensures far greater credibility than what is proposed for alhurra17 some opponents of alhurra would prefer policymakers to adopt alternative approaches to confronting the arab media according to media analyst mamoun fandy you need to change the software to change the arab minds and you dont change them by television because television coming from america also will be seen differently because these people are already exposed to american television18 instead of focusing on broadcasting some experts believe that the best public diplomacy tool at the united states disposal is its education system and governing institutions which many in the region who have been exposed to us universities consider model varying survey results according to an acnielsen survey released by the bbg in october 2004 weekly viewing rates for hurra among adults with satellite 16 air wars the battle for arabic television and radio audiences rand review
