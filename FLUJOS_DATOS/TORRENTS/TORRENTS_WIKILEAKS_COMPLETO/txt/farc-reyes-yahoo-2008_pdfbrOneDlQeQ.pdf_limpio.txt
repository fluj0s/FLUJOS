our best to carry out the fighting tasks of our beloved party and make significant allround advances in the philippine revolution in the coming year the arroyo regime especially the fake president and her top military henchmen keep on bragging that they can destroy or cause the strategic defeat of the cpp the new peoples army and all other revolutionary forces before 2010 said the cppcc instead they are growing in strength and advancing because of the ever worsening crisis of the world capitalist system and the domestic ruling system the arroyo regimes detested policies of national betrayal class exploitation corruption and state terrorism and the ceaseless ideological political and organizational work of the party the cppcc directed the new peoples army npa to accelerate tactical offensives against the enemy in order to seize more weapons for building more units of the peoples army and for strengthening the various levels of command from the guerrilla front to the provincial and regional commands and further on to the national operational command we must be able to annihilate more units of the enemy forces in order to gain strength and experience forcpp gears up for 40th founding anniversary cpp information bureau destroying even more of these until we can seize nationwide political power it anticipates the armed revolutionary movement to grow in strength and be in position to deliver more deadly blows to the lameduck regime amidst the far worsened crisis of the ruling system the cpp leadership foresees the further worsening of the political crisis rocking the arroyo regime the socioeconomic crisis under the arroyo regime is worsening rapidly and generating social unrest the broad masses are reeling from the pressures of the crisis and the rising rates of exploitationthe filipino people have all the reason to carry out the newdemocratic revolution through protracted peoples war they can avail themselves of the crisis conditions of the ruling system for building their revolutionary strength and advancing from one stage of the revolutionary struggle to another the cppcc explained it predicted the further disintegration of the arroyo regime as conflict of business and political interests is growing between the closest relatives and cronies of the fake president on the one hand and some of her allies within the ruling coalition of kampi lakasnucd and nationalist peoples coalition on the other hand photo from wwwcasareales and amadeoblogcomunicef exposes arroyos dirty war page 3 german police attack turkish migrant workers page 7 by ed ladera exhibiting shocking ignorance of the widely condemned human rights record of the arroyo government spanish king juan carlos i grievously offended countless human rights victims and their families by heaping praise and honors on mrs gloria arroyo during her visit to spain in early december 2007 the spanish king ignored or was apparently ignorant of the report of special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings prof philip alston which was already widely circulated and commented on long before the arroyo visit to spain the alston report declared that the arroyo regimes counterinsurgency program was the major reason for the sharp rise in cases of extrajudicial killings enforced disappearances and other gross human rights violations in the philippines after his visit to the philippines in february

and enlisted personnel are contemptuous of the arroyo regime and the proarroyo officers at the top of the chain of command the cppcc cited the trillanes takeover of the manila peninsula hotel last november 29 as praiseworthy for denouncing the crimes of the arroyo regime it however did not take into account the peoples clamor for change under the principle of civilian supremacy and the necessary sequence of mass mobilization and military withdrawal of support from the regime cpp 40th from page 1 col 3 in this issue liberaliberaliberaliberalibera tiontiontiontiontion international

response of the arroyo regime to the manila peninsula standoff shows that it is prepared to go into bloodbath in order to keep itself in power said the cppcc it is therefore necessary for the broad range of opposition forces to engage in mass mobilizations that can discourage the use of armed force by the regime as in the overthrow of marcos and estrada in 1986 and 2001 the cppcc said that the arroyo regime has even made it easier for the npa in rural areas by deploying more troops in the national capital region and other urban areas the npa will face less obstacles in launching tactical offensives in the countryside the arroyo regime is extremely isolated it is ripe for ouster by the broad masses of the people and broad united front of anti arroyo forces said the cppcc it pointed out that the toiling masses and the middle social strata are the most determined in ousting arroyo as great deal of vacillation is setting in among the anti arroyo reactionary parties because some of their leaders have started to set their sights on the 2010 elections if the arroyo regime can manage to stay in power up to 2010 however said the cpp cc it will only succeed in pushing the people to rely increasingly on peoples war for changing the entire ruling system the national democratic front of the philippines ndfp is an alliance of revolutionary organizations with roots in the various sectors and regions of the philippines its goal is to build society that enjoys national sovereignty genuine democracy social justice progress and peace it seeks to unite with all forces willing to

and other human rights violations which are convincingly attributed to them in his final report prof alston declared that the interagency legal action group ialag headed by national security adviser norberto gonzales and established by decree of mrs arroyo should be dissolved for its notorious role in perpetrating the numerous extrajudicial killings human rights watchdog alliance for the advancement of peoples rights karapatan has documented almost 900 such murders since the start of the arroyo regime in 2001 mainly directed against those opposing her regimes policies close to 200 involuntary disappearances and hundreds more of frustrated extrajudicial killings have been documented by karapatan the regimes counter insurgency program oplan bantay laya i and ii has caused the evacuation and economic displacement of more than million people in the rural and urban areas throughout the country the spanish king praised mrs arroyo for being at the forefront of liberties and the defense of human rights with the abolition of the death penalty gesture which gave us satisfaction and was applauded by the international community he even added that the philippines was opening the way to democracy in asia the royal university of alcala also awarded mrs arroyo with the medal of gold the spanish king has ignored not only the alston report he disregarded as well the reports of amnesty international and human rights watch in 2007 the verdict of the permanent peoples tribunal second session on the philippines of 25 march2007 and the stinging condemnation by dr sam kobia the general secretary of the world council of church of the gross human rights violations perpetrated by the arroyo regime and its military police and paramilitary forces against the filipino people the praise and honor given to mrs arroyo by the spanish king also goes against the view of the filipino people according to the latest surveys filipinos consider mrs arroyo as the most corrupt president in philippine history even worse than the dictator ferdinand marcos her pro imperialist and ultrareactionary policies subserviently following us president george w bushs war on terror havecaused intolerable misery and suffering on the filipino people asked for comment luis g jalandoni chief peace negotiator of the national democratic front of the philippines expressed confidence that the

the effects of armed conflict and violence reacting to the unicef report cpp spokesperson gregorio rosal welcomed the report and said in statement in the afps vicious and heartless war againstthe people especially in peasant communities there is hardly any discrimination between armed guerrillas and unarmed civilians worse in its desperation to suppress whole communities engaged in agrarian struggles and suspected of supporting the armed revolution the fascist armed forces do not hesitate to direct their armed might and terror against children women and the elderly the cpp spokesperson also categorically dismissed afp claims about the existence of child warriors in the new peoples army npa he stressed that applicants and recruits have to be at least 18 years old ruling strictly followed among the ranks inall units of the npa he condemned the afp for recently parading before the mass media two twelve year old children from central luzon as alleged npa child warriors and demanded that the afp immediately release the two victimized children to their families he also urged independent human rights and childrens welfare organizations to aid the two children in their ordeal similarly fidel v agcaoili chairperson of the national democratic front of the philippines ndfp monitoring committee urged the office of the special representative of the secretary general on children affected by armed conflict srsgcaac in new york to investigate cases of abduction and illegal arrests of children and minors perpetrated by the arroyo regime in letter addressed to the office

homefront cpp information bureau on the ocassion of the 39th anniversary of its reestablishment the communist party of the philippines cpp said the new peoples army npa achieved significant military victories the past year portending more and bigger successes in response to the partys anniversary call to accelerate advances in 2008 based on our summary of still very partial reports received from the field clearly the revolutionary forces have gained significant victories in waging guerrilla warfare foremost is the defeat of the military campaigns launched by the armed forces of the philippines afp this year to date said cpp spokesperson gregorio ka roger rosal citing reports published in ang bayan the cpps news organ rosal said the npa was able to launch at least 95 big and small tactical offensives nationwide this year there are at least 200 more unreported tactical offensives launched by the npa especially in mindanao in these military initiatives the npa was able to seize at least 327 weapons consisting mostly high powered rifles tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition and various military and communication equipment these weapons are enough to arm at least three new companies of red fighters rosal said we still have to account for more victories in the tactical offensives of the npa in many guerilla fronts especially in mindanao where there have been hundreds of successful npa tactical offensives the last three years 400 of which were launched in 2006 whereby government armed forces suffered 330 casualties and lost 300 weapons to the npa among the significant npa victories this year rosal particularly cited the raid at the davao penal colony on april 7 that yielded 108 assorted firearms without the npa firing single shot he also cited the downing of philippine air force huey helicopter last december 14 by the npa in tanay rizal which killed four soldiers and wounded nine others at least 204 government military police and paramilitary forces were killed and more than 149 other enemy forces were wounded in these armed encounters nine government soldiers and cafgu elements were also captured in the field held asprisonersofwar and subsequently released on humanitarian grounds added rosal revolutionary punishment was also meted out against certain elements of afp directed death squads that are behind the extra judicial killings masterminded by arroyos national security officials said rosal these measures were carried out by the npa after painstaking investigations and judicious observance of due process said rosal most significant the npa was able to defeat divisionlevel brigadesize military campaigns of suppression launched in several guerrilla fronts since january in the ilocoscordillera region the attacking afp troops were the ones who suffered casualties numbering at least 33 from january to april in the northeast mindanao region the 58th ib lost the equivalent of company due to casualties and also due to demoralized troops that went on awol revealed rosal morale has been noticeably very low among junior officers and rank and file soldiers of the afp principally because they could not defeat an npa that undeniably enjoys deep and widespread support among the peasant masses and other advantages such as the element of surprise mastery of terrain and others rosal pointed out moreover the afp is badly demoralized because of the corruption fascism and terrorism of the arroyo regime and its top military and security officials rosal laughed off claims made recently by philippine army chief lt gen alexander yano that the afp can put an end to the revolutionary movement in 39 weeks alluding to the 39th anniversary of the cpp celebrated on 26 december rosal challenged general yano to surrender all his medals and accept dishonarable discharge by october 2008 as he will certainly be proven wrong when his 39 week timetable expireshow can the deeply factionalized demoralized and inutile government armed forces expect to defeat solid highly spirited and battlecapable adversary in the npa asked rosal how can the fascist reactionaries expect to defeat the npa when they are waging brutal and barbaric war that only incites more and more people to hate the afp and the regime that it serves with the worsening poverty oppression and sufferings the masses of the people have been going through under the rotten puppet regime more and more of them are taking up arms and joining the npa the afp could not even concentrate the bulk of its fighting force on more than 10 of all npa guerrilla fronts they are desperately stepping up the recruitment of paramilitary forces but with decreasing successes and increasing misgivings especially as many cafgu members are reportedly being suspected of supporting the npa said rosal he cited the incident where five cafgu elements were massacred on june 28 by elements of the 29th ib in nieves agusan sur after they were accused of assisting the npa in the raid of the 23rd ib detachment the day before the new peoples army aims to achieve bigger victories in the coming year in line with the cpp leaderships call to accelerate advances said rosal we anticipate that the npa will be able to launch bigger and more frequent tactical offensives starting the first quarter of 2008 all units of the npa are challenged to surpass all victories of the past years said rosal ang bayan npa score significant victories in 2007 more and bigger victories eyed in 20085november december 2007by ed ladera an official mission from the national
