dismissal and closure authority washington dc executive branchvulnerability assessment of federal facilities noted that implementation of any standards not already in place w ould require additional funding53 according to this study it would cost nearly 25 million new construction to 3 million retrofit to provide the necessary security for 17 story multiagency level iv54 building with 380000 total square feet and more than 450 employees55 as for the basic security charge levied by gsa there appears to be discrepancy between actual costs and what gsa is allowed to charge pr ior to september 11 2001 actual costs were slightly more than 030 per square foot but the basic security charge in fy2002 was 18 per square foot the basic secu rity charge was increased to 24 for fy200356 as of this writing all funding is frozen at fy 2002 levels and funding for fy2003 is uncertain for agencies that own their own buildin gs or have obtained security waivers from gsa or whose buildings are exempt ed by statute from gsa control funding for security and emergency preparedness is their responsibility it is not known whether these agencies receive or allocate funds suffi cient to meet their security requirements federal emergency decision and notification protocol as reported in the news media fede ral emergency decision and notification protocol took effect in may 2002 it will be used in the event of widespread attack or the threat of an impending biological chemical or radiol ogical attack the protocol identified who ie fema gsa and opm determines when to dismiss employees and how that determination will be communicated and discussed the role of the media in any notification57 to date the only confir mation of the existence of the protocol may be found in the congressi onal testimony of sc ott hatch director office of communication offi ce of personnel management58 opm has not yet provided any other information about the protocol in the absence of additional information or explanation seve ral questions re main unanswered the november 12 2002 opm memorandum on dismissal procedures does not refer to the pr otocol what is the relationshiphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31739crs15 if any between the protocol and the november 12 2002 opm memorandum on dismissal nd closure procedures is the scope of the protocol the same as the memorandums all executive agencies inside the beltway excluding the us postal service or different how would the legislative branch and federal court activities relate to the protocol what are the extent and progress of federal executive boards efforts to develop similar protocols does the protocol cover variet of leave options for federal employees akin to the content of the november 12 2002 opm memorandum does the protocol apply only to impending or actual attacks or would it also apply in the event of citywide emergency caused by for example inclement w eather eg snowstorm how will the protocol change as result of the realignment of fps and fema under the departme nt of homeland security status of agency preparedness agency autonomy and the decentralization of emergency preparedness functions combine to make it difficult to gauge the extent of preparedness among federal agencies establishment of the interagency security committee was an effort to address this challenge and ot her related issues but so far the isc has compiled mixed record the vulnerability assessment of federal facilities was another initiative aimed at among other things evaluating how well agencies are prepared for disasters however this report was snapshot of agency preparedness apparently there is ongoing gove rnmentwide effort to assess agency preparedness ideally information on the status of ag ency preparedness would be compiled on an ongoing basis and would be available be fore an emergency occurs this sequence would allow an agency head and emerge ncy team personnel to address areas that need improvement information gathered after an incident occurs also may be useful information and data sometimes referred to as lessons learned can be used to improve program including an emer gency preparedness program where an incident has occurred potentially useful tool is the afteraction report which would document how an ag ency responded what worked well and what needs to be improved the applicable portion of the code of federal regulations does not require agencies to produ ce an afteraction report although an agency may decide on its own to review and examine its performance during an incident or emergency for example the environmental protection agency epahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31739crs16 59 us congress house of representatives national constructi on safety team act 107th cong 2nd sess h rept 107530 was hington gpo 2002 p 20issued lessons learned in the ftermath of september 11 2001 dated february 1 2002 more formal investigation is requi red by the national construction safety team act pl 107231 hr 4687 signed by president george w bush on october 1 2002 pl 107231 requires the na tional institute of standards and technology nist to establish national construction safety teams for deployment after an event which causes building failure that resulted in substantial loss of life although the thrust of this law is study ing building failures that resulted in substantial loss of life or had the pot ential to and recomme nding improvements to building standards codes and practices it also calls for the evaluation of the technical aspects of evacu ation and emergency respons procedures hrept 107 530 elaborates on the function of teams the ultimate goal of investigations conducted under this act should be to develop detailed set of recommendations for any necessary improvements to building codes standards and practices as well as emergency response and evacuation procedures based on the findings of the investigation many of these procedures are based on an understanding of how people respond to disaster it is the committees view that when examining emergency response and evacuation procedures teams should ev aluate not only the effect that buildings design has on emergency response and evacuation procedures but also on human behavior59 information gleaned from construction team reports could prompt agencies to revise their emergency procedures or implement new safety features construction team reports also would provide insight into the technical aspects of an agencys preparation for emergencies homeland security legislation under the homeland security act re sponsibility for safeguarding buildings currently protected by gsa shifts to th homeland security department with the transfer of the federal protective service to dhs furthermore the language of pl 107296 section 1706a see who is respons ible for emergency preparedness suggests that the secretary of homeland security also acquires responsibility for federal buildings that currently are protected by agencies other than gsa this action would constitute significant expa nsion of the respons ibility that had been vested in gsa centraliza tion of responsibility for safe guarding buildings owned or occupied by the federal government does not necessarily mean that the protection function also will be centralized the secretary of homeland security could delegate to federal agencies the authority to provide security for their buildings facilities and installations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31739crs17 60 pl 107296 section 402policy questions policy questions and issues will likely arise as congress examines the status of emergency preparedness within the federal government and the implications of the homeland security act for agency emergency preparedness the homeland security act places the federal protective service within the directorate of border and transportation security bts the responsibilities of the under secretary for bts include preventing terrorists and instrument s of terrorism from entering the united states securing borders rritorial waters ports terminals waterways and air land and sea and transportation systems conducting immigrant enforcement functions establishing and administering rules for granting visas establishing immigration enforcement policies administering certain customs laws and conducting certain agricultu ral inspection functions60 how will the mission of fps mesh with the re sponsibilities of this directorate section 1706a of the homeland security act amends 40 usc 1315 and states the secretary of homeland security shall protect the buildings grounds and property that are owned occupied or secured by the federal government including any agency instrumentality or wholly owned or mixedownership corporation thereof and the persons on the property does the secretarys responsibility include for example the legislative branch the supreme court buildings occupied by agencies that have received delegations of authority for secu rity functions such as the white house and military installations will dhs need additional personnel and other resources to fulfill its responsibility under what conditions or circumstances might the dhs secretary allow an agency to provide its own security what model should be used to provide suitable combination of centralization of responsibility dhs and decentralization of execution agencies and buildings per pl 107296 section 422b1a the administrator of gsa retains the authority to collect rents and fees including fees collected for protective services the secretary of homeland security is not authorized to obligate amounts in the federal buildings fund and if any amounts are transferred by the administrator to the secretary out of rents and fees collected by the administrator they shall be used by the secretary solely for the protection of buildings or grounds ow ned or occupied by the federal government is this workable arrangement how should the fees collected for protective services be handled the transfer of fps and the responsibility for building security to dhs might provide anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31739crs18 61 pl 107296 sec 422aopportunity for examining security fees charged actual costs of security the alleged discrepancy between the two and whether and how to reconcile the differences the vulnerability assessment of federal facilities was issued in 1995 should another assessment be conducted with focus on terrorist threats and antiterrorism measures if so who should conduct second vulne rability assessment questions posed about the fe deral emergency decision and notification protocol may include is opm going to inform federal employees about the protocol how might fednp procedures change in light of the creati on of department of homeland security that includes fema and fps what should be the relationship between the interagency security committee and dhs gsa retains responsibility for th operation and maintenance of buildings and grounds owned or occupied by the federal government and under the jurisdic tion custody or control of the administrator61 how should gsa and dhs work out issues that involve both organizations for example the homeland security department may determine that to meet security requirements entrances to building must be modified in specific way but gsa may believe there are other options available for improving building entrances more than year has passed si nce the attacks of september 11 2001 is emergency preparedness still top priority among agencies are agencies reviewing and if necessary revising their emergency preparedness plans ar training programs provided for employees are emergency teams fully staffed do agencies have the necessary equipment and supplie s needed to help protect their employees do agencies have fficient funds to establish and maintain comprehensive effective emergency preparedness programs
