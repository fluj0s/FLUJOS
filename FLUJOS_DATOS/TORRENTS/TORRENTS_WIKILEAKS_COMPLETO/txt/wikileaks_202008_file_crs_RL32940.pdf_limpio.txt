the larger ones the conservation reserve and the environmental quality reserve programs have several subprograms some created in legislati on and others created by administrative action this report is limited to subprograms created by congress in addition to these 20 programs congress has authorized large number of other small in terms of spending levels discretionary programs usually with spec ific geographic focus examples from the 2002 farm bill include the great lakes and the delmarva peninsula and programs that have never been funded or implemented examples include the environmental easement program and the office of agriculture environmental qu ality these programs are not identified or presented in this report 2 this is an updated and revised edition of report originally written by jeffrey zinn specialist in natural resources policy res ources sciences and industry division and tadlock cowan agriculture conservation programs scorecard introduction the natural resources conservation rvice nrcs and the farm service agency fsa in the us department of agriculture usda currently administer 20 programs and subprograms that directly or indirec tly provide technical and financial assistance to produ cers and landowners who wish to practice conservation on agricultural lands1 with each recent farm bill enacted in 1985 1990 1996 and 2002 congress has responded to the potentia l adverse effects of agricultural activities on the physical landscape by increasing the number scope and overall funding of conservation progra ms reorganizing these programs to reduce the total number by combining similar programs is likely outcome in the forthcoming omnibus farm bill2 one result of the growth of conserva tion programs since 1985 is that these programs now attract atten tion from groups and individuals that had not necessarily had an interest in conser vation policy and may be c onfused about which problems and conditions each program addresses nd specific program characteristics and performance these people often ask ques tions about which programs may be used to respond to specific res ource problem why several prog rams appear to address single problem or which agency administers program usda provides technical and cost share assistance to attract interest and encourage participation pa rticipation in all usda conservation programs is voluntary these programs protect soil wa ter wildlife and other natural resources on privately owned agricultural lands to limit environmental impacts of production activities both on and off the farm while maintaining or imp roving production of food and fiber some of these programs center on improving or restoring resourceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32940crs2 that have been degraded while others create conditions to will limit degradation in the future of the 20 programs 16 ar administered by nrcs and four are administered by fsa however both agenci as well as other agencies mostly in usda work closely to implement many of them all of these programs with the excepti on of the conservation security program csp respond to existing resource problems some of them address these problems by paying landowners to retire land fro m production for multiyear periods using easements and longterm agreements many programs also have particular resource focus such as cropland wetlands or gr asslands or focus on specific physical condition such as floods or drought othe rs address problems by assisting producers in installing conservation practices that are designed to maintain or improve resource conditions in ways that enhance the nvironmental and economic performance of farm these practices may be structural eg constructing terraces or an animal waste management facility land management eg contour farming nutrient management or vegetative eg filter strips tree planting the csp is different because it pays producers to maintain conser vation practices that are already in place and provides financial incentives and t echnical assistance to expand on their conservation efforts the conservation reserve program crp and the environmental quality incentives program eqip each include s ubprograms enacted by congress as well as other initiatives based on administrative actions for the crp those subprograms are the conservation reserve enhancement program crep the farmable wetlands program and the new emergency forest ry conservation reserve program fsa began implementing this program in 2007 enacted in december 2005 in pl 109 148 it is not included in this report acreage enrolled in these subprograms is considered to be within the crp and th erefore counts against the current overall program enrollment cap of 392 million acres the three eqip subprograms address development of innovative approaches to conservation surface and groundwater conservation and water use ch allenges in the klamath river basin the innovative grants subprogram is funded using porti on of the overall annua l funding authorized for eqip while the water conservati on and klamath river subprograms have specified funding levels that ar treated as being in addition to eqip funding this report provides basic informati on primarily drawn from agency budget presentations and websites about each pr ogram using consistent format this information should help respond to basi c questions and resolve many common sources of confusion about the purposes of the program progra m participation and policy topics further information about all of these programs can be found on the nrcs website at httpwwwnrcsusdag ovprograms and on the conservation programs page of the fsa website at httpwwwfsa usdagov and in written responses to questions published later each ear in
