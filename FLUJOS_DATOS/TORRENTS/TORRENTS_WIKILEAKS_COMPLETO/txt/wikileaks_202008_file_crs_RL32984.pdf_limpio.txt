scope of the regiona l market to three additional states but nevertheless retains the basic compromise and structure of the original wright amendment the language of the wright amendment has been the focus of several administrative interpretations by the partment of trans portation as well as litigation at both at the state and federal level each court decision to date has affirmed the dots interpretation of the wright amendment the newest iteration of this long running issue is primarily the result of events that have occurred since the fall of 2004 fi rst delta airlines decided in october 2004 to pull most of its service out of da llas ft worth interna tional airport dfw next dfw asked southwest airlines to c onsider operating long distance flights out of dfw southwest rejected the dfw offer and instead announced in november 2004 that it intended to seek legislative relief from the wrightshelby amendments this announcement ended what was regarded as long standing truce on this issue in the period since november dfw join ed by other parties such as american airlines have lobbied in fa vor of retaining the existin g wrightshelby restrictions on airline operations at love field southwest and others have at the same time presented their own arguments as to why these restrictions should be removed the dfw arguments are primarily couched in the politics legalities and history of the regional compact that created the airport the rationales for retaining the amendments are primarily of local interest and origin eg pr otecting investments and markets at dfw the rationale for removing the restrictions is the rationale for deregulation in the first place the unrestricted flow of air commerce question for policymakers then is should the exceptions to deregulation that are the wrightshelby amendments be retained in the context of the existing national aviation system legislation affecting the wrightshelby restrictions has been introduced in the

airports and shift them to dfw38 according to fort worth the terms of the bond ordinance were not preem pted by either the airline deregulation act or the wright and shelby amendments therefore dallas was obligated to utilize its proprietary powers to restrict service at love field39 the state court agreed holding that dallas was obligated to preclude airlines from flying between love field and areas outside texas and the fourstate service area authorized by the wright amendment40 while an appeal of the state courts decision was pending the dot initiated an interpretive proceeding that resulted in declaratory order rejecting the claims of the city of fort worth specifically the dot held that i the city of fort worth may not enfo rce any commitment by the city of dallas to limit operations at love field authorized by federal law and the proprietary powers of the city of dallas do not allow it to restrict services at love field authorized by federal law ii the ability of the city of dallas to limit the type of airline service operated at love fiel d is preempted by the wright and shelby amendments iii any airline operating airc raft with passenger capacity of more than 56

order one of the major issues addressed by the c ourt was the scope of an airport owners proprietary powers42 according to the court federal courts have generally held that an airport proprietor can issue only reasonable nona rbitrary and nondiscriminatory rules that advance the local interest43 while under this standa rd courts have upheld regulations aimed at addressing envir onmental concerns44 and managing congestion45 the court was able to find ju stification for broad grant of proprietary power that would permit an air port owner to allocate traffic between two airports so as to preserve the shorthaul nature of one facility46 although the court did note willingness to review the exercise of proprietary powers with respect to advancing previously unrecognized local inte rests the city of fort worth failed to present sufficiently viable justification in this instance47 as result of the fifth circuits decisi on it appears that local governments are likely to have regulations enacted that are designed to protect the economic interests of airports preempted by federal law to the extent that such regulations conflict with federal requirements notwithstanding the fifth circuits willingness to consider previously unrecognized local interests it would appear that localitys proprietary powers are limited and any future judicial interpretations of such interests will likely be narrowly tailored to address specific local issue thus it would appear that the local governments and dfw board are substantially limited in their ability to remedy any economic distortions that are the result of either the airline deregulation act or the implementation and enforcement of the wright and shelby amendments economic issues the current dispute as discussed above

of the remaining 3 of passengers there are other significant air carrier competitors at the airport at this time airline competition in the dallasft worth market as can be seen from the above most of the airline traffic in the regional market is controlled by small number of air carriers there are some major differences affecting how these air carriers operate in the current marketplace however southwest is the most successful air carrier in the era since deregulation of the industry in 1978 it has been corporately ba sed in dallas for its entire existence it has also been profitable for most of its existence which is rather unique situation in the us airline industry it has done th is by offering low or lower fares while at the same time maintaining relatively low operating costs southwest is the prototypical low cost carrier lcc and its operating structure has been imitated at least to some degree by many new air carriers formed since deregulation imitating southwest has not guaranteed success howev er for much of the 1980s southwest was primarily viewed as niche carrier with an uncontested re gional market based out of love field during the later 1980s and especially in the 1990s southwest has expanded dramatically with route system that became national in scope southwest does not operate huband spoke service hence love fiel d is not referred to as hub rather southwest operates primarily as pointtopoint air carrier because the wrightshelby amendments limit direct service from love field to 7 states it has not been possible for southwest to compete directly with dfwbased air carriers in many major national airline markets this does not mean that southwest travelers originating in dalla s have been unable to reach other southwest cities such as baltimore passenger can reach these des tinations but cannot be through ticketed and must change planes at some ot her destination such as new orleans over time southwest has faced very limite d competition at love field at the present time the only other airline providing service from the airport is express jet which is continental airlines affiliate all of this service is between love field and houston bush international because of the regional air carrier exemption to the wrightshelby amendments any service beyond the 7 state restriction must be performed by an aircraft with 56 seats or less the

us air carriers delta has history similar in many respects to that of american its corporate base is atlanta its now reduced fora into dfw met with limited success initially but especially since september 11th it has consistently lost money at the airport according to industry analysts other air carriers at dfw serve the airport primarily as feeder to their own hubandspoke sy stems eg united

the airport but is not yet viewed as replacement air carrier for deltas lost service impacts of deltas decision to dehub at dfw delta airlines maintained hub at dfw airport for some years but as can be seen from the market share figures discu ssed above it was drama tically smaller than its american counterpart in october 2004 delta announced that it was restructuring systemwide in order to stave off bankr uptcy filing delta announced its intention to cut up to 7000 jobs reduce wages cl ose its dfw hub and make major operating changes throughout the remainder of its system its dfw hub now closed ended operation earlier this year lta continues to provide serv ice at the airport though at much more modest leve l 21 departures per day versus the 258 departures per day in october 2 004 in its new configuration delta now uses 4 gates at the airport versus the 28 it previously occupied since deregulation began in 1978 there ve been several instances in which more than one airline tried to operate hub at the same airport in most instances these multiple airline hubs for example miami and st louis have either become single airline hubs miami or stopped being hubs altogether st louis very few multiple airline hubs still exist eg chicag ohare and atlanta hartsfield jackson many airline industry observe rs believed from the establishment of its hub at dfw that delta would be unable to compete with american on its home turf they expected correctly that delta would ev entually scale down or abandon its hub at dfw deltas withdrawal comes at what th airport views as an inopportune

service at the airport and take over at least 10 of the gates made available by deltas departure these incentives included years free rent on airport f acilities and up to 22 million in other aid to date there have been takers dfw contends that southwests move to eliminate the wrightshelby amendments is major reason for this situation dfw contends that carrier is currently willing to take gamble until there is some certainty about the future of the wrightshelby amendments dfws argument could explain some of the reluctance of new carriers to locate at the airport but does not take into cons ideration other factors that might be more important in the market at the moment the current financial state of the airline industry makes it almost impossible for all but few lccs to significantly expand service to new airports at the mo ment legacy airline is known to be contemplating the creation of new hub lccs as mentioned earlier do not normally create hubs the dfw argument also fails to fully acknowledge americans competitive position at the airport american has always been fierce competitor and is likely to remain one its financial problems notwithstanding there are not many airlines who are willing to compete headtohead with americans well established hub at the airport especi ally when they have other options airport competition in the dallas ft worth market there are number of major cities that have more than one major airport successfully operating in relative proximity to each other examples include chicago new york angeles san franciscooa klandsan jose washingtonbaltimore and houston southw est contends that this national experience could easily be replicated in the dallas ftworth region and that any negative effects on dfw of increasing f lights out of love field would be of relatively short duration as regional growth continued to create new opportunities for both airports dfw goes to some length in its briefing materials to argue that the houston model in particular would be bad model for the dallasft worth region dfw argues that it already provides more serv ice out of dfw alone than houston does out of two airports it also argues that its fares are as low and in some cases are lower than those prevalent in the houston regi on again dfw repeats the argument that it would be inefficient for the regions resources to be split between two airportshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32984crs12 55 weinstein bernard l and clower terry l economic and fiscal consequences of dallasfort worth international airport and the north texas region

accounts found at httpwwwbeadocg ovbearegionalbearfactsactioncfmcompeting economic impact studies dfw initiated work as part of its presentation on why the wrightshelby amendments need to be retained dfw hired economists at the university of north texas to perform an economic analysis of what the delta hub closure means to the airport and the local economy55 the specific findings of this analysis are that the delta pullout will result in 782 million per year decrease in regional economic activity the loss of more than 7000 jobs decrease in wages and salaries of 344 million per year an annual loss of tax and other revenues co llected by state and local governments of 58 million and in 2005 35 million loss to the airport as result of diminished landing fees concession fees etc the authors conclude their assessment by stating that the airport will be severely pressed to f ill the 24 gates left v acant by delta given southwest airlines decision not to move flights to dfw and the reluctance of other discount carriers to serve dfw with southwest making noises about expanding service from love field it may be many years before dfws gates and terminals are fully utilized56 the type of economic analysis utilized by the authors inputoutput analysis is standard tool employed to show the benefit or loss that might accrue to community as result of some sort of ac tion for example new stadium and other large public works project proposals are frequently accompanied by economic analyses of this type it is not uncommon for opponents of stadiums etc to hire their own economists to provide an alternative view using the same basic methodology which as will be seen in the next section is the situation here as is sometimes the case the assumptions that go into the inputoutput process are often questioned for example some of the observations in the report while sounding quite dramatic are much less so wh put in the perspective of the greater regional economy the dallasft wort h region had total wage and salary disbursements in 2003 of 1164 billion57 this represents year over year increase of 524 million or roughly 05 increase ove r the previous years level the 344 million in wages and salaries associated with deltas pullback equates to less then 310ths of one percent of to tal local salaries and wages less than eight months growth in the regional economy at current growth rates would therefore overshadow the regional effects of delta s departure individuals nd businesses however may continue to suffer from the pull out for much longer period

penalty june 7 2005 found at http www setlovefreecompdfcampbell_hill_studypdfthe wrightshelby amendments the study does not express its findings in dollar terms but rather tries to demonstrate that repeal would redistri bute air service in manner that would be bad for dfw and fo r the regional economy this second study works from the premise that southwest would greatly expand its activity at love field to major destinations outside of the seven states to which service is currently restricted under two growth scenarios58 the study assuming worst case outcome from the perspective of dfw presents several major findings among these are that air traffic at love field could triple59 that international traffic at dfw would be reduced that the number of domestic des tinations served from dfw would also be reduced and that dfw would lose up to 35 of its annual passeng ers against this backdrop she comes to the conclusion th at the best option for the region would be the retention of the wrightshelby amendments because it would concentrate future aviation growth at dfw where infrastructure is readily available otherwise she predicts dfw would be underutilized with significant fi nancial implications for the region which at the same time mig ht need to pay for expensive new public infrastructure at love field there are many assumptions in the she study that can be questioned which is the normal situation for study of th is type one assumption open to question is the prediction that american and other dfwbased airlines can only compete with southwest successfully by moving andor creating new service at love field although certainly possible this would seem to be in conflict with the experience in other multiairport metropolitan areas wher airlines successfully compete using different airports southwest airlines initiated work southwest has contracted for its own study of the effects of repealing the wrig htshelby amendments the study by the campbellhill aviati on group takes very different approach from the dfw initiated studies60 campbellhill contends that the wrightshelby amendments impose an economic penalty on north texas of 24 billion and on the nation as whole of 42 billion this penalty in the view of the studys authors is the result of limited competition at dfw that results in above market fares to many destinations the figures in the study are derived from deta iled regression analysis that assumes that southwest would be able to compete in 15 citypair markets from which it is currently excluded southwest able to compete in the regional market it is assumed will offer lower fares in these citypairs then those cu rrently available at dfw from american or other airlines the study also assumes that lower fares will attract considerable new airline traffic to north texas and that each visitor will have positive economic for the region as wholehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32984crs14 61 torbenson eric american report says re peal risks dfw hub southwest disagrees the dallas morning news httpwwwdallasnewscomcgibi nbigold_printcgi october 11 2005there are of course several issues that study of this type cannot and is not designed to answer for example the study does not discuss the issue of offsetting investments in new infrastructure that might accrue to facilitate this increased traffic especially at love field american airlines initiated work american airlines has also commissioned study supporting the dfw position61 the study done by eclat consulting suggests that the southwest s upported campbell hill study is flawed and considerably overstates the regional benefits of increased southwest service at love field eliminating the wrightshelby restrictions would also in this view cause significant changes in americans dfw hub system and lead to reducedeliminated service to numerous small cities and some international destinations as with the other studies mentioned above the aut hors of this report made number of assumptions as basis for analysis primary among them in this case is that american would move sign ificant amount of service from dfw to love field all of the above mentioned studies provide insights in to the relative merits and demerits of repealing the wrightshelb amendments none however give complete picture and each is built on assu mptions that can and will be called into question potential impacts of repeal on dfw dfw is legitimately concerned that it will have tough time paying off its bonded indebtedness if it loses airline rvice as result of wrightshelby restriction repeal it is as discussed earlie r principal argument made by the airport for retention of the restrictions whether these effects would be shortterm or long term in nature however is debatable also debatabl is whether dfws potential financial plight visavis love field should be matte r of congressional concern in the last two decades numerous airports have seen large reductions in air service in some instances the reductions we re far greater then what appears to be the case at dfw several airports for exampl have lost hub carrier atlanta and miami both went through some rough times after the collapse of eastern airlines indianapolis is currently dealing with the loss of ata as major presence at the airport many other examples could be detailed the experience in each case has been similar there have been major bond failures at any of these airports in most major markets replacement air carriers or growth by the incumbent air carrier has over time restored the ai rport to economic health in light of the experience of other cities dfw would not be expected to experience serious longterm economic repercussions as result of the dynamic nature of the dallasft worth regional marketplace in the shortterm however dfw may go throug h some hard times the biggest threat to the financial health of dfw is the longterm financial health of american airlines american is not just the largest air carrier at the airporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32984crs15 62 associated press usa today american threatens to build hub at love field march 22 2005its route system and its future aspirations are largely the rationale for much of the infrastructure at the airport as suggested above the move of significant number of american flights to love field w ould hurt dfw financially an american business failure would have mu ch more serious repercussions it could be argued therefore that dfws campaign to save the wrightshelby amendments is as much concerned with protecting americans market position as it is with trying to retain its overall preeminent position in the north texas aviation market and from the airports perspective this is common sense position potential impacts of repeal on love field 2001 master plan adopted by love fiel d limits service to 34 gates and makes plans for runway or other airside expans ion love field is physically constrained by surrounding development that includes several residential neighborhoods noise issues are important to the local community and noise concerns played an important role in the adoption of the master plan southwest contends that its potential expa nsion of service at love field can be easily handled within the context of the master plan further they contend that their fleet of relatively quiet bo eing 737700 aircraft ensures that increased noise will not be factor in any rampup of service southwest has consistently stated that it welcomes new competitors at the airport so long as everyone has to abide by the same rules unclear however is how relaxation of the wrightshelby amendments might play out amongst southwests competitors american has suggested that termination of the existing restrictions would force them to open hub at love field as competitive res ponse62 american perceives possibly correctly that it could lose significant amounts of dallas originating tr affic if southwest were able to provide national service from the downtown airpor t without direct competition american currently owns three gates at love field although it does not use them at this point it is far from clear whether american could in fact create parallel but smaller hub operation at love field by their own admission serving two airports in close proximity would be inefficient such move could certainly have at least shortterm negative financial implications for dfw so far other major air carrier has pub licly stated an intention to serve love field if restrictions are withdrawn many industry observers would question the idea that some carrier would want to go h eadtohead with southwest on its home turf more likely is that additional airlines might wish to add regional or even large jet service at the airport to serve their own hubandspoke or pointtopoint route systems american contends in its statements that it views the love field master plan as moot in the event of wrightshelby

communities to increased noise and other activities at and around the airport as result there might be considerable local opposition to the increase in airport activity that might accompany amendment repeal local reaction to proposed wrightshelby repeal the large populations of american and southwest employees in the region by itself almost guarantees that this subject will generate considerable local debate it is not surprising therefore that regiona l opinions appear to be mixed perusal of the websites created by dfw and southw est to promote their respective positions details local support for both protagonists positions63 local newspapers have also weighed in on the subject providing ex tensive coverage of the debate over wrightshelby64 again coverage would seem to indicate that broad consensus on the question of repeal is absent local politicians are also weighing in on the subject notably the mayor of dallas now seems to be seeking an as of yet undefined compromise on the issue65 in addition members of the regions congre ssional delegation are weighing in on the subject with two members supporting rep eal and several others opposing the idea prospects for congressional action in the 108th congress several members of the tennessee congressional delegation introduced legislation that woul d have allowed direct air service between love field and airports in tennessee h r 5187 the bill received further congressional considera tion comparable legislation s now been introduced in the 109th congress hr 2932 representative ma rsha blackburn june 16 2005 the bill has been

wrightshelby amendments has been introduced in the 109th congress hr 2646 representative jeb hensarling may 26 2005 this legislation has also been referred to the subcommittee on aviation further action on the legisl ation has been taken as of this writing three pieces of legisl ation have been introduced in the senate that would impact the wrightshelby ame ndments the first of these would have the practical effect of eliminating the existing restrictions but does so not by repealing the wrightshelby amendments but by amending the existing provisionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32984crs17

helby restrictions would require the closure of love field three years after th date of enactment s 1425 senator james inhofe july 19 200566 final piece of legislation is provision in the senate passed version of the transportation treas ury the judiciary housing and urban development and related agencies appropriations bill 2006 hr 3058 as amended october 20 2005 this provisi on would appear to permanently add missouri to the existing list of states eligible for direct service to love field the senate committee on commerce scie nce and transportation has scheduled november 10 2005 hearing on the love field dispute it is unclear whether action other then on the appropriations bill will be take on any of these bills during the remainder of the 1st session of the 109th congress it is unknown whether the senate appropriations provision concerning love field will survive or be modified by the conference committee considering the legislation in its november 2005 announcement s outhwest contended that hr 5187 in the 108th congress clearly showed desire on the part of congress to expand direct service to love field beyond the 7 states allowed service by the wrightshelby amendments southwest believes that the legislation introduced in the 109th congress excluding s 1425 bolsters this pos ition southwest also contends that the departure of delta from the regional market provided n eed for additional service in the market especially low fare service and that with relief from the wrightshelby restrictions southwest is in the best position to provide it dfw obviously takes very different view from their perspective southwest should either offer long di stance service from dfw or live with the wrightshelby amendment restrictions gi ving southwest authority to fly beyond the seven states it can now serve would in their opinion have chilling effect on dfws ability to attract new air carriers to replace delta by extension such move could also diminish the economic vibrancy of the ai rport and the region love field in this view is not seen as regional asset but rather as dallas city asset the dfw arguments are primarily couched in the politics legalities and history of the regional compact that created the airport that are discussed more fully earlier in this report the rationales for retaining the amendments are primarily of local interest and origin eg pr otecting investments and market s at dfw many industry observers including some outside th dallasft worth region believe that wrightshelby repeal or modification is local issue and should be decided in the context of local aviation needs since its 1978 deregulation the airline industry has become very competitive airlines move service in and out of airports as their marketing strategies change this is mostly done irrespective of the fina ncial and other needs of the airports theyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32984crs18 serve there are still few other airports with operating restrictions reagan washington national and new york guardia are the two most commonly mentioned but the restrictions in each instance are far less constraining than they are at love field and the reasons for these restrictions are completely unrelated to those at issue here the ra tionale for removing wrights helby restrictions therefore is the rationale for deregulation in the first place the unrestricted flow of air commerce question for policymakers then is should the exceptions to deregulation that are the wrightshelby amendments be retained in the context of the existing national aviation system or should local concerns be the primary determinant as to the desirability of repeal andor modification
