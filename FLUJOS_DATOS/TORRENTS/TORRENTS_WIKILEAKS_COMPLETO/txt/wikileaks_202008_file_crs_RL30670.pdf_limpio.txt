on congress ability to protect the environment summary federal protection of the environment must hew to the same constitutional bounds as any other federal activity in the past decade the supreme court has invigorated several of these bounds in ways that present new challenges to congressional drafters of environmental statutes this report reviews five of these newly emergent constitutional areas for each area the focus is its significance for current and future federal environmental legislation first the commerce clause requiring that activities regulated by federal laws enacted under the clause have sufficient nexus with interstate commerce in 1995 the supreme court sustained commerce clause challenge to federal law for the first time in 60 years and did so again in 2000 thus far lower courts have rejected such challenges to federa l environmental laws but in 2001 the supreme court opted for narrow reading of federal clean water act jurisdiction over isolated waters in part to avoid commerce clause issues second standing to sue in the federal courts article iii restricts standing who is proper party to bring suit to those w ho can demonstrate injury in fact causation and redressability in series of d ecisions during the 1990s the supreme court interpreted these requirements with increasing stringency making standing more difficult to establish and lessening the viability of many potential environmental citizen suits in sharp turnabout howev er the court in 2000 eased the injuryin fact and redressa bility components third the takings clause of the fifth amendment declaring that when the federal government takes property ju st compensation is owed the federal environmental program most commonly attacked in takings suits is the clean water act section 404 wetlands progra m other federal progra ms occasionally challenged as effecting takings include the endangered species act surface mining control and reclamation act rails to tr ails act and superfund act fourth the tenth amendment stating that powers not granted to the federal government are reserved to the states invoking this amendment supreme court decisions during the 1990s held that cong ress cannot compel the participation of state legislatures or state executivebranch officials in federal programs but conditions on the grant of federal funds to the states and other noncoercive approaches to enlisting state cooperation w ith federal environm ental initiatives have been judicially approved fifth the eleventh amendment which together with general principles of state sovereign immunity bars congress from authorizing private lawsuits against unconsenting states because the amendment applies only to private suits against states and does not prohibit suits against stat officials for injunctive relief it has thus far not been major constraint on congressi onal environmental effo rts noncoercive approaches preceding paragraph are also

crs rept rl30315 updated march 21 2001constitutional bounds on congress ability to protect the environment congress efforts to protect the envi ronment have always been required to respect the same constitutional bounds as any other federal actions today however this fact is newly important in the past decade or so the supreme court has invigorated five of these constitutional bounds in ways th at present fresh challenges to congressional drafters of environmental statutes these five constitutional strictures are 1 the commerce clause1 demanding that congressional enactments based on the clause address activities having sufficient link to interstate commerce 2 article iii standing doctrine limiting who is proper party to invoke the jurisdiction of article iii federal courts 3 the fifth amendment takings clause requiring that certain government interferences with private property be accompanied by compensation of the owner 4 the tenth amendment barring direct fe deral regulation of state legislatures and state executive branch officials and 5 the eleventh amendment limiting federal authorization of private suits against unconsenting states what these five constitutional areas shar is that in each instance the court often though not always through the five conservative justices2 has redrawn or at least underscored fundamental limit on fede ral power in the courts commerce clause tenth amendment and eleventh amendment decisions that line is the one between the proper domains of federal nd state power these are known as the federalism cases3 in the courts standingtosu decisions it is the line between the judiciary and the political branches of the federal government and in its takings clause decisions it is the line between the rights of the community as effectuated by government and those of individual pr operty owners goodly number of these supreme court decisions arise out of suits directly involving federal environmental statutes but even where they do not their relevance to such statutes is clear until the 1990s congress legislated in the environmental area with relatively few constitutional concerns thus the supreme courts renewed attention to the five areas mentioned has hardly escaped tice particularly because the new focus comes chiefly from one side of the political spectrum the conservative majority on the court

citizens seeking to protect the environment and sketched the outline of jurisprudence of economic liberties under the ta kings clause and the us commerce clause of the us constitution that would frustrate or repeal most federal environmental statutes4 others find the threat overstated at least in regard to the federalism cases collectively these rulings proscribe federal power but this does not mean that environmental prot ection is threatened thus far the courts federalist decisions have been exceedingly modest trimming federal power only on the margins congress retains substantial authority to dopt environmental measures especially in those areas of particular federal concern in any event federal regulation is not the only means to advance environmental values 5 herein we offer

of the five cons titutional areas above the report gives cursory nod to two constitutional doctrines th at while recently active have not been the beneficiaries of supreme court prom otion one the article i nondelegation doctrine was briefly resurrected by lower court in challenge to clean air act regulations before being reig ned in by the supreme court in 2001 the other article iis vesting of

1937 there the court rejected its previous distinction between direct and indirect ffects on interstate commerce recasting the commerce clause inquiry as whether the intrastate activities have such close and substantial relation to interstate commerce that their control is essential or appropriate to protect that commerce id at 3638 9514 us 549 1995 10see generally kenneth r thomas united states v lopez the limits of federal power under the commerce clause crs rept 951047 1995 archived 11514 us at 558559 12529 us 598 2000article i commerce clause background the commerce clause of article i bestows upon congress the power to regulate commerce among the several states 7 as the basis for much of the environmental social and economic legislation enacted by congress the scope of this power is of more than passing in terest the supreme court has often been treated to cases where the validity of federal statute hinged on whether the activity sought to be regulated alone or aggregated with similar activity of others had sufficient effect on interstate commer ce to fall within the commerce power fortunately from congress point of view the supreme court beginning in the 1930s adopted an expansive interpre tation of the clauses reach8 indeed from 1937 until 1995 the court rebuffed every commerce clause challenge to federal law in 1995 congress winning streak came to halt in united states v lopez 9 the supreme court by 54 voided cr iminal conviction under the gunfree school zones act of 1990 as beyond congress authority under the commerce clause10 the majority explained that the courts decisions had identified three categories of activity reached by the clause the nowcanonical test11 first congress may regulate use of the channels of interstate commerce second congress may regulate and protect the instrumentalities of or persons or things in interstate commerce even though the threat may come only fro m intrastate activitie s and third the commerce clause includes the power to regulate intrastate activities that alone or in the aggregate substantially affect interstate commerce as to the last category the court strongly suggested that only economic activity may be aggregated to establish substantial effect finding that possession of gun in schoolyard lay outside the last category the only one that potentially applied the convi ction was reversed in 2000 and 2001 the c ourt showed that lopez was anomaly in united states v morrison 12 it again held and again by 54 that congress exceeded its commerce power this time in creating federal civil remedy for

proscribed activity in refusing to aggregate impacts on interstate commerce under the substantially affects category14 further and raising eyebrows among the commentators the court refused to be bound by congressiona l findings in the act asserting such impacts on interstate commerce these findings it said relied on line of reasoning but for causation that the court d previously rejected in the commerce clause context after morrison the court twice construed federal statutes narrowly at least in part to avoid questions as to their possible invasion of intrastate realms beyond congress commerce power15 while purely statutory rulings these two decisions show the continuing importance of the constitutional issue to the court and its determination that the line between the proper realms of federal and state power not be obliterated at the same time nothing in lopez or morrison overruled any of the courts prior commerce clause decisions th court even cited with approval wickard v filburn16 widely seen as the pinnacle of its expansive commerce clause jurisprudence lopez and morrison are thus best regarded not as retrenchment but rather as clarification of where the line has long been and warning that the line will not be shifted further toward fe deral power to accommodate congress are federal environmenta l statutes vulnerable sooner had the ink dried on the lopez decision than concerns were raised that some federal environmental statutes might be on shaky commerce clause footing17 vulnerabilities were suggested in the superfund act cleanup sites where the contamination remains within one state clean water act isolated waters safe drinking water act publicly owned drinking wate r systems providing service within one state and endangered species act

exceeded its constitutional bounds22 some further words are in order about congressional findings in the wake of lopez and morrison in both decisions the court cautioned that simply because congress

commerce clause scrutiny will be closer when federal regulation intrudes on an area of traditional st ate control of c ourse environmental law has been heavily federaliz ed area for several decades now26 in post morrison decision however the courts commer ce clause discussion refers to the states traditional and primary power over land and water use27 suggesting that the court still views the federal government as something of an interloper in such matters several federal environmental statutes such as the clean water act wetlands permitting program and the endangered species act authorize direct federal regulation of l and and water use second this same post morrison decision suggests doubt in the courts nd as to whether intrastate economic activities that are step or two removed from the statutes environmental concerns may be aggregated to show the requisite substantial effect on interstate commerce28 if this judicial doubt bears fruit in later court opinions we may see some contraction in the constitutionally permissible scope of federal environmental laws29 more optimistically from congress point of view it may be that the moderate conservatives on the court that is jus tices oconnor and kennedy are not yet ready to take on body of law such as fe deral environmental statutes that by and large if not in every instance has an adequate interstatecommerce nexus to do so

handed down after morrison the latest supreme court holding directly on the commerce clause all of these decisions reject the commer ce clause challenge and ll do so on the same ground that the substantially affects factor of lopez was satisfied in gibbs v babbitt35 the fourth circuit the same court that struck down the violence against women act provision on its way to the supreme court36 and circuit generally seen as quite conservati ve held 21 that an aspect of the endangered species act was within congress commerce power the issue was whether the united states under the could limit the taking of reintroduced red wolves on private nd the fourth circuit invoked the substantially affects criterion on which lopez and morrison hinged this time finding the criterion satisfied unlike ge nderbased violence and guns near schools it said the taking of red wolves is connected with economic enterprise for one thing the protection of economic assets is prima ry reason for taking the wolves37 for another without the wolves there would be wolfrelated tourism or scientific research and commercial trade in pelts because of this economic nexus the effects of individual wolf ta kings may be aggregated and when so aggregated they sufficiently affect interstate commerce to satisfy the substantially affects prong of lopez the absence of congressional findings to that effect said the circuit did not preclude this conclusion also involving the was gdf realty investments inc v norton 38 addressing use of the act to block construction of shopping center that would take endangered cave bugs by destroying their cave habitat outside of museum collections the cave bugs were known to exist only in one county in texas notwithstanding the court found the substan tially affects crite rion satisfied both because the development of the shopping center standing alone satisfied the substantially affects test and because as clearly economic activity it could be aggregated with other such development to substantially affect important however the court cautioned that on different facts it might have ruled otherwise the broad terms of the it said certainly cover purely local intrastate activities having connection whatso ever with interstate commerce39 this raises the possibility that use of the to thwart noneconomic activity harming an endangered species existing within

in the decision below the seventh circuit found that the migratory bird rule satisfies the substantially affects prong of lopez pointing out that 31 million americans spent 13 billion to hunt migratory birds in 1996 and that about 11 of them traveled across state lines to do so the court found the aggregate impact of the destruction of migratory bird habitats to substantially affect interstate commerce49 the supreme court decision50 never reached the constitutional question at least not directly rather the majority opini on the court split yet again 54 confined itself to the statutory issue as to the scope of section 404 it held depending on which part of the opinion one looks at ither that congress ne ver intended section 404 to extend to isolated waters at all or that congress neve r intended section 404 to extend to isolated waters solely on the basis of the migratory bird rule the effect of this ruling however interpreted is to narrow the reach of not only the section 404 program but also other components of the clean water act such as pointsource permitting51 whose reach likewise is defined by the term navigable waters more important for present purposes the court in arriving at its reading of section 404 drew support from the comme rce clause and considerations of federalism chief justice rehnquist who authored the majority opinion also wrote the

issue again raised by the defendants coming into compliance during the district courts delib erations the court charged the fourth circuit with confusing sta nding and mootness the confusion was understandable the court conceded given its past charact erization of mootness as standing set in time frame in laidlaw the court backed away from that description it noted for example that the pros pect of future noncompliance may be too speculative to support standing but not too speculative to overcome mootness then too the underlying purpose of the two doctrines c ounsels greater hesitancy in dismissing case on mootness as opposed to absence of standing grounds standing doctrine acts to ensure that the scarce resources of the federal courts are devoted to disputes in which the parties have

payable to the plaintiff the courts statement that all civil penalties have some deterrent effect is powerful one for citizen suitors there are currently several citizensuit provisions that allow claims for money penalties payable to the us treasury note also because the court seems inclined to defer to congressional findings in this area it may be useful in the future for proponents of new citizensuit provisions authorizing civil penalties to accompany them with assertions of deterrent effect 3 the majority retained the traditional view that makes it hard for defendant to obtain dismissal based on mootness on ce plaintiff has established standing 4 two facts suggest that laidlaws reversal of the 1990s trend toward higher standing hurdles may be more than temporary first the court did not have to decide the standing question at all in the case mootness was the principal issue presented and the petitioners briefs were focused there that ju stice ginsburg reached out to resolve the standing issue when it was unnece ssary to do so points to desire on the part of at least some justices to move the pendulum back to some extent second it may be significant that the

background the takings clause of the fifth amendm ent states nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation but when precisely does government action sufficiently interfere with private property as to effectively take it outside of the obvious circumstance wh the government formally condemns or confiscates property answering this question has involved the courts in delicate and usually ad hoc balancing act between the needs of society at large and the rights of the individual property owner the rise of the takings issue coincides with the growth during the twentieth century of government regulation of land use from the advent of comprehensive municipal zoning in the early part of the century to the widespread use of environmental historic pr

takings cl ause protections has ensured that every court term includes at least one takings decision in the congress and many state legislatures property rights partisans pa rticularly during the 1990s gave the issue legislative face as well as judicial one by introducing property rights bills some of these bills would have given the property owner aggrieved by regulation right of action

takings and which subcategory best describes the property owners claim the courts answer significantly affects the owners chances of success 1 regulatory takings in regulatory taking cl aim the property owner asserts that despite the absence of any physical intrusion by government or its instrumentalities onto the private property or any government appropriation of that property taking has been effected by government regulati on of the propertys use there are two subcategories of regulatory takings if the regulation deprives the property of all economic use andor value ta king

taking when the government action fails to substantia lly advance legitimate government interest agins v city of tiburon 447 us 255 260 1980 this meansend test is very different animal than the prevailing multifactor balancin g method just described in the text which primarily looks at the economic effects of government action perhaps reflecting judicial awareness of this uncomfortable fit the s ubstantially advance test has been infrequently used by courts in any event there can be little argument that federal environmental statutes do substantially advance legitimate government purpose acquired88 this is called the total taking rule if far more commonly the regulation removes only portion even very substantial portion of the propertys use or value then ad hoc bala ncing is used to decide whether taking occurred under this partial regulatory taking test court assesses the government action for its 1 economic impact on the property 2 degree of interference with the property owners reasonable investmentback ed expectations and 3 character89 while recent supreme court rulings str ongly suggest that the above multifactor balancing approach governs in the overwhelming majority of regulatory takings cases90 it has done little to explicate the thr ee factors based on the case law however we can reasonably say the following as to the economic impact factor the degree of loss in use or value must be very substantial befo re taking occurs plaintiffs ability to recoup hisher cost basi s is also relevant and both direct and indirect benefits conferred by the regulatory scheme may offset the immediate economic impact on the property owner as to interference with investmentbacked expectations the fact that the regulatory scheme in question predates plaintiffs acquisition of the property does not automa tically preclude the taking action see notice rule discussion below but thos who enter heavily regulated field have limited expectations of being free of any subsequent strengthening of the regulatory strictures as to the character of the government acti on the supreme court initially explained that this factor chiefly referred to the fact that takings are more readily found in the case of physical inva sions as compared to purely regulatory interferences yet other elements are now understood to be within this most elastic of the three factors for example it includes balancing of the public interest advanced by the government measure ag ainst the burden imposed on the property owner and requirement that pl aintiff allege the taking of specific property interest rather than say only generalized monetary liability crosscutting issue arising with both total takings claims and partial regulatory takings claims is the question of the p arcel as whole this conundrum stems from the fact that takings law in assessing the economic impact and interference with investmentbacked expectations factors looks not at the absolute amount of the property owners loss but rather at the loss relative to what the owner retains to assess what the property owner retains court is required to look at the parcel as whole in any of its three dimensions the spatial dimension asks which acreage owned by plaintiff should be included in the assessment of the government actionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30670crs20 91for example the

restricted acreage claimed to have been taken the f unctional dimension of parcel as whole focuses on the rights plaintiff still has in the property one must examine in the common metaphor the entire bundle of righ ts possessed by plaintiff and the temporal dimension asks whether notw ithstanding plaintiffs inability to make economic use of the property during one pe riod in the life span of the property interest there is anothe r period when the property can be so used two specialized issues in regulatory takings law have occupied the supreme court recently first the notice rule in the 1990s many courts held that taking action was barred absolutely whenever landuse restriction was imposed under regulatory scheme predating plaintiffs ac quisition of the property this is known as the notice rule it was justified on th grounds that land buyer assumes the risk that development will be thwarted under the preexisting regime and presumably bought at discounted price reflecting that risk the notice rules importance can hardly be overstated afte r another decade or two few landowners will be left who purchased prior to the advent of many fe deral environmental pr ograms and thus can bypass the rule91 in 2001 however the supreme c ourt emphatically rejected the absolute version of the notice rule holding that the preacquisition existence of regulatory program was not per bar to later takings actions92 year later the court clarified albeit in dicta that preacquisition regime still retains some persuasive role in the re gulatory takings equation even if not dispositive one93 second the expressly temporary restriction typically the regulation challenged as regulatory taking is of indefinite duration in the most recent supreme court taking decision94 however the court dealt with very different entity the regulation declared at the outset to be temporary such expressly temporary landuse restricti ons commonly take the form of development moratoria imposed by local governments to maintain the status quo until study of the impacts of future development can be complete d congress as well has used temporary moratoria as in connection with outer continental shelf oil and gas production the court declared that for such expre ssly temporary devel opment bans the per total taking analysis used for initially indefinite bans is inappropriate notwithstanding the owners inability to make of hisher property for time the former ban is generally to be analyzed unde r the multifactor balanc ing test for partial regulatory takings under this test th economic impact and dur ation of the ban are merely two of many factors and the ban if of reasonable duration and for legitimate public purpose is likely not to be taking httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30670crs21 95loretto v

physical takings physical taking claim sserts that the government directly or through third pa rties has effected physical invasion of private property as with regulatory takings there are two subtypes if the invasion is deemed permanent it will be held taking in almost all instances95 if the invasion is only temporary the threefactor regulatory ta king test above is invoked under which the invasion may or may not be ta king but generally not federal actions that often bring on physi cal takings claims include flooding from federal dams and other water projects overflights of federal aircraft and in the environmental arena the railstotr ails and superfund cleanup programs 3 exaction conditions on development permits here the government doesnt forbid the land use but rather demands concession exaction from the landowner in return for approving the use to survive takings challenge such an exaction condition must satisfy two criteria it must substantially advance the same government purpose as justified the permit program in question96 and the burden imposed on the property owner by the exac tion must be greater than roughly proportional to the burden that the prope rty owners proposed project would have on the community97 exactionsbased takings claims are myriad at the local level curiously however the exactions test s never been invoked by court deciding taking claim against the united states though some federal activity such as the mitigation conditions imposed on wetlands pe rmits and inciden tal take permits under the endangered species act argu ably falls within the tests reach98 so much for how courts determine wh ether taking has occurred we come finally to the question of the constitutionally mandated remedy once taking is found long unresolved matter the government says the supreme court generally must pay compensation in the usual case it does not satisfy the constitution for the court to invalidate the act found to have caused

taken102 establishing ripeness he re has proved much easier than for landowners dealing with local land use agencies the latter must deal with frequent judicial demands that following nial of the owners initial proposal heshe must return to the landuse agency with scaleddown or reconfigured proposals so the court can ascertain the degree of devel opment that will be accepted by contrast the

delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people once dismissed by the supreme court as but truism118 the court today discerns in these wo rds bulwark of states rights in our federalstate system of government on other occasions the court has derived the same protection for states rights by inquiring whether an act of congress is authorized by one of the powers delegated to congress in article i such as the commerce power the two inquiries says the court are mirror images of each other119 the invigoration of the tenth amendment has played out in cases dealing with congress ability to regulate the states directly instances where federal mandate tells state or state official what that entity must do in itially the context was whether congress could subject states to the same restrictions it applies to private parties in series of decisions begi nning in the 1960s the court agonized over this issue eventually concluding in 1985 th at its earlier effort to immunize the traditional governmental f unctions of the states from federal mandate s was both impractical and doctrinally

pendulum swung back toward state immunity in related but different context the new cases asked whether congress can compel state legislative branch and executive branch participation in the implementation of commerce clausebased federal programs122 the courts answer was if the state is being made to act in its sovereign capacity the first decision was new york v united states123 invalidating federal law requiring that any state failing to provide for permanent disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste generated within its borders must take title to the waste the court held that congress may not commandeer th legislative processes of the states by directly compelling them to enact and enforce federal regulatory program124 at the same time it hastened to add congress may encourage states to regulate in particular way for example c ongress may under its spending power125 attach conditions to the receipt of federal funds t least where they bear some relationship to the purpose of the federal spending or congress may offer states the choice between regulating an activity according to federal standards or having state law preempted by federal regulation the cour t specifically noted the clean water act resource conservation and r ecovery act and alaska national interest lands conservation act as examples of the preemption route126 in the second decision printz v united states 127 the supreme court voided provision of the brady handgun violence pr otection act requiring the chief law enforcement officer of local jurisd iction to do background check on wouldbe purchasers of handguns the brady act thus commanded such officers to participate in administering federal regulatory scheme the court concluded this time in the executive branch context that the united st ates may not compel state involvement in federal program congress sa id the court cannot circumvent new york s prohibition on compelling sovereign acts by conscripting the states

enforcement such congressional conscription of state legislative functions said the fifth circuit is clearly prohibited under new york 130 congress is free to regulate drinking water coolers in interstate commerce directly but not through the states as conduits to the people the sdwa provision it concluded deprives the state of the option of declining to regulate drinking water systems and

federal implementation of federally desi red program within state when the state fails to act another common approach is constitutional135 as above the state is not compelled to regu late for the same reason the mirror image of this arrangement ending the federal pr ogram within the state if the state adopts its own program meeting federal criteria is also constitutional136 when the state itself engag in the regulated activity there appears to be one circumstance when the united states may regulate the state or political subdivision directly when the state or local authority itself engages in an activity that congress legitimate ly may regulate under the commerce power this may occur for exampl when county operates fleet of wastecollection trucks with their attendant emissions or solid waste landfill137 here federal regulation burdens the state not as s overeign government but solely in its enterprise capacity such burdens do not implicate the federalism concerns raised by federal encroachments on state sovereignty138 recent and unanimous supreme court opinion affirms this sovereignenterprise distinction in reno v condon 139 the court was faced with the federal drivers privacy

important conse quence it largely frees the court of the amendments textual constrai nts thus while the amendment speaks only to suits against states by citizens of another state the supreme court has disallowed federally authorized suits against unconsenting states even when brought by citizens of the same state145 while the amendment speaks only to suit in federal court the court has barred suits

exists for suits against states by the united states151 or by another state152 the states in ratifying th constitution are deemed to have surrendered at least that porti on of their inherent

other is not relevant to whether suit is barred156 the amendment and the constitutional principle of state sovereign immunity have three exceptions157 1 ex parte young suits while state immunity extends to state agencies and state officials who act on behalf of the state ex parte young allows federal court to prospectively enjoin state official from violating federal law158 the legal fiction behind this exception is that suit against state officer is not suit against the state when an injunction is sought against an ille gal action since an officer is seen as not acting on behalf of the state when he or she acts illegally conversely ex parte young doctrine does not cover retroactive re lief that requires the payment of funds from the state treasury eg imposing civil money penalties for past noncompliance159 the supreme court recently has narrowed the ex parte young doctrine but only minimally as yet the more important of its narrowing decisions at least for environmental purposes came in seminole tribe of florida v florida160 there the court held that petitioners claim against the state which was barred by the eleventh amendment also could not be brought as an ex parte young suit against the state governor the court reasoned that whe re congress has pres cribed detailed remedial scheme for the enforcement against state of statutorily created right the court should hesitate befo re casting aside those limitati ons and permitting an action against state officer under ex parte young 161 particularly is this so where the detailed regulatory scheme involves only quite modest sanctions against the state or state official not that cong ress cannot if it chooses authorize ex parte young suits against state officials even in this circumstance the court

consenting to be sued164 the more difficult question is what constitutes consent in general the court insists that waiver s of sovereign immun ity be unequivocal165 thus enactment of state statute or constitutional provision explicitly consenting to suit in federal court generally passes muster166 the same goes for clear statement of states agreement to administer federalstate program that imposes federal standards on the state consent may also take the form of the states voluntarily invoking federal jurisdiction167 as by its voluntary appearance in federal court as an intervenor and defense of the case on the merits168 or its removal of lawsuit from state court to federal court169 but in general the court has become increasingly stingy in finding that states waive their immunity by exercising the rights given them by federal law important to environmental regulation consent will not be presumed based on the states mere presence in field that is federally regulated even if the

clear in the language of the statute175 the mere fact that statute was passed under the fourteenth amendment is not enough to s how that congress intended to circumvent state sovereign immunity176

provision in solid waste disposal act 183to be sure there are recurring reasons why states on occasion do not comply 1 the federal obligation imposes onerous financial bur dens on the state 2 the federal obligation trenches on an area traditionally considered matter of state prerogative and 3 there is public opposition to the consequences of compliance see stephen r mcallister and robert l glicksman note 180 supra giving examples of state noncompliance 184vermont agency of natural resources v united states ex rel stevens 529 us 765 2000subdivisions of states or nongovernmental actors181 and we are not talking about suits that seek to coerce states to participate in their sovereign capacity in federal programs that option was already lost to cong ress through the tenth amendment cases as the cases discussed below indi cate the eleventh amendment and related immunity have been stumbling block for federal environmental programs in principally two narrow situations the first is nonsovereign state activity as noted earlier this might include states use of vehicles eg police cars and state ownership or operation of landfills the second situation occurs when state chooses to participate in federal regulatory effort by developing its own program meeting federal standards and submitting it for federal approval but the key part the approved state program re tains purely statelaw status thus far this second scenario has arisen solely under the surface mining control and reclamation act third realm where the amendment has insulated states is whistleblower actions brought under federal environm ental statutes by state em ployees alleging retaliatory treatment by their state employers182 due to the marginal relevance of such litigation to our topic here we do not discuss it further even in those limited situations where the amendment has been held to apply it can hardly be said that states are fr ee to violate standards imposed under federal environmental laws as an initial matter most states presumably would comply as matter of good faith183 more to the legal point and as noted above state officials still could be constrained by injunctions in private suits demanding compliance with federal laws and states could still be sued by the federal government or as presumably would occur only rarely by ot her states the second category above may present higher barriers to enforcement against the states though even here the united states can bypass the states and enforce directly against the regulatee and of course the state may consent to be sued in its own courts an interesting question is whether congre ss could authorize private suits against state activity eleventh amendment notwithstanding by statutorily characterizing such suits as being on behalf of the ited states similar question recently was presented to the supreme court involving private qui tam suit against state under the federal false claims act but was side stepped by the court when it construed the act as not extending to states184 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30670crs35 185see note 171 supra and accompanying text 186clean air act 304a1 42 us c 7604a1 emphasis added 187see eg

also might be given to enc ouraging state waiver of sovereign immunity by making waiver condition to receiving delegation of the federal program or to receiving federal money as to the latter we mentioned earlier that the court has upheld for now the power of congress in the exercise of its spending power to condition its grant of funds to the states upon their taking specified actions that congress could not manda them to take185 the citizen suit provisions found in most federal environmen tal statutes make the eleventh amendment limit on suits against the states explicit typical language is that of the clean air act any person may commence civ il action on his own behalf against any person including i the united states and ii any other governmental instrumentality or agency to the extent permitted by the eleventh amendment to the constitution who is alleged to have violated or to be in violation of an emission standard or limitation unde r this clean air act or b an order issued by the epa administrator or state with respect to such standard or limitation186 of course the eleventh amendment woul d have constrained suits under this and similar citizensuit provisions even without the explicit mention yet mentioning the amendment has not been for naught severa l court decisions have used it to support an inference that congress intended to authorize suits against state officials187 finally congressional abrogation of state immunity pursuant to section 5 of the fourteenth amendment may be viable in rare instances probably the most compelling example would be federal laws to prevent the disciminatory application of environmental laws by the states such as the disproportiona permitting of toxic hazards or other environmental threat s in minority neighborhoods as noted supreme court decisions make amply clear that the legislative history for such enactments would have to contain substa ntial evidence of pattern or future likelihood of unconstitutional activity by the states188 case law involving federal environmental statutes clean water actclean air act several eleventh amendment decisions stem from clean water act cwa and clean

article is nondelegation doctrine this doctrine is relegated to an ddendum because unlike the constitutional principles in the preceding chapters the supreme court has not been the instrument of its recent resuscitation but ra ther of its recent confinement the nondelegation doctrine blocks congress from surrendering too much legislativetype discretion to another branch of government205 the doctrine flows from the separation of powers in the constitutional structure and in particular from article is vesting of all legislative powers in the congress206 while the court gives lip service to

21442 usc 7409b1circumvents that reading the court has long held that legislativelike powers may be delegated to agencies if congress gives the agency an intelligible principle to guide its exercise of that authority this is merely recognition that congress routinely and necessarily delegates legislativetype powers to noncongressional bodies in particular cong ress frequently commits to th specialized expertise of executivebranch agencies the task of rulemaking and standard setting in technical areas such as environmental control except for two decisions in 1935 the supr eme court has never agreed with nondelegationdoctrine challenge207 and the doctrine has often been declared deceased208 delegations sustained by the court sometimes have been extremely broad including statutes instructing the f cc to regulate broadcast licensing in the public interest209 and authorizing the price admin istrator during world war ii to set fair and equitable prices210 all that the court seems to insist on sometimes is that congress employ delegation which sufficiently marks the field within which the price administrator is to act so that it may be know n whether he has kept within it in compliance with the legislative will211 where the congressional standard is combined with requirements of notice and hearing and agency statements of findings and considerations so that j udicial review under due process standards is possible the constitutional requirements of delegation have been fulfilled212 in 1999 the dc circuit breathed ne w life into the nondelegation doctrine becoming apparently the first court to bless nondelegation attack on federal statute since 1935 at issue in american trucking associations v epa213 was epas promulgation in 1997 of revised primary national ambient air quality standards naaqss for ozone and partic ulate matter the 2judge majority found that epa had construed clean air ac t caa section 109b1214 requiring that primary naaqss be set at level requi site to protect the public health with an additional adequate margin of safety so loosely as to render it an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power the dc circuit majority had quarrel with the factors used by epa to assess the public health threat posed by air pollutants rather it said epa had articulated intelligible principle for translating the factors into particular naaqs nor it said is one apparent from the statute going from the impact factors to numerical naaqs requires more insisted the court th an asserting that higher naaqs would allow greater public health harm nd lower naaqs less harm this is always truehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30670crs40 215according to the court epa regards ozone definitely and particulate matter likely as nonthreshold pollutants ie ones that have possibility of adverse health impact however slight at any exposure level above zero 175 f3d at 1034 216531 us 457 2001 217id at 474 218id at 475 219id 220id 221 in separate concurrences justice thomas questioned whether the courts delegation jurisprudence had strayed too far from the f ounders understanding of separation of powers while justice stevens argued for candid r ecognition that agencies routinely exercise legislative power and that nothing in article i section 1 precludes congressional delegation of legislative power 222remarks of prof david hodas widener iv school of law quoted in high court continuedfor nonthreshold pollutant215 but does not fix the maximum acceptable degree of harm epa also argued that at polluti on levels below the pr omulgated standard health effects are less certain the court rejected this argument as well the increasing uncertainty argument it said is helpful only if some principle reveals how much uncertainty is too much in whitman v american trucking associations 216 the supreme court unanimously rejected any nondelegation doctrine infirmity in caa section 109 reversing the court of appeals the court read the term requisite in the section 109 naaqs standard to mean higher and lower than necessary to protect the public health with an adequate margin of safety with epas discretion so constrained the justices found section 109 to be well within the outer limits of our nondelegation precedents217 the majority of the justices voiced disapproval of those precedents the court further opined that the degree of agency discretion that is acceptable varies according to the scope of the power congressionally conferred218 thus while congress need not provide any directi on to epa on the meaning of narrowly applicable statutory term it must give substantial guidance on setting air standards that affect the entire national economy219 even in the latter instance however the court asserted that congress need not pr ovide determinate criterion for saying how much of the regula ted harm is too much 220 finally the supreme court rejected the d c circuits approach of allowing the agency rather than congress an opportunity to supply the missing intelligible principle221 with its decision in whitman the supreme court appears to have discouraged judicial invocation of the nondelegation doctr ine

unbounded the court found the delegation lawful unlike cases where the agencys claimed power encompassed all american ente rprise here epa must make number of fact findings eg emissions migrating into nother state that confined the statute to modest role delegations of narrow scope the court said based on its reading of precedent can be effectively standardless pendulum has not swung all the way back to somnolence to be sure the court in whitman cited with approva l many of its laxest nondele gation precedents still the courts insistence that regulations of national application be predicated on substantial guidance from congress appears to be new component of the doctrine or at least one that has not been made ex plicit before now if substantial guidance is to have any meaning at all rumors of the demise of the nondelegation doctrine may in the familiar expression be premature it is difficu lt for example to discern even an amorphous statutory standard for the granting of individual permits under the clean water act wetlands permitting program223 perhaps the most important statement in whitman for environmental law purposes is that the substantial guidance required for national regulations does not require congress to specify how much of th regulated harm is too much thus the typical standards for how protective fe deral regulation must be for example necessary to protect human health and the environment under the resource conservation and recovery act224 or when needed to address emissions that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger pub lic health or welfare under the clean air acts mobile sources title225 should pass muster readily regulations of lessthan national scope would seem to be virtually unassailable226 addendum 2 article iis vesting of

however some justices of th court recently have signalled interest the locus of concern is the citizensuit device in many federal environmental statutes especially its use to seek civil penalties

however an ample body of districtcourt decisions beginning in the 1980s unanimously reject the article ii argument in connection with citi zen suits under the clean water act231 and emergency planning and co mmunity righttoknow act232 these courts endorsed four key arguments first they say the separationofpower s decisions relied on by citizensuit defendants are inapposite those cases implicate the constitutions concern that one branch of government not expand its powers at the expense of another branch of government eg c ongress expanding its powers into the law enforcing domain of the executive branch they do not stand for the proposition that private persons who are not controlled by congre ss may not enforce federal laws second the appointments clause does not pr eclude private

the united states to intervene in the suit233 to amplify on the fourth point the in itiation of citizen suit most definitely can affect how an agency allocates its enfo rcement resources if for example epa became concerned that arguments raised by citizensuit defenda nt were not being adequately addressed by the plaintiff the agency might fear that the courts decision would make bad law from its poi nt of view that fear might effectively compel the agency to intervene in the suit shifting its attorneys from other enforcement efforts the skewing of agency resource allocation i nvolved in such citizensuit scenarios has not been seen by courts as infringing on executive branch lawenforcement responsibilities to constitutionally suspect degree thus far the new crop of article iicitizensuit decisions has fallen in line with the first generation rejectin g the constitutional challenge234 it is tempting therefore to dismiss the current cases as posing little threat to this privateenforcement mechanism unlike the first generation of cases however defense counsel in the current litigation have clear suggestion from the supreme court that it might be interested in hearing an artic ii challenge one can ex pect therefore that counsel will press these cases to the petition for certio rari stage but though justices scalia and thomas likely would respond sympatheti cally to

universally rejected by the courts as the above indicates the most sign ificant of these constitutional bounds for congress environmental initiatives are the commerce clause and the takings clause where is the supreme court headed in the application of our five constitutional constraints most obviously the 5justi ce conservative majority seems intent on nudging the jurisprudence toward greater

section 5 of the fourteenth amendment237 at minimum congressional drafters should be aware that the days of reflexive judi cial acceptance of statutory findings may in select constitutional areas be over when the courts constitutional analysis occurs in an environmental case there seems to be an additional consideration commentator s have observed that the supreme courts warm endorsement of

three votes chief jus tice rehnquist and justices sca lia and thomas out of the required five for any significant constitutional voiding of federal environmental law240 of course new appoi ntments to the court may alter these numbers moreover if in fact there is decreased friendliness on the court towards federal environmental statut it probably should be understood not as an antipathy towards the broad goals of such laws ra ther the unease of the courts conservative majority likely stems from some of the recu rring features of fe deral environmental statutes increased regulation and federal bureaucracy expansive construction of the commerce clause broadened st anding rules contracti on of permissible property uses and insertion of federal standards into realms of historic state and local control each of these features has been asserted by some commentators to be necessitated by current environmental problems while opposed by others such as free market environmentalists either way
