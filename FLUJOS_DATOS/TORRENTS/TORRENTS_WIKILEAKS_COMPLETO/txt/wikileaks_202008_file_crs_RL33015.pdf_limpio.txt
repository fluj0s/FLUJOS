diﬀerent socio economic proﬁle than both us citizens and persons both naturalized us citizens and noncitizens from current totalization countries workers from totalization countries tend to have more education and higher earnings than workers born in the united states or in mexico noncitizens from mexico tend to be younger and have higher labor force participation rates than naturalized us citizens from mexico and other us citizens in addition mexican noncitizens and naturalized us citizens from mexico in the us labor force tend to have more dependents in their us households because mexican workers may have lower lifetime earnings they may receive higher replacement rate relative to the payroll taxes they pay than workers with higher lifetime earnings such as us citizens and noncitizens from the totalization countrieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33015congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congress received through the crs weborder code rl33015

countries summary on june 29 2004 the united states and mexico signed social security totalization agreement the effects of which depend on the ye t to be disclosed language of the agreement totalization agreement coordinates the payment of social security taxes and benefits for workers who divide their careers between two countries the agreement has not been tr ansmitted to congress for review which is required under law before the agreement can go into effect this report does not attempt to estimate the potential cost of totalization agreement with mexico or reach conclusion on the effects of such an agreement on us workers and employers instead this report explores one of the issues concerning such an agreement using different socioeconomic characteristics the report compares persons born in mexico and living in the united states both naturalized us citizens and noncitizens with persons born in the cu rrent totalization c ountries and living in the united states the social security program provides m onthly cash benefits to qualified retired and disabled workers their dependent s and survivors of deceased workers generally worker must have 10 years of social

in the united states without authorization there are some exceptions generally the work of aliens who are citizens of country with which the united states has totaliz ation agreement is not covered by social security if they work in the united states for less than five years in addition by statute the work of aliens under certain visa categories is not covered by social security currently ce mexico meets the definition of social insurance country mexican worker may receive us social security benefits outside the united states family members of the mexican worker must have lived in the united states for at least five years to receive benefits outside the united states but typically under totalization agreement this requirement is waived this report concludes that the mexican population in the united states has different socioeconomic profile than both us citizens and persons both naturalized us citizens and noncitizens from current totalization countries workers from totalization countries tend to have more education and higher earnings than workers born in the united states or in mexico noncitizens from mexico tend to be younger and have higher labor for ce participation rates than naturalized us citizens from mexico and othe r us citizens in addition mexican noncitizens and naturalized us citizens from mexico in the us labor force tend to have more dependents in their us households b ecause mexican workers may have lower lifetime earnings they may receive higher replacement rate relative to the payroll taxes they pay than workers with higher lifetime earnings

work of alie ns under certain visa categories such as h2a agricultural workers f and m students is not covered by social security 7in 2005 social securitycovered workers nd their employers each pay 62 of earnings up to 90000 this amount is indexed to average wage growth the selfemployed pay 124 on net selfemployment income up to 90000 and they may deduct onehalf of payroll taxes from federal income taxes 8if the worker has fewer than 35 years of cove red earnings zeros are entered in the benefit formula the numerator is the sum of the 35 highest years of earnings indexed to average wage growth the denominator is the number of months in the 35year computation period 420 months 9the basic benefit formula for persons or thei r survivors who become eligible for oldage insurance or disability insurance benefits in 2005 or who die in 2005 before becoming eligible for benefits is 90 of the first 627 of aime plus 32 of aime over 627 through 3779 plus 15 of aime over 3779 for more information see crs report 94 27 social security brief facts and statistics by gary sidorthe social security program is financed primarily by mandatory payroll taxes levied on wages and selfemployment income which are paid by the worker and the workers employer noncitizens or aliens who work in social securitycovered employment must pay social security payr oll taxes including those who are in the united states working temporarily and those who may be working in the united states without authorization5 there are some exceptions6 generally the work of aliens who are citizens of country with which the united states has totalization agreement see below is not covered by social security if they are sent by firm in their home country to work in the united states for fewer than five years most jobs in the united states are covered unde r social security about 96 of the work force is required to pay soci security payroll taxes7 benefit formula social security benefits are computed by applying benefit formula to the workers lifetime taxable earnings indexed to reflect the growth in average wages over time an average monthly earnings amount known as the workers average indexed monthly earnings or aime is computed based on the 35 highest years of covered earnings8 the social security benefit computation formula is progressive as it uses bend points to return higher percentages of lowerwage workers lifetime indexed earnings computed on monthly basis for 2005 the bend points used in the benefit formula are 627 and 3779 per month9 if all or most of workers indexed earnings fall under the first or second bend point they will see higher replacement rate of average monthly earni ngs as compared to those whose earnings are above thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33015crs3 10although social security benefits are not base d on workers taxes comparison of taxes paid to benefits received shows that lowerwage earners receive higher return on their taxes than higherwage earners similarly when benefits in the first year of retirement are compared to workers final earnings lowerwa ge earners have larger percentage of their earnings replaced by benefits this socalled tilt in the program is deliberate and has existed since its inception it is one of the social insurance features of the program reflecting the view that social security should provide means through which low wage workers can sustain at least minimal standa rd of living in retirem ent without resorting to welfare crs report rl31086 social security what happens to future benefit levels under various reform

2004 is not subject to the work authorization requirement all of the individuals soci securitycovered earnings will count toward insured status regardle ss of hisher work au thorization status13 because social security is an earned entitlement program there are few restrictions on benefit payments once worker becomes entitled to benefits nonetheless noncitizens in the united states must be lawfully present to receive benefits in the united states14 if noncitizen is entitled to benefits but does not meet the lawful presence requi rement hisher benefits are suspended in such cases noncitizen may receive benef its while residing outside the united states including benefits based on work performed in the united states while the alien lacked authorization to work if heshe meets

citizens who reside outside the country i social insurance country mexico is social insurance country to receive payments outside the united states alien dependents and survivors must have lived in the united states for at least five years previously lawfully or unlawfully and the family relationship to the worker must have existed during that time the law provides several broad exceptions to the fiveyear us residency requirement for example the residency requirement for depe ndents and survivors does not apply if the alien is citizen or resident of country with which the united states has

taxes and the payment of benefits under each countrys so cial security system for workers who split their careers between the two countries without totaliz ation agreement an individual who is sent by us company to work in foreign country and his or her employer must contribute to the social security system s of both countries resulting in dual social security cove rage and taxation based on th same earnings in most cases totalization agreements allow workers and their employers to contribute only to the foreign system if the worker is employed abroad for five or more years or only to the system in their home country if the worker is employed abroad for fewer than five years totalization agreements also allow workers who divide their careers between two countries to combine earnings credits unde r both social security systems thus worker who may lack sufficient covera ge to qualify for benefits under either program may under totalization agreemen t qualify for benef its under one or both systems the benefits of workers who are allowed to combine earnings credits are prorated to reflect the number of years the worker paid into each system the same treatment applies to foreign workers in the united states since 1978 the united states has entered into totalization agreements with 20 countrieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33015crs5 19it should be noted that the pr ovision of section 233e2 that allows for the rejection of totalization agreement upon adoption of re solution of disapproval by either house of congress is an unconstitutional legislative veto ins v chadha 462

naturalized us citizens fro m the totalization countries and mexico are compared separately from us citizens is th at although under the social security act they are treated as us citizens it is possible th at individuals in those groups have previously worked in their country of birth and would have earned credits under both the us social security system and the system of their native country 22of the estimated 103 million unauthorized aliens residing in the united states 57 are from mexico while 23 are from other latin american countries 9 from asia and only 6 are from canada and europe where the majority of the totalization countries are located pew hispanic center estimates of the size and characteristics of the undocumented population by jeffrey passel mar 21 2005 23see appendix b for an explanation of confidence levels 24one of the arguments for totalization agre ement with any country is the savings to individuals and companies when the employer sends the individual to work in the other country since the cps does not have firmlev information this report does not explore how many us companies send workers to br anches in mexico or how many mexican companies send mexican workers to their branches in the united statesgone into effect although the analysis treats individuals from different totalization countries as one group there may be differe nces in socioeconomic characteristics among the countries this variation is explored in appendix for the countries with large enough sample s to be representative the comparisons in this report are based on five groups residing in the united states 1 us citizens 2 noncitizens from mexico 3 naturalized us citizens from mexico20 4 noncitizens from totalization c ountries and 5 naturalized us citizens from the totalization countries21 the group of us citizens excludes naturalized us citizens from mexico and the current totalization countries although one of the issues surrounding the to talization agreement with mexico is the large number of unauthorized mexicans living in the united states compared to the unauthorized alien population fro m the totalization countries it is not possible using cps data to differentiate between aliens who are in the united states legally and those who are unauthorized22 nor is it possible to differentiate between different categories of noncitizens eg legal permanent reside nts temporary workers students refugees asylees etc in addition it is unknown how many of the mexican noncitizens and naturalized us c itizens from mexico in the sample would still qualify for social security benef its without totalization agreement the population characteristics analyzed in this paper were chosen because they relate to aspects of the social security benefit formula eg income and factors that affect income or eligibility eg age number of dependents the comparisons discussed in the text of this report are st atistically significant at the 95 confidence level unless stated otherwise23 24httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33015crs7 table 1 estimated resident population by citizenship status and gender march 2004 in 000s citizen status popul ation

table 1 shows that the number of mexican nationals living in the united states is five times larger than the number of citizens from all totalization countries combine d in addition there are approximately 185000 more naturalized us citizens from xico living in the united states than the number of naturalized us citizens from all totalization countries combined gender table 1 also shows that more than any other group mexican noncitizens are more likely to be male 563 on the other hand noncitizens and naturalized citizens from the totalization countries are more likely to be female 543 and 566 respectively possible reason for the higher percentage of females among naturalized citizens from tota lization countries is that over third 376 of the population is age 65 and over and the proportion of females is greater among those 65 and older for all popula tion groups in the united states see figure 1 for the age distributi ons of the

ages of 16 and 64 compared to 639 of us c itizens one reason for the low labor participation rate among na turalized citizens from the to talization countries is that over third of persons in this

2005 social security covered workers and their employers each pay 62 of earnings up to 90000 this amount is indexed to average wage growth thus higher wage workers pay more into the system than lower wage workers unless both workers are earning over 90000 nonetheless the social security be nefit formula is tilte d so that lower wage workers receive higher replacement rate in social security benefits than workers with higher lifetime earnings occupations several factors may affect relative earnings including work experience education gender industr and occupation and hours worked figure 1

participation rates are hi gher mexican persons in the us labor force tend to have more dependents in their us households because mexican workers may have lower life time earnings they may r eceive higher replacement rate in social security benefits than work ers with higher lifetime earnings the fact that mexican noncitizens tend to spend more years in the labor force does not mean that they

technical paper 63 mar 2000 pp 53 through 55appendix b data and detailed methodology the analysis in this report is ba sed on data from the march 2004 current population survey cps the current population survey cps is household survey conducted by the us bureau of the census for the bureau of labor statistics bls of the us department of labor the monthly cps is the main source of labor force data for the nation including estimates of the monthly unemployment rate the cps collects wide range of demographic social and labor market information currently approximate ly 57000 households are interviewed each month the monthly cps sample is repr esentative of the civilian noninstitutional population it does not include persons on active military duty48 each march the cps asks additional questions about earnings for the previous year49 the bls defines the labor force as the sum of employed and unemployed persons unemployed persons are indivi duals who are not working but who are available and looking for work employed persons are individuals who are working for private or public employer are lfemployed or who work 15 hours or more week as unpaid workers on family farm or business also counted as employed are persons who are temporarily absent fro m work because of illness bad weather vacation job training labormanagement di sputes childcare problems maternity or paternity leave or other family or personal reasons50 citizenship variable the cps uses five categories to define citizenship 1 born in the united states 2 born in puerto rico or anothe r outlying area of the united states 3 born abroad of us citizen parents 4 natura lized citizens and 5 noncitizens for the analysis in this report the first three categories were combined and defined as citizens the group of us citizens excl udes naturalized citizens from mexico and the current totalization countries natura lized us citizens from mexico and the totalization countries were an alyzed separately because it more likely that individuals in those groups would have credits to co mbine under totalization agreement ie compared to naturalized us citizens from other countries and naturalborn us citizens information on place of birth is collect ed for every household member in the cps sample and for the pare nts of every household member individuals born in the united states or its outlying areas or w hose parents were born in the united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33015crs35 51httpwwwcensusgovpopulationwwwcpscpsdefhtml 52us department of labor bureau of labor statistics employment and earnings vol 49 nov 2002 pp 147148or its outlying areas are not asked ques tions about citizenship individuals born outside the united states or its outlying areas and whose parents were born outside the united states or its outlying areas are asked are you citizen of the united states respondents who answer yes are coded as naturalized citizens while respondents who answer are categ orized as noncitizens in the cps individuals for whom birthplace is provi ded are assigned citizenship status during the editing process for example the citizenship status of child may be assigned based on the citizenship status of the childs mother51 the cps does not attempt to verify the accuracy of respons to the questions about citizenship it is not possible using cps data to di fferentiate between di fferent categories of noncitizens eg legal permanen t residents temporary work ers students refugees and asylees nor is it possible to differentiate between aliens who are in the united states legally and those who are unauthorize d thus some of the respondents in the noncitizens category who have ne ver had authorization to work in the united states would be ineligible for social security benefits barring future changes to immigration or social security policy confidence levels the comparisons discussed in this report are statistically significant at the 95 confidence level unless stated otherwise estimates based on survey responses from sample of households have two kinds of error nonsampling error and sampling error examples of nonsampling error in clude information that is misreported and errors made in processing collected info rmation sampling error occurs because sample and not the entire population of hous eholds is surveyed the difference between an estimate based on sample of households nd the actual population value is known as sampling error52 when using sample data researchers typically construct confidence intervals around popula tion estimates c onfidence intervals provide information about the accuracy of estimated values with 95 confidence interval and repeated samples from population 95 of inte rvals will generally include the actual value of population char acteristic for this report confidence intervals were calculated using methodol ogy suggested by the census bureau
