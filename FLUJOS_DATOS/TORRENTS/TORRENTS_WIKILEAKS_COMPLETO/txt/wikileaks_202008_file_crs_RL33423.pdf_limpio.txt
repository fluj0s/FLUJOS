is pr imarily matter of state w is generally based on strict tort liability rather than on negligence this means that plaintiff need prove only that the defendant sold defective pr oduct and that the def ect was the proximate cause of the plaintiffs inju ries due care on the part of the defendant is ordinarily immaterial the purpose of strict tort liability is to insure that the costs of injuries resulting from defective pr oducts are borne by the manufacturers that put such products on the market rather than by the injured persons who are powerless to protect themselves greenman v yuba power products inc 377 p2d 897 cal 1963 the federal interagency task force on product liability under the direction of the department of commer ce in its final report i ssued november 1 1977 found that the cost of product liab ility insurance had risen dramatically making it more difficult for some small firms to obtain ad equate insurance coverage the major causes of the dramatic rise in rates the task force found were irra tional premium setting procedures by insurance companies the manufacture of products that are not as safe as current technologies would llow and uncertainties as to how personal injury litigation is conducted on april 6 1978 the department of commerce released an options paper on product liability and accident compensation issues 43 federal register 14612 it included model

july 20 1978 the carter administra tion unveiled its program to deal with product liability problems the proposals ge nerally followed those suggested by the department of commerce in its options paper the administration also directed that model uniform product liability law be prepared to add stability to products liability law which varies from state to state

which consisted of re presentatives of ten federal agencies and the white house in february 1986 the group issued its report report of the tort policy working group on the causes extent and po licy implications of the current crisis of insurance availability and affordability the report made eight recommendations including the elimination of joint and several liability and of the collateral source rule 100000 cap on non economic damages and 25 cap on the first 100000 in lawyers contingent f ees see glossary regarding terms used in this sentence in march 1987 the to rt policy working group issued another report an update on the liability crisis during the 1980s in response to the liability insurance crisis many states enacted tort reforms intended to limit the rights of injured parties some states limited the right of plaintiff to sue product sellers other than the manufacturer some states permitted awards of punitive da mages only upon proof by clear and convincing evidence or re quired that portion of pun itive damages be paid to state fund some states enacted caps on punitive damages or on noneconomic damages such as pain and suffering some states limited or eliminated joint and several liability or the collateral source rule and some enacted statute of repose see glossary for an explanation of these terms state reforms continued to be enacted through the 1990s and

federal statutes enacted 97th109th congresses consumer representatives and plain tiffs attorneys generally oppose limiting injured parties rights in products liability suits they consider the present system necessary to provide incentives for the manufacture of safe products and to ensure adequate compensation for injured worker s and consumers insurance companies and product manufacturers by contrast hoping to reduce the amount currently paid as the result of products liability suits and seeking national uniformity in products liability law have supported federal produc ts liability reform federal products lia bility statute could bring bout national uniformity with respect to some issues some proposed legislation for example has included federal statute of limitations or federal statute of repos for products liability suitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33423crs3 however some legislative provisions such as one that establishes standard of conduct for the award of punitive damages are necessarily subject to varying interpretations by every federal and state court unless the supr eme court establishes national interpretation of it even if the supreme court does so such provisions application to the facts of particular cases may vary among juries therefore the possibility of uniformity s hould not be overestimated glossary the extent to which each of the following

of repose statute specifying the number of years after product is first sold or distributed within which suit must be filed it supplements the statute of limitations manufacturers favor statutes of repose becau they preclude recovery when products are old consumers oppose th em because they result in suits being barred before injuries even occur strict tort liability liability established if plaintiff proves that product defect caused an injury the plaintiff need not prove that the fendant was negligent subrogation the right of collateral source such as an insurance company or
