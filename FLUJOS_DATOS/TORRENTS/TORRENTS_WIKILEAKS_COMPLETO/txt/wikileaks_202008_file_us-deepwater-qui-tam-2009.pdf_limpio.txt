business within the northern district of texas general background fourth amended complaint page 4 relators employment 5 relator is aware and has reported to several governmental authorities that the government has been c heated to the extent of milli ons of dollars which he learned after being assigned in july 2003 as the d eepwater lead systems engineer for the 123 foot patrol boat operation of t he deepwater information technology systems program relator is concerned about 1 national securi ty breaches and 2 the financial losses to the government as result of the defendants dishonesty in the performance of its obligations to the government for the 123 foot patrol boat m odifications as part of the overall us coast guards integrated deepwater system program 6 relator has been pursuing compla ints up the chain of command in lockheeds organization and government recent ly subsequent to relators complaints the inspector general of the department of homeland security issued stinging public report which criticized lockheeds performance of the modernization of the 123 foot patrol boats see exhibit report office of inspector general an active investigation continues on relators other complaints 7 finally to relators knowledge he is the original source as that term is defined under the false claims act and his co mplaint and his claims are not based upon any public disclosure prior to the date of his filing relator has ex tended cooperation to the government in order to prosecute those res ponsible for defrauding the government and he continues as well to offer his time and kno wledge in order to expedite 1 the remedial repairs to the 123 foot patro l boats 2 the securitization of law enforcement and fourth amended complaint page 5 intelligence agencies communications and 3 t he collection of statutory damages and penalties from the defendant 8 as icgs is joint venture the acts of lockheed and northrop are deemed the acts of the other on matters pertaining to t he venture each of the defendants have violated the fca on some occasions and have agreed to or acquiesced in violations by the other defendant on other occasions therefore the defenda nts herein shall be referenced herein cumulatively as icgs icgs has placed profits before contractual compliance in divers and sundry manners in connection with the integrated deepwater system deepwater contract the shoddy and fraudulent performance of icgs has materially undermined the viabilit of the project and has resu lted in extensive waste and has jeopardized the security of t he united states and its citizens introduction 9 korts background in c4isr c ommand control communications computers intelligence surveillance and re connaissance included six 6 years as communications technician for the us navy one and half 15 years as communications officer for t he us state department incl uding over 6 months as communications engineer for the counterterro rism group and over five 5 years in lockheed as systems engineer seven 7 more years were spent in lockheed in project program and engineering management roles 10 relator complains of several critical curity and safety issues that affect not only the us coast guard but the general public key government agencies such as dod fbi cia and the dea as well as any forei gn governments which the uscg supports fourth amended complaint page 6 these deficiencies created by icgs put our nation at risk and enable our enemies or terrorists to exploit weaknesses including cove rt communications surveillance as result of corrupted systems that icgs has created in our newly fiel ded us coast guard systems especially the coast guards 123 patrol boat wpb 123s modernization program 11 icgs corruption of deepwaters assets cumulatively will hamper every mission the uscg undertakes the critical mission areas affected include 1 drug interdiction 2 search and rescue 3 supporting dod and other government organizations and 4 the protection of our nat ional resources the corruptions or deficiencies have manifested them selves as direct result of knowing intentional and informed design and implementat ion choices made by icgs relator advised the us coast guard and icgs representatives of icgs knowing failures to perform the contract as icgs had otherwise represented to the unit ed states these discrepancies affected not only the eight wpb 123s but any other effort s for which icgs may be leveraging these designs additionally as these defic iencies have corrupted national agency communications security there are likely colla teral damages to other law enforcement and military organizations foreign or domestic that have utilized the same communications systems under the impression that communicati ons were encrypted or protected from eavesdropping when they were not finally the corruption and def iciencies associated with the engine upgrades hull damages and sha ft alignment ultimately resulted in all eight 8 123s being decommissioned resulting in total losses under the contract of the amount spent through the date of the decommissioning by the united states or the contractual amount whichever is greater it subsequently became known that buckling fourth amended complaint page 7 hulls caused shaft misalignment problems renderi ng the 123s unfit for duty the total loss of the boats due to shoddy and deceptive work by icgss management likely caused loss of the total upgrade expenditures of 1175 million per boat or the cumulative sum of 96 million further as result of the decommissi oning of all eight boats because of improper upgrades and repairs the loss of each boats fair market value of 30 million on information and belief or the cumulative sum of 240 million or more had the icgs contract been honestly and properly performed in addition the eight prosecutors srps associated with the eight 123s were lost as well at cost of 13 million while relator was an original source on the engine upgrade and shaft alignment problems occurring at bollinger louisiana he was second hand source through lockheed employee regarding the hull damages relevant dates 12 icgs commenced the deepwater progr am in 2001 relator worked icgss program for lockheed as the deepwater lead s ystems engineer for t he 123s from 72003 to 22004 relator wanted to remain on the program but was removed because of apparent friction arising from his complain ts to his direct management about icgss concealed defects and its improper and shoddy work since then relator has been pursuing various governmental and other channels while seeking remedy for the icgss corruption on the integrated deepwater system contract ids contract fourth amended complaint page 8 summary of issues safety issues 13 relator is aware of the cavalier ttitude of icgss management regarding its false and fraudulent conduct in the performance of the ids contract his personal observations include at least the following crucial safety issues involve three 3 key areas 1 environmental survivability of external equipment 2 the flir video cable 3 the proper labeling of all system cables and 4 t he failure to utilize low smoke cables his awareness of engine upgrade and shaft alignment problems was as result of personal participation in continuous status conferences with bo llinger program managers who complained about those issues those m anagers complained about not being allowed to complete the necessary engine repairs bey ond the core repairs to ensure the proper operation of the engines the same manager s complained about receiving substandard propeller shafts from the associated vendors thus resulting in improper alignment finally an icgs manager in moorestown advised the rela tor that the hulls we re not in acceptable condition and were damaged by use age and co rrosion beyond what was expected when the bid was made as resu lt of all of the above icgs performed service in manner that predestined the failure of the eight 8 boat s due to improper and ineffective retrofitting environmental survivability of equipment 14 additionally relator knows that seve ral critical navigation sensor command and control and communications systems did not meet environmental specifications icgss associated design and implementat ion flaws would lead to 1 equipment degradation or 2 premature failure either of which would result in the boats inability to fourth amended complaint page 9 navigate or communicate clearly in such situations rious physical harm could result to the uscg crews the gener public and the us governm ent agencies for which these vessels are providing joint mission critical s upport similarly the same harm would harm any nation which the mission might be supporting these failures could easily result in the loss of life flir video cable forward looking infrared flir 15 this system is used for navigation relator complained because the external video cable was not weatherproofed failure to provide water proofing on wpb 123s would result in premature fa ilure the loss of system video and the loss of the ability to navigate using the flir system icgss fa ilures in this regard could result in mission failure the loss of the boat and loss of life the consequential damages far outweighed icgss desire to cut corners on cost s in order to maximize profits cable labelingphysical c onfiguration audit issues 16 lockheed martin quality assurance organization found that 80 of the c4isr cabling was incorrectly marked on boat number one the w pb matagorda this situation could lead to mission critical mistakes being made during routine maintenance or repairs these mistakes could result in damage to critical systems such as navigation sensor command and control and communications systems these failures could result in the boats inability to perfo rm their missions and the unacceptable consequences that are attendant to the needless loss of boat and crew fourth amended complaint page 10 security issues 17 relator reported critical security issues which involved two key areas 1 cameravideo surveillance and 2 tempest systems specifically siprnet and shielded cabling videocamera surveillance system 18 camera surveillance system wa s installed on the boats and was supposed to replicate the systems on other boats that system was intended to provide remote 360 degree viewing of the vessel and its perimeter prior to this system the uscg staffed personnel to perform onboat watches the camera system that was installed has two significant blind spots at approximately 10 and 2 oclo ck as viewed from the pilot housebridge these blind spots are significant in size and could permit undetected access to the boats such undetected access c ould result in unwanted boarding of the vessel tampering with the hu ll or enemy destruction of the boat all of which pose great danger to the crew the general pub lic and our national security interests since the uscg shares critical communications systems with law enforcement the m ilitary and other us government agencies these failures could resu lt in loss of life and the loss of vessel tempest failures siprnet shielded cablinglow smoke cables 19 the communications systems on the ve ssel including secure voice systems radio and data siprnet require certain parameters tempest be met in order to be certified for safe and secure use of the system s several significant flaws have corrupted these systems including the danger of icgss use of nonshielded cables when shielded cables were mandated by military and intelli gence standards for secure communications fourth amended complaint page 11 about 100 on each boat as result of these corrupt syst ems these communications systems have been compromised exposi ng intended secure communications to unwanted eavesdropping including all communications of w enforcement intelligence and military organizations that share the same communicati ons systems with the uscg further the failure of icgs to properly incorporate low smoke cables unnecessarily exposes the system to failure and the personnel to dangerous toxic fumes in the event of fire 20 not only is it possible for terroristic or narco governments to eavesdrop but the violation is sufficiently significant to permit these 8 wpb 123 boats to retransmit clear communications traffic from one classified circui t to another thereby making it relatively easy for anyone including our national enemies to access classified us communications within very large area without the need to utilize sophisticated eavesdropping equipment both of these failures in these circumstances could or likely has 1 compromised national security operations 2 lead to loss of life 3 compromised the identities of protected indi viduals andor 4 resulted in the loss of life and property the consequential damages of icgss failure to use shielded cables and low smoke cables are significant in the war on terror the terrorists could hardly have done more damage to the security of t he uscgs secure communications than icgs all recklessly done without conscience in the pursuit of the undeserved profits in fact tempest design issues have now affected new group of assets in the deepwater system of systems the national security cutters nsc lockheed martin refused to perform the tempest design for the nscs until 2008seve ral years late and on information and belief given the predicate conduct on the 123s not until after they had extracted extra fourth amended complaint page 12 funding from the coast guard to create th is design which should have been completed properly for the 123 cutters because of lockheed martins delay northrop grumman proceeded with the nsc vessel design prior to co mpletion of the tempest design this outoforder process caused seri ous problems in the nscs in addition the instrumented tempest testing is now more than one year late all of these nsc issues are consequences of icgs failures in connection with the eight 123s addressing the corruption i environmental survivability of externally mounted equipment summary 21 the externally mounted equipment will in all likelihood not survive the environmental requirements specif ied in the contract thes environmental areas include but are not limited to temper ature humidity shock and

the impact it should be noted that relator made certain that icgss higher management understood t he risks and dangers associated with these corruptions and deficiencies all of which could easily hav remedied before the delivery of the first boat impact to the mission 22 systems potentially affected 1 navigation 2 sensor and 3 command and control and communications systems failu res in any one or more of these areas could render the vessel unable to navigate or communicate this risks the lives of the crew any partnering organiza tions or vessels and the general public catastrophic situation could result in major ss of life and the loss of the vessel resolution 23 the requirements would have to be changed or the equipm ent replaced or modified to meet specs additional docum entation and training changes would have to be incorporated these activities would in clude significant material and labor costs cost of resolution 24 if any equipment has to be modified or replaced depending on the quantity of those changes the cost could be tens of thousands or easily in the millions of dollars per boat damages caused to the mission or any other organizations depending on the wpb 123s to execute assigned missions could be incalculable fourth amended complaint page 14 relevant details 25 environmental requirements were not flowed down by the icgss lockheed sos team after not bef ore the final design review the equipment was purchased and installation began standard engineering proc esses dictated however that the requirements had to be establis hed prior to the design review icgs knew this but disregarded proper design protocol 26 upon receipt of this information relator directed his team to evaluate whether or not the equipment icgs had purchased and installed met specifications the first device for which we had response was the flir system it failed to meet temperature requirements when relator informed ic gss management about the defect management directed relators team not to review any more of the equipment for compliance 27 later relator understood that icgs order ed topside study to review the rest of the equipment and that icgs fixed the flir however relator does not know that as fact ii flir video cable summary 28 relator reported to icgss management that the cables used to transfer the flir video signal from the exte rnally mounted sensor to the internal systems were not the correct type and were not weat herproof they were not manufactured to be installed externally that is to be exposed to any element s again it should be noted that relator raised this issue in timely fashion and icgs could easily have remedied the defects fourth amended complaint page 15 before delivery of the first boat impact to the mission 29 failure of the cables will lead to ss of system video this will render the crucial navigation system inoperabl this situation could l eave the vessel incapacitated and unable to carry out the mission this could result in loss of life and the vessel resolution 30 the requirements would have to be changed or the equipm ent replaced or modified to meet specs these activiti would include material and labor costs cost of resolution 31 the costs would require the replac ement of the nonindicated cables and changes to documentation this would invo lve material and labor charges relators estimate for remedial repairs or modifications is not less than several thousand dollars per vessel relevant details 32 notwithstanding to objective dangers icgss management refused to swap out the improper cables and took the position that the cables would simply be replaced when they failed iii physical configuration audit pca nonlabeled cables boat 1 matagorda summary 33 physical configuration audits pca are contractually ma ndated inspections to ensure that the installation of the systems matches the des ign relevant documentation fourth amended complaint page 16 and equipmentcable labeling the pca of the first boat the matagorda showed 80 of the cables were mislabeled this situation could lead to mistakes being made during routine maintenance or repairs resulting in pr ospective critical system failures again relator put icgss management on notice of the nonindicated cables pr ior to the delivery of the first boat but icgs refused to utilize compliant cables impact to the mission 34 the above mistakes could result in damage to critical systems such as navigation sensor command and control and co mmunications systems these failures could result in the boats inability to per form their missions and ll of the attendant consequential problems and damages resolution 35 cables must be relabeled cost of resolution 36 conservative estimate of labor and material to accomplish the remedial repairs would be 100000 per boat relevant details 37 when notified about this cable corr uption icgss management refused to make corrections management preferred to assign the problem to the shipyards even though icgs gave them the inco rrect labels icgss management also took the dubious position that the problem would affect only ic gss personnel since we were responsible for depot maintenance and repair in other words icgs was not going to correct corrupted system that it constructed fourth amended complaint page 17 iv videocamera surveillance system summary 38 there is camera surveillance system installed on the boats it affords remote 360 degree viewing of the vessel and it s perimeter the camera system has two significant blind spots at approximately 10 and 2 oclo ck as viewed from the pilot housebridge these blind spot s are significant in size and could permit undetected access to the boats again it s hould be noted that icgs was fully briefed by relator on these issues before the delivery of the first boat and icgs could easily have been remedied before the delivery of the first boat impact to the mission 39 lockheeds decision resulted in ex posing the wpb 123s to undetected enemy access which could result in 1 unwanted boarding of the vessel 2 tampering with the hull or 3 sinking the boat this action could pose danger to the crew the general public and our national security intere sts because the uscg shares critical communications systems with other us gov ernment law enforcement intelligence and military agencies these failures could predict ably result in loss of life and the vessel resolution two options 40 first the uscg could keep the flawed system as is and budget for personnel to serve as watch standers to cover the blind spots that is as was done before the installation of the systems cameras this would mean the uscg would have to fourth amended complaint page 18 maintain flawed system sacrificing the benefits of dec reased manpower and costs previously associated with assigning staff used to watch the boats in uscg port 41 second the uscg c ould add the omitted camera on each boat and update the documentation the latter of whic h is clearly the preferred remedy cost of resolution 42 the cost of the first option would need to be assessed by the uscg there was material cost savings associated with the use of the surveillance cameras 43 the cost of the second option by addi ng the omitted camera is estimated to be 25k per boat relevant details 44 icgs received requirements to insta ll 2 mast mounted mo vable cameras an implementation used for quite some time in the uscg 45 originally icgs was supposed to pr ocure the cameras and install them provide the video and control circuitry and as well as the shore connection box 46 the cameras purpose was to permit re mote monitoring of the boat when in uscg port watch standers would be required if the system was properly installed 47 internal arguments ensued within icgs regarding who would buy the cameras 48 relator requested that lockheed take over icgss effort in order to stay on schedule 49 decision was made to install four 4 fixed cameras on the pilot house while relator liked the idea of fixed cameras as one could sneak around moving fourth amended complaint page 19 camera relator knew that management was assuming each camera had 90 degree field of view relator later l earned that fixed cameras were selected because icgs did not include the control circuitry 50 relator asked ships integration to utilize the camera specs and ships design to plot the views ships integration re sponded that 1 the cameras did not afford 90 degree field of view and 2 mount ing cameras in favorable locations would be problematic due to other items installed on t he pilot house relator was told there would be blind spots 51 these blinds spots were at 1 ocl ock and 2 oclock directly over the pilot housebridge windows the blind spots were over 10ft wide on the deck and hundreds of yards wide to the horizon relator told icgss management that relators team needed to install one 1 more camera and shift the existing forward camera over to cover the blind spots icgss management said the design of record was 4 cameras cameras had been purchased or installed at that time 52 icgss management responded by lling relator that there was 360 degree requirement relator responded that it was known that the uscg currently had ships with 2 masts mounted moving cameras that supplied 360 degree of view icgss management refused to concede the obvious icgs did however permit relator to talk to the uscg tech rep about the defective design 53 the uscg tech rep expressi ng scheduling pressure appeared to acquiesce to icgss refusals noting that the blind spots would be covered by the locking of the pilot housebridge windows he thought that any covert entry would be discovered by observing broken glass relator inquired about how the blind spot s and the locked pilot fourth amended complaint page 20 housebridge windows would prevent an intruder from planting an explosive charge on the boat for which neither he nor ic gs offered an acceptable response the tech rep said icgs would have to seek waiver for less than 360 degree coverage 54 relator pointed out that the surveillance defect could have been remedied by simply installing an additional camera at cost of under 1000 55 some time after this the uscg secu rity inspector inspected the boat his report stated the boat didnt hav the standard 2 camera mast solution but that he had 4 fixed cameras and that it appeared that the boat had 360 degree views this established that 360 degree view was requirement 56 after reading the uscg security ins pectors report relator informed icgss management that the 360 degree requirement was indeed valid and that icgs had an obligation to tell the inspector that the system had two 2 material blind spots of which they were aware 57 icgss management responded it was not icgss fault that the inspector missed the blind spots or that the inspector wrote and conducted faulty test 58 unaware of the blind spots and the corrupted surveillance system the us cg accepted the design all 8 boats have the blind spots fourth amended complaint page 21 v classified communication ce rtification deficiencies siprnet tempest shielded cabling requirement defects summary 59 the communications systems on the ve ssel including secure voice systems for radio and data siprnet required certain security parameters tempest be satisfied in order to be certified for use there are veral significant flaws in these areas including the use of nonshielded cables where shielded cables shoul d have been used about 100 on each boat these deficiencies have re sulted in corrupted communications systems which are exposed to the unwanted eavesdr opping on all governmental organizations including law enforcement intelligence and milit ary that share the same communications systems national security has probably ready been compromised by the absence of nonshielded cables for instance the coast g uards own press releases have stated that several of the 123s used the cl assified siprnet system on missions to cuba as before these issues were acknowledged and c ould easily have been remedied before the delivery of the first boat impact to the mission 60 these defects including the cables could easily 1 compromise national security 2 compromise mission operations 3 compromise identities of protected individuals and 4 result in the unnecessary ss of life and property not only is it possible for other governments to eavesdrop on secure communications but the defective cables enable these 8 boats to retransmit clear communicati ons traffic from one classified circuit to another thereby making it relatively easy for anyone including the enemies of our fourth amended complaint page 22 country to access classified communications within very large area even globally resolution 61 the complete rerunning of t he tempest and siprnet certification procedures need to be done visual and instrument ed all failures should be addressed where feasible small vessels such as the 123s sometimes receive waivers for redblack separation etc if the visual report from icgs is accurate and discloses the full extent of the issues document can be pr ovided then the estimated cost must include replacing 100 cables and fixing other problems such as but not limited to grounding bonding and separation failures additionally there would have to be documentat ion changes and more tests would need to be performed lastly if other government agencie s law enforcement intelligence or military have already been compromised they would need to perform damage assessment cost of resolution 62 if other government agencies secur ed communications have already been compromised the remedial costs could be significant 63 if the costs are confi ned to the errors in the icgss visual tempest inspection report rather than full audit t he remedial costs would exceed 25000000 per boat relevant details 64 again well after the design review and t he equipment was purchased relators team first received the tempest requirementsthe opposite of the sequence fourth amended complaint page 23 which should have occurred t hose requirements called for the standard set of military sea going requirements shielding grounding bonding separation of equipment etc 65 icgss chief engineer on the program had directed months before that icgs not buy the requisite shielded cables becaus they were too expensive not bid the requirements were never changed and the defect was not disclosed by management 66 until this point icgs had not in volved anyone on the project who had tempest background despite the fact that icgs partners had some employees with that critical background 67 at the time the 123 matagorda was being tested and well after the design had been completed and most of the equipm ent had been procured lockheed technical teams contended in communications with coast g uard technical teams that there were tempest requirements for the 123s the c oast guard technical authority stated that because the requirements in cluded secret communications radio systems tempest requirements were inherently included th is is because tempest requirements are standard government and industry wide in connection with the relevant secure radio communications systems as such the tem pest standards were requirements and not guidance lockheeds ships integrat ion team prepared report on what our tempest solutions should be they did an ex cellent job given t hat the engineer had not previously worked tempest the tem pest engineer whom icgss lockheed had on its staff was not asked to participate the report clearly reported that shielded cables among other noted relevant standards were required for the intended usejust standard operations fourth amended complaint page 24 68 management was informed that to rem edy the defects icgs needed to buy and install shielded cables and fix other probl ems such as but not limited to grounding bonding and separation failures or seek change of the requirements icgs however informed relator that the design of record would stand that it would do neither 69 thereafter icgs arranged for the mpest engineer from sh ips integration to perform site in spection icgs failed several areas including the shielded cables issue and other problems such as but not limited to gr ounding bonding and separation failures 70 initially icgs agreed to fix the vis ual failures icgss management asked relators team to draft an impact and resolution document the result wa s that most of the fixes would add significant cost and schedul upon hearing this icgss management decided to wait until the instrumented test to see if it could pass effort was made to buy or install the required sh ielded cables based on the visual test failure or fix other problems such as but not limited to grounding bonding and separation failures 71 two and onehalf 25 years later all 8 boats have had the predictable siprnet certification problems relator independently confirmed that shielded cables have not been installed and other problems such as but not limited to grounding bonding and separation failures have not been fixed thus the parade of horribles continues daily 72 relator had contacted several tempest inspectors around the country all of them confirmed that the chances of passing bona fide test were extremely unlikely without shielded cables similarl the boats were unlikely to pass bona fide test without fixing other problems such as but not limited to grounding bonding and separation failures fourth amended complaint page 25 73 relator believes that icgs and t he uscg have either 1 gun decked the tests or 2 lowered the requi rements on information and belief relator is virtually certain that every other uscg or navy sh ip in the present fleet has sh ielded cables in their secure communication systems security does not otherwise exist on those ships ironically icgs took shielded cables off these boats when relators team installed the nonshielded cables 74 as the uscg now has requirement to be able to communicate with dod and several other law enforcem ent or military organizations the communications between those entities and the uscg are at severe risk any enemy or foreign government monitoring these boats from shore or from fishing boats will be abl to pick up all the secured communications from these boats si nce the uscg has shielded cables on these patrol boats the cabl will emanate like antennae additionally the boats could retransmit clear bleedover information from ot her circuits the communications heard will be in the clear and easily underst ood this is not good thing according to homeland security see exhibit b email complaint to ceo of lockheed from michael kort 75 relator has learned recently that related test result failures were illegally waived by the test branch of the uscg 76 regarding siprnet the department of homeland security igs report stated that the contractor admitted t here were issues but that they could not be fixed without rendering the system inoperable without disclosing icgss comp licity in the corruption of the system fourth amended complaint page 26 77 regarding siprnet certif ication organization in april 2006 well after the boats became operational admonished the icgs that it would allow 45 days to correct the problems or the accreditation would be pulled relator does not believe that icgs has addressed constructively all the indicat ed problems the same problems which could easily have been avoided in time manner vi low smoke cable defects summary 78 lockheed martin failed to install low smoke cables on the 123s at the time relator left the effort he was told that icgs was going to waive the requirement since then the dhs ig report on 123 c4sir has c oncluded that granting the waiver was inappropriate and that the cables should be replaced this defect was disclosed in the report filed by relator with the department of homeland security in spector general dhs ig in february of 2006 because the ig had r equested complete listing of any issues that relator felt had been handl ed improperly even if relator thought the issue was closed information provided by relator wa s the basis of the inspector generals 123 report the issue was also included in mo st of relators requests to lockheed management to fix the problems on the 123s impact to the mission 79 failure to use these cables could result in excessive damage to electronic systems even

documentation updated this should include as in other filings review of ever c41sr asset for any similar c41sr problems cost of resolution 81 if only the 123s are affected 80 cables per boat if any other assets are affected then the cost would increase due to more cables being installed engine upgrades shaft alignment and hull damages summary 82 the relator was aware of the bollinger program managers complaints to northrop and the coast guard that bollinger was unable to upgrade any of the equipment attached to the engines while they were r ebuilding the engine blocks those managers complained that unless they or someone else per formed the critical rebuilding services the engines would not run properly and would fail pr ematurely recent events have revealed that the program managers compla ints were not seriously heeded 83 during those same continuous status conferences with the bollinger program managers relator also became aware of their complaints that the pr opeller shafts received from the associated vendor we re in substandard condition the program managers were extremely concerned that the shafts would not align properly recent events indicate that northrop and icgs failed to attend to this rious problem resulting in part in the decommissioning of all eight 8 123s 84 finally the relator was aware th rough lockheed employee of icgs in moorestown new jersey that in the summer of fall of 2004 icgs was informed that the fourth amended complaint page 28 hulls were damaged beyond that which was cont emplated or bid by icgs the damage from use age and corrosion was not addressed in order to prevent the corruption of the eight 8 123s recent events have indica ted that icgs management failed to address these issues as well impact to the mission 85 each of these issues could contribut or directly cause core ship systems failure which apparently they have resolution 86 engine issues repair or repl ace all ancillary engine equipment and components which should have been address during the engine upgrades 87 propeller issue repair or replace the propeller shafts 88 hull damages repair replace or engineer hull components that are required in order to ensure the integrity of the hulls costs of resolution 89 as each of the eight 8 123s was decommissioned due to problems on the vessels primarily associated with the mechanica l electrical and hull issues the resulting costs would be the greater of the original upgrade cost for ea ch vessel or the amount spent by the united states whichever is greater that is assumi ng that 1175 million was spent on the upgrades on each of the eight 8 123s 90 as result of the decommissioning of all eight 8 123s the total cost or damages are approximately the cumulative sum of 96 million fourth amended complaint page 29 relevant details 91 the extent of relators knowledge is being party to the conversations on these topics relators primary responsib ility was c4isr not hull mechanical and electrical overall costs associated with resolution of the issues safety issues environmental survivability of ex ternal equipment and cable labeling 92 costs associated with the resolution of these issues would primarily involve the vessel on which the discrepancies exist however should the vessels be part of critical event or working jointly with other organizations in critic event the boats capabilities may be degraded to point where the vessel is unusable thereby posing serious risks to the missions in which it is actively participating in such an event the costs would be great and the consequential costs could be immense specific costs will be estimated in following sections however due to recent events relator is aware that all eight 8 of the 123s have been decommissioned by the coast guard thus resulting in at least the loss of the upgrade funds spent on the eight 8 123s or the sum of 96 million and the loss of all eight 8 boats which were previously seaworthy due to the decommissioning of each of the boats on information and belief had the upgrades been properly performed the fair market value of each of the boats would have been not less than 30 million and that sum may be far s hort of the real value thus the decommissioning resulted in loss of contempl ated benefits of not ss than 30 million or cumulative sum of 240 million fourth amended complaint page 30 security issues 93 video surveillance costs associat ed with the resolution of these issues would primarily involve the vessel on which t he discrepancies exist specific costs will be estimated by discrepancy type below 94 classified communications issues tempest costs associated with the resolution of these issues would involve the vessels for which these have deficiencies are present but must also include the costs relating to compromised classified communications of several law enforcem ent and military organizations within our government as well as foreign governments in order to ascertain this cost each organization would have to ev aluate whether communications have been compromised the likely period of the infraction as well as esti mate the damage to the security of the agency or the nation types of information that could have been compromised 1 mission parameters 2 ship or troop location 3 names of protected personnel total cost estimates labor and materials 95 minimum remedial damages for icgss objective performance defects are in excess of 40000000 for each of deepwaters 123 foot patrol boat s cumulatively the minimum remedial amount needed to correct known and identified problems with the 123 foot patrol boats is 320000000 for the 8 boats 96 if the boats exterior equipment surv ivability is an issue across wide array of systems the remedial costs would easily exceed 2 million per boat fourth amended complaint page 31 97 estimated turnkey damages are 1920000000 for the eight 8 boats the damages caused by icgs may well be an order of magnitude much greater than this sum if the secure communications systems of our government have been eavesdropped by criminals and enemies 98 if these defective designs are being leveraged on other projects per the policy of system of systems requirement there will be similar ty pe damages for each of those platforms as well as changes that must be m ade conservative estimate of those projects damages if any would be the same costs as for the 123s per platform 99 if national security has been damaged as result of breaches of the ostensible secure communications system s each affected organization whose communications have been compromised would have to do an audited damages assessment this cost would be geometrica lly greater than the known damages outlined above 100 due to recent developments it is now objectively conceded that the deficiencies and corruption attendant to the upgr ades and repairs to the eight 8 123s has resulted at least in the loss of the 96 m illion paid by the government for the upgrades and repairs moreover the recent decommissioni ng of the eight 8 123s and the eight 8 associated srps on information and belief if the upgrades and repairs had been properly performed the fair market value of each of the 123s would hav been not less than 30 million per boat or cumulatively the sum of 240 million that loss is real and the united states has suffered that loss yet t he eight 8 123s had preicgs seaworthiness and operational value of an estimated 10 million eac h all of which has been destroyed for fourth amended complaint page 32 an additional cumulative loss in excess of 80 million false

awarding icgs the deepwater contract in july of 2002 in proposalpl anning meetings icgs developed strategy of persuading the coast guard to delete its standard will or s hall language from much of the requirements portions of t he deepwater contract icgss expressed intention was to persuade the coast guard to replace requirements language with guidance language allowing icgs nearly unlimited latitude in dev eloping the deepwater system of systems icgs planned to promise the coast guard t hat icgs would deliver superior design and products if the coast g uard would untie the contractors hands from firm requirements in the course of these planning meetings relator objected specifically to the absence of any other c4isr experts from t he planned staffing of the deepwat er project and objected to fourth amended complaint page 34 the substitution of guidance language for requirem ents icgs not only did not staff the deepwater team with additional qualified c4isr experts it removed relator from the project virtually guaranteeing t he c4isr would not be superior design but much less adequate one 107 about year and half later in t he summer of 2003 relator was once again assigned to the deepwater project at that time he learned that ic gs had succeeded with its guidance pitch the contractual proj ect requirements included guidance language rather than firm shall or will requirements 108 icgs did not intend or believeand this was clear from the discussions at proposalplanning meetings attended by relato rthat guidance language rather than firm requirements language in the deepwater ct would produce superior design and products rather icgs simply wanted the contract to give it latitude to conduct the work in whatever manner it saw fit and to limit its re sponsibility for any problems encountered in the course of the program those false statements were material to the united states coast guard 109 because of these false statem ents and fraudulent
