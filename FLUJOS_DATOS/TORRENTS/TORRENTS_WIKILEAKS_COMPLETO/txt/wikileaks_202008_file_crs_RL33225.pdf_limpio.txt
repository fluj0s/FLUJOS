supreme court justices has undergone changes over two centuries but its most basic feature the sharing of power between the president and senate has remained unchanged to receive lifetime appointment to the court candidate must first be nominated by the president and then confirmed by the senate key role also has come to be played midway in the process by the senate judiciary committee table 1 of this report lists and describes actions taken by the senate the senate judiciary committee and the president on all supreme court nominations from 1789 to the present the table provides the name of each person nominated to the court and the name of the president making the nomination it also tracks the dates of formal actions taken and time elapsing between these actions by the senate or senate judiciary committee on each nomination starting with the date that the senate received the nomination from the president thirtynine of the 42 presidents in the history of the united states have made total of 158 nominations to the supreme court of which 122 more than threequarters received senate confirmation also on 12 occasions in the nation s history presidents have made temporary recess appointments to the court without submitting nominations to the senate of the 36 unsuccessful supreme court nominations 11 were rejected in senate rollcall votes 11 were withdrawn by the president and 14 lapsed at the end of session of congress total of 115 of the 158 nominations were referred to senate committee with 114 of them to the judiciary committee including almost all nominations since 1868 prior to 1916 the judiciary committee considered these nominations behind closed doors since 1946 however almost all nominees have received public confirmation hearings most recent hearings have lasted four or more days in recent decades from the late 1960s to the present the judiciary committee has tended to take more time before starting hearings and casting final votes on supreme court nominations than it did previously the median time taken for the full senate to take final action on supreme court nominations also has increased in recent decades dwarfing the median time taken on earlier nominations for another perspective on supreme court nominations focusing among other things on when the senate first became aware of each presidents nominee selections eg via public

appointing justice to the supreme court of the united states is provided for by the constitution in only few words the appointments clause article ii section 2 clause 2 states that the president shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall appoint judges of the supreme court the process of appointing justices has undergone changes over two centuries but its most basic featurethe sharing of power between the president and senatehas remained unchanged to receive lifetime appointment to the court candidate must first be nominated by the president and then confirmed by the senate an important role also has come to be played midway in the process after the president selects but before the senate considers by the senate judiciary committee on rare occasions presidents also have made supreme court appointments without the senates consent when the senate was in recess such recess appointments however were temporary with their terms expiring at the end of the senates next session the last recess appointments to the court were made in the 1950s the appointment of supreme court justice might or might not proceed smoothly from the first appointments in 1789 the senate has confirmed 122 out of 158 court nominations of the 36 unsuccessful nominations 11 were rejected in senate rollcall votes while nearly all of the rest in the face of committee or senate opposition to th nominee or the president were withdrawn by the president or were postponed tabled or never voted on by the senate

perspective on the emergence and then increased involvement of the senate judiciary committee in the appointment process specifically the table lists for each supreme court nomination the following name of the person nominated the nominee name of the president who made the nomination date the nomination was made by the president and received in the senate 1 dates of any committee hearings held on the nomination that were open to the public 1 usually the date on which the president formally makes nomination by signing nomination message is the same as the date on which the nomination is received in the senate in table 1 these two dates are the same for any given nomination when only one date is shown in the date received in senate column however for the occasional nomination made by president on date prior to the nominations receipt by the senate the earlier presidential nomination date is distinguished in parentheses from the date when the nomination was received by the senate

action by the senate or in rarer instances by the president when the final action taken on nomination was its withdrawal by the president table 1 also shows the speed with which action was taken on each nomination specifically presenting the number of days that elapsed from the date the nomination was formally received in the senate until the following the first day of public confirmation hearings if any the date of final committee action if any and the date of final senate action or presidential withdrawal of the nomination the table also lists all recess appointments to the supreme court as well as the later nomination of each recess appointee table 1 it should be emphasized tracks the dates of formal actions taken by the president the senate and the senate judiciary committee on each supreme court nomination the table for example records the dates that nominations were actually made and transmitted by the president to the senate the table however does not track the dates on which presidents announced the intention to nominate someone to be justice or on which the senate informally first became aware of each presidents nominee selections discussion focusing more closely on such informal steps in the supreme court appointment process can be found in crs report rl33118 speed of presidential and senate actions on supreme court nominations 19002006 actions by the full senate tracked systematically in table 1 are those on which the senate took final action ordinarily in the form of confirmation and less often in the form of rejecting tabling or postponing action on nomination for certain supreme court nominations table 1 also provides dates of procedural actions taken on the senate floor prior to or after final senate action in order to put the final action in fuller context the table however does not account for all senate procedural actions on or for all dates of senate floor consideration of supreme court nominations for more comprehensive information on procedural actions taken by the full senate on past supreme court nominations see crs report rl33247 supreme court nominations senate floor procedure and practice 17892006 in listing all persons ever nominated to the supreme court table 1 includes the names of those who were not confirmed as well as those who were confirmed but did not assume their appointive office 2 list solely of the 110 individuals who assumed office and served on the court with judicial oath dates and service termination dates for each justice is available on the courts website 3 2 table 1 identifies eight supreme court nominees who subsequent to senate confirmation did not assume the office to which they had been appointed seven declined the office and one died before assuming it it should be noted however that one of the seven who declined the office w illiam cushingconfirmed to be chief justice in 1796was at the time serving on the court as an ssociate justice and continued to serve in that capacity until 1810 another of the seven john jayconfirmed to be chief justice in 1800 had served earlier on the court as the courts first chief justice from 1789 to 1795 3 the list available at

presidents in the history of the united states have made nominations to the supreme court6 these 39 are listed in the second column of table 1 all but one of the 39 presidents succeeded in having at least one supreme court nomination receive senate confirmation the one exception was president andrew johnson whose only court nomination of henry stanbery in 1866 was thwarted when the senate enacted legislation eliminating the associate justice position to which stanbery had been nominated7 continued names in all 17 98 includes those of five chief justices who earlier had served as associate justices hence reducing to 110 the total number of persons who have served as members of the court 4 specifically eight persons were nominated twice to the same court position seven to be associate

has varied greatly from president to president for any given president the number of nominations will be affected by various factors including the length of time the president was in office the number of vacancies occurring on the court during that presidency and whether more than one nomination was required to fill court vacancy due to previous nominations failure to be confirmed examination of the nominations to the court for each president reveals that half of the 42 presidents made four or more nominations and half made three or fewer half of the 42 presidents saw three or more of their court nominations confirmed and half saw two or fewer confirmed the president with the most supreme court nominations and confirmations was george washington with 14 nominations 12 of which were confirmed the two presidents with the secondlargest number of court nominations were john tyler and franklin d roosevelt with nine each only one of tylers nine nominations however received senate confirmation while all nine of fdrs were confirmed the president with the largest number of supreme court confirmations in one term apart from the first eight of george washingtons nominationsall in his first term and all confirmed was william howard taft who during his four years in office made six court nominations all of which were confirmed six presidents made only one supreme court nomination each with the nominations of five of these presidents receiving confirmation 8 and as noted above three of the nations 42 presidents were unable to make single nomination to the court because vacancies occurred on the court during their presidencies

appointment process officially begins when the president signs message to the senate nominating someone for appointment to the court usually on the date of the signing the message is delivered to the senate and recorded in the senate executive journal as having been received that day9 however in 30 instances all but two prior to the 20th century supreme court messages were recorded in the senate executive journal as received in the senate on day after they were signed by the presidentusually the next day in table 1 in the date received in senate column second date is provided in parentheses

although referral of supreme court nominations to the senate judiciary committee is now standard practice such referrals were not always the case table 1 shows that 115 of 158 8 the five presidents whose single supreme court nominations received senate confirmation were franklin pierce james garfield william mckinley calvin coolidge and gerald r ford as mentioned above the one president whose single court nomination did not receive confirmation was andrew j ohnson 9 president may announce the selection of nominee well before transmitting nomination message to the senate for instance president george w bush announced his selec tion of samuel alito jr to be supreme court nominee on oct 31 2005 but formally signed and transmitted the nomination of alito to the senate on nov 10 2005

them to the judiciary committee the first standing legislative committees of the senate including the judiciary committee were created in 1816 only once previously was supreme court nomination referred to committee when in 1811 the senate referred the nomination of alexander wolcott to select committee of three members for roughly half century afer the judiciary committees creation nominations rather than being automatically referred to the committee were referred by motion only from 1816 to 1868 more than twothirds of the nominations 26 out of 38 nominations were referred to the committee during this period the confirmation success rate was roughly the same for nominations referred 15 of 26 as it was for those not referred seven out of 12 in 1868 senate rules were changed to provide that all nominations be referred to appropriate standing committees unless otherwise ordered by the senate 10 subsequently from 1868 to the present day 87 of 94 supreme court nominations have been referred to the judiciary committee the seven not referred to committee were persons who at the time of their nomination were former president senator former senator an attorney general and former us representative or former secretary of war11 and all were easily confirmed the last supreme court nomination not referred to the judiciary committee was that of senator james f byrnes in 1941 the senate by unanimous consent considered and confirmed the byrnes nomination without referral to committee on the day it received the nomination from the president

confirmation hearings on supreme court nominationthat of louis d brandeis to be an associate justiceat which outside witnesses but not the nominee testified more days of public hearings 19 were held on the brandeis nomination than on any supreme court nomination since the brandeis hearings however did not set immediately into place new policy of open confirmation hearings for supreme court nominations since each of the ne xt six nominations during the years 1916 to 1923 was either considered directly by the senate without referral to the judiciary committee or was acted on by the committee without the holding of confirmation hearings from 1925 to 1946 public confirmation hearings for supreme court nominations became the more common if not invariable practice of the judiciary committee in 1925 harlan f stone became the first supreme court nominee to appear in person and testify at his confirmation hearings 13 during the next two decades the stone nomination was one of 11 court nominations that received public confirmation hearings before either the full judiciary committee or judiciary subcommittee14 while five other nominations did not receive public hearings one of the five nominees not receiving public confirmation hearing was senator james f byrnes whose nomination in 1941 as noted earlier was considered directly by the senate without referral to the judiciary committee15 not indicated in the public hearing datescolumn is the precise length in minutes or hours of each public hearing session the hearing sessions for few supreme court nominations during 12 at least once in the 19th century however in 1873 the judiciary committee did hear witnesses testify concerning supreme court nominationthat of george h williams to be chief justicebut these two days of hearings on dec 16 and 17 1873 were held in closed session the closeddoor sessions were held to examine documents and hear testimony from witnesses relevant to controversy that arose over the williams nomination only after the committee had reported the nomination to the senate the controversy prompted the senate to recommit the nomination to the judiciary committee and to authorize the committee to send for persons and papers us congress senate journal of the executive proceedings of the senate of the united states of america vol 19 washington gpo 1901 p 189 after holding the two closeddoor sessions on dec 16 and 17 the committee did not rereport the nomination to the senate amid press reports of significant opposition to the nomination both in the judiciary committee and the senate as

over several days16 others however were brief and perfunctory in nature held only long enough to accommodate the small number of witnesses who wished to testify against nominee17 from tom c clarks appointment in 1949 throug h the nomination of samuel alito jr in 20052006 all but three of 34 supreme court nominations have received public confirmation hearings before the senate judiciary committee or judiciary subcommittee18 the first of the three exceptions involved the 1954 nomination of john m harlan ii made less than month before the final adjournment of congress at the beginning of the next congress however harlan was renominated and hearings were held on that nomination19 the second and third exceptions involved the associate justice nominations of john g roberts jr and harriet miers in 2005 both of which were withdrawn by the president before the scheduled start of confirmation hearings

court nomination to another particularly in recent decades following the 19 days of hearings held on the brandeis nomination in 1916 court nominations through the associate justice nomination of abe fortas in 1965 typically received either one or two days of hearings however from 1967 through january 2006 15 of the 21 court nominations which advanced through the hearings stage received four or more days of open confirmation hearings four of the 15 nominations received 11 or more days of hearings 20 while another received eight days of hearings21 by contrast only three of the 21 nominations received two or fewer days of hearings22 16 see in table 1 the multiple hearing days for the nominations of fe lix frankfurter in 1939 and robert h jackson in 1941 17 for example judiciary subcommittee hearing on the 1932 nomination of benjamin n cardozo lasted only five minutes during which one witness testified in opposition likewise when the judiciary committee extended open invitations for witnesses to testify in opposition at the confirmation hearings for stanley f reed in 1938 william douglas in 1939 harlan f stone for chief justice in 1941 wiley b rutledge in 1943 and fred mvinson for chief justice in 1946 witnesses appeared to protest against douglas or stone and only one or two persons filed protests in each case against reed vinson and rutledge farrelly operational aspects pp 194195 18 the last supreme court nomination on which senate judiciary subcommittee held hearings was the 1954 nomination of earl warren to be chief justice the subcommittee held public hearings on the nomination on feb 2 and 19 1954 after which the full committee on feb 24 1954 voted to report the nomination favorably all subsequent hearings on supreme court nominations were held by the full judiciary committee 19 the judiciary committee held two days of confirmation hearings on the second harlan nomination on feb 24 and 25 1955 the feb 24 session held in closed session heard the testimony of nine witnesses seven in favor of confirmation and two opposed luther huston harlan hearing held by senators new york times feb 25 1955 p 8 the committee also began the feb 25 hearing in closed session to hear the testimony of additional witnesses however for judge harlan who was the last scheduled witness the committee voted to open the hearing to newspaper reporters for his testimony luther huston harlan disavows one world aims in senate inquiry new york times feb 26 1955 p 1 20 these were the nominations of robert h bork in 1987 12 hearing days clarence thomas in

supreme court nominations referred to the judiciary committee have almost always been reported to the senate if majority of its members oppose confirmation the judiciary committee technically may decide not to report supreme court nomination this tactic would prevent the full senate from considering the nominee unless the senate were able to undertake successfully the discharge of the committee table 1 however shows that the committee has almost never employed the strategy of not reporting of the 114 supreme court nominations referred to the judiciary committee 106 were reported to the senate 23 the committee has reported these nominations in the following four ways g20g142g153g152g155g157g146g151g144g561 for most of the first five decades in which the judiciary committee considered supreme court nominations 1828 to 1863 its usual practice was simply to report these nominations to the senate without any official indication of the committee members opinions regarding them twentythree nominations were reported to the senate in this way and 15 of them were confirmed g20g142g153g152g155g157g146g151g144g561g160g146g157g145g561g138g561g8g138g159g152g155g138g139g149g142g561g20g142g140g152g150g150g142g151g141g138g157g146g152g151g561 in 1870 the judiciary committee initiated the practice of reporting to the senate an explicit recommendation in favor of confirmation whenever majority of members supported supreme court nominee over the course of almost century and half the committee has favorably reported 72 supreme court nominations with 66 receiving senate confirmation24 g20g142g153g152g155g157g146g151g144g561g25g146g157g145g152g158g157g561g20g142g140g152g150g150g142g151g141g138g157g146g152g151g561 on four occasionsthree times in the late 19th century and once in the late 20th centurythe judiciary committee has voted to report supreme court nomination while explicitly stating it was not making recommendation to the senate on each occasion the committee reported nomination without urging the senate either to confirm or to reject 25 the senate confirmed three of the nominations that were reported in this way while rejecting the fourth26 23 as noted earlier only once prior to the establishment of the judiciary committee in 1816 was supreme court nomination referred to committee and that nominatio n was reported to the senate as well see in table 1 the nomination in 1811 of alexander wolcott which was considered by select committee and then reported to the senate where it was rejected by 924 vote 24 the six favorably reported nominations which failed to receive senate confirmation involved these nominees george h williams for chief justice in 1873 nomin ation withdrawn caleb cushing in 1874 nomination withdrawn pierce butler in 1922 action taken by senate abe fortas for chief justice in 1968 nomination withdrawn clement f haynsworth jr in 1969 rejected by senate and g harrold carswell in 1970 rejected by senate butler it should be noted was renominated and confirmed 25 report that states it is not accompanied by recommendation can be way to alert the senate that substantial number of committee members have some reservations about the nominee which however do not rise at that point to the level of opposition it might also be way to bridge or downplay differences between committee members who favor confirmation and other members who oppose it the latter for example was said to be the purpose for the judiciary committee in 1888 reporting the chief justice nomination of melville w fuller without recommendation the action was described in news account as compromise between the democratic minority who desired report to the senate in favor of confirmation and the republican majority who desired to defeat the nomination mr

occasionsfive times in the 19th century and twice in the 20th centurythe judiciary committee voted to report supreme court nominatio n with recommendation to the senate that it reject the nomination only two of the seven nominations received senate confirmation and each only by close roll call vote27 the senate rejected four of the others28 and postponed taking action on the fifth29

referred to the judiciary committee since its establishment eight were not reported by the committee to the senate the final outcome for all eight nominees however was determined not by the failure of their nominations to be reported out of committee but by action or lack of action taken outside the committeeby the senate congress as whole or the president while five of the nominees were never confirmed to the court30 the other three ultimately were after being renominated31 continued fullers nomination washington post july 3 1888 p 1 26 the three nominees confirmed by the senate after the judiciary committee explicitly reported their nominations without recommendation were melville w fuller for chief justice in 1888 george shiras jr in 1892 and clarence thomas in 1991 fourth nomination reported without recommendation wheeler h peckham in 1894 was rejected by the senate 27 see in table 1 the second nomination of stanley matthews in 1881 confirmed 2423 and the nomination of lucius q c

2430 john j parker in 1930 rejected 3941 and robert h bork in 1987 rejected 4258 29 the senate in 1829 postponed taking action on the nomina tion of john crittenden after receiving an adverse report on the nomination from the judiciary committee 30 in 1853 the nomination of william c micou was referred to the judiciary committee and on the same day ordered discharged by the senate where action was taken in 1866 the nomination of henry stanbery was referred to the judiciary committee but shortly afterwards while the nomination was pending in the senate the associate justice position to which stanbery had been nominated was eliminated by statute in 1893 the nomination of william b hornblower was referred to the judiciary committee but not reported later that year in new session of congress hornblower was renominated reported unfavorably by the judiciary committee in early 1894 and rejected by the senate 2430 in 1968 the judiciary committee declined to report the nomination of homer thornberry to succeed associate justice abe fortas until the final outcome of the nomination of fortas to be chief justice was determined the thornberry and fortas nominations were both withdrawn by the president after motion to close debate on the fortas nomination failed to pass in the senate the failu re of fortass chief justice nomination eliminated the prospective associate justice vacancy that thornberry had b een nominated to fill in 2005 the nomination of harriet miers was withdrawn by the president before the judiciary committee held hearings on the nomination 31 in february 1881 just before the final adjournment of the 46th congress the judiciary committee voted to postpone taking action on the supreme court nomination of stanley matthews shortly afterwards however in special session of the 47 th congress matthews was renominated and although his second nomination was reported unfavorably by the judiciary committee it was confirmed by the senate 2423 in nov 1954 late in the 83rd congress the nomination of john m harlan ii was referred to the judiciary committee where action was taken in 1955 harlan was renominated considered and reported favorably by the judiciary committee and confirmed by the senate in sept 2005 before the scheduled start of confirmation hearings the nomination of john g roberts jr to be associate justice was withdrawn and on the same day of the withdrawal roberts was renominated for chief justice the second roberts nomination was reported favorably by the judiciary committee and confirmed by the senate

supreme court appointments in 1789 to the present day presidents have made 158 nominations to the court table 1 shows in the final action by senate or president column that the senate confirmed 122 of these nominations or roughly threefourths32 of the 36 nominations that were not confirmed 11 were rejected by the senate all in rollcall votes33 11 were withdrawn by the president34 and 14 lapsed at the end of session of congress without senate vote cast on whether to confirm35 while the invariable practice of the senate in recent decades has been to vote on supreme court nominations by roll call this historically was usually not the case table 2 at the end of this report shows that of the 133 senate votes on whether to confirm resulting in 122 confirmations and 11 rejections 60 decisions were reached by rollcall votes and the other 73 by voice vote or unanimous consent initially for some 40 years the senate rarely used rollcall votes to decide supreme court nominations starting in the 1830s however and continuing through the 1880s the senate used rollcall votes on supreme court nominations somewhat more often than unrecorded votes the trend reversed between 1890 and 1965 when fewer than onethird of senate decisions on confirming court nominations were by rollc all vote since 1967 though every senate vote on whether to confirm supreme court nomination has been by roll call table 2 shows these trends within the four historical periods just noted by breaking down the number of senate decisions on confirmation within each period according to whether made by voice vote or unanimous consent 32 the exact confirmation percentage is 772 reached by dividing 122 confirmations by 158 nominations 33 the earliest senate rejection of supreme court nomination occurred in 1795 when president george washingtons nomination of john rutledge to be chief justice failed on 1014 vote the latest instance was the senates rejection of robert h bork in 1987 by 4258 vote between rutledge and bork the following nominations were also rejected alexander wolcott in 1811 john c spencer in 1844 george w woodward in 1846 eben ezer r hoar in 1870 william b hornblower in 1894 wheeler h peckham in 1894 john j parker in 1930 clement f haynsworth jr in 1969 and g harrold carswell in 1970 34 the following supreme court nominations were withdrawn in the years indicated with the presidents who withdrew them shown in parentheses the first nomination of w illiam paterson in 1793 george washington the first nomination of reuben h walworth in 1844 john tyler the second nomination of john c spencer in 1844 john tyler the third nomination of reuben h walworth in 1845 john tyler the second nomination of edward king in 1845 john tyler george h williams and caleb cushing both in 1874 ulysses s grant abe fortas and homer thornberry both in 1968 lyndon b johnson john g roberts jr and harrier miers both in 2005 george w bush less than week after his first nomination was withdr awn paterson was renominated by president washington and confirmed by the senate on the same day on the same day that president bush withdrew the roberts nomination to be associate justice he renominated roberts to be chief justice and the latter nomination was confirmed 35 the 14 nominations that lapsed at the end of session of congress without senate confirmation or rejection vote or withdrawal by the president having occurred can be broken into the following groups according to senate actions or lack of senate actions taken on three nominations john crittenden in 1829 the first nomination of roger taney in 1835 and george badger in 1853 the senate voted to postpone taking action the senate tabled two nominations the first nomination of edward king in 1844 and edward bradford in 1852 on one nomination the senate rejected motion to proceed jeremiah s black in 1861 by 2526 vote and on eight nominations there was record of any vote taken the second nomination of reuben h walworth in 1844 john m read in 1845 william c micou in 1853 henry stanbery in 1866 the first nomination of stanley matthews in 1881 the first nomination of william b hornblower in 1893 the first nomination of pier ce butler in 1922 and the first nomination of john m harlan ii in 1954 however four of the 14 persons whose nominations lapsed in one session of congress were renominated in the next congressional session and confirmed taney in 1835 matthews in 1881 butler in 1922 and harlan in 1955

mentioned all 11 senate rejections of supreme court nominations were accomplished by rollcall votes historically recorded vote margins on supreme court nominations have varied considerably some rollcall votes either confirming or rejecting nomination have been close36 most votes however have been overwhelmingly in favor of confirmation37

for supreme court nominations the amount of time elapsing between senate receipt and start of confirmation hearings has varied greatly table 1 shows that for all 43 court nominations receiving public confirmation hearings starting with the brandeis nomination in 1916 the shortest time that elapsed between senate receipt and start of hearings was four days for the nominations of both benjamin n cardozo in 1932 and william douglas in 1939 the second shortest time interval of this sort was five days for the nominations of both stanley f reed in 1938 and felix frankfurter in 1939 the longest time elapsing between senate receipt and first day of confirmation hearings was 82 days for the nomination of potter stewart in 1959 the next longest time interval of this sort was 70 days for nominee robert h bork in 1987 in recent decades from the late 1960s to the present the judiciary committee has tended to take more time in starting hearings on supreme court nominations than it did previously table 1 reveals that prior to 1967 median of 10 days elapsed between senate receipt of supreme court nominations and the first day of confirmation hearings from the supreme court nomination of thurgood marshall in 1967 through the nomination of samuel alito jr to be associate justice in 20052006 38 median of 21 days elapsed between senate receipt and first day of confirmation hearings39 36 the closest roll calls ever cast on supreme court nominations were the 2423 vote in 1881 confirming stanley matthews the 2526 vote in 1861 rejecting motion to proceed to consider the nomination of jeremiah s black and the 2625 senate vote in 1853 to postpone consideration of the nomination of george badger since the 1960s the closest roll calls on supreme court nominations were the 5248 vote in 1991 confirming clarence thomas the 4551 vote in 1970 rejecting g harrold carswell the 4555 vote in 1969 rejecting clement haynsworth jr the 5842 vote in 2006 confirming samuel alito jr the 4258 vote in 1987 rejecting robert h bork and the 6533 vote confirming william h rehnquist to be chief justice in 1986 also noteworthy was the 4543 vote in 1968 rejecting motion to close debate on the nomination of abe fortas to be chief justice however the roll call was not as close as the numbers by themselves suggested since passage of the motion requir ed twothirds vote of the members present and voting 37 the most lopsided of these votes were the unanimous roll calls confirming morrison r waite to be chief justice in 1874 630 harry blackmun in 1970 940 john paul stevens in 1975 980 sandra day oconnor in 1981 99 0 antonin scalia in 1986 980 and anthony m kennedy in 1988 970 and the nearunanimous votes confirming noah h swayne in 1862 381warren burger in 1969 to be chief justice 743 lewis f powell jr in 1971 891 and ruth bader ginsburg in 1993 963 38 in calculating the median elapsed time for the contemporary period the marshall nomination in 1967 was selected as the starting point for the following reason the marshall nomina tion it could be argued marked the start of an era in which the confirmation hearings of most if not all supreme court nominees were highly charged events covered closely by the news media with nominees interrogated rigorously and extensively and for more than day about their judicial philosophy as well as their views on constitutional issues and the proper role of the supreme court in the us government for the marshall nomination the elapsed time between senate receipt and start of confirmation hearings was 30 days 39 see bottom rows of table 1 for median number of days that elapsed from the date supreme court nominations were received in the senate to first hearing dates for three different time spans

has been to allow at least four weeks to pass between senate receipt of supreme court nominations and the start of confirmation hearings this block of time is intended to be used by the committee members and staff for thorough study and review of background informati on about nominees and issues relevant to their nominations in preparation for the hearings in the case of five of the six most recent court nominations to receive confirmation hearings starting with the david h souter nomination in 1990 the shortest elapsed time between senate receipt and first day of hearings was 28 days 40 while the elapsed time for the sixth nomination of john g roberts jr to be chief justice in 2005 was only six days another longer time interval is more meaningful table 1 shows that robertss earlier nomination to be associate jus ticelater withdrawn in order to have roberts be renominated for chief justicewas received by the senate 45 days prior to the start of hearings on his chief justice

the time elapsing between senate receipt of supreme court nominations from the president and final committee votes has also varied greatly table 1 shows that for the 108 court nominations that received final committee votes41 the nomination receiving the most prompt committee vote was of caleb cushing in 1874 which was reported by the judiciary committee on the same day that the senate received it from the president 42 the committee votes on 14 other nominations to the court occurred three days or less after the dates of senate receipt43 at the other extreme was the 1916 nomination of louis d brandeis on which the judiciary committee voted 117 days after senate receipt and referral to the committee five other nominations as well one in the 19th century and four in the 20th received committee votes more than 80 days after senate receipt from the president44 in recent decades the judiciary committee has taken much more time in casting final vote on supreme court nominations than it did previously table 1 shows that prior to 1967 median of nine days elapsed between senate receipt of supreme court nominations and the committees final vote on reporting them to the full senate45 from the supreme court nomination of 40 for the five nominations the elapsed time between senate receipt of nomination and the first day of confirmation hearings was 50 days for david souter in 1990 64 days for clarence thomas in 1991 28 days for ruth bader ginsburg in 1993 56 days for stephen g breyer in 1994 and 60 days for samuel alito jr in 20052006 41 as already mentioned the first such nomination of alexander wolcott in 1811 was reported by select committee all subsequently reported nominations were reported by the senate judiciary committee 42 ironically five days after the committees favorable and extremely prompt recommendation of cushing president ulysses s grant withdrew the nomination 43 five nominations were voted on by the judiciary committee one day after their receipt by the senate robert c grier in 1846 john campbell in 1853 morrison r waite to be chief justice in 1874 horace gray in 1881 and harold h burton in 1945 six nominations were

ree nominations to the court in 1844 was voted on by the judiciary committee 93 days after senate receipt and committee referral during the 20th century the judiciary committee in addition to its 1916 vote on the brandeis nomination voted on the following nominations more than 80 days after senate receipt potter stewart in 1959 93 days robert h bork in 1987 91 days abe fortas to be chief justice in 1968 83 days and clarence thomas in 1991 81 days 45 all of the 15 aforementioned nominations on which the judiciary committee voted three days or less after senate receipt were made prior to 1946 and

the supreme court confirmation process now typically extends over much longer period of time than it once did table 1 shows that from the appointment of the first justices in 1789 continuing into the early 20 th century most senate confirmations of supreme court nominees occurred within week of the nominations being made by the president in recent decades by contrast it has become the norm for the court appointment processfrom senate receipt of nominations from the president to senate confirmation or other final action such as senate rejection or withdrawal by the presidentto take more than two months the last column of table 1 shows the number of days that elapsed from the dates supreme court nominations were received in the senate until the dates of final senate or presidential action the number of elapsed days is shown for 150 of the 158 nominations listed in the table with elapsed time shown for the pending alito nomination or for eight nominations on which there was record of any

and the objections to the nomination voiced by few of the committees members ultimately the committee voted 104 to re port the nomination favorably receiving much more expeditious committee action was president eisenhowers fifth and final supreme court nomination of charles whittaker which was approved by the judiciary committee 16 days after senate receipt 48 the days that elapsed from the date received in the sena to the date voted on by the senate judiciary committee were eight days and 25 days for the 1962 nominations of byron r white and arthur j goldberg and 13 days for the 1965 nomination of abe fortas to be associate justice 49 besides nominations that received official final senate action in the form of confirmation or rejection 122 and 11 respectively or that were withdrawn by the president 11 six others are treated in the table as also receiving final action albeit not of definitive official sortwith three having been postponed by the senate two tabled and one the nomination of jeremiah s black in 1861 not considered after motion to proceed was defeated by 2526 vote while the six nominations remained pending in the senate af ter the noted actions the effect of the actions it can be argued was decisive in eliminating any prospect of confirmation and thus constituted final senate action for time measurement purposes accordingly for these six nominations

periods17892006 1789 1966 and 19672006 in recent decades the median elapsed time for supreme court nominations to receive final action has increased dramatically dwarfing the median time taken on earlier nominations table 1 shows that from 1967 starting with the nomination of thurgood marshall through january 30 2006 the date on which the senate confirmed the nomination of samuel alito jr median of 69 days elapsed from when supreme court nomination was received in the senate until the date it received final action compared with median of seven days for the same interval for the prior years of 1789 to 1966 50 most of the supreme court nominations receiving final action within relatively brief period of timefor example within three days of initial receipt in the senate occurred before the 20th century51 while most of the nominations receiving final action after relatively long period of timefor example 75 days or more after receipt in the senate occurred in the 20th century and nearly all of these since 196752 the presence of senate committee involvement has clearly tended to increase the overall length of the supreme court confirmation process of the 26 court nominations made prior to the establishment of the judiciary committee in 1816 only one of alexander wolcott in 1811 received final action more than seven days after initial senate receipt being rejected by the senate nine days after receipt it also was the only court nomination prior to 1816 which was referred to and considered by select committee subsequently until the civil war six nominations received final action more than 50 days after initial senate receipt all six were first considered and reported by the judiciary committee during the same period other court nominations were considered and acted on by the senate more quicklysome with and some without first being referred to committee subsequent historical developments involving the senate judiciary committee further served to increase the median length of the supreme court confirmation process one such development was the senates adoption of rule in 1868 that nominations be referred to appropriate standing committees resulting in the referral of nearly all supreme court nominations thereafter to the judiciary committee another was the increasing practice of the judiciary committee in the 20 th century of holding public confirmation hearings on supreme court nominations ultimately to become standard practice third more recent historical trend has involved the pace and thoroughness of the judiciary committee in preparing for and conducting confirmation hearings since the late 1960s close and thorough examination of the background qualifications and views of supreme court nominees has become the norm for the judiciary committee an 50 at first glance the most recently confirmed nomination of john g roberts jr for chief justice appears to be deviation from the 1967 to 2005 median interval from date received to final action of 69 days as the nomination was confirmed only 23 days after its initial recei pt in the senate however it can be argued that more meaningful context is to see the roberts chief justice nomination received in the senate on sept 6 2005 in relation to the earlier july 29 2005 nomination of judge roberts to be associate justice after the death of chief justice william h rehnquist on sept 3 2005 the roberts associate justice nomination was withdrawn and he was renominated to be chief justice hearings on the roberts associate justice nomination set to begin on sept 6 were cancelled and rescheduled hearings on the chief justice nomination began on sept 12 the overall time that elapsed from the associate justice nomination of judge roberts on july 29 until senate confir mation of his chief justice nomination on sept 29 was 62 days 51 table 1 shows that 43 nominations received final senate or presidential action three days or less after date of receipt in the senate thirtysix of the 43 were pre20th century nominations 52 table 1 shows that 16 nominations received final senate or presidential action more than 75 days after date of receipt in the senate twelve of the 16 were 20th century nominations with 10 made since 1967

presidents have made temporary recess appointments to the supreme court without submitting nominations to the senate table 1 identifies all of these 12 appointments showing how each was related to later nomination of the appointee for the same position the table shows that nine of the 12 recess appointments were made before the end of the civil war 53 with the last three made almost century later in the 1950s during the presidency of dwight d eisenhower54 each of the 12 recess appointments occurred when president exercised his power under the constitution to make recess appointments when the senate was not in session55 historically when recesses between sessions of the senate we re much longer than they are today recess appointments served the purpose of averting l ong vacancies on the court when the senate was unavailable to confirm presidents appointees the terms of these recess appointments however were limited by the constitutional requirement that they expire at the end of the next session of congress unlike the lifetime appoint ments court appointees receive when nominated and then confirmed by the senate56 despite the temporary nature of these appointments every person appointed during recess of the senate except for onejohn rutledge to be chief justice in 1795ultimately received lifetime appointment to the court after being nominated by the president and confirmed by the senate as table 1 shows all 12 of the recess appointees were subsequently nominated to the same position and 11 all except for rutledge were confirmed

various phases during the more than 200 years of the republic initially such nominations were handled without senate committee involvement later from 1816 to 1868 most nominations to the supreme court were referred to the judiciary committee but only by motion since 1868 as the result of change in its rules the senate has referred nearly all court nominations to the judiciary committee during the rest of the 19 th century and early 20th century the committee considered nominations without public hearings subsequently public hearings 53 see in table 1 the recess appointments of thomas johnson

practice although many of the earlier hearings were perfunctory and held simply to accommodate small number of witnesses wishing to testify against the nominees gradually however in the latter half of the 20th century public hearings on supreme court nominations lasting four or more days with nominees present to answer extensive questioning from committee members would become the usual practice also the overall length of time taken by the supreme court confirmation process has in general increased significantly over the course of more than 200 years from the appointment of the first justices in 1789 continuing well into the 20th century most supreme court nominations received final action usually but not always in the form of senate confirmation within week of being submitted by the president to the senate in recent decades by contrast it has become the norm for the confirmation process to take from two to three months other trends and historical phases may be discerned from tables 1 and 2 still other trends of course may be revealed by future nominations that presidents make and by the actions taken on them by the senate and its judiciary committee
