analysis of economic effects of state incentives summary state and local governments have long s ponsored economic incentives to firms such incentives are designed to attract investment and to stimulate and diversify thelocal economies in general these incen tives can include such economic subsidies and tax breaks as loans grants public ve nture capital programs tax exemptions tax deductions and tax abatements these programs however have both strongsupporters and detractors who disagree sharply over the economic effects both intended and unintended of industrial location incentives supporters argue that they need economic incentives because they send message to businesses that the state or locality is favorably disposed toward businessthe supporters also argue that they need well developed package of incentives to compete with other localities that offer sim ilar types of incentives critics argue that this type of beggarthyneighbor competition among localities and statescontributes nothing to the national economy and likely costs more in lost revenues and direct outlays than it generates in tax revenues and jobs empirical analyses offer mixed evidence majority of studies indicates that industrial location subsidies and incentiv do little to affect business location decisions in most cases other economic factors outweigh incentives and subsidies in importance to firms making location decisions nevertheless recent researchindicates that under some circumstances tax incentives may be important factors forsome firms making investment decisions many of the developing nations starved fo r investment funds have proliferated the use of investment subsidies and incentives to attract foreign investment this has increased the cost of such subsidies for all nations and pushed the issue into theforefront of international negotiations on fo reign investment subsidies were to have been on the agenda for discussion among the developed economies during thenegotiations over the multilateral agreement on investment mai but thosenegotiations ceased in early 1998 within the united states some member s of congress have expressed concern over the use of incentives by jurisdictions and the competition for investmentscongress also is concerned that subsidies offered abroad will spur us firms toinvest overseas at the expense of investments and jobs at home despite theseconcerns congress has been reluctant to step in to regulate or control the subsidies state and local governments offer firms moreover state and local governmentsapparently feel compelled to continue offering incentives to stay competitive with other states so far one state has been willing to risk possible loss in corporate investment by being the first to reject such subsidies it is unlikely therefore that the present situation will change despite expressed disenchantment among all levelsof governmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98516contents i n c n t i v s b s t t 2

not new they date back to at least 1791 when new jersey offered tax incentives to alexander hamilton toinduce him to locate his manufacturing business in the state 1 in the 1980s and 1990s however subsidies and incentives escalated sharply as states and localitiescompeted in bidding wars to attract foreign and domestic firms and the attendantjobs prompting calls within the united states and abroad for curbs on suchactivities there have been numerous attempts to rein in investment subsidiesincluding the multilateral agreement on investment mai 2 this agreement attempted to standardize such practices and to make them more easily discernibleor transparent to firms of all nationalities within the united states state and local governments generally exercise broad discretion in designing and offering incentives but they do not have unlimitedauthority they are restrained by the us constitution which gives to the congressthe power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and

strong co re of supporters and critics who disagree sharply over the effects intended and unintended that are associated with suchinvestment incentives congress has expr essed concern over investment subsidies and their role in competition between states for investments investment subsidies are emerging as an important international issue and was to have been keycomponent of the multilateral

that competition among states and local governments spurs the governments to lower their respective environmental and labor standards tosatisfy firms seeking the lowest level of standards these conclusions are notuniversally accepted some observers argue that investment subsidies shift someeconomic activity from one state or locality to another but they doubt that suchbeggarthyneighbor

7475factors involved in site selection analysts representing economics business law and sociology have contributed to the literature on industrial location often however these analystshave reached contradictory or ambiguous conclusions part of this problem arisesfrom shortcomings inherent in attempting to draw general conclusions aboutindustrial location decisions when the very factors involved in reaching thosedecisions change in importance as firms proceed through multistage process theyuse to decide where to locate as one analyst has written the location decision isa nonstandard complex and trying one for many managers largely because thefactors that affect it can be quite numerous and not easily quantified 20 recent views according to economists traditional view of direct investment firms invest abroad to maximize their profits21 while true this view ffers little insight into the direct investment process more recent vi ews argue that firms invest abroad because they possess superior technology or manufacturing processes which give them aneconomic advantage over their competitors another theory stresses that firms investoverseas because they are attracted by the economic performance of foreign markets once firms have decided to invest overseas they use different set of factors to differentiate among locations often these factors are difficult to quantify and the decisionmaking process may be imperceptible to those outside the firms chain ofcommand after reviewing broad spectrum of the industrial location literature two economists concluded that the location process is sequential decisionmakingprocess that involves number of stages the first stage is the choice of st ate or region over half of all locational studies make their first cut at the multistate level once the stateor region has been selected more microfocus will culminate in the selection of specific community and site the important locationalfactors differ between the first stage when firms

invol ved in firms location decision also vary by range of industrial characteristics this means that the factors relevant to location decision can vary by industry by the types and amounts of raw materials and skilled labor that are used by the type and area of the market by company size experience personal preferences and by other factors23 for instance labor costs are especially important in the apparel and shoe industries and other laborintensiveindustries laborintensive industries on the whole are also more likely to besensitive to labor unionization than are such capitalintensive industries aspetroleum chemicals food processing basic metals and papermaking transportation costs are especially important for firms in food processing lumberor paper common chemicals plastic glass metals and metal fabricating firmswhich process agricultural mining or forest products generally prefer to locate close to sources of raw materials while firms in industries involving multistage

not fully captured in empirical studies as result most of the empirical literature offers little evidence that statesponsoredeconomic and tax incentives are important f actors affecting firms location choices one survey of firms receiving statesponsor ed economic incentives indicated that the firms did not view the incentives as significant or as giving them competitiveadvantage over their competitors because they believed their competitors received similar treatment 25 on the other hand some firms apparently do view tax and financial credits as important factors if competing sites are comparable in terms of labor market costs and proximity to resources and markets26 advanced technology industries the fastgrowing advanced technology indus tries have led analysts to conclude that these industries use new and different set of factors in deciding where to locate their plants according to this viewpoint state and local tax systems education the business climate and the

plants often require far fewer job categories than those commonly employed in usindustry and introduce different labor relations practices facing onlyenterprise unions at home japanese investors may perceive thatadversarial unions would impede the introduction of flexible productionpractices 33 researchers have also concluded that market potential and access to foreign markets are positive and important influen ces on firms decision to locate facility abroad us states with large market potential have welldeveloped infrastructure transportation facilities certain economies of scale associated with firms involved in similar economic activities agglomeration economies34 and access to customer markets that attract foreign as well as us firms35 changes in the industrial structure of the us economy toward greater services and advanced technology ledother economists to conclude that these changes are heightening the importance ofsuch other factors as state and local taxe s education business climate labor skills and state and local physical infrastructure 36 these economists also concluded that so many factors seem to be involved that it is difficult to determine whether subsidies or locational incentives are significant factors in where firms decide to invest the lack of strong econometric and survey evidence contrasts with the opinions of many policymakers that some development incentives areessential for successful job creation effort perhaps the varieties ofincentives are too complex to be captured by the econometric models orperhaps they are so widely offered that they cancel out 37 higher manufacturing wages relative to othe r states apparently are significant detriment to attracting some types of foreign direct investment foreign firmsapparently respond differently to the relativ magnitudes of wage rates for instance japanese firms apparently are highly sens itive to wage rates and to labor productivity in deciding where to locate their plants european firms on the other handapparently do not respond to labor market conditions in this way and their decisions seem to be only marginally responsive to relative wage rates

economic benefits that arise from such programs outweigh the costs empirical research indicates th at incentives or subsidies do not drive firms decisions to locate plant or fac ility abroad and as such constitute questionable economic practice 39 economists also conclude that such incentives generally misallocate economic and financial resources this misallocation arisesfrom at least three sources jurisdictions must expend resources to monitor the incentives offered by eachother incentives and subsidies offered to firms may not be recouped in reasonabletime frame or never fully recouped

claimed publicly that such incentives helped them capture firms one author argues that jurisdictionscontinue to engage in such activities despite their reservations because they apparently produce more immediate political results than waiting for longertermentrepreneurial programs to mature 41 these jurisdictions also believe they are unable by themselves to stop this activity42 further compounding the issue firms often expect to be offered attractive incentives since they have become accustomedto having state and local governments offer in centives to attract businesses in some

of state and local jurisdictions have also used incentives to signal their interest in attracting business or as part of an effort to establish businessfriendly atmosphere 44 once these incentives

as result some states have amended their approach from recruiting busine sses outside the state to developing an entrepreneurial approach of helping firm s grow within the state one analyst summarized these changes by stating it would be difficult to make the case that states are abandoning the commitment to economic development that emerged so powerfully in the1980s but there are signs of loss of

implications states face additional financial problems that arise from industrial location incentives first the subsidies shift fi scal burdens from one class of taxpayer principally large

subsidies or tax reductions which encourage capital expansion or construction relative to laborcould shift the use of inputs in the favor of capital and possibly lead to relatively less labor being used in the production process taxes in general state tax credits and incentiv fall into three categories general economic credits and incentives targeted social and environmental welfare credits and incentives and specific economic development credits and incentives54 general economic development credits and incentives are available to all of those who invest within the parameters of certain

unobservable variables62 in some cases investors are drawn to locations despite high tax rates because other factorsdominate their decisions hines argues th at there are various factors which draw firms to specific location although many of those factors are not observable 63 hines also questions what might be expected from correlation between taxes and business investment for instance he argues that if higher business taxesrepresent part of fiscal package that in cludes greater spending on infrastructure and other items that benefit business then higher taxes might be positively correlatedwith business activity hines concludes that the available data do not allow for testof the impact tax factors have in explai ning foreign investment in the united states as whole but that they do allow for st concerning foreign investment within the united states here hines finds that even small variations in local tax rates mayhave important effects on capital flows 64 those who assert that taxes are importa nt are aided little by empirical analysis which has not yet resolved uncertainties over how taxes affect the decisions ofmultinational firms one analyst concluded that there still is little awareness of the actual manner in which the financial decisions of multinational corporations areaffected by differences in taxati on across government jurisdictions 65 another critic argues that incentives are ineffective in stimulating economic activity because theymerely reward activities that would otherwise take place tax breaks are not targetedand not connected to

administration is seeking agreements within numberof multilateral frameworks to liberalize further the remaining national barriers to direct investment in may 1995 the admini stration launched negotiations within the oecd on multinational agreement on investment mai the intent of thisagreement would be to go beyond the obliga tions nations currently face in the oecd to liberalize their laws and practices relevant to international investment inparticular the administration pressed to ve the agreement include provisions that limited the number and type of industrial sectors nations can exclude from liberalizing allowed for freedom from performance requirements conditions imposedon foreign investors as requirements for gaining an approval to invest gave firms the freedom to make any

problems for state andlocal governments which might face suits over state consumer and environmentallegislation also every nation wanted some of its industries or economic sectorsexempted from the mai

stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98516crs21 conclusions over the last decade there has been sharp escalation in the growth of economic and tax incentives to influence the cation decisions of firms state local and even national governments are skeptical of the economic benefits associated with such incentives but seem unable by themselv to retard their proliferation across local state and national boundaries moreove r empirical analyses to date indicate that economic incentives generally are not decisive factor in where firms decide to locate despite these results there seems to be reversal occurring any time soonin the number and types of incentives state local and national governments seemwilling to offer members of congress are concerned over the escalating use of incentives between states that are compe ting for corporate investment but congress has shown little desire to regulate state economic development programs at theinternational level congress may be required to address the issue of incentives if the administration negotiates successfully to include incentives as part of an international agreement on investment empirical analyses indicate that broa d array of factors ranging from labor availability and quality to market access ra w materials and schools may all play role in the location decisions of firms superior technology or advancedmanufacturing processes however likely gi ve firms the initial advantage they need to consider investing abroad once firms have made the decision to invest abroad separate set of factors likely influence wh ere they decide to locate for some high technology firms taxes and other incentives may be important factors that influence where they locate but empirical research offers conflicting results on the role these factors play part of this ambiguity aris from the importance specific factors may play in locational decisions especially si nce the relative importance of those factors changes as firms proceed through multistage process to decide whether and where to invest abroad nearly all economists agree that economic growth is determined at the national level by broad macroeconomic factors and conditions but economic growth andemployment issues often dominate elections and political developments at the level of state and local governments as resu lt political leaders at these levels feel compelled to compete with other jurisdictions for jobs and businesses by offeringincentives even though these types of beggarthyneighbor policies have dubioustrack record few jurisd ictions however seem willing to buck the trend and eliminate incentives and subsidies to firms at the risk of losing investments oralienating voters at the international level there is growing movement toward
