for grains cotton and oilseeds the new law extends with modifications dair and sugar support the bill creates new countercyclical payments for dairy and it overhauls the peanut program by replacing quotas with support program like that for other major crops the final bill also contains titles to expand conservation programs reauthorize agricultural export and food aid programs and ame nd and extend research nutrition food stamps credit and rural development activities among others total direct mandatory budget author ity spending in the bill is 2739 billion over 6 years fy20022007

programs 92 billion is for conservation about 55 1496 billion of the bills 2739 billion in total direct spending is for food stamps and other nutritiontitle programs the nutrition programs r eceived 28 billion in new spending above baseline the new farm law has attracted widespread criticism from those here and abroad who argue that it is extremely expensive will reverse the marketoriented course congress had charted for longterm farm policy in 1996 stimu late overproduction thus depressing farm prices and distor ting trade worldwide and undermine the us objective of further reforming global agricu ltural trade proponents counter that the law is needed to aid farmers hit by several years of low prices fully complies with congressional spending limits and current us trade obligations maintains market orientation by providing fa rmers with the flexibility to plant most crops unbound by government supply controls and places th united states in stronger position to negotiate future trade reforms by ensuring that us farmers will not be unilaterally shorn of their support before other countri commit to reducing their own subsidies and trade

legislation many are evaluated periodically revised and renewed through an omnibus multiyear farm bill the federal agriculture improvement and reform f air act of 1996 pl 104127 was the previous omnibus farm bill and many of its provisions were set to expire in 2002 the heart of every omnibus farm bill is farm income and commodity price support policy the methods and levels of support that the federal government provides to agricultural producers however farm bills also typically include titles on agricultural trade and foreign food ai d conservation and environment domestic food

resolution allowance the sum of the cbo baseline plus the new money as the bill progressed through congress subsequent reestimates of the federal budget baseline showed fading budget rpluses in general and higher than previouslyestimated costs for some farm programs in the new bill for example newer projections in early 2002 indicated that some farm prices would be lower than had been projected earlier in april 2001 meaning that usda farm subsidy outlays would be higher too the new estimates created uncertainties regarding available funding and whether congress would c ontinue to support the new spending approved year earlier ultimately lawmakers did s upport this new spending tables 1 and 2 below show respectively cboestimated costs over 6 years the term of the new law and

food stamps the emergency food assistance program and child nutrition programs as well as new spending for demonstration programs child nutrition programs are not included in baseline since their reauthorization is not addressed by the farm bill b other provisions in the farm bill primarily consist of savings associated with the federal crop insurance program however crop insurance is not included in the baseline since the reauthorization of the program is not part of the farm bill trade considerations the multilateral uruguay round agreem ent on agriculture uraa posed another potential constraint on legislators the uraa limits the united states to providing more than 191 billion per year worth of domestic farm supports most likely to distort production and trade the are socalled amber box programs the agreement spells out rules for determining whether policy is market distorting or whether it is exempt from the annual subsidy calculation according to usdas economic research service ers the us has so far met commitments under the uraa but surges in direct payments to producers after 1997 in response to low market prices have raised concerns that domestic subsidy levels might eventually exceed the ceiling on domestic supports established under the uraa us support is expected to remain below its ceiling under current farm programs but increases in support under new programs could cause compliance problem with the uraa commitmentsand could hamper effort s in the new multilateral trade talks to accomplish us goals for liberalizing international trade and getting otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31195crs4 2 usda economic research service aligning us farm policy with world trade commitments agricultural outlook januaryfebruary 2002 p 12countries to reduce domestic support to their agriculture sectors and increase market access2 fsria 2000 continues system of di rect payments not tied to current production or prices of specific commod ities which proponent s believe will not have to be counted as trade distorting and therefore are not subject to uraa farm subsidy limits they also believe that the bills conservationrelated programs are among those that are exempt from the limits however the bill continues crop marketing loan benefits nd the dairy price support program which already are classified as tradedistor ting and thus counted toward the uraa annual limit if their value exceeds the socalled minimis threshold of 5 of farm production value further the bill creates new counterc yclical program that also may have to be counted toward the uraa annual limit on tradedistorting subsidies also farmers who receive direct payments are per mitted to update the hi storical production bases to which such payments are tied see farm income and commodity price support later in this report for an explana tion of these programs it remains to be seen whether these and other types of subsidies in the bill ultimately result in future uraa compliance problems andor challe nges by foreign trading partners the bill does contain provision requiring the secretary of agriculture to attempt to keep farm prog ram benefits within the annual uraa limit critics have questioned the feasibility of implementing this socalled circuit breaker besides the political difficulties of proposing fa rm program cutbacks usda might face administrative problems for example if usda found after calcu lating upcoming spending that farm support might exceed the allowable 191 billion would the secretary have to withhold from farmers some or all of the years expected subsidy which commodities andor supports w ould be affected some of them or would she make an acrosstheboard reduction what if usda wrongly predicted that spending would not exceed the 191 billion but it ultimately did would the department take money back from recipients and if so how defenders of the provision counter that the circuit breaker would not be as complicated as critics contend suggesting that relatively modest adjustments in pr ograms and payment vels could be made easily on an asneeded basis see crs report rl30612 farm support programs and world trade commitments meanwhile the united states is involve d in new round of multilateral trade negotiations under the aegis of the word trade organization wto critics contend that the scope and vel of subsidies in the new farm law and their potential to perpetuate market distor tions undermine the us argument in the new trade round that the worlds agricultural subsidies shoul d be further disciplined many foreign officials and some us analysts have poi ntedly noted that the new us farm policy raises questions about the cerity of the us negotiating pos ition the law will encourage other countries to increase their domestic subs idies andor import barriershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31195crs5 to protect their own farmers critics add many have characterized us farm policy as highly protectionist and destructive to farmers worldwide particularly in developing nations defenders of the bill counter that th united states cannot unilaterally back away from supporting its farmers before the european union eu and other competitors agree to do likewise in the united states agricultural interests have long complained that the eu and japa n are permitted under the uraa to spend much more on domestic farm support japans annual llowable level is approximately 3035 billion versus the us 191 billion the eus level is around 60 billion more than three times the us level they argue maintaining and even increasing us subsidies within allowable limits provide us negotiators with more leverage in the negotiations over foreign trade barriers including high tariffs and export subsidies as well as domestic price supports defenders argue administration views the bush administration at first highly critical of the evolving measure was by late 2001 pledging its support for generous farm bill on may 2 2002 the president said he would sign the final bill commenting i am pleased that the compromise agre ement on the farm bill resulted in better balanced commodity loan rates spending that is longer frontloaded and the strongest conservation provisions of any farm bill ever passed by congress the final provisions of the farm bill are also consistent with americas international trade obligations which will strengthen our ability to open foreign markets for american farm products while this compromise agreement did not satisfy all of my objectives i am pleased that this farm bill provides generous and reliable safety net for our nations farmers and ranchers and is consistent with the principles i outlined also by may 2002 the administration was engaged in vigorous public defense of the new bill pa rticularly in response to widespread foreign criticism such administration support was marked departure from its earlier criticisms on october 3 2001 as the house began to debate its bill the white house office of management and budget omb issued statement of administration policy stating that it did not support hr 2646 because it would encourage overproduction of commodities fail to help farmers most in need jeopardize global markets and boost federal spending at time of economic uncertainty the omb statement of administration policy on the senate bill issued december 5 2001 argued that s 1731 w ould stimulate ove rproduction partly through higher crop loan rates result in higher consumer milk prices hurt us farm trade by among other things risking us ability to meet current trade obligations and undermining us efforts to phase out wo rldwide export subsidies in the future authorize ineffective conser vation programs poorly direct farm aid by increasing payments regardless of need weaken acc ountability in domestic nutrition programs and result in unknown budget costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31195crs6 3 subject headings are not

stock for the new century which concludes among other things that farm policy should be tailored to reflect the wide differences among us farms and farming practices current programs tend to tilt benefits most heavily toward highly efficient commercial farms which enables them to expand operations and lower costs even more with direct relationship between benefits and farms financial need landowners not necessarily farm operators benefit the most through high er land values and higher farmland rental rates caused by current support programs the report st ates farm policy must promote more sustainable prosperity for farmers rely ing on the market and not government for longterm support although government c ould provide aid for unexpected events beyond their control according to the report the report also argues that trade policy not only must focus on more access to foreign markets but also be supported by domestic policies that meet us trade obligations and provide the latitude to pursue ambitious goals in trade negotiations the report suggests that future polic should shift emphasis from traditional commodity price supports toward the dema nd side of agriculture focusing on marketing and consumption particularly overseas c onservation programs food safety and affordability nutrition and ru ral development so are addressed despite its periodic comments on farm

the options below except as noted mainly apply to policies for grains cotton and oilseeds pfc payments most although not all producer groups supported continuation of annual lump sum assistance like pfc payments some wanted pfc eligibility expanded to include soybeans and possibly even such commodities as tobacco peanuts milk wool mohair appl cranberries which all received direct payments under the emergency assistance ws critics argued that such payments are quickly capitalized into land prices nd rents the new 2002 farm bill continues direct payments that are similar in concept to pfc payments and adds soybeans and other oilseeds as eligible crops countercyclical assistance there was wide support for new counter cyclical assistance program that would be more generous than previously provided through marketing loans early proposal s differed in detail but shared common objective of providing more support when fa rm prices andor incomes decline than provided under amta the 2002 farm bill c ontains new counterc yclical assistance tying such support to target prices for individual commodities not revenue income or receipts as some had proposed see crs report rs20913

consider these subsidies to be highly production and trade distorting s upporters contend that these programs are effective in maintaining farm incomes and low cost to taxpayers the new farm bill continues the tobacco sugar and dairy progr ams and alters the peanut program to function similarly to the grains and cotton programs the new law also adds target price and countercyclical direct payments for dairy producers risk management another proposed alternativ would have phased out all supports tied to the production of specifi ed commodities and replaced them with assistance designed to encourage producer s to expand their use of various risk management tools the subsidized federal crop insurance program is an existing risk management program howe ver some argued for broader approach that might include combination of whole farm revenue insurance income stabilization accounts more use of futures markets c ontracts with commodity buyers and other options comprehensive bill introduced by senator lugar s 1571 embraced such an approach but it was not adopted in the final bill provisions as enacted among the grains upland cotton and oilseeds provisions in the new farm bill

support benefit into fixed decoupled payments while the senate bill put more benefits into loan deficiency payments the fixed dec oupled payments are not tied to current production or prices and so are not consider ed to be potentially trade distorting ie amber box in contrast higher loan rate s generate increased benefits when market prices are low and so serve as countercyc lical assistance thereby likely to fall into the amber box the cost of marke ting assistance loans and countercyclical payments also are difficult to predict in th future making government farm spending projections uncertain another important differe nce was the senate plan samdt 2826 to limit support payments more strictly than the house version to 225000 per individual 275000 for couple including marketing an benefits fixed payments counterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31195crs10 cyclical payments plus gains from commodity certificates and forfeitures the rules also would have made it more difficult to reorganize operations in order to legally exceed this limit see crs report rs21138 farm commodity payment limits comparison of proposals trade implications subsidies linked to market prices are considered trade distorting the inclusion of higher loan rates and new counte rcyclical payments in the law have caused numerous critics to question the stated us international commitment to limit trade distorting subsidies to agreed upon levels whether or not spending on production and trade distortin g policies actually breach the wto limits the sheer size of farm subsidies in the new law causes concern about the ability of us trade negotiators to persuade ot her countries to lower their barriers to agricultural imports or reduce their export subsidies critics c ontend supporters of

the conservation missi on significantly beyond its traditional focus on controlling soil erosion and provi ding water to enhance production the goals now include wetlands protection wildlife habitat protection and development and air and water quality improvement among others new issues have continued to emerge in recent years since the 1 996 farm bill was enacte d these issues have included sequestering carbon and addressing global climate change pr oducing energy from biomass protecting and restorin g grasslands reduc ing nonpoint water pollution caused by very large animal f eeding operations and addressing other offfarm environmental impacts over the years congress has added new conservation tools including controls over modification of envir onmentally fragile lands nd

reflected in funding levels conser vation activities at usda received just over 1 billion in fy1985 they now receive more than 3 billion annually however most of this growth has been for land retirem

more substa ntial changes one broader approach encompassing the idea of green payments was introduced by chairman harkin in freestanding bill s 932 it was event ually incorporated as the conservation

alternative conservation title endorsed by ma ny environmental organizations this amendment revise d version of the work lands stewardship act hr 2375 would have shifted 19 billion annually from commodity support payments to various conservation activities more generally the house and later the senate debated at so length how much money to allocate to conservation and how to split that funding among conservation programs the conservation title was not as controversial when the senate considered the farm bill although water conservation provisions that would have addressed anticipated water shortages in many parts of the country and specific allocation issues that had been raised in the klamath river basin located in southern oregon and northern california did attract considerable atten tion these provisions would have allowed the federal gove rnment to lease or purchase water rights as way to address scarce supplies widely opposed by most western senators they were revised several times before being approved with many limits such as being available only in specified states the conference committee was confronted with many differences that had to be resolved as it created the final version of the conservation title from the house bill it deleted the farmland stew ardship program and numerous other items from the senate bill it deleted wetlands reserve enhancement program nutrient management program for chesapeake bay drainage and watershed risk reduction program other provisions were modified but remained in the conservation title for example the water conservation provisions that had been passed in the senate became both 200 million transfer from the ccc to the department of the interiors bureau of reclamation to improve water supplies in natural desert terminal lakes and an earmark of 50 million w ithin the new surface and groundwater conservation program to ddress water allocation problems in the klamath river basin with specific

spring of 1994 and only bit over 10 higher th an the alltime low over half of the decline over the 5 years since the last major food stamp amendments came from sharp drop in the rate at which those

aspects of food stamp eligibility bene fit and administrative rules thwarted participation and ffective administration denying needed support to working poor families and others in need and

limiting participation food stamp reform agendas food stamp advocates states and welfare reform supporters all expresse d their dissatisfaction with this state of affairs but there was not single unified reform agenda and most alternatives for change imposed significant new costs states called for simplified fe deral food stamp rules much greater state control over policies lifting federal limits on work and training activities and revamped and more standardized benefit and eligibility rules to help administrators and applicantsrecipients they also wanted major revision of the quality control system and more open federal waiver policy program advocates emphasized the inadequacy of benefits and the need to grant eligibility to noncitizens although they support reform of the quality control system and selective changes to make eligibilitybenefit determinations easier for applicantsrecipients they resisted vesting too much decisionmaking with states and tampering with what they see as nationally uniform food stamp safety net welfare reform supporters also agreed with quality control reforms but stress th need to ensure that the food stamp program fulfills major role in supporting the working poor as its first priority within major cost constraints the fa rm bills food stamp provisions responded to many of these criticisms by easinglifting administrative requirements

2000httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31195crs29 appendix selected arguments for and against the new bill these selected pro and arguments organized topically were among those offered by various lawmakers as they bated final passage of the measure in relating these points crs doe s not attempt to support or refute their factual basis and of course ta kes position on any legislative option economic impact on farmers pro the measure is critically needed now because of continuing severe problems in the farm sector including the lowest real net cash farm income since the great depression the 5th straight year of low prices for major crops in some cases record lows and high production costs without the measure farm income will decline well below the levels of the past 6 ears causing plunging land values and threatening the viability of many rural lenders this measure will have the perverse effect of worsening not improving farmers financial situation the higher subsidies inflate land values adding to production costs and more speci fically making it more ex pensive to rent land and 42 of us farmers are renters subs idies stimulate overpr oduction causing farm prices to decline the combination of higher production costs and lower prices squeezes net farm incomes market orientation pro the measure maintains the marketo riented features of the 1996 farm law farmers will have the flexibility to plant virtually any agricultural crop with the exception of most fruits and vegetables there are supply controls such as set asides and usdamanaged stocks thus the measures support features are not dependent on governmentimposed planting rules and therefore will have minimal impacts on market prices and production decisions rather than marketoriented the measure maintains the commodityoriented policies of the past where most subsidies ar pegged to the prices of specified crops and skewed toward those who produced them in the past moreover because the more producer has grown the more he or she is entitled to receive the reason why 23 of farm subsidies have gone and will likely continue to go to 10 of us farmers large farmers will be in an even better financial position to become larger swallowing more traditional sm all and mediumsized operations regional balance pro the measure is one of the most balanced in years for example negotiators were able to win the support of most dair regions in the country growers of both southern and northern tier crops were equally satisfied w ith the benefits and various provisions address the needs of ameri cas fruit and vegetable growers and of livestock producers as wellhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31195crs30 15 the bill is 6year measure 20022007 but cbo has scored it over 10 years as wellcon the biggest benefits will go to just handful of states largely in the upper midwest plains and south according to one university analysis 75 of all projected annual crop payments under the w will go to 13 states over 40 will go to 5 states also commodity program be nefits are again focused primarily on the major row crops eg corn wheat soybeans cotton etc budget impacts pro the measure fully complies with the fy2002 congressional budget resolution this resolution provided for the expenditure by the agriculture committees of an additional 735 billion in mandatory farm bill spending above the april 2001 baseline over 10 years nd the congressional budget office cbo officially has reported that the measur additional cost will not exceed this15 also farm policies which account for little more than onehalf of 1 of the total us budget will cost more per year under th 2002 farm bill than spending under the 1996 farm bill when the cost of the an nual emergency assistance packages is included when the fy2002 budget resolution allowed 735 billion in additional spending there was projected budget surplu s in the wake of 911 and an economic slowdown the federal budget is now in defic it reestimates of spending since april 2001 show that costs will be higher when the new spending whether the 735 billion under last years outdated estima tes or the 828 billion under the march 2002 cbo reestimate is added to existing spending th actual cost of this new bill will be anywhere from 170 billion to 200 billion over 10 years not counting the food stamp title making it likely the mo st expensive farm bill in history current trade obligations pro the measure fully complies with u s trade obligations which limit trade distorting us farm subsidies to 191 billi on per year the measure was designed to provide much of the assistance in nontrade distorting manner eg fixed payments not based on current production new conservation spending to ensure that us obligations are not breached circuit breaker provision requires the secretary of agriculture to reduce tradedistorting subsidies if it is determined that they will breach the 191 billion limit this measure will cause the united states to violate its current trade obligations one analysis estimates on einfive chance that the 191 billion cap will be breached but other analysts contend that the likelihood may be much greater the circuit breaker provision will be administratively and politically difficult to employ certain provisions c onsidered green that is not tradedistorting in fact will be challenged before the world tr ade organization wto by us trading partners who believe they are am ber that is tradedistortinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31195crs31 new trade negotiations pro although there are new subsidies the bill places the united states in stronger position in the ongoing round of world tr ade negotiations to negotiate future constraints on foreign farm supports more specifically the united states should not unilaterally cut its own support to us fa rmers at time when agricultural tariffs throughout the world average 62 compared with average us agricultural tariffs of 12 moreover the european union eu is permitted to provide much higher subsidies to its farmers ove rall eu support is more than three times as high as us support furthermore the eu accounts fo r some 90 of all agricultural export subsidies worldwide the united states will have less not more trade negotiating clout many foreign leaders have already vehemently denounced the bill as highly trade distorting officials from brazil australia cana da mexico the european union and developing nations for example now question the sincerity and credibility of the united states when it says it wants further reforms in global agricultural and trade policies the bill jeopardizes progress in current multilateral bilateral and regional discussions undermines developing nation farmers trying to compete in global markets or simply to subsist and encourag other countries to increase their own subsidies just to keep pace with the united states conservation pro the measure calls for the largest inve stment in conservation in the history of recent farm bills 171 billion in new m oney or 80 more in total mandatory spending than would have been provided w ithout the bill moreover by putting more money into the protection of working lands the measure will make production agriculture more environmentally responsib and result in mo re offfarm benefits eg cleaner streams and ground water etc the increase in conservation will be he lpful but more so for larger producers who will be rewarded for environmental pr actices they should ve in place already four times as much money will be spen t on commodity price supports than on conservation under the new law had more money gone for conservation subsidies could have been more equita bly distributed to smallersiz ed farms and ranches to more diverse array of crops and to more regions of the country rural development pro the new farm bill will help stimulate stagnant rural economies by increasing land values and shoring up the rural financial system in addition to spreading farm payments through rural economies across america the bill adds 820 million to innovative rural developmen t projects and activities the new farm bill diverts money fro m the needs of most rural economies to few agricultural areas only small per centage of rural non metro counties have an agricultural base and in those few if any of the farm benef its stimulate good jobs or innovative economic ente rprises with long term prospects for growthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31195crs32 need for new legislation pro the measure replaces the 1996 farm bill which was set to expire in 2002 failure to pass bill now c ould have resulted in congre ssional gridlock as the 2002 elections approached forcing reversi on to permanent farm laws passed in 1938 and 1949 these old laws mandate stric tly prescriptive nonmarketoriented and highly costly policy farm state lawmakers deliberately k eep these old laws on the books to force congress to approve expensive new farm bills in fact congress would never permit the old 1938 and 1949 laws to take effect as indicated by the extension of the 1990 farm bill for an additional year when congress could not come to agreement on new farm bill by the end of 1995 ad hoc assistance pro the measure averts the need for yet another year of ad hoc emergency assistance bills which congress passed 4 pr evious years providing over 30 billion another emergency bill would have been considered closer to the midterm elections when pressures to provide even greater levels of assistance likely would have prevailed another year of emergency ad hoc assistance would have been preferable to locking in 6 years of unpred ictable spending and such ad hoc assistance could have been implemented by usda more quickly moreover it was precisely electionyear politics ie the desire to improve the election prospects of farm state lawmakers which brought pressure to enact such an overly generous 6year bill farm bill deliberations pro the measure was carefully and transparently crafted involving 2 years of deliberations including over 50 hearings to receive the views of diverse set of interests bill drafters focused on proposals by the big commodity interests ultimately expanding outmoded and ultima tely harmful policy tools rather than introducing innovative new policies or better funding resear ch and trade
