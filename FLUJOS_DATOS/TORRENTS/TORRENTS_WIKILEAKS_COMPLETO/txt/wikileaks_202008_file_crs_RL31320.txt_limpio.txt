lstas authorization expired at the end of fy2002 however funding was not interrupted pl 10881 the museum and library services act of 2003 mlsa reauthorized the lsta as title ii library services and

states via formula grants funding is also provided for library services for native americans and for national leadership projects lst grants to the states are allocated to state library administrative agencies slaas and may be used for the following basic purposes expanding services for learning and access to information in variety of formats in all type of libraries developing and improving electronic or other linkages and networks connecting providers and consumers of library services and resources andor b targeting library services to under served or disadvantaged populations such as persons with disabilities those with limited literacy skills or children from poor families although the bulk of funds appropriated for lst are used for state grants percentage of total funds is reserved for national activities native americans and federal administration out of total lst appropriations for given year 375 must be reserved for national activities1 the latter may include competitively awarded grants or contracts for research demonstrations preservation and conversion of materials to digital form plus education and training for librarians congressionally directed grants have also been included in this category and president bushs librarians for the 21st century program described below is included under this heading in addition 175 of appropriations is reserved for services to native americans including indian tribes alaskan natives and native hawaiians and up to 35 of appropriations may be used for federal administration of lst programs 1 the actual percentage varies due to the addition of congressionally directed grants crs2 of the total funding reserved for state grants each state receives flat grant of 340000 40000 in the case of outlying areas remaining funds are allocated on the basis of total population in each state the federal share of the total costs of assisted activities is 66 in all cases2 if there is yeartoyear decline in federal funding for lst states must maintain levels of spending for library programs or their lst grants will be reduced in proportion to the reduction in state funding pl 10881 provides for an increase in minimum state allotments for library services and technology to 680000 if the amount appropriated for year and available for state allotments exceeds the amount of allotments to all states in fy2003 in addition minimum state allotments for outlying areas are increased to 60000 if appropriations in given year are sufficient to meet the higher state minimums of 680000 if remaining funds are insufficient to reach 60000 they are to be distributed equally among outlying areas receiving such funds3 however the level of fy2004 and fy2005 appropriations for the imls were not sufficient to trigger the higher state grant amounts authorized by pl 10881 participating states are required to develop fiveyear plans that set goals and priorities consistent with the purposes of lst grants ie to enhance information sharing networks and target library services to disadvantaged populations the plans must provide for independent evaluations of federally assisted library services wide variety of types of libraries public public school college or university research if they provide public access to their collections and at state discretion private libraries may receive lst aid not just the public and research libraries eligible for aid under the predecessor legislation the library services and construction act lsca4 more than 4 of each states grant may be used for administration however there is limit on the share of funds that can be used at the state level to provide services as opposed to being allocated to local libraries library services and technology grants are intended to provide states with considerable latitude in the use of funds lst funds are allocated within states on competitive basis by the slaa 2 this is essentially the same as the allocation formulas for the previous lsca titles iiii combined under the previous lsca the federal share varied from 33 to 66 depending on each states relative personal income per capita 3 the share of lst funds allocated to the freely associated states palau the republic of marshall islands and the federated states of micronesia under this formula will be reserved and allocated among these areas plus the us virgin islands guam american samoa and the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands on competitive basis via the pacific regional educational laboratory in hawaii 4 the provisions of the lsta were modified and continued in pl 10881 by the museum and library services technical and conforming amendments of 1997 pl 105128 the amendments made special libraries ie libraries other than public school college or research libraries these are frequently part of museums corporations or government agencies eligible for aid under the lsta b expanded the funds reservation for native americans from 15 to 175 adding native hawaiians to the eligible recipients of these funds c reduced the maximum reservation for national programs from 4 to 375 d clarified requirements of the lsta regarding state maintenance of

justifications of appropriations estimates to the congress crs5 history the federal government has provided direct aid for public libraries since initial adoption of the library services and construction act lsca in 1956 the 104th congress considered legislation to extend and amend lsca programs as well as to consolidate these programs with separate authorizations of federal aid to elementary and secondary school and college libraries the library services and technology act consolidated and replaced number of programs under title vii subtitle b of the lhhsed appropriations act of 1997 within pl 104208 these programs included the lsca plus library assistance programs authorized by title ii of the higher education act hea and title iii part f of the elementary and secondary education act esea6 pl 108 81 the museum and library services act of 2003 mlsa reauthorized the lsta as title ii library services and technology lst of the mlsa while states have had large degree of discretion in selecting grantees and deciding how funds are to be used under both the former lsca and the current lst overall state discretion would appear to be increased under the current program at the same time some funds particularly aid for construction under the former lsca title ii were intended for specific purposes that are not authorized for lst grants in fact pl 10881 includes provision explicitly prohibiting the use of funds for construction the library services and technology provisions of pl 10881 also focus more thoroughly on relatively new forms of information sharing and networking such as the internet than the lsca reauthorization issues issues that were discussed during the reauthorization of the lsta included the adequacy of minimum state grants and overall authorization levels the need for additional funding to provide for evaluations of the lsta and new provisions disallowing grants for projects deemed obscene 108th congress on september 25 2003 the museum and library services act of 2003 was signed into law pl 10881 the lsta was reauthorized as title ii library services and technology of the mlsa the major changes regarding library services adopted in the reauthorized museum and library services act of 2003 include the following 6 the lsta repealed not only the lsca but also aid to collegeuniversity libraries under hea title ii and an unfunded authorization of aid to elementary and secondary school libraries under esea title iii part f this program was added to the esea by the improving americas schools act of 1994 pl 103382 but was repealed without ever being funded the esea contained earlier authorities for aid specifically to school libraries under titles ii 19651974 and iv 19741981 separately local educational agencies may and often do use portions of their funds under the broad authority of esea title vi innovative education program strategies to support school library services in addition pl 107110 amends the esea
