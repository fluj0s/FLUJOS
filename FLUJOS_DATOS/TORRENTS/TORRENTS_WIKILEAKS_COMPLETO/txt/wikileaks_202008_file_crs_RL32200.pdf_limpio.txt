committee of the whole parliamentary device designed to allow greater participation by members in debate to consider most major measures various rules and procedures govern how and when members can engage in debate offer amendments make motions and requests and take other actions in the committee of the whole in addition measures considered in the committee of the whole typically are subject to conditions governing debate and amendments that are specified by special rule or unanimous consent agreement time during general debate is controlled by the chair and ranking member of the committee that reported the measure under consideration these members called floor managers determine who may speak for how long and in what order time during the amendment process is sometimes controlled in similar way under the terms of special rule alternatively the amending process might proceed under the fiveminute rule whereby the proponent and an opponent of an amendment are recognized by the chair of the committee of the whole for five minutes each additional members may offer pro forma amendments solely for the purpose of gaining recognition to speak for five minutes in some circumstances members might make motions to close or limit fiveminute debate if member believes pending matter violates house rule he or she may make point of order against it member may also reserve point of order to be made later against an amendment ruling by the chair as to whether matter violates house rule may be appealed member might also make parliamentary inquiry to ask question about procedural situation some actions can be taken in the committee of the whole by unanimous consent however member cannot ask unanimous consent to take actions in committee of the whole that are properly performed by the house or that substantially modify conditions established by special order agreed to by the house the committee of the whole resolves back into the house proper by rising members might make motion simply to rise when the committee of the whole has not concluded consideration of measure or to rise and report when consideration has concluded special rules usually include language that makes motion to rise and report unnecessary members occasionally make the motion to rise and report with the recommendation to strike the enacting clause quorum for conducting business in the committee of the whole is 100 members but quorum is presumed to be present unless it is otherwise demonstrated through process that begins when member makes point of order on the floor three kinds of votes can take place in the committee of the whole voice division and recorded this report will be updated as warranted

house of representatives have multiple opportunities to participate in the consideration of measures on the floor they can discuss legislation propose changes to pending text and suggest actions that may facilitate deliberation or expedite decision making to achieve these legislative objectives members rely on standard procedures and phraseology that have evolved over the course of congressional history an important parliamentary device designed to allow greater participation in debate is the committee of the whole formally the committee of the whole house on the state of the union1 the committee of the whole can be understood as the assembly in different form it is committee of the house composed of every representative that meets in the house chamber the house considers most major measures in the committee of the whole in fact house rules require revenue appropriations and authorization measures to be first considered in the committee of the whole house rule xviii clause 3 the house agrees to resolve itself into the committee of the whole in one of three ways by special rule by unanimous consent or by motion 2 typically the house adopts simple resolution reported by the committee on rules referred to as special rule or more simply as rule authorizing the speaker to declare the ho use resolved into the committee of the whole to consider particular measure less frequently member might ask unanimous consent that the house resolve itself into the committee of the wh ole for consideration of particular measure finally member of the appropriations committee will occasionally make motion to resolve into the committee of the whole to consider general appropriations bill 3 the consideration of measure in the committee of the whole and the house can be divided into five stages 1 the house resolves itself into the committee of the whole 2 members engage in general debate on the measure 3 members offer consider and vote on amendments to the measure 4 the committee of the whole rises and reports back to the house with recommendation and 5 the house votes on the recommendation and then on the measure itself various rules and procedures discussed in this report govern how and when members can participate in debate offer amendments make motions and requests and take other actions in the 1 for additional information on the rules procedures nd practices

by members to engage in these activities the report also presents some examples of parliamentary phraseology before member can take any action the member must be recognized for such purpose by the chair of the committee of the whole4 the chair of the committee of the whole who is member of the majority party appointed by the speaker exercises substantial discretion in recognition sometimes the chair will ask for what purpose does the gentleman or gentlewoman rise before according recognition measures considered in the committee of the whole typically are subject to conditions governing debate and amendments that are specified by special rule from the committee on rules or unanimous consent agreement in either case the house sets the procedural conditions under which the particular measure is considered in the committee of the whole the committee of the whole even by unanimous consent may not set aside or substantially modify those conditions 5 under those conditions member may be prohibited from gaining recognition to debate or make certain motion or request in the committee of the whole

on the floor the manner in which time is obtained restricted and distributed in the committee of the whole depends on the stage of consideration of the measure and the terms of any special rule or unanimous consent agreement governing the consideration of the measure after the house resolves itself into the committee of the whole to consider particular bill or resolution members engage in general debate on the measure during the general debate stage members discuss the bill and may discuss any amendments they plan to offer but they may not offer amendments during this time the next stage of consideration is the amendment process during this stage members seek recognition to offer amendments and to debate their merits along with these two distinct stages of debate there are two different methods by which time is distributed in the committee of the whole time for debate is either controlled or it is not under controlled time member is granted block of time from member called manager who determines which members may speak for how long and in what order controlled time is generally divided equally between two managers if time is not controlled then member gains time to speak by seeking recognition from the chair of the committee of the whole absent any order of the house governing consideration of measure time in the committee of the whole would be controlled only during general debate 4 for further information on the rules procedures and practices associated with the securing and granting of recognition see house practice pp 773802 5 the committee of the whole however may rise and return back to the house which subsequently may adopt special rule or agree by unanimous consent to modify the conditions under which the particular measure is considered in the committee of the whole httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32200g6g142g139g138g157g142g496g561g15g152g157g146g152g151g156g496g561g138g151g141

fiveminute portions as described in the debate under the fiveminute rule section below the house usually resolves into the committee of the whole under special rule however and these orders of the house always provide for controlled time during general debate and often during the amendment process g9g142g151g142g155g138g149g561g6g142g139g138g157g142g561 time for general debate in the committee of the whole is almost always set and controlled by the terms of special rule or unanimous consent agreement 6 these agreements often limit the time for general debate to one hour although the length of general debate can vary in practice general debate is usually divided between the chair and the ranking minority member of the committee of jurisdiction of the measure under consideration these members are referred to as the majority and minority floor managers if the measure falls under the jurisdiction of multiple committees then the chair and ranking member of each committee might control portion of general debate time g5g152g151g157g155g152g149g149g146g151g144g561g22g146g150g142g561g138g156g561g138g561g15g138g151g138g144g142g155g561 those designated to control the time often begin discussing the measure by yielding to themselves set number of minutes or more often by stating i yield myself such time as i may consume the manager then controls the time until it expires or until the manager retains his or her remaining time by saying i reserve the balance of my time the presiding officer will then recognize the other floor manager by reserving his time floor manager gives the other floor manager chance to speak or distribute time generally the chair alternates recognition between managers from each side floor managers yield portions of time to members who let them know in advance they wish to debate the measure each floor manager usually but not necessarily yields to members on his or her side of the aisle by custom managers do not refer to other members by name and instead designate them by state for example the manager might say i yield two minutes to the gentlewoman from new hampshire alternatively the floor manager might say 6 if the length of general debate on measure was not set by special rule unanimous consent or statute before the house resolved into the committee of the whole then debate would take place under the hour rule and every member could potentially each speak for an hour after beginning general debate under these circumstances however the committee of the whole could rise and the house could adopt motion or agree to unanimous consent

if manager yields portion of time to another member he may not take the time back once the time is yielded it belongs to the member who is speaking until he finishes and yields back his time or until the presiding officer announces that the time has expired time is kept by the clerks sitting at the house dais and managers often ask mr chairman how much time is available to each side in response the presiding officer will announce how much time the majority and minority floor managers have left it is not uncommon for the managers to discuss with each other how the remaining time will be distributed for example one manager might ask the other how many more members on his side are waiting to speak the floor manager from the majority party has the right to speak last in general debate or to close when time is controlled7 toward the conclusion of general debate the majority floor manager will likely reserve the balance of his time until all the time of the minority manager has been consumed or until the minority manager yields back the balance of his time debate ends when all time has expired or all time has been yielded back the floor managers yield back time by simply stating i yield back the balance of my time if the time allowed for general debate has not expired managers sometimes discuss whether or not to end general debate the managers might in this way determine that more members wish to speak on either side and they might then in turn yield back their remaining time if the length of time for general debate is set by the house as it nearly always is the committee of the whole cannot extend the length of time for general debatenot even by unanimous consent 8

member is not the floor manager but wishes to speak the member informs the floor manager on her side of her interest in speaking the floor manager might then yield portion of time to the member when the block of time the member has been yielded is over the chair will announce that the time yielded to the member has expired if the member wishes to continue speaking he can look to the floor manager

30 seconds or 11 minutes to another member except by unanimous consent9 the member might however yield to another member for question or comment but the yielding member retains the floor thus any time consumed by the member yielded to is charged against the portion of time yielded originally by the manager when member is yielded to he or she is actually using the time of another member for this reason members ask permission to use another members time if member wants to interrupt another member to ask question or respond to something that was said he or she can ask will the gentleman or gentlewoman yield the member speaking can decline to yield or the member can respond i yield to the gentleman or gentlewoman the member who has yielded retains the floor and should remain standing the time being consumed belongs to the member who yielded therefore the member who was yielded to cannot yield to third member if another member wants to join the discussion between the yielding member and the member who was yielded to he or she would have to seek permission to interrupt from the yielding member in this way members might engage in colloquy with one member yielding to one or more members in turn so that they may exchange information or debate an issue furthermore the member who has yielded to another member can take the time back generally this is done by interrupting the member who had been yielded to by saying reclaiming my time the following example illustrates the difference between yielding portion of time and yielding to another member during general debate representative as floor manager might yield five minutes to representative b another majorityparty member of the committee representative b then may begin speaking if at some point during the five minutes another member representative c rises while representative b is speaking and asks will the gentleman or gentlewoman yield then representative b can either yield or decline to yield if representative b yields then any time used by representative c is charged against the five minutes originally granted to representative b representative c cannot yield to yet another member representative d because representative b holds the floor representative d would have to ask representative b to yield although representative b cannot limit the time of representative c by yielding only set period of time at any point representative b can reclaim his time 9 deschler ch 29 sec 3124 and sec 3125 sometimes member yielding to another member will indicate specific period of time he wishes the other member to speak however member yielding in this situation should remain on his feet and one at the desk will keep track of the time used by the member who was yielded to

the fiveminute rule described below unless special rule specifies that time will be controlled10 special rules that permit only certain amendments to be offered called either structured or modified closed rules by the committee on rules typically provide for the debate time on those amendments to be controlled11

controlled under the terms of special rule the rule usually specifies the member or designee who may offer the amendment and how long the amendment may be debated time to debate amendments is usually equally divided between the amendments sponsor and member who opposes it it is unlikely that the rule will specify the member who will control the half of the time in opposition to the amendment instead after the clerk designates the amendment12 and the proponent is recognized and finishes speaking member can stand and state i rise to claim time in opposition to the amendment the majority floor manager will often ask to co ntrol the time in opposition if the amendment is not committee amendment the chair will then grant the available time to the member who claims it by stating that the gentleman or gentlewoman will be recognized for or will control the specified number of minutes controlled time during the amendment process operates the same way as controlled time during general debate as described above those controlling the time for debate on an amendment usually begin by yielding time to themselves to discuss the amendment these managers then usually reserve the balance of their time and yield portions of their time to other members in the same fashion as described above when the majority floor manager usually the committee chair controls the time in opposition to an amendment he or she and not the sponsor of the amendment has the right to close debate or to speak last on an amendment house rule xvii clause 3c the general principle behind this practice is that the committee of jurisdiction defends the bill it reported against amendments 13 10 time to debate amendments in the committee of the whole might be controlled under few other circumstances as well for example the committee of the whole might agree by unanimous consent to limit the length of time for debate on an amendment and to provide for this time to be divided and controlled by members identified in the agreement deschler ch 29 sec 273 11 for more information on the different types of special rules see 1 crs report 98612 special rules and options for regulating the amending process and 2 crs report 96938 special rules in the house of representatives 12 although under house rules amendments are to be read in full when offered special rules that make specific amendments in order usually provide that they be considered as read therefore the chair usually directs the clerk to designate the amendment in which case the clerk will identif the amendment in an abbreviated form such as by the sponsor 13 additional precedents concerning the right to close debate on an amendment are discussed in the house rules and manual sec 959 pp 736739

has the right to close will normally reserve the balance of his time until all the time of the other manager has been consumed or yielded back as is the case with all controlled time when all time has expired or has been yielded back debate on the amendment ends g6g142g139g138g157g142g561g23g151g141g142g155g561g157g145g142g561g8g146g159g142g556g15g146g151g158g157g142g561g20g158g149g142g561 time for debating amendments is not always controlled in the committee of the whole debate sometimes takes place under what is known as the fiveminute rule 14 clause 5a of house rule xviii states member delegate or resident commissioner who offers an amendment shall be allowed five minutes to explain it after which the member delegate or resident commissioner who shall first obtain the floor shall be allowed five minutes to speak in opposition to it accordingly if member offers an amendment the presiding officer will recognize him or her for five minutes another member sometimes the floor manager defending the version of the bill reported by the committee of jurisdiction can then be recognized for five minutes to speak against the amendment by standing and stating i rise in opposition to the amendment time under the fiveminute rule is not controlled meaning that there is member acting as manager and allocating portions of time instead any member may seek recognition from the chair of the committee of the whole to speak for five minutes member need not consume the full five minutes but time cannot be reserved certain types of special rules especially those referred to as open rules or modified open rules normally allow for amendments under the fiveminute rule 15 when members five minutes on an amendment expires the member sometimes asks unanimous consent to extend his time by specified number of additional minutes up to five minutes g18g155g152g561g8g152g155g150g138g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g156g561 although the fiveminute rule technically permits only ten minutes of debate for each amendment five for and five against the amendment members secure additional time through the use of pro forma amendments pro forma amendments are amendments to strike one or more words of the text under consideration and they are offered solely for the purpose of gaining recognition to speak for five minutes in other words change to the text under consideration is substantively proposed the proponent is not actually suggesting word or words be stricken 14 the process for offering substantive amendments is discussed further below and extensively in crs report 98995 the amending process in the house of representatives 15 in addition if the house simply agreed by motion or by unanimous consent to consider bill in the committee of the whole the bill would be

their allotted five minutes another member who wishes to speak may rise and state i move to strike the last word the chair then recognizes the member for five minutes technically to speak on the pro forma amendment but in fact to continue debate on the pending substantive amendment any number of pro forma amendments can be made but because of general prohibition against offering the same amendment twice members sometimes choose to say instead i move to strike the requisite number of words pro forma amendments can also be made when amendment is pending if members wish to discuss the measure itself pro forma amendments however are not always in order in the committee of the whole if measure is being considered under special rule from the committee on rules that prohibits most or all amendments or that permits only specified amendments then pro forma amendments are not in order unless the special rule explicitly states otherwise 16 g27g146g142g149g141g146g151g144g561 debate under the fiveminute rule as stated above is not controlled time members therefore cannot yield portions of their five minutes to other members they can however remain standing and yield to other members for questions or comments and the time consumed by the other members is deducted from the time of the yielding member member recognized under the fiveminute rule also cannot yield to another member for the purposes of offering an amendment the member who wishes to offer an amendment could seek recognition for that purpose later from the presiding officer

limit debate on 1 the portion of the measure that is open for amendment or 2 pending amendment generally the motions are made to close debate on the pending portion of the text or the pending amendment and all amendments thereto this action prevents further discussion of pro forma or substantive amendments to the pending section or amendment when the committee of the whole is considering measure under special rule that sets time limits for debate on amendments motions to close debate are not in order the committee of the whole can make minor changes to the terms of consideration specified in special rule only by unanimous consent and only if the changes are congruent with the terms of the special rule 17 16 house practice pp 313314 deschler ch 29 sec 7720 in addition

however members may make motions to close fiveminute debate it is in order to move to close debate only on the portion of the bill that has been read or designated for amendment under the fiveminute rule bills are generally read section by section except general appropriation bills which are usually read paragraph by paragraph motion to close or limit debate on an amendment and all amendments thereto is in order after the proponent of the amendment has been recognized for five minutes and has finished his or her remarks the motion is usually made by the majority floor manager although any member who is recognized might make the motion member might move that debate end immediately after the expiration of certain length of time or at specified hour18 for example member could make any of the following motions i move to close debate on the section and all amendments thereto i move to limit debate on the paragraph and all amendments thereto to ten minutes i move that all debate on the amendment and all amendments thereto end at 3 pm the motion to close or limit debate is amendable but not debatable after the motion is made the committee of the whole proceeds to vote on it successful motion to close debate on section or amendment and all amendments thereto does not prevent members from offering further amendments it only prevents them from debating such amendments if offered in other words if the motion to close debate is agreed to then once the time remaining for debate if any has expired amendments to the section or the amendment are still in order but they cannot be discussed if an amendment that was printed in advance in the congressional record is offered however then the proponent and an opponent will each be recognized for five minutes even after debate has been closed on portion of measure house rule xviii clause 8 19 the committee of the whole might agree to close or limit debate by unanimous consent rather than by motion by unanimous consent the committee of the whole could agree to close or limit debate on portion of text not yet read in addition the committee of the whole could agree by unanimous consent to limit debate on an amendment not yet offered if debate is limited by unanimous consent then the committee of the whole can also allocate the remaining time between specified members20 prior to proposing such unanimous consent requests the floor managers sometimes engage in colloquy to reac h an agreement about how much time is needed to discuss pending section or amendment 18 the form of the motion affects how time is kept if the moti on specifies that all debate end at certain specified time such as 300 pm then time consumed by actions other than debatesuch as votes or the reading of amendmentsis subtracted from the time for debate if the motion instead states that debate end after the expiration of certain length of time such as an hour then only time consumed in debate is counted against the stated length of time see house practice pp 436437 19 this provision can be superseded by special rule 20 house practice p 436

on the matter28 once recognized for this purpose member usually states mr chairman i make point of order against the amendment section paragraph etc the member making the point of order should refer by number or by subject matter to the rule of the house that the pending matter violates and is expected to explain why or in what way the amendment or other matter violates the rule 29 argument on point of order is at the discretion of the chair normally however the chair will entertain debate on the merits of the point of order debate is limited to the alleged rule violation not the merits of the policy often the chair will recognize the sponsor of an amendment or manager of the bill to respond to point of order against an amendment member recognized for debate on the point of order does not control time and thus cannot reserve time or yield time to another member point of order is initially settled by ruling of the chair on whether the matter cited does in fact violate the rule specified if the chair rules the matter out of order the committee of the whole may not consider it further in ruling on points of order the chair is aided by guidance from the parliamentarian on applicable precedents the parliamentarian also may provide guidance to members considering offering amendments or making points of order against them or other matters member may withdraw point of order at any time before the chair rules on it further point of order may be waived by special rule or by unanimous consent agreement for the consideration of the particular measure if member has not yet determined whether point of order lies against an amendment about to be debated then instead of making point of order member might at the discretion of the chair reserve point of order 30 by this action member secures the chance to review the matter without missing the opportunity to make point of order against it31 before debate on an amendment begins for example member could seek recognition from the chair and state mr chairman i reserve point of order against the amendment the member at this stage need not specify what rule he or she believes the amendment might violate member who reserves point of order can then decide at later time during debate to make the point of order or withdraw the reserv ation at any time however including immediately after the member attempts to reserve point of order the chair can require the member to state 28 under house rules certain points of order may be made at any time for example point of order may be raised at any time against an appropriation clause 4 of house rule xxi or tax clause 5a of house rule xxi provision contained in or offered as an amendment to bill not reported by the appropriate committee house practice p 666 29

taken by unanimous consent as implied unanimous consent requests effectively require the support of all members or the absence of an objection from any member to set aside the procedures that would otherwise be followed in particular situation for c onvenience members sometimes ask for unanimous consent to take actions that could also be taken by motion examples of typical unanimous consent requests in the committee of the whole include requests that an amendment be withdrawn or that an amendment be considered as read not all rules and procedures can be set aside by unanimous consent in fact unanimous consent requests in the committee of the whole as opposed to those allowed in the house are somewhat limited it is not in order in the committee of the whole to ask for unanimous consent to take any action that is properly within the ju risdiction of the house member cannot ask for unanimous consent therefore to take actions in the committee of the whole that could not be done by motion such as to reconsider vote on an amendment 41 furthermore special rules also limit the unanimous consent requests members might make regarding the consideration of measure unanimous consent requests are in order only if they make minor variances that are congruent with the controlling special order of the house 42 when unanimous consent request is made member opposed to the request may simply state mr chairman i object single objection would defeat unanimous consent request unanimous consent requests are not normally debatable however if the member wishes to explain his or her objection or perhaps obtain an explanation of the unanimous consent request then the member could instead rise and announce mr chairman reserving the right to object it is up to the chair to decide whether and how long to recognize member to speak on reservation of the right to object to unanimous consent request when speaking on reservation of objection the member may yield to other members to engage in colloquy any other member however might demand the regular order and the member reserving the right to object would lose the floor the chair would then state the question is there any objection to the request of the gentleman or gentlewoman and the member could object if he or she wished 40 house practice pp 672673 41 for list of unanimous consent requests that cannot be made in

motions for example to amend during debate under the five minute rule and to rise and report with the recommendation that the enacting clause be stricken see relating to the enacting or resolving clause section below simple motion to rise is in order even if special rule provides that the committee shall rise and report at the conclusion of its consideration of the bill45 motion to rise is not debatable and the chair puts the question to the committee of the whole immediately the simple motion to rise does not require quorum for adoption in other words even if only few members are present on the floor quorum in the committee of the whole is 100 members those few members can agree to motion to rise on the other hand if the simple motion to rise fails when less than quorum is present on the floor then member can make the point of order that quorum is not present pending request for recorded vote for more details see v oting and quorum procedures section below if the motion to rise is

has the authority to cluster or roll votes on amendments after the first vote is held clause 6 of house rule xviii allows the chair to reduce the minimum time for an electronic vote from 15 minutes to five minutes in some situations member might not believe there is sufficient support for recorded vote perhaps because only few members are present on the floor in that case the member can instead say mr chairman i request recorded vote and pending that i make point of order that quorum is not present if the request is for vote on an amendment the chair still can postpone the vote under house rule xviii and the point of order of quorum is considered withdrawn56 alternatively if the chair determines that quo rum is not present he or she can immediately order quorum call in response to the
