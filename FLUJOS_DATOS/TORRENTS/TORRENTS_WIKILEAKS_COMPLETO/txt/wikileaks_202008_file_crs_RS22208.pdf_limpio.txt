process for judgeships has become in recent years with apparent letup in sight for example when the 104th congress 19951997 convened republicans were in control and democrat bill clinton was in the white house the ideological chasm between the parties was large and legislativeexecutive tensions were often much in evidence between the gopcontrolled senate and president clinton the re sult more than 60 of clintons judicial candidates never received hearings or waited years before the senate took any action on their nominations3 on the other hand th nomination and approval of supreme court justices ruth bader ginsburg and stephen breyer by president clinton were accompanied by little partisan rancor during the brief period from june 2001 to november 2002 when democrats held the senate because senator switched parties th ey blocked several of president george w bushs judicial nominees republicans rega ined control of the senate following the november 2002 elections and expanded their hol d in the aftermath of the november 2004 elections the 108th and 109th congresses witnessed an escalation of judicial strife as the two sides battled either to approve or block judicial nominees submitted by the president lacking control of committees or the floor agenda the minority democrats were compelled to use the more incendiary weapon of the filibuster to stop the bush nominees they oppose but the result has been the sa frustration in the white house and more acrimony in congress4 as one commentator noted wh at distinguishes the judicial battles of the clinton and bush presidencies from those of earlier eras is that they have come to resemble political blood feuds in wh ich each side seeks to avenge the earlier assaults by the other side5

the constitution requires only majority vote to confirm judicial nominees senate democrats emphasize that the constitution neith er requires an upordown vote on nominees nor even that they be voted

to invoke cloture clo sure of debate on miguel estradas nomination to the dc circuit c ourt of appeals veral factors help to explain the recent senate battles over circ uit court nominees first both parties understand that although the supreme court is viewed as the court of last resort it only decides about 80 cases each year d ecade ago the number was 107 today the 13 regional appeals courts decide more than 63000 cases each year6 the circuit courts remarked law professor are the supreme courts for their region7 second circuits courts especially the dc circuit court of appeals are recruiting grounds for supreme court nominees for example three of the nine members of toda ys supreme court antonin scalia ruth bader ginsburg and cl arence thomas served previously on the dc circuit court finally the contests over circuit court nominees are perceived by many to be warmup for potential battle s involving supreme court vacancies frustration in the 109th sena continued to mount over the confirmation of judges the majority leader and minority leader conducted extensive negotiations during the spring of 2005 to reconcile their fundamental disagreemen ts over how judicial nominees are to be considered by the nate the majority leader fo r example proposed that after 100 hours of debate every nominee should recei ve an upordown vote by the senate8 the minority leader opposed any curb on th right to filibuste r unacceptable judicial nominees looming over these discussions was the majority leaders warning that barring some accord between the two sides he would use parliamentary maneuver dubbed the nuclear or constitu tional option to end judi cial filibusters talks between the two party leaders broke ff on may 16 2005 with the majority leader indicating that the nuclear or constitutional option would be employed before the memorial day recess9 the nuclear or constitu tional option summary the nuclear or constitutional option is controversial proce dure that would

filibuster vote washington post may 23 2005 p a1filibusters and thus win upordown votes on judicial nominees nor do they have the votes to amend that rule which requires twothirds vote to end filibuster on any proposed change to senate rules the parliame ntary issue they face is that the inherited or entrenched procedures of the senate have the practical effect of thwarting their ability to end judicial filibusters on nominees who ostensibly enjoy majority support of the chambers membership by cont rast opponents of upor down votes on controversial nominees contend that the president wants the senate to be rubber stamp and approve candidate s whom many lawmakers belie ve are outside the judicial mainstream there are various nuclear or constitutiona l option scenarios but most involve ruling by the presiding officer vice president cheney could be in the chair to cast tie breaking vote that could lead to new pr ecedent ending judicial filibusters one parliamentary approach might proceed roughly as follows 1 the majority leader would call up controversial judicial nominee 2 debate on the candidate would continue for an unspecified but extended period of time 3 cloture motion would be filed at some point in the proceedings to end the debate 4 the cloture vote on the controversial nominee is expected to fail senator woul d then raise point of order that further debate on the nominee is dilatory and must end within certain period of time 5 the presiding officer would sustain the point of order which would establish new senate precedent 6 however it is expected that senator opposed to the chairs ruling would appeal the decision which is debatable mo tion 7 another senator would offer non debatable motion to table the appeal which would be voted on immediately and requires simple majority for approval tabling the appeal upholds the presid ing officers decision and creates the most authoritative type of precedent one established by vote of the senate this precedent would be used to stop future judicial filibusters use of the nuclear or constitutional option say its opponents would trigger employment of various pro cedural devices the parliame ntary fall out to impede action on all but the most essential business of the senate they also stress that its use would among other things weaken the senates ability to check executive power undermine the chambers traditional respect for minority rights and further heighten partisan acrimony opponents also suggest th at advocates of the procedural maneuver may find themselves in the minority some day and need the filibuster to protect against the tyranny of the majority on the other hand it is proponent s concern about tyranny of the minority that could overri these potential objections and trigger eventual use of the nuclear or constitutional option on may 18 the majority leader called up the controversial mination of priscilla owen to be federal circuit c ourt judge her ascent to the court had been blocked for several years by judicial filibusters clot ure was filed on her mination and the vote to invoke it was slated for may 24 the cloture vote was expected to fail

quietly for weeks trying to come up with compromise to break the judicial stalemate and avert use of the nuclear or constitutional option late in the afte rnoon of may 23 the 14 senators signed memorandum of understanding that ended the impending parliamentary showdown and produced at least temporary ceasefire over j udicial nominations the agreement which was to remain in effect through the end of the 109th congress has three principal features12 bipartisan agreement the memorandum of understanding the 14 senators agreed to vote to invoke cloture on three of the five most controve rsial federa l appellate court nominees virtually assuring the three of senate approval s ubsequently all three were approved by th senate owen 5th circuit janice rogers brown dc circuit and william pryor 11th circuit the other two william myers 9th circuit and henry saad 6th circuit would likely face unbreakable f ilibusters if they were brought to the floor as of july 2005 they have not been confirmed second the seven republicans promised not to support any recommendation to or interpretation of the rules of the senate th at would force vote on judicial nomination by means other than unanimous consent or rule xxii this feature effectively prevents the majority leader from using the nuclear or constitutional option and protects the minoritys right to filibuster in return the seven democrats agreed that judicial nominees should only be filibustered under extraordin ary circumstances and each signatory must use his or her own discretion and judgment in determinin g whether such circumstances exist this provision of the memorandum affects the minority partys ability with its 44 members plus one independent supporter to mobilize 41 backers to sustain filibuster third the accord sent signal to the white house that the president should consult with senate democrats and republicans on prospec tive judicial candidates13 we believe that under article ii section 2 of the united states constitution the word advice speaks to consultation be tween the senate and the president with regard to the use of the presidents power to make nominations we encourage the executive branch of government to consult with members of the senate both democratic and republican prior to submitting judicial nomination to the senate for consideration the memorandum of understanding aroused some consternation inside and outside the senate with many wonderi ng whether it would remain in effect for long i dont know whether its something thats here to st ay or just passing moment

oppenheimer washington cq press 2005 p 313senator14 the majority leader who saw his decision to use the nuclear or constitutional option circumvented by the agreement stated that the constitutional option remains on the table i will not hesita to use it to ensure an upordown vote on judicial nominees15 the minority leader contends that the nuclear or constitutional option is off thetable whether the goal of the agreement will be achieved is unclear until it is subject to likely test on supreme court nomination not surprisingly soon after justice sandra day oconnor announced on july 1 2005 that she would retire from the supreme court once her replacem ent was confirmed there was considerable speculation in the press and media about the durability of the bipartisan pact if president bush nomin ated controversial candidate someone that many perceive to be out of th mainstream in terms of his or her judicial views would that amount to extraordinary circumstances and trigger f ilibuster signers of the accord have variable interpretations of the phrase for example one signer said in my mind extraordinary circumstances would include not only extraordinary personal behavior but also extraord inary ideological positions16 another stated are they going to be activist their political philosophy or ideology may not bother at all if theyre not going to be activist17 still another remarked based on what weve done in the past with bush nominees since may 23 2005 ideolo gical attacks are not an extraordinary circumstance18 to be sure even if the group dissolves following president bushs choice of judge john roberts to replace oconnor there is certainty that the senate would implement the nuclear or constitutional option to conclude it is widely understood that the stakes are high in confirming judges to lifetime positions on the federal bench as two scholars note intense ideological disagreement coupled with the rising importan ce of closely balanced federal bench has brought the combatants in the wars of advi ce and consent to new tactics and new crises as the two parties struggle to shape the future of the federal courts19
