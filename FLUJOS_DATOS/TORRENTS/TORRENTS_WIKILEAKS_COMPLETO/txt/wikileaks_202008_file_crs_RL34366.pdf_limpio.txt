of representatives was used for the first time on january 23 1973 87 years after the first proposal to use an automated system to record votes was introduced the concept of automated voting dates even farther back to 1869 when thomas edison filed patent for his vote recorder and demonstrated the system to congress between the first proposal for automated voting in 1886 and the passage of the legislative reorganization act of 1970 which contained language authorizing an electronic voting system 51 bills and resolutions were introduced to provide for automated electrical mechanical or electronic voting following the passage of the legislative reorganization act of 1970 the committee on house administration and house information systems worked to develop install and implement the electronic voting system the electronic voting system was first used on january 23 1973 to record quorum call since its first use the electronic voting syst em has undergone numerous updates and upgrades these modifications have included efforts to improve the retrieval and organization of voting data to improve the manner in which votes are displayed on closed circuit television and c span to create new procedures for members changing their votes and to upgrade the system when new technology becomes available for further analysis of record voting in the house of representatives see crs

by thomas edison in 18692 he designed the system after learning that the washington dc city council and the new york state legislature were considering systems to record votes automatically in edisons system each legislator moved switch to either yes or position thus transmitting signal to central recorder that listed the names of the members in two columns of metal type headed yes and no3 edison and his colleague dewitt roberts demonstrated the machine to congress where edison recalled we got hold of the right man to get the machine adopted and i enthusiastically set forth its merits to him just imagine my feelings when in horrified tone he exclaimed young man that wont do at all that is just what we do not want your invention would destroy the only hope the minority have of influencing legislation it would deliver them over bound hand and foot to the majority the present system gives them weapon which is invaluable and as the ruling majority always know that it may some day become minority they will be as much averse to any change as their opponents 4 in 1886 electric and mechanical voting was proposed for the house with the introduction of two separate resolutions representative lewis beach of new york introduced resolution in february directing the committee on rules to inquire into the feasibility of plan for registering votes 5 in june representative benjamin fevre of ohio submitted resolution on the electrical recording of the yeas and nays6 the resolutions were referred to the committee on rules further action was taken on either resolution during the 63rd congress 19131914 representative allan walsh of new jersey introduced hres 513 providing for an electrical and mechanical system of voting for the house of representatives7 special subcommittee of the committee on accounts held hearings on an automated system where each member would have voting box with three or four buttons 1 pl 91510 84 stat 1140 october 26 1970 2 thomas

member would be assigned to voting box that only his or her key would operate the votes would then be transmitted electrically and recorded mechanically by machine installed on the clerks desk with votes displayed on boards throughout the chamber and in the cloak rooms8 following the subcommittees hearing further action was taken on hres 513 similar proposal hres 223 was introduced in the 64th congress 19151916 by representative william howard of georgia hearings were held by the committee on accounts on the proposal in which testimony was heard from outside experts including representatives of the company then installing an electrical voting system in the wisconsin legislature9 hres 223 was favorably reported by the committee on accounts but was not acted upon by the house10 during the hearings on hres 513 and hres 223 members statements and questions focused on the length of time needed to vote in the house the accuracy of such rollcall votes and the cost of developing and implementing an electrical vote recording system during his testimony on hres 513 representative walsh testified that taking 45 minutes as the average time consumed in roll call the time consumed in the sixtysecond congress in roll calls was 275 hours or 55 legislative days11 however members of the committee on accounts were concerned that shortening votes could flood the country with legislation and disrupt thenused delaying tactics resulting in filibuster by means of roll calls12 the hearings also addressed members concerns that voting mistakes could be made using an electrical and mechanical system in the hearings on hres 513 representative walsh testified that the voting system he envisioned would automatically cut off the circuit after prescribed time to end vote in the instance where member missed vote representative walsh left the decision up to the speaker as to whether the member would be allowed to vote13 representative howards resolution hres 223 overcame this perceived deficiency and allowed for vote changes either through the mechanical system or through more traditional paper method during the hearings on hres 513 members of the committee on accounts expressed concern about the cost of development and installation of the electric voting system representative walsh testified in the 63rd congress that his proposed voting system was estimated to cost more than 2500014 in the 64th congress however in the report recommending adoption of representative howards resolution the committee on accounts estimated that the electrical voting system would cost 106 per unit with total cost of approximately 12500015 8 ibid pp 46 the buttons on the voting box would indicate yea nay present and paired when button was depressed the appropriate

adoption there was still division in the committee on accounts over the desirability of such voting system majority found that an electrical and mechanical system could help members save time and avoid the practice of reading each name twice for every rollcall vote and quorum call from the statements of the experts before the committee it is evident that such device can be constructed from view of the working model of one device it is evident that practical voting system can be instituted and from the statements of various members of the house it is evident that there is very strong desire for some means of saving the time of members believing that system can be adopted which will save time encourage the regular attendance of members and insure absolute acc uracy in registering and recording the votes of the members the adoption of this resolution is recommended 16 minority opposed the concept of an electronic system and the potential loss of floor time to review proposals before casting vote it must be frankly admitted that the proposed device if properly installed in the house will rapidly record the vote if all members are pres ent voting however is the most important function of member of congress and we seriously question the wisdom of hurrying this branch of the work it frequently happens under the present system that members are required to vote before they have fully formed their judgment the time taken in voting is obviously time of deliberation of conference of quiet discussion and of interchange of views often under the present system before the voting has closed members change their votes it is not an unreasonable thing to require half hour or more to take the votes of 435 men who as frequently happens have been engaged in debate on an important question for weeks speed is not the most necessary thing in legislation 17 proposals to install automatic electrical or mechanical vote counting systems were introduced in the years following in 1923 representative melville kelly introduced hres 497 providing for the purchase and installation of an electromechanical voting system in the house of representatives18 referred to the committee on accounts hres 497 was reported by the committee on february 28 without recommendation in the report the committee noted that similar resolutions were favorably reported by the committee in the 63rd and 64th congresses and that all members could vote simultaneously if so desired it was also shown that great saving in times could be affected sic in the calling of the roll in the house by the use of one of these voting machines 19 with the exception of hres 513 introduced by representative walsh in 1915 hres 223 introduced by representative howard in 1916 and hres 497 introduced by representative kelly in 1923 none of the bills subsequently introduced received committee or floor attention 16 us congress house committee on accounts electrical and mechanical system of voting

house administration committee informatics set five objectives and guidelines for designing the system they were as follows the system should significantly reduce the time required to vote and also meet the information needs of system users each system user representative tally clerk press etc should have simple and consistent interface with the system from both hardware and software viewpoint the system should have very high degree of reliability with appropriate levels of automatic testing hardware should be highly compatible with the chamber decor so as to be as unobtrusive as possible and still function properly absolute lowest cost is not prime consideration when weighed against other design objectives however costs should be handled prudently35 informatics estimated that completing these objectives would cost total of 90000036 informatics worked on the preliminary design concept for the electronic voting system until september 1971 when his recommended the terminat ion of the contract his took informatics design and continued to refine and develop the electronic voting system in november 1971 representative john dent introduced and the house agreed to hres 601

voting system38 also in november 1971 the committee on house administration approved contract with control data corporation to develop fully operational electronic voting system39 based on the work of informatics and his in october 1972 the cost for designing and installing the electronic voting system was estimated to be 106500040 while this was substantially greater than the estimated costs in

the house chose fully electronic computerbased system with an electronic display board which flashes running tally and records each members vote on an overhead scoreboard and computer printout42 the electronic voting system consisted in part of voting stations located throughout the house chamber in contrast to earlier proposals that linked voting to individual voting boxes that were affixed to desks in the house chamber in this respect the system was unlike those used in many state and local legislative bodies representative joe d waggonner of louisiana enumerated the impracticality of returning to the pre1913 practice of assigning seats 43 as function of the number of seats in the house chamber and the imbalance between democrats and republicans in congress how many democrats are in the house of representative today it was 244 i believe how many seats are there on this si of the aisle there are 224 and there are 224 over there44 the electronic voting system became operational in january 1973 in letter to control data corporation in march 1973 chairman hays wrote that final system acceptance would not be completed until list of system deficiencies are corrected45 the deficiencies were divided into two categories items that had yet to be completed and items that were unacceptable the items yet to be completed included hardware maintenance documentation delivery of card reader machines creation of an installation plan for the speakers crt monitor installation of the speakers crt monitor installation of five additional voting stations and programmer training 46 the unacceptable items included the need for preventative maintenance schedule maintenance personnel not sufficiently familiar with the electronic voting system the voting stations being highly sensitive to static electricity and to variations in the voting cards the panels in the chamber warping the crt monitor for the minority malfunctioning an insufficient inventory of maintenance parts and error messages appearing on crts that had not been translated from computer terminology to plain english 47 these issues prevented the house administration committee from authorizing final payment
