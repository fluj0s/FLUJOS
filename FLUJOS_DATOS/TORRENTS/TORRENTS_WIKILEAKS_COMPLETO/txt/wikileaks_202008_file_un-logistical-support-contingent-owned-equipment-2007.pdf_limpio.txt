mou 157 final examination 165 v foreword the evolution of the coe system of reimbursement is an example of the achievements that can be accomplished when the secretariat and member stat focus their efforts on resolving common problems this collaboration permitted remarkable achi evements within short period of time it took only six months from the date of the approva l to proceed with changes to the reimbursement methodology to the date that solution wa s developed that solution also included the participation of 70 member states this spea ks volumes of the leadership and organisation of the working groups to produce results as c olonel bo brandt counsellor and military adviser permanent mission of denmark to the and vicechairman of the phase ii working group so aptly put it on daily basis i sm ell the scent of consensus though not everyones concerns could be satisfied the spirit of cooperation meant that solution could be achieved and that unresolved issues could be handled separately by the secretariat it then took less than year to transform the principles and recomm endations into resolution approved by the general assembly again through the combined ef forts of the secretariat and member states the momentum for change continued to produce workable system for all parties some might say there is better system the coe system addresses complex issues and satisfies the majority of both secretariat and member state concerns from the start the focus of coe was to reduce the administrative burden imposed by the survey method that was in use at the time students should keep that spirit of cooperation in mind during this course since i used the coe manual as the main reference for this cours you may encounter different terms for the same thing most notably is the use of member state and trooppolicecontributor while i am sure that these terms have di fferent meaning for the they can be used interchangeably to signify the country that provides troops and equipment to missions since it is only to member states of the that the coe system applies in january 2006 dpko release new version of the coe manual this course is an updated version of the 2004 course based on changes in the new coe manual as always the co manual and the associated documents should always be consulted for the practical application of the coe methodology don leslie 2006 vi introduction the provision of troops and contingentowned equipment coe and the method for reimbursement course objective the purpose of this course is to provide students with an indepth look at the provision of and reimbursement for troops and equipment that trooppolicecontributors tc pc provide to peacekeeping missions the primary reference will be the coe manual which was last amended on 22 december 2005 the lessons follow the same sequence of the c oe manual for ease of reference for the students the coe system is the foundation upon which the obtains personnel and equi pment from tcpcs designed to simplify administration through the use of standard rates for troops and generic types of equipment the coe system is still in its infancy since bei ng approved by the general assembly in june 1996 it is important that students understand what the system is designed to achieve and the rationale behind its creation there are literally billions of dollars being spent by the for troops and equipment and the coe system was created based on the premise that the pays for what it wants the endoflesson quizzes will focus on practical examples whereve r possible to allow the student to be familiar with the classification of equipment and personnel services the application of standard rates and the processes involved in completing an agreement course outline lesson 1 the evolution of troop and contingentowned equipment reimbursement in lesson 1 the student will be exposed to the history of how troops and equi pment have been provided by member states to peacekeeping missions the less on will cover the development of the reimbursement process for troop costs the reimburse ment for coe up to 1996 will also be discussed as prelude to the emergence of the current coe system this lesson will explain how and why the coe system was developed nd state its goals and objectives chronological presentation will take the student throug h the five phases of working groups that prepared the concept and the associated regulator meetings that led to the general assemblys approval of the system and procedures the lesson will close with segment on the various references t hat apply to the provision of troops and equipment to missions and the related reimbursement proc edures it will be stressed that the student becomes familiar with these referenc both for success with the course and more importantly for use by member states on actual missions applicable excerpts from the references will be provided as part of the course package vii lesson 2 standard elements of the coe system and lease options lesson 2 will describe the elements of the coe system includi ng their purpose and underlying concepts after an introduction of the major concepts behind the coe system the following elements will be discussed retroactivity binding arrangements reimbursementlease options transportation loss and damage mission factors verification and control major equipment selfsustainment reimbursement during drawdownstermination of mission dispute resolution lesson 2 will close with summary of the interaction of the lements and restatement of the goals and objectives of the coe system it is important t hat the student understand the nature of the coe system and the rationale behind its key elements lesson 3 standards verification and control lesson 3 will discuss the standards upon which the coe system is buil t the lesson will explore the guiding principles behind reimbursement for major equipment nd for self sustainment in addition the verification and control process will be xplained and students will be exposed to the three types of inspections used in mission area the lesson will focus on the standards laid out in the coe manual it is very important that students understand the meaning and application of the standards as basis for reimbursement negotiations by the end of this lesson the student should be familiar with the requirements for reimbursement based on the standards set forth in the coe manual they should also be conversant with the processes for verification and control for personnel equipment and materials lesson 4 transportation procedures lesson 4 will cover the procedures and regulations governing the preparat ion and transportation of equipment to and from mission as part of coe agree ment the lesson will expose students to the aspects of transportation costs that are rei mbursable through the for both deployment and sustainment equipment and materials the lesson will also describe viii responsibilities for inland transportation within the boundaries of mem ber state when route to the mission area finally this lesson will discuss the respons ibilities for loss and damage of equipment when in transit to and from the mission area lesson 5 special equipment rates lesson 5 will provide the student with an insight into the procedures f or negotiating rates for specialised equipment that cannot be categorised into generic group the lesson will cover the rationale for establishing this procedure and the instances when i t is to be applied students will be provided with the formulas for calculating special rates and shown how to apply to the to determine reimbursement rates the endoflesson quiz will include practical example for the students to complete lesson 6 equipment loss and damage lesson 6 will familiarise the students with the responsibilities and procedures related to the loss and damage of equipment and supplies provided under the coe agreem ent the lesson will differentiate the liabilities between the and member states and show how and when the authorises compensation students will be provided with several scenarios as demonstration of the application of the loss and damage procedures since member states can have var iety of claims dependent upon the level of major equipment and selfsustainment support they are pr oviding to their contingents it is important that the student recognises the circums tances under which claims will be approved this will also include brief segment on the reporting of loss and damage to the lesson 7 mission factors lesson 7 will provide the student with knowledge as to the purpose and calc ulation of mission factors as part of the coe reimbursement process since mission factors are designed for additional reimbursement based on the rigors of specific miss ion area it is important that the student realise the situation and requirements that have to be t the student will learn how the determines mission factors and the elements used in the dec isionmaking process the student will also be provided with practical example to test the ir ability in determining mission factors lesson 8 major equipment rates lesson 8 provides the student with indepth exposure to the actual rates used to calculate reimbursement for major equipment building upon previous lessons lesson 8 w ill use examples and scenarios to familiarise the student with wet and dr lease generic equipment groups and the roles and responsibilities for rate calculations the latest rate tables will be provided to the student ix building on the standards and principles of lesson 3 lesson 8 will provide m ore detail as to the specific standards for each category of major equipment explanations and examples will be provided to demonstrate the application of the standards to both ma jor equipment and selfsustainment lesson 9 selfsustainment rates lesson 9 is similar to lesson 8 but focuses on personnelbased selfsus tainment rates the lesson provides the student with an indepth exposure to the actual ra tes used to calculate reimbursement for major equipment building upon previous lessons lesson 9 w ill use examples and scenarios to familiarise the student with wet and dr lease categories of self sustainment service level standards and the roles and responsibilitie s for rate calculations the latest rate tables will be provided to the student building on the standards and principles of lesson 3 lesson 9 will provide m ore detail as to the specific standards for each category of selfsustainm ent explanations and examples will be provided to demonstrate the application of the standards to both ma jor equipment and selfsustainment lesson 10 management responsibilities lesson 10 will provide the student with an insight into how coe agreeme nts are prepared approved and managed this lesson will cover the responsibilitie s of headquarters mission headquarters member states and contingents thr ough progression from initial identification of mission to the deployment and repatriati on of troops and equipment this lesson will describe the composition of the formal agreement memorandum of understanding that the uses to requisition troops and equipment from mber states this lesson will provide an example of the mou and guide the student through description of its contents and process for completion this will expose the student to the documentation and l evel of detail required completing and managing coe agreement the objective of this lesson is to provide the student with an understa nding of the complexities and detail involved in completing coe agreements the scenarios will be present from and member state point of view to demonstrate how differe nces can arise in preparing coe agreement this will demonstrate to the student how the concept of voluntary contributions as described in lessons 2 is applied to coe agreements x format of study this course is designed for independent study at pace determined by the student

will be provided as part of the course package lesson 1 the evolution of troop and coe reimbursement 3 11 the evolution of troop costs the history behind the development and setting of troop costs is important because it represents the underlying principles used for the coe system troop cost reimbursement was originally created in 1974 based on study conducted by the secretariat in conjunction with troop contributing countries an amount of 500 per person per month would be paid for services rendered on peacekeeping missions additionally standard rate of 150 per month would be paid to troop contributing countries for limited number of specialists to provide s upport to contingents the rates were reviewed every 23 years up until 1991 from july 1991 until today troop costs were set at 988 per person per month for pay and allowances all ranks 291 per person per month for supplementary payment for specialists for up to maximum of 25 of logistic units and up to 10 of other units back in 1974 the general assembly also approved monthly allowance per person for clothing personal equipment including weapons and ammunition the rates w ere set at 65 per month for personal equipment and clothing and 5 per month for ammunition in determining reimbursement rates for troops the initial study c onsidered three underlying principles troops serving side by side should be reimbursed on the same basis for identical services government should receive higher reimbursement than its actual cost s in other words member state should profit from its participation in the operation and some governments would not be fully reimbursed based on any standard cost f ormula but they should be reimbursed at least the amount that was paid to thei r troops as actual overseas allowance installation of the united nations checkpoint by th unef finnish contingent at kilometre marker 101 on the cairosuez road 1973 photo 123971 lesson 1 the evolution of troop and coe reimbursement 4 in 2001 troop cost reimbursement was reviewed and the following new rate s were approved as of 1 january 2002 troop costs at the rate of 1028 per month per contingent member personal clothing gear and equipment allowance at the rate of 68 per month per contingent member personal weaponry and training ammunition at the rate of 5 per month per contingent member and an allowance for specialists at the rate of 297 per month or 303 per m onth effective 1 january 2002 for 25 of troop strength of listed logistics units and 10 of troop strength of infantry unit force headquarters sector headquarters and other units the contingent personnel will receive directly from the peacekeepi ng mission daily allowance of 128 plus recreational leave allowance of 1050 per day for up to 7 days of leave taken during each six month period 12 the focus on coe reimbursement during the 1970s the also developed methodology for reimbursing membe r states for the provision of equipment to peacekeeping missions for the most part the purchased the use of equipment through letters of assists or notes verbale since most mission roles were as observers commercial pattern or light military vehicles and equipment were sufficient even major confrontation areas with over 1000 troops each such as unficyp we re primarily static observer forces whose requirements could be satisfied through simple support organisation or by member states voluntary contributions if the funds ran short to control the use and reimbursement of contingentowned equipment the veloped system of surveys to count and catalogue material as it arri ved in the mission area the in survey identified all items brought by the contingent the outsurvey listed all the items returning to the member state for all returning equipment member states were reimbursed for depreciation costs while the equipment was in the mission area the difference between the surveys was considered equipment losses and could be reimbursed at the value establis hed during the insurvey reimbursement was based on the member state providing the proper document filed at the time of the loss loss or writeoff reports in the mid to late 1970s the complexity of mission equipment started to increas wherever strong military presence was required of observer missions such as unef ii unifil and undof by the late 1980s the simplicity of the inout survey wa s insufficient to keep pace with the growing list of equipment and support the survey process was quickly becoming an administrative burden for both the secretariat and member state s moreover the deployment time for contingents became shorter as forces were rapidly deploy ed to ceasefire operations in iran iraq afghanistan and angola by its very nature t he survey process was timeconsuming and bureaucratic the time and workload to settle rei mbursement claims following redeployment of contingents grew steadily lesson 1 the evolution of troop and coe reimbursement 5 as the size and complexity of forces grew so did the focus of both the member states and the on the cost of equipment and support member states were ca ught between both the desire to provide suitablytrained equipment contingents and the difficult in receiving all or partial reimbursement the secretariat was experiencing substantial increase in workload and personnel devoted to reimbursement in addition dpko faced increasing dissatisfaction from member sates and varied standards in contingentowned equipment and s upport provided in mission areas 13 reform project plan and timeline in order to simplify the process of reimbursement for contingentowned equipment and thereby reduce the leadtime associated with the payment of clai ms project plan was established to develop new methodology for reimbursement for coe and s upport this development process began with the secretarygenerals report a48 945 and the report of the advisory committee on administrative and budgetary questions acabq a49664 in which problems related to the planning budgeting and administration of peacekeepi ng operations were presented to the general assembly the general assembly by res olution 49233 of 23 december 1994 authorised the secretarygeneral to proceed with re form of the procedure for determining reimbursements to member states for contingentowned equi pment provided to peacekeeping missions this effort was divided into five phases the phase i and phase ii working groups made up of technical and financi experts from member states met with secretariat representatives from j anuary to march 1995 six member states presented written proposals for reform of the methodology ll focusing on flat rate reimbursement system the groups recommended that reimbursement to the trooppolice contributor tcpc be made on the basis of wet lease whereby the tcpc would provide major equipment and maintenance second option was dry lease whe reby the tcpc would provide only major equipment with the assuming responsibility for maintenance these working groups recommended that minor equipment and consumables not dire ctly related to major equipment be reimbursed as selfsustainment bas ed on troop strength selfsustainment categories are not subject to accountability upon ntry into and departure from the mission area but rather to verification and inspection to ensure t hat they meet the agreed standards and mandate of the contingent when contingent provides less m ajor equipment or selfsustainment than that is stipulated in the memorandum of understanding mou the tcpc will be reimbursed only for actual numbers in preparation for the phase iii working group the secretariat convene d meeting in may 1995 to gather cost data from member states in order to determine t he baseline rate of major equipment and selfsustainment reimbursement in july 1995 the working gr oup met and developed the first rate tables examples of which are provided in l essons 9 and appendix c the working group also finalised the general principles of the coe s ystem and prepared recommendations for general assembly approval and the establishme nt of subsequent phase iv to obtain general assembly approval and to implement the coe system lesson 1 the evolution of troop and coe reimbursement 6 the basic principles of this system are simplicity accountabili ty and financial and management control this is accomplished by reducing the administrat ive burden on tcpcs the secretariat and the peacekeeping missions standardisation of r eimbursement rates will be determined on an equitable basis based on the standards to be applied to equi pment and services to be provided moreover the secretariat wanted to ensure that the new system allowed the to pay for what it wants not what it gets furthermore accountability and control are ensured by the system rel ying on an priori agreement memorandum of understanding between the and the tcpc for the leasing of equipment and the provision of services to personnel this mou eliminates the need for detailed surveys of equipment spare parts and consumables and it puts the emphasis on the tcpc for asset management phase iv implementation was launched when the general assembly by resolution 50222 of 10 may 1996 authorised the implementation of new procedures for determini ng reimbursement to member states for contingentowned equipment maj or focus of this phase was the development of the manual on policies and procedures concerning t he reimbursement and control of contingentowned equipment of tcpc participating in pea cekeeping missions hereafter called coe manual the first coe manual was com pleted in october 1996 and detailed the procedures authorised by the general assembly the coe manual replaced the previous methodology whereby the tcpcs were reimbursed based on the in and outsurveys and depreciation of equipment the outcome of this phase was report bac k to the general assembly on the implementation of the coe system the fifth phase of the reform project covers ongoing process improveme nt and reporting to the general assembly the phase v working group reviewed the ra tes in february 2001 and examined lessons learned from the implementation of the coe syste m postphase v working group reviewed the draft coe manual that had been in use since the coe was adopted in 1996 the results were incorporated in new version of the coe manua l released in october 2001 the working group was again convened in 2004 to review the coe system its rate s and the contents of the coe manual the recommendations of the working group and those of the secretarygeneral were adopted by the general assembly by res olution 59298 on 31 august 2005 new version of the coe manual was provided to the general assem bly for translation and distribution on 22 december 2005 the next review will be conducted in 2008 in accordance with general ssembly resolution 59298 lesson 1 the evolution of troop and coe reimbursement 7 14 the coe manual the coe manual is primary document that governs reimbursement under the coe system the coe manual is consolidation of the recommendations of t he phase ii iii iv v and postphase v working groups as approved by the general assembly and pr ovides clarifications and explanations where required on the implementation of these decisions the coe manual contains the policies procedures and actions to be followed by headquarters and missions the coe manual is intended to provide assistance to the t cpc and ensure that the decision of the general assembly is fully and consistently impl emented the procedures used in the implementation of the general assembly decisions may be am ended from time to time to take into account changing circumstances and experience gained one of the coe manuals goals is to facilitate the preparation of mou to deploy troops and equipment to peacekeeping operations the scope of the coe manual pri marily covers the administrative logistical and financial aspects related to the contingent owned equipment major equipment and selfsustainment however in order to facilitate t cpcs participation in operations the coe manual contains additional information relating to

required to fulfil its mandate and to ensure that the tcp c provides personnel equipment and services as detailed in the specific mou and that the contingents perform according to the established standards the reform of the thodology for reimbursement for coe was monumental step forward in realising that responsibility the coe system also brings standardisation to this major element of finances this system is major departure from previous practices as it is focused on management rather than accounting for contingentowned equipment it is performance driven and provides for transparency of deployment as well as accountability it is designed to enable member states to appreciate their commitment to peacekeeping at the outset thus l eading to simplified budgeting and reimbursement further key benefit is that missions w ill be able to implement an integrated management structure in the field lesson 1 the evolution of troop and coe reimbursement 10 1 when was the

2 the student will be exposed to the basics behind the coe sy stem many of these elements will be repeated throughout the other lessons so it i s important for the student to understand the rationale for these elements this lesson serves as foundation for the more detailed lessons to follow the student should also note the key documents mentioned in this lesson it is important to remember that the wording of the various documents submi tted for approval was key to the success of the coe initiative the working group spent an extensive amount of time making the wording as clear as possible without being overly restrictive this lesson in addition to the others uses exact wording or paraphrasing of both the documents and the coe manual students should seek out the actual references to

major concepts behind the coe system the following elements will be discussed implementation of the coe system retroactivity of the coe system binding arrangements leaserent options transportation loss and damage mission factors verification and control major equipment selfsustainment reimbursement during drawdowns termination of mission dispute resolution 22 implementation the general assembly by resolution 50222 of 11 april 1996 authorised the implementation of new procedures for determining reimbursement to mem ber states for contingentowned equipment these procedures came into effect on 1 july 1996 the procedures were applicable to all new missions as soon as the s ecretariat had procedural arrangements in place as of 31 october 2006 there have been 550 memorandums of understanding mous raised for the provision of troops and equipment under the coe system the mous covered support to 19 missions and involve 74 different different member states 23 retroactivity for missions activated prior to 1 july 1996 trooppolicecontributors tcp cs had the option to accept reimbursement under either the new or the old reimburse ment methodology since part of the reason behind reform of the reimbursement methodology was to provide simplicity accountability and financial and management control applyi ng the coe system to previous or ongoing claims was seen as benefit for both the cretariat and the member secretariat lit up for uns 50th anniversary new york 1994 photo 188956c lesson 2 standard elements of the coe system and lease options 16 states essentially determination was made between unhq nd the member states as to the most costeffective system to use to settle older missions nine retroactive claims for reimbursement under the coe system were made all for unpf the claims were for both major equipment and selfsustainme nt and covered period from 1992 to 1996 24 binding arrangements one of the goals of the coe system is to have memorandum of unde rstanding mou signed by the tcpc and the united nations prior to deployment stipulat ing the obligations of each party related to personnel major equipment and selfsustainment the final form of the mou can vary as long as the substantive elements of the model mou remain consistent for all member states the legal aspects of the mou are to be in ac cordance with the financial rules and regulations of the it is understood that changeamendment addit ion to or deletion from the model mou is to affect or diminish the legally binding na ture of the mou on the parties 25 reimbursementlease options the tcpcs are reimbursed under wet or dry lease as per rates adopted by the general assembly wet lease provides for reimbursement for the use of the serviceable equipment and its associated maintenance and consumables eg fluids oils lubricant s if not provided by the fuel can also be included in the wet lease dry lease is for equipment use only with maintenance and support being provided through the reimbursement is limited to those items of major equipment includi ng associated minor equipment and consumables specifically agreed to by the should contingent provide less major equipment or selfsustainment categories than that stipulate d in the mou the tcpc will be reimbursed only for major equipment or selfsustainment categorie s that were actually provided the method of computation for the monthly equipment usage charge for the m odular dry lease system and components of modular wetdry lease system are discussed in lesson 5 and lesson 8 the tcpcs are reimbursed for selfsustainment as per rates in general assembly documents these rates are listed in chapter 8 of the coe manual and are covered in lesson 9 rates of reimbursement for special equipment will be negotiated s eparately between the tcpc and the and is covered in lesson 5 reimbursement rates will be adjusted for any period for which tcpcs are not meeting the standards the coe manual also has

and hostile actionforced abandonment must be made nofault incidents the wet leasedry lease rates include nofault factor to cover loss of or damage to equipment in nofault incident there is additional rei mbursement and other claims are receivable in the case of equipment loss or dama ge in such incidents see definition of nofault incident in chapter 6 of coe manual hostile actionforced abandonment in cases of loss or damage resulting from single hostile action or forced abandonment the tcpc will assume liabilit for each and every item of equipment when the collective generic fair market value is below t he threshold value of 250000 for major equipment lost or damaged as result of single hostil action or forced abandonment the will assume liability for each and every item whose generic fair market value equals or exceeds 250000 or for those lost or damaged when the collec tive generic fair market value of such equipment equals or exceeds 250000 the value of the s or damage is determined using the gfmv the reimbursement is made at the gfm v rates less the equipment use charge and any other environmental and intensified operational use pay ment made by the for that equipment the tcpc cannot file claims against the for loss or damag to spare parts minor equipment and consumables these are covered by the missionapproved hostile actionabandonment factor which is applied to the spare parts component of the wet leas as well as the selfsustainment rates andor by the nofault incident fact or included in the drywet lease rates in the case of loss or damage during transportation the party making transportation arrangements is responsible for loss or damage incurred during trans portation the loss and damage issue has been clarified and is to be applied to ensure that tcpcs are reimbursed where significant damage occurs to coe during transportation significant damage has been defined as damage where the repairs amount to 10 or more of the generic fair market value of the item of equipment the has responsibility for reimbursement where loss and damage is due to wilful misconduct or negligence by members of the tcpc as determined by board of inquiry convened by duly authorised personnel of the the report of which has been pproved by the responsible official major equipment can be provided to the by one tcpc to be used at the request of the by another tcpc in these cases major equipment provided to peacekeeping mission by tcpc and used by another tcpc shall be treated wit h due diligence the user tcpc shall be responsible for reimbursing the providing tcpc

provided in the mou loss or damage to special case equipment shall be treated in the same manner as other major equipment when equipment is provided under wet lease arrangement the method of c alculation for damage is the reasonable cost of repair equipment which has suffer ed damage is to be considered total loss when the cost of repair exceeds 75 of the gfmv more detailed information of loss and damage is provided in lesson 6 28 mission factors mission factors are intended to compensate the tcpc for extreme operating conditions in the mission area when conditions impose significant and additional hards hips they are to be applied to the lease rates as follows an extreme environmental condition factor not to exceed 5 of the reimbursement rates for major equipment and for selfsustainment an intensified operational conditions factor not to exceed 5 of the reimbursement rates for major equipment and for selfsustainment and hostile actionforced abandonment factor not to exceed 5 of the reimbursement rates for selfsustainment and the spare parts element or ½ of the maintenance rate included in the wet lease rate these factors will be determined by the technical survey team t the initiation of the mission mission factors are specific to each peacekeeping miss ion and will be applied universally throughout the mission these factors are subject to chang depending on

assessment of the operational capabilities of the equipment and services and head2right the must also demonstrate that where the has agreed to provi self sustainment it does so to the same standards as those approved by the g eneral assembly and expected of tcpcs operational readiness inspection this inspection must be carried out at least once during every sixmonth period of the contingents deployment in the missi on area and anytime the mission believes the equipment or services do not meet t he standards the condition of the major equipment and selfsustainment will be inspected with view to assess whether the capability is sufficient and satisfactory repatriation inspection this inspection shall account for all major equipment of the tcpc to be repatriated and verify the

very important that students understand the meaning and application of the standards as basis for reimbursement negotiations explanations nd examples will be provided to demonstrate the application of the standards to both major equipme nt and self sustainment by the end of this lesson the student should be familiar with the requirements for reimbursement based on the standards set forth in the coe manual the should also be conversant with the processes for verification and control for personnel equipment and mate rial lesson 3 standards verification and control 29 31 introduction reimbursement is dependent upon verification that the material and ser vices provided meet the undertaking of the tcpc in its mou with the the objective of the coe system is that the pays for what it wants to achieve that objective there needs to be set of standards that member states must maintain to be eligible for r eimbursement moreover means of verifying both the quantity and quality of equipment and support service s needs to be in place chapter 3 of the coe manual is the main reference for this lesson 32 purpose the purpose of these principles and procedures is to define the means by which the will ensure in conjunction with the tcpc that the required standards in quantity and quality of material and services for which reimbursement will be sought are met 33 verification guiding principles the verification and control procedures are intended to ensure that the t erms of the mou between the and the tcpc are met by both parties at the outse t and throughout the period of effect of the mou major equipment and selfsustainment standards are defined in terms of operational capability for each categorysubcategory rather than on the details of prescriptive list of the type and levels of equipment required these standards of operational capability are promulgated in general assembly documents and listed in annexes and b of chapter 3 of the coe manual the in conjunction with the respective contingents or delegated author ity designated by the tcpc is responsible for ensuring that the equipment and services provided by the tcpc meets the requirements of the peacekeeping operation and is provided in ccordance with the mou entered into by the with the tcpc in order to do so the will verify the status condition and quantity of the equipment and services provided this control is implemented in cooperation between the and the tcpc in accordance with the term s of the mou for the provision of military personnel equipment and services the inspectionverification team which may be composed of st aff members and military personnel assigned by the head of mission or by an offic ial acting on hisher behalf must be assigned to the inspection team for sufficient period of time t ensure continuity in the control activities the tcpc must designate person at each c ontingentunit who is responsible point of contact with the inspectionverification team for verification and control matters in the conduct of the verification process reasonability view is to be employed when assessing the yielded results including whether positive steps have been taken towards fulfilment of the mou that is to say the tcpc and the have taken all reasonable lesson 3 standards verification and control 30 measures and have met the spirit of the mou if not the full substa nce and also taken into account the importance of the subject and length of period where the mou has not been f ulfilled the guiding principle in determining reasonability is whether the material to be provided by the tcpc as well as by the will meet its military function at additional cost to the or the tcpc other than those provided for in the mou the results of the control process are to be used by the and the t cpc as basis of consultative discussions at the lowest level possible in the mission areas in order t hat capabilities provided by the tcpc meet the operational requirement of the mission however the control process in medical matters is one of quality assurance to ensure that all troops and staff in peacekeeping mission are offered medical services according to the standards stated in the coe manual chapter 3 annex b arrival inspection must ascertain the dical preparedness and vaccination status of all troops the process also serves to det ermine whether minimum standard of quantity or quality of both material and services has been provided with the required corrective actions and the adjustment to the agreed eligibility f or reimbursement alternatively the parties given the degree of nonfulfilment of the mou may see k to renegotiate the terms and conditions in the mou 34 major equipment standards there are verifiable standards by which both dry and wet lease are applied and subsequently reimbursed the following standards and associated definiti ons are designed to apply to the equipment listed in annex to chapter 3 of the coe manual the standards stated in terms of operational requirements are designed to be generic in nature to fit the widest range of equipment the following principles are applicable to all equipment equipment arriving in theatre must be in serviceable condition for us in its primary role and must already be painted with markings ambulances and othe r vehicles dedicated to the transport of medical staff or medical supplies shoul d be clearly marked with symbol placing it under the protection of the geneva convention any requirement to disassembleassemble the equipment due to shipping constr aints will be completed by the contingent at its own expense as part of the deployme nt process this will include the addition of pol removed for the purpose of transportation b all associated minor equipment checklists or load list items requi red for use with the equipment in the performance of its role will accompany the equipment or be in clearly identifiable cargo for inclusion with the equipment on arrival in theat re c under the wet lease reimbursement the contributor is responsible for the provision of replacement equipment spare parts maintenance and contracted repair and consumables basic 2 per cent transportation factor for the resupply of spare parts and consumables is included in the wet lease rate this 2 rate is further increased by 025 lesson 3 standards verification and control 31 for each complete 500 miles or 800 kilometres segment beyond the first 500mile or 800 kilometre segment along the consignment route between the port of emba rkation and the arrival point in the mission area d to meet serviceability standards contingents have the option to mainta in an additional 10 of the mouauthorised quantities of major equipment to be deployed and r deployed with the contingent the united nations will be responsible for the associated deployment and redeployment as well as paintingrepainting costs however troop contributor will not receive wet or dry lease reimbursement for overstocks reasonability view is to be employed when assessing whether performance standard has been met however the capabilities staff and medical equipment and the capability to perform emergency medical procedures according to the standards f or medical self sustainment stated in the coe manual annex b of chapter 3 must be pr esent at all times trooppolicecontributors and the united nations should not be penalis ed when nonperformance results from the operational situation in the mission area f any equipment damaged in transit will be the responsibility of the pa rty responsible for making the transportation arrangements g the term special case should be reserved for major equipment for which reimbursement rate has not been established in the coe manual spec ial case major equipment should be of value greater than us500 collective value of l items in the set and with life expectancy greater than one year the united nations inspection team will use the mou in verifying the type and quantity of major equipment provided by the trooppolicecontributor third party maintaining equipment of another trooppolicecontributor is to meet the same performance standards as trooppolicecontributor providing mainte nance of its own equipment where contingent is employing major equipment for selfsustainment support the applicable trooppolicecontributor is not entitled to major equipment rei mbursement but only to the applicable selfsustainment reimbursement there may be inst ances where trooppolice contributor provides services such as communications medical engineering on force level or as force assets in which case there may be an entitlement to r eimbursement for major equipment whereas the same items at the unit level would be considered as m inor equipment and incorporated into the overall selfsufficiency cost base these inst ances will be specified in annexes b and c of the mou where applicable lesson 3 standards verification and control 32 35 vehicles vehicle standards present unique problem as this major equipment cat egory is divided into military and commercial pattern vehicles what differentiat these categories has been debated and reviewed since the introduction of the coe system as rate s and capability standards can vary considerably between these two categories of vehicles t hese categories are defined as follows commercial pattern vehicles are defined as those vehicles that are readily vailable from commercial source military pattern vehicles are specifically engineered and designed accordi ng to precise militarypolice specifications and are built to satisfy particular mili tarypolice mission applications the 2004 working group on coe developed the following checklist to determine w hether commercial pattern vehicle could qualify for military pattern rate of reim bursement fitted for military radio and antenna mounting plus radio system vhfhf this must be present plus any five of the following nine items

upgrade to commercial equipment entitles trooppolicecontri butor to military pattern equipment reimbursement are to be dealt with during the mou negotiat ion at unhq with paramount importance accorded to operational requirements and the principle of reasonableness in resolving disagreements commercial vehicles built to military specifications are not considered military pattern unless the above capabilit ies are met lesson 3 standards verification and control 33 36 selfsustainment standards selfsustainment is defined as logistics support for contingents in peacekeeping mission area whereby the tcpc provides some or all categories of logis tics support to the contingent on reimbursable basis contingent may be selfsufficient for various categories depending on the ability of the to provide the necessary support and the contingent s own capabilities the modular concept of selfsustainment is based on the principle that the tcpc cannot only be partially selfsustaining in any given category the required lfsustainment categories and any supplementary arrangements will be indicated in the respective mou the overarching principle regarding selfsustainment is for all t cpcs and contingents to adhere to the commitments made in their respective mou to provide t he agreed operational capability discussions between the and the tcpc will resul t in an agreement on the capabilities to be provided by the and the contingent to be deployed as starting point for negotiation the will identify and request from the tcpc those selfsustainment capabilities it cannot provide the right of the tcpc to provide any or some categ ories of selfsustainment will be taken into consideration during the negotiation of the mou howe ver the has responsibility to ensure that any selfsustainment services provided by tcpc meet the minimum operational capabilities and are compatible with other tcp cs where interface is required in addition the costs to the are similar to what it would have cost the to arrange centrally for the provision of these selfsustainment services only those services specifically agreed upon in the mou to be provide d by trooppolice contributors will be reimbursable at the rates listed in the coe manual chapter 8 see lesson 9 and appendix c using the actual troop strength up to the personnel ceiling agreed upon in the mou the inspection team will refer to the respective mou to determine the categories of self sustainment to be provided by each contingent to be eligible for reimbursement for any selfsustainment categ ory or subcategory contingent must provide all minor equipment maintenance and consumables ass ociated with that specific category or subcategory categories are subdivi ded to ensure flexibility and to reimburse the tcpc only for the minor equipment and consumables provided should contingent obtain selfsustainment services from another contingent re imbursement will be made to the tcpc providing the services unless other bilateral ar rangements have been made when the provides that service or part thereof the tcpc does not receive reimbursement for the applicable category or subcategory tcpcs may choose t procure some minor equipment and consumables from another tcpc on bilateral basis or f rom civilian contractor in which case the tcpc remains eligible for reimbur sement as long as it meets the operational capability and standards for the categories of selfsustainment trooppolicecontributors are to take note that in order not to disrupt the operational effectiveness of mission it may require significant leadti for the united nations to arrange for procurement and support for some selfsustainment categories the refore it is of paramount importance that the united nations be informed as soon as it becomes known to the trooppolice contributors that trooppolicecontributor will not be able or does not wi sh to continue lesson 3 standards verification and control 34 providing one or some of the selfsustainment capabilities negotiated in the mou in these cases the united nations and the trooppolicecontributors will have to agree to an amendment to the mou in order for the united nations to take responsibility for the provision of self sustainment categories that cannot be sustained by trooppolicecontributors where contingent is employing major equipment for selfsustainment support the applicable tcpc is not entitled to major equipment reimbursement but only to the applicable selfsustainment reimbursement there may be instances when t cpc provides services such as communications and engineering on force level in which case ther may be an entitlement for the reimbursement for major equipment whereas the same items at the unit level would be considered as minor equipment and incorporated into the overall selfsuffi ciency cost base and selfsustainment reimbursement these instances will be negotiat ed and indicated in annexes b and c of the mou where applicable tcpcs are responsible for the transportation related to the res upply of contingents for consumable and minor equipment necessary for the provision of selfsustai nment the rates approved for selfsustainment include generic premium of up to 2 to c ompensate for the cost of transportation of selfsustainment resupply tcpcs are not eli gible for additional reimbursement for the transportation of selfsustainment items the inspection team is responsible for the verification of the cate gories or subcategories of selfsustainment agreed to in the mou and to assess if the st

to request from trooppolicecontributors to change the port of exitentry will be the responsibility of the tcpc in the event of the tcpc deploying more personnel than authorised in this mou the extra costs will be borne by the tcpc there is entitlement for the reimbursement of landing fees as the considers landing fees as direct taxes from which the organisation is exempt pursuant to section 7a of the convention on the p rivileges and immunities of the reimbursement for troop costs will continue at full rates until depa rture in accordance with the withdrawal plan headquarters will develop an

starting ea ch mission and to be included in the guidelines to tcpcs issued for each missions the personnel equipment and kit agreed upon should be available to personnel prior to deployment 44 deployment and redeployment of equipment the is responsible for the deployment and repatriation of contingent owned major and minor equipment including spare parts and consumables as noted in the mou or as outlined in the guidelines for governments contributing troops the port of embarkation disembarkation shall be agreed upon and noted in the mou for landlocked countries or those whose equipment is moved by road or rail to the mission area the port of embarkationdi sembarkation will be an agreed border crossing the will normally make the necessary transportation arrangements with the tcpc and appropriate carriers when tcpc offers t provide the transportation or when the is unable to provide the required transportation the may request the tcpc via letter of assist to provide that transportation to and from the miss ion area in such cases the will reimburse the tcpc the associated cost up to the esti mated amount that would have been incurred had the provided those services

from the l other associated cost is met on the basis of the loa when transportation is provided by mil itarypolice means the incremental cost is eligible for reimbursement except the labour cost of militarypolice personnel the may request tcpc to provide petroleum oils and lubricants particularly during the startup phase under these circumstances reimbursement will be made via tter of assist for major equipment transportation shall be provided for the level liste d in the mou tcpc is allowed to exceed the quantity of equipment by up to 10 to low for backup equipment the will be responsible for the cost of transportation on deployment and re deployment for the equipment level authorised in the mou as well as for the 10 backup equipment in the event of the tcpc deploying more equipment than authorised in thi s mou the extra costs will be borne by the tcpc reimbursement for major equipment will be in effect at full rates unt il the date of cessation of operations by tcpc or termination of the mission and thereafte r be calculated at 50 of the rates agreed in the mou until the equipment departure date reimbursement for selfsustainment will be in effect at full rates until the date of cessation of operations by tcpc or termination of the mission and thereafte r be reduced to 50 of the rates agreed in the mou calculated upon the remaining actual deploy ed troop strengths until all contingent personnel have departed the mission area when the negotiates contract for the repatriation of equipment and the carrier exceeds 14day grace period after the expected arrival date t he tcpc will be reimbursed by the at the drylease rate from the expected arrival date until the actual rrival date 45 inland transportation the is responsible on initial deployment and repatriation for the c ost of inland transportation of authorised major equipment and initial provisioning of ass ociated spare parts from and to its agreed originating location and an agreed port of emba

will be the responsibility of the tcpc the may make arrangements for the transport to and from the originating base however the government will be responsible for i tems other than major equipment the will only be responsible for paying the inland transport ation costs on initial deployment and subsequent redeployment of the equipment for the major equipme nt levels stipulated in the mou plus the backup vehicles to maximum of 10 of s uch authorised levels any additional cost will be borne by the tcpc involved lesson 4 transportation procedures 46 the reimbursement for inland transportation costs including packing and cr ating materiel will be accessed and reimbursed using procedures similar to those mployed for the letter of assist loa therefore tcpcs intending to request reimbursem ent for inland transportation are responsible for contacting unhqlogistics service division lsd prior to the deployment to discuss arrangements and agree in advance on the conditions and costs eligible for reimbursement the following factors similar to those used for loa procedures wil l be taken into consideration climate changes route to the point of embarkation environmental changes border crossing crossing from one state to another for the purpose of transiting to point of embarkation changes in transportation mode from road to rail different rail ga uges road to water etc and when transportation is provided by military means the incremental cos t is eligible for reimbursement except the labour cost of military personnel on deployment or redeployment the may reimburse the cost of packing crating materials exclusive of labour costs as preventive measure aga inst loss or damage to major equipment when it is demonstrated that it is required for the safe transport of the typecategory of major equipment and directly associated minor equipment expenses associated with inland transportation of the resupply of spa re parts and consumables associated with major equipment under wet lease arrange ments and minor equipment and consumables associated with selfsustainment are not igible for additional reimbursement beyond that provided in the wet lease there is inland transportation reimbursement for spare parts or consumables under the dry lease arrangements the united nations will not reimburse the cost of transporting troops from various parts of the contributing country to the assembly point at the port of exitentry 46 rotation of equipment contingentowned equipment brought in to peacekeeping mission area is ex pected to remain for the duration of the tcpcs participation in that missi on and will not be rotated with contingent personnel therefore costs related to the transportation of equipment to meet national operational or maintenance requirements including third or fourth line maintenance are national responsibility and are not eligible for reimbursement by the the will only be responsible for reimbursing tcpc for transportation costs of ext ra equipment brought into mission area when mutually agreed in such cases headquarters will issue an amendment to the mou transportation costs will be arranged in the same manner as that for other movements as described above lesson 4 transportation procedures 47 47 transportation of spare parts and consumables other than on initial deployment and repatriation transportation of spare parts associated with the maintenance of major equipment under the wet lease arrangement is national responsibility the monthly estimated maintenance rate within the wet lease rate is increased by 2 to cover such costs this rate is further increased by an incremental transportation factor of 025 for each complete 500 miles or 800 kilometres after the first 500 miles or 800 kilometres along the consignment route between the port of embarkation and the port of entry to the mission area for landlocked countries or c ountries where equipment is moved by road or rail to and from the mission area the port of emba rkationdisembarkation will be an agreed border crossing point in order to determine the incremental transportation factor the and the tcpc will agree to distance to be considered for reimbursement at the time of neg otiation of the mou and note that distance in the mou the distance is determined using the shortest sea consignment route unless it is determined that different route is necessary the conve rsion rate to be used in computing the distance is 16091 kilometre to 1 statute mile and 1852 kilomet re to 1 nautical mile the lease rates will then be calculated accordingly transportation cost of minor equipment spare parts and consumables associ ated with self sustainment other than that incurred for initial deployment and repatri ation are not reimbursable as the selfsustainment rates include premium of up to 2 transportation fa ctor to compensate such expenditures therefore the additional incremental transportation f actor is not applicable to selfsustainment subsequent to the notice of withdrawal contingent will drawdown its s pare parts and consumables to ensure that only minimum quantities are being returned w ith the equipment on repatriation troops unload spare parts and personnel equipmen t during contingent deployment unhcra hollmann011994 lesson 4 transportation procedures 48 48 loss damage or injury in transit liability for loss or damage incurred during transportation will be assumed by the party arranging the transportation transportation means all transportation arrangements along the consignment route arranged by the loss or damage incurred during transportation is reimbursed when signif icant damage occurs to coe during transportation significant damage has been define d as damage where the repairs amount to 10 per cent or more of the generic fair market value of the item of equipm ent 49 transportation example the equipment that member state is deploying to mission wi ll travel by ship through the countrys main port this port of embarkation is located 4000 kil ometres from the designation port of disembarkation the member states militar facility providing the equipment is located 800 kilometres from its port the cost of shipping the equipment and the associated spare parts by rail to the port is 1000000 which is reimburs able by the the total gfmv of all the equipment is 20000000 with cumulative monthly mai ntenance rate of 500000 for all the equipment as part of the calculation for the mou this member state would r eceive 1 increment to the monthly maintenance rate or 5000 per month to cover the cost of shippi ng spare parts and consumables to support the equipment in the mission area the maintena nce rate already includes factor for the first 800 kilometres the remaining 3200 kil ometres are divided

utilisation of equipment while on peacekeeping missions including the authorised rates for generic items however there are items of equipment listed in the same document that are annotated as special equipment the following sections outline the procedure to negotiate mou with the equipmentproviding country and to determine rate of reimbursement for that special case other than aircraft and ships the requirements for special equipment such as aircraft and ships re not covered in the coe manual but they continue to be the subject of negotiations and arrang ements via letters of assist 52 definition special case equipment is that major equipment for which due to the uni queness of the item its high value or the lack of generic group standard rate of reimbursement has not been defined

by 12 plus the nofault incident factor for loss multiplied by the generic fair market value divided by 12 wet lease rate dry lease rate calculated above plus the estimated monthly maintenance costs provided by the tcpc the estimated monthly maint enance rate includes nofault incident factor for damage which is calculated s generic fair market value multiplied by 50 of the nofault incident factor for loss as in dry lease above divided by 12 note that this nofault incident factor for damage is in addition to the fault incident factor for loss included in the dry lease rate mission factors the mission factors will be applied where applicable and when necessary to the wet or dry lease rates to compensate for the potential increased wear and tear in the mission area mission factors are used in the initi calculation of the special rate but applied afterwards to all major equipment lesson 5 special equipment rates 57 57 sample calculation the following information is provided to assist the

factor to recognise the effects of inflation and factor to discount prior use estimated useful life in years based on normal operations in the home country wet lease requests only estimated monthly maintenance costs currency this figure is to be based on the spares contracted repair third li ne maintenance and the estimated monthly pol cost required to keep the above item operational to the specified standards and return the item to operational condition upon return from the m ission area the cost of personnel involved in first and second line maintenance is exclude d from the figure as these are reimbursed under the gaapproved troop cost this estimate is based on normal operations estimated monthly use kilometres miles or hours only required when seeking wet lease reimbursement for special case vehicles or equipment requiring pol this factor will be used to ensure that the estimated monthly mai ntenance and the estimated monthly pol use reported above are based on similar

contingentowned equipment under the f ollowing circumstances nofault incidents intransit loss damage or injury member state third party loss or damage wilful misconduct or negligence 62 nofault incidents nofault incident is defined as an incident resulting from misha p that is not attributable to wilful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of an operatorcus todian of equipment this includes inter alia vehicle accidents and thefts the wet lease dry lease rates include nofault factor to cover loss of or damage to equipment in nofault incident there is additional reimbursement and other claims are receivable in the case of quipment loss or damage in such nofault incidents for example contingent has an accident that destroys 1 million armoured personnel carrier the member state would receive reimbursement for the loss there are some types of incidents that are not the fault of the contingent for which reimburse ment can be sought but these are not classified as nofault see sections 64 to 66 yet even in these cases the damage must be in excess of 250000 succinctly put the does not reimburse m embers states for losses in the mission area of 250000 or less regardless of the cause in addition the does not assume additional financial responsibilities resulting from their inability to make payments for contingentowned equipment owing to lack of funding member states cannot claim for financial burden or administrative overhead resulting from the length of the claims process this would include any costs associa ted with equipment replacement as contingents are permitted to stock additional equipment in the mission area to ensure continued service 63 loss damage or injury in transit the party arranging the transportation will assume liability for loss or damage during transportation in most instances this is the responsibility of the transportation means all transportation arrangements along the consignment route arranged by the reimbursement by the for loss or damage in transit will be based on the gfmv not the member states actual price lesson 6 equipment loss and damage 66 if member state has been authorised to arrange for its own tra nsportations service the would only be liable for cost over and above any insurance adjustments member states are to ensure that adequate insurance coverage is in place in these inst ances insurance costs are to be included in the loa for transportation services loss or damage incurred during transportation is only reimbursable when significant damage occurs to coe during transportation arranged by the significant damage has been defined as damage where the repairs amount to 10 or more of the generic fair market value of the item of equipment 64 liability for third party damage to major contingentowned equipment major equipment can be provided to the by one tcpc to be used at the request of the by another tcpc in these cases the following principles will apply adequate training is necessary to ensure that user is qualifie d to operate unique major equipment such as armoured personnel carriers the will be respons ible for ensuring that this training is conducted and to provide funding for the training the arrangements to provide and conduct this training are to be negotiated between the the tcpc providing the major equipment and the tcpc using the major equipment the results of the negotiation are to be reflected in the respective mous major equipment provided to peacekeeping mission by tcpc and use d by another tcpc shall be treated with due diligence the user tcp c shall be responsible for reimbursing the providing tcpc through the for any damage that may occur whether as result of wilful misconduct gross negligence or negl igence by personnel of the user tcpc and any incident involving damage shall be investigated and processed accordi ng to the application of rules and regulations the secretariat when establishing or amending mous between the and tcpcs shall take the abovementioned principles and procedures into account 65 hostile action or forced abandonment hostile action is defined as an incident of short or sustained durati on resulting from the actions of one or more belligerents which has direct and signif icant hostile impact on the personnel andor equipment of tcpc single hostile action may be characterised when different activities can be related to each other by means of place or tacticalstrategic considerations as acknowledged by the force commanderpolice commissioner forced abandonment is defined as actions resulting from decision appr oved by the force commanderpolice commissioner or his authorised representative or provision in the rules of engagement which results in the loss of custody and control of equipment and supplies lesson 6 equipment loss and damage 67 tcpcs are responsible for major equipment loss or damage result ing from single hostile action or forced abandonment when the collective value for loss or damage is less than the threshold value of 250000 for major equipment lost or damaged as result of single hostile action or forced abandonment the will assume liability for each and every item of major equipment whose generic fair market value equals or exceeds 250000 or for major equipment lost or damaged when the collective generic fair market value of such equipment equals or exceeds 250000 equipment with gfmv greater than 250000 is not considered w hen calculating collective gfmv since its loss or damage is rei mbursed on an individual basis upper limit should be placed on justified claims when equipment is provided under wet lease arrangement the method of calculation for damage shall be the reasonable cost of repair equipment that has suf fered damage will be considered total loss when the cost of repair exceeds 75 of the g eneric fair market value the cost of repair will be determined through the mission maintenance system tcpc cannot file claims against the for loss or damag to spare parts minor equipment and consumables these are covered either by the missionapprove d hostile actionabandonment factor see lesson 7 or by the nofault incident fac tor lesson 8 included in the drywet lease rates this includes cumulative loss or dam age even if it is in excess of building destroyed in unscom 1991 photo 159125c lesson 6 equipment loss and damage 68 250000 for example if contingent has its warehouse of spare parts nd consumables valued at 5000000 destroyed by hostile actions the is not responsible for reimbur sing the value of the inventory the use of mission factors and nofault factors is the premium paid by the to member sates to guard against such losses when tcpc submits claim for loss or damage in excess of 250000 the method of calculation is based solely on the generic fair market value g fmv the dry lease rate wet lease rate and any other environmental and intensified operational use payment made by the for that equipment are not considered when calculating the value of the equipment for use in determining loss or damage amounts 66 wilful misconduct or negligence the has responsibility for reimbursement when loss and damage i s due to wilful misconduct or negligence by members of the tcpc as determined by board of inquiry convened by duly authorised personnel of the the report of the board of inqui ry must also be approved by the responsible official in applying the term gross negligence consideration will be gi ven as appropriate to the criteria set out in the legal opinion of 30 june 1981 including its attac

special arrangements between the and the country will apply the nofault incident factor for special case equipment will be the same as items of sim ilar type for which wet and dry lease rates have been promulgated unless special negotiated arrangements have been stated in the morandum of understanding loss or damage to special case equipment shall be tre ated in the same manner as other major equipment at the time of the arrangements being made for special equipment the value of the equipment and the lease rate will be determined and indicated in the mou aircraft and vessels are not

factors as part of the coe reimbursement process since mission factors are designed for additional reimbursement based on the rigors of specific miss ion area it is important that the student realise the situation and requirements that have to be t the student will learn how the determines mission factors and the elements used in the dec isionmaking process the student will also be provided with practical example to test the ir ability in determining mission factors lesson 7 mission factors 75 71 introduction mission factors are increments to the reimbursement rates for major equipment and self sustainment minor equipment and consumables to compensate tcpcs for specific conditions prevailing in the area of responsibilities aor which cause unusual wear and tear shorter life of equipment increased maintenance costs andor risk of damage and loss to the equipment increments are included in mission budgets developed after technical survey mission factors are applicable to all contingents in mission area and subject to subsequent review should circumstances change compensation for costs borne by tcpcs in those circumstances would be limited to the rates set for that mission note that such inc rements would only be proposed under conditions of significant anticipated additional costs to contingent thr ee mission factors have been defined as follows an extreme environmental factor not to exceed 5 per cent of the wet dry lease rate and the selfsustainment specific factor is to be recommended by the initial united nations technical survey team for approval taking into account element s such as extreme mountainous climatic and terrain conditions an intensity of operations factor not to exceed 5 per cent of the wetdry l ease rate and the selfsustainment specific factor is to be recommended by the initial united nations technical survey team for approval taking into account elements such s the scope of the task assigned the length of logistics chains the nonavailability of commercial repair and support facilities and other operational hazards and conditions and hostileforced abandonment factor not to exceed 5 per cent of the spa res element of the wet lease rate or half of the estimated monthly maintenance c ost when the spares cost cannot be calculated separately and the selfsustainment to compens ate for the cost of losses borne by contingents for minor equipment spare parts and consumables 72 determining mission factors these factors will be determined by the technical survey team t the initiation of the mission they are specific to each peacekeeping mission and will be applied universally throughout the mission decision sheet is used by the technical survey team visiting the peacekeeping area at the beginning of mission to evaluate each of the mission factors lesson 7 mission factors 76 example of combined mountainous and extreme environmental conditions ms office 2000 upon returning from the survey mission the technical survey team is to submit this report to the military advisorpolice advisor miladpolad and the asg office of mission support asgoms for review and approval the resulting factor is to be indicated in the mou these factors are subject to change depending on the prevailing conditi ons in the mission area the or tcpc can request review of the mission fac tors whenever the conditions in the mission have changed sufficiently to warrant reassessment when the rates are reviewed and amended the approving authority will specify an effective date for the new rates 73 extreme environmental conditions 731 general an extreme environmental condition factor is designed to compensate member states for support operations in difficult terrain or extreme weather specific factor is to be recommended by the initial technical survey team for approval taking into account elements such as extreme mountainous areas desert or arctic climates and terrain conditions rocky swamps etc annex to chapter 7 of the coe manual contains decision sheet used by the technical survey team visiting the peacekeeping area at the beginning of mission the purpose of this d ecision sheet is to assist the evaluator in determining any environmental conditions factor in miss ion areas which is introduced to compensate troopcontributing countries for the impact of exc eptional and extreme conditions which result in shorter equipment life and increased maintena nce costs this factor not to exceed 5 is to be applied to the wetdry lease rate and the selfsustainment r ates although the elements cannot be totally assessed objectively some ssistance to this effect is provided the evaluator will also have to base the assessment on m ilitary experience and common sense to complete this evaluation 732 calculation conditions the following conditions which might contribute to premature wear and ar of the equipment and increased maintenance costs are to be analyzed terrain profile the following terrain profiles have been identified for considerati on in this mission factor lesson 7 mission factors 77 mountainous if the terrain can be characterised as rough mountains ie st eep gorges peaks and substantial rock outcrop points are allocated for the differe nce in altitude between the base camps and the average elevation of the outposts the average change in elevation is divided by the rated percentage of how much of the aor is mountainous average change in elevation percentage of aor affected less than 800 meters 0 small portion 1029 4 800 to 1600 meters 1 substantial but less than half 3049 3 1600 to 2400 meters

mountainous factor would be 13 desert conditions if the terrain can be characterised as desert loose sand and sharp roc ks are the main factors of the terrain profile one method of asses sing these factors is to allocate points for mobility based on average speed with offroad type vehicles the average speed of travel is divided by the rated percentage of how much of the aor is desert average speed of travel percentage of aor affected less than 10 kmhour 3 small portion 1029 4 10 to 15 kmhour 2 substantial but less than half 3049 3 15 to 25 kmhour 1 substantial and more than half 5069 2

warranting consideration for inclusion in the extre environmental conditions factor if the mission area is subject to the subgroups be low allocate points within the allowed range for compatibility with the subgroup of the actual average daily high or low temperature humidity or rainfall and months of duration extreme 3 points tropical equatorial climate where the average daily high temperature is 29 degrees celsius or above all 12 months of the year average morning humidity is 80 or more or average precipitation is over 100 mm all twelve months of the year on the other end of the scale can be tundra climate where the average daily low temperature is under minus 10 degrees celsius for each of the coldest five months substantial 2 points tropical monsoon climate where the average daily high temperat ure is 29 degrees celsius or more all 12 months of the year average morning humidity is 80 or more or average daily precipitation is over 100 mm for five to six months of the year moderate 1 point tropical dry climate where the average daily high temperat ure is 25 40 degrees celsius over the year average monthly precipitation has maximum of three months with over 50 mm all other climate conditions would be considered temperate and would score zero road conditions the quality and quantity of the road transportation network can increase the consumption and wear and tear of vehicles operating in tha t aor if roads bridges or ferries are especially poor and impeding communications between ba camps and resupply points allocate points for main plus secondary roads as follows main road conditions secondary road conditions few hardened main roadsbridges 1 plus several secondary dirt roads 0 few dirt main roadsferries 2 very few secondary dirt roads 1 main roads 3

bellige rents which has direct and significant hostile impact on the personnel andor equipment of tcpc single hostile action may be characterised when different activities can be related to each other by means of time place or tacticalstrategic considerations as acknowledged by the force commanderpolice commissioner forced abandonment is defined as actions resulting from decision approved by the force commanderpolice commissioner or his authorised representative or provision in the rules of engagement which results in the loss of custody and control of equipment and supplies the missionapproved factor is applied to each category of the selfsustainment rates and to the spares element of the estimated maintenance rate of the wet lease rate and is not to exceed 5 of the rates this is different from the other two mission factors which are applied to the wet lease rate the distinction is made because contingents are res ponsible for managing the risks associated with the quantity and locations of spare parts storage this factor is intended to compensate tcpcs for potential loss and damage below the value of 250000 the same factor will apply to all tcpcs in the mission area and will be indicated in the mou between the and each respective tcpc when the spares cost cannot be calculated separately the factor i s half of the estimated monthly maintenance cost the working group used several elements to termine the estimated daily maintenance rates found in the major equipment table s see lesson 8 the spares element can be found in the database created by the phase ii i working group and developed for use by oms although the elements cannot be totally assessed objectively some ssistance to this effect is provided the evaluator will also have to base the assessment on m ilitary experience and common sense to complete this evaluation when assessing the risk for hostile action and potential forced abandonment the standards of the traditional chapter vi

the actual rate s used to calculate reimbursement for major equipment building upon previous less ons lesson 8 will use examples and scenarios to familiarise the student with wet and dry lease generic equipment groups and the roles and responsibilities of rate calculations the l atest rate tables will be provided to the student in appendix c the objective of this lesson is to provide the student with an understanding of the complexities and detail involved in completing coe agreements c alculator and some scrap paper will be required when the student is taken through examples of re imbursement calculations it is particularly important to be familiar wit h the standards that define each category of major equipment simply having equipment in mission are is not good enough the equipment must fulfil its intended use and be maintained to reasonable standard lesson 8 major equipment rates 91 81 introduction there are verifiable standards by which both dry and wet lease are applied and subsequently reimbursed the following standards and associated definiti ons are designed to apply to the equipment listed in annex to chapter 8 of the coe manual the standards stated in terms of operational requirements are designed to be generic in nature to fit the widest range of equipment 82 standards major equipment is grouped into 11 categories some with major subcategories as f ollows communication equipment including head2right vhfuhffm transceivers head2right satellite equipment head2right telephone equipment head2right airfield support equipment and head2right miscellaneous equipment electrical equipment engineering equipment including logistics and demining equipment riot control equipment medical and dental equipment observation equipment including both area and personal use accommodation equipment including semirigid and rigid structures and containers aircraft armaments naval vessels vehicles including head2right tanks head2right armoured personnel

lesson 8 major equipment rates 92 the following standards are used by the mission inspection team to det ermine the use and suitability of major equipment 821 communications equipment the provision of communications equipment for drywet lease reimburseme nt will be applied to communications contingents providing services on force level that is above the battalion or contingent level the service must be available to all units as designated by the mission headquarters and will be included in the mou the mou will specify the technical specifications to be used the equipment must be sufficient to provide the basic communications network desired by the mission backup capability must be retained in theatre to ensure uninterrupted service the backup equipment will deploy and redeploy with the contingent when higherlevel communication capabilities are required by non communication units and are not reimbursable under the selfsustainment rate for communications eg inmarsats the equipment must be authorised in the mou in which case it will be reimbursable as major equipment in the same manner as for communications unit inmarsat used for national rearlink purposes is national responsibility and is not reimbursable 822 electrical this equipment is for the provision of main source generating power for base camps company or larger dispersed locations or specialist units requiring large power sources greater than 20 kva eg medical facilities maintenance workshops it is to include all associated minor equipment consumables and wiring harnesses and cabling to connect end users lighting fixtures accommodation circuits and wiring are reimbursable under t he electrical self sustainment rate when troops or specialist units from one contingent are deployed with another contingent the responsibility for supplying the power with sufficient backup capacity must be defined in the mou of both parties base camp main generators and generators supplying medical facil ities will have back up capability running in parallel the backup capacity must at all times be sufficient to cover medical needs and must be connected to the vital areas of the medica l facilities giving these facilities first priority the combination of the output of the two generators is used to determine members of the canadian signal regiment testing rad io equipment at unef headquarters in

related wiring and cabling c ircuit panels and transformers are to be repaired or replaced within two hours single generators ie not running in parallel will operate with maximum of three hours of servicing refuelli ng or repair within 24hour period generators supplying medical facilities must have backup capabil ity running in parallel as well the backup capacity must at all times be sufficient to cover medical needs when troops or medical units from one tcpc are deployed and operating with contingent of another tcpc the responsibility for supplying power with sufficient back up capacity will be negotiated on casebycase basis and indicated in annex b of the mou 823 engineering engineer equipment will be maintained to ensure its immediate ava ilability for use as deployed when an engineering unit is tasked to conduct deminingeod on behalf of the sion as force asset the equipment will be reimbursed as major equipment whe re applicable as agreed in the mou ammunition and explosives consumed in deminingeod operations or in specifically ordered operational training above accepted readiness standards are reimbursable upon presentation of claim and certification from the mission since the costs of ammunitions or explosives associated to special case major equipment items are not inc luded in the calculation of monthly wet lease rates an incremental transportation factor is not included to reimburse the cost of transportation for the replenishment consequently the will reimburse for the transportation cost of the deployment and repatriation as well as re plenishment of those specific ammunitions and explosives used for deminingeod tasks at force level using force asset major equipment 824 riot control equipment this is new equipment category that was added based on recommendati ons from the 2004 coe working group this category includes personal equipment body protect ion items batons gas masks etc and collective equipment loud hailers searchl ights gas launchers etc it is only applied to military contingents that have defined riot control task personal equipment is reimbursed in sets of ten while collective equipment is grouped in platoon and company level sets riot control equipment will be maintained to ensure its immediate availability for use as needed 825 medical and dental only medical equipment provided as per standards and authorised in the mou will be reimbursed as medical equipment the medical equipment stipulated in the mou is applicable wherever medical equipment is used for the provision of medical servic providing levels 1 2 lesson 8 major equipment rates 94 and 3 services according to standards this includes general medi cine internal medicine surgical and other medical specialties such as agreed dental hyg iene dispensary blood testing and processing xray laboratory ward and stabilisationlifesaving measures and capabilities and evacuation to the next level the contingents must have sufficient medical equipment as stipulated in the standards for levels 1 2 and 3 medical services in order to provide the respective outpatient and inpatient care basic and advanced diagnostic services basic and advanced lifesaving basic and advanced surgical capacities and capabilities and sufficient resupply capabilities as well as casevacmedevac capabilities and capacities in the mission area as per the mou requested medical equipment must be provided and maintained in ful ly operational condition maintaining an aseptic and sterile environment as per world h ealth organisation who requirements in order to ensure uninterrupted medical support and n adequate standard for medical services including evacuation capabilities if laboratory is included in level 1 medical facility at t he request of the united nations then it will be reimbursed as laboratory only major equipment level 1 medical facilities are considered force assets thus available to all members of mission therefore level 1 hospital medical equipment is eligi ble to the reimbursement of the major equipment rate of level 1 hospital listed in the coe manual the medical facilities are reimbursed for each module ie leve ls 1 2 or 3 dental and laboratory only of medical equipment as long as the equipment meets the standards the cost of each medical facility module and therefore the related reimburse ment rates is based on the generic fair market value gfmv of each piece of medical quipment required by the module as recommended by phase v working group the revised lists of equipment per m odule include all equipment required by the phase v working group for the separate l evels but the non medical equipment eg generators above 20 kva ambulances general hyg iene facilities and water purification systems although still requirement liste d in the medical standards have been subtracted from the medical modules gfmv and will be listed separately as major equipment in annex b of mou for separate reimbursement in addition minor adjustments in an unmee surgeon from the jordanian battalion makin g preparations for surgery in asmara 2002 photo 211887c lesson 8 major equipment rates 95 the list of major equipment and clerical corrections have been made the revised medical equipment requirements for each medical facility module are shown i n appendices to the coe manual in preparing the verification reports for medical facilities the quality capacity and capability as defined in the standards are the overriding considerati ons therefore an expert medical opinion concerning the operational impact of any shortfall discr epancy or corrective action or substitution undertaken will be required before deduction and may be made to the reimbursement 826 observation equipment under wet lease observation equipment will be maintained to ensure roundtheclock operability at all observation outposts routine calibration of equipment must be performed under dry lease arrangement the is responsible for

crewserved weapons must be operationally serviceable at 90 rat serviceability includes sighting and calibration of weapons and periodic test firing s permitted in the mission area the defines crewserved weapon as any weapon operated by more than one designated soldier ammunition for sighting calibration testfiring and training is consumable and is included in the wet lease maintenance rate therefore training ammunition is national responsibility unless the force commanderpolice commissioner specifically requires ammunition expenditures for operational traini ng and exercise beyond accepted readiness standards when weapons are provided through the sufficient spare part stocks will be maintained in theatre to ensure the serviceability standard the will reimburse contributing countries for deploying operational stocks of ammunition to and from the mission area since the costs of ammunitionsmissilesassociated with major equipment items such as antiair antiamour and howitzer and explosives used with major equipment are not included in the calculation of monthly wet lease rate an incremental transportation factor is not included to reimburse the cost of transportation for the replenishment consequently the united nations will reimburse for the transportation cost of the deployment redeployment and replenishment of those specific ammunition and for ammunition or explosives used with major equipment additionally the united nations will reimburse ammunition and explosive s expended on training beyond accepted readiness standards authorised and directed by the force commanderpolice commissioner but not for other trainingexercises within accepted united nations readiness standards for which ammunition is considered consumable covered in the wet lease rates

commercial pattern vehicles what differentiates these categories has been debated and reviewed since the introduction of the coe system as rates and capability standards can vary considerably between these two categories of vehicles commercial pattern vehicles are defined as those vehicles that are readily available from commercial source military pattern vehicles are specifical ly engineered and designed according to precise military specifications and are built to satisfy particular litary mission applications in cases where the original vehicle is of commercial patte rn and significant

separate this appendix from the main course text as handy reference for answering quizzes and the final examination it should be remembered that the major equipment rate table is bas ed on generic descriptions of equipment oms maintains databases linking specific equipment makes to their generic description clarification should always be sought from the when developing the mou to ensure categories are properly assigned in addition many of the generic descriptions are based on the capability of the equipment not its costs or additional features for example commercial pattern truck utilitycargo under 15 t ons refers to its load carrying capability see rate table appendix c whether it cost 10000 or 50000 to purchase the vehicle is not matter for the to resolve the gfmv is set at

with the use of the vehicle the same rationale applies to the monthly maintenance cost if member state used expensive high maintenance vehicles they will only be reimbursed at the set rates in the table ie 226 per month for the 15 ton truck conversely the use of low cost subst andard vehicles will be addressed through the verification and inspection program to ensur that standards are met
