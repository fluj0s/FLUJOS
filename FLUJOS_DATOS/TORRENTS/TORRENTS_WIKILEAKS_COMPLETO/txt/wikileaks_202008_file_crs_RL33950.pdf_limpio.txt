wikileaks document release httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33950 february 2 2009 congressional research service report rl33950 land conversion in the northern plains megan stubbs resources science and industry division april 5 2007 abstract within the past year increased discussion has occurred about rates and patterns of land conversion in the northern plains particularly conversion from native grass or rangeland into crop production this discussion is driven by two concerns 1 that this type of land conversion is becoming more widespread in the dakotas and in the northern plains generally and 2 that land conversion is reducing the amount of land available for both wildlife habitat and grazing these concerns are expressed most strongly by advocates of wildlife protection and enhancement those concerned fear that landowners in the region will continue to convert grasslands to crop production especially to corn production as long as commodity market prices remain high this report examines these concerns focusing on the available evidence which is limited about rates and patterns of land conversion it also presents additional questions on policy options that would respond to these concerns most likely in the context of the 2007 farm billhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33950 order code rl33950 land conversion in the northern plains april 5 2007 megan stubbs presidential management fellow resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33950land conversion in the northern plains summary land is being converted from native gra ss or rangeland into crop production in the northern plains region especially in south dakota north dakota and montana advocates of wildlife protection and enha ncement and grazing interests are concerned that landowners in this region w ill continue to convert grasslands to crop production especially to corn production as l ong as market prices remain high as the rate of land conversion accelerates those concerned suspect it will have significant environmental impacts and redu ce the amount of land available for both wildlife habitat and grazing they are seeking changes in public policy that might slow halt or reverse this process the availability of reliable and timely data to examine these concerns is limited though not enough time has pa ssed to document current trends in periodic surveys anecdotal evidence from numer ous sources suggests that grassland conversion to cropland is being observed more frequently in the northern plains than in years past identified data sets each offering differe nt time frames collec tion techniques and insights on this topic indicate shif t in land use in the region questions concerning exactly how much land is be ing converted to cropland where this land is located and what forces are driving the change can be only partially examined with the limited data currently available while the forces encouraging the convers ion of land are not discussed in depth in this report it is widely thought that the recent push for renewable energy from biofuels rising market prices for co rn and advances in biotechnology are intensifying the conversion rate some of the possibl conversion forces such as expiring conservation reserve program crp contract acres commodity support program policy and existing conservation compliance polic might be reviewed by congress in the context of the upcoming farm bill discussion on topics such as current policy technological advances in crop production changes in wildlife habitat and population regional economic s and environmental stainability could assist anticipated farm bill discussionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33950contents background 1 v i l b l d t n d i n f r m t i n3 n t i n l r s u r c i n v n t r n r i 3

northern plains within the past year increased discu ssion has occurred about rates and patterns of land conversion in the northern plains particularly convers ion from native grass or rangeland into crop production this disc ussion is driven by two concerns 1 that this type of land conversion is becoming mo re widespread in the dakotas and in the northern plains generally and 2 that land conversion is reducing the amount of land available for both wildlife habitat and grazing these concerns are expressed most strongly by advocates of wildlif protection and enhancement those concerned fear that landowners in the regi on will continue to c onvert grasslands to crop production especially to corn producti on as long as commodity market prices remain high this report examines th concerns focusing on the available evidence which is limited bout rates and patterns of land conversion it also presents additional questions on policy opti ons that would respond to these concerns most likely in the context of the 2007 farm bill1 background the issue of increased land conversion ac tivity in the northern plains over the past year with particular focus on centr south dakota has been brought to the attention of congress through field hearings and constituent correspondence2 constituents who object to visual indications that more land is being c onverted to crop production view the continui ng pressure to convert nd in the future and at rapid rate as the larger issue on th other hand agricultural production is market driven landowners are responding to higher market prices by converting grassland into crop production rising corn prices and the emergence of national policies that encourage additional production of crops as domestic source of energy have created additional incentives for landowners to convert to crop production3 t h u s httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33950crs2 3 continued quality incentives program january 17 2007 mr ham expressed interest in the early release of crp acres citing missed opportunities in high market prices hearing transcripts are forthcoming 4 on march 30 2007 the usdas national agricu ltural statistics service nass reported that 905 million acres nationwide are expected to be planted in corn for all purposes in 2007 if realized this would be the highest planting of corn since 1944 northern plains states south dakota north dakota and montana are projected to plant respectively 15 54 and 9 more corn in 2007 than in 2006 usda nass prospective plantings march 2007 at httpwwwusdagov nasspubstodayr ptpspl0307pdfdepartment of agriculture usda currently estimates that 905 million acres nationwide will be planted in corn during the 2007 crop year4 these acres will come from several sources including land that d been planted to other crops and idled land that will be returned to production some portion of the expansion may occur in grassland that is converted to crop pr oduction though exactly how much remains to be seen many forces that may be encouraging the conversion of land in the northern plains have intensified recently the recent push for renewable energy from biofuels and rising market prices fo r corn since august 2006 as growing portion of this crop is used as bioenergy feedstock appear to be providing economic incentives to convert land conversion also may be facilitate d by advances in biotechnology that have led to the availability of herbicide resistant crop varieties and the promise of droughtresistant varieties in the near future some assert that the availability of federal farm commodity s upport programs is providing farmers with additional incentives to convert land from native gra ss into commodity crops protecting them from full financial loss if crop should fail this is discussed more under issues for congress below those concerned about conversion maintain that the major undesirable results that accompany land conve rsion in the northern plains are 1 native oldgrowth grasslands being disrupted or destroye d 2 wildlife and nesting habitat being lost and 3 land rental rates and sale prices increasing rapidly some landowners and producers woul d likely counter that this increase in production is resulting in 1 increased economic activity in rural communities 2 lower federal spending resulting from high commodity prices and 3 meeting the demand for renewable domestic fuel supply this re port does not analyze these possible impacts primarily because they are so recent that few data are available questions concerning changing land us the amount of acreage involved and where the change is located have focused either on the northern plains generally or more specifically on parts of south da kota where conversions appear to be concentrated significant conversions also may be occurring in other areas of the country however this re port discusses only conversions in the northern plains data are limited mainly becau not enough time has passe d to document these very recent trends in periodic surveys ho wever anecdotal evidence from numerous sources suggests grassland conversion to cropland is being obs erved more frequently in the northern plains than in previous yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33950crs3 5 fourth possible data source compiled by the national agricultural statistics service nass is not discussed in this report be cause of difficulties accounting for crp acres 6 the conservation reserve program crp was not implemented until 1985 the crp which pays participating farmers to retire cropland from production had 315 million acres enrolled in 2003 this explains large portion of the declining cropland acres between 1985 and 2003 7 usda natural resources conservation rvice national

should be noted that fsa collects information on th past use of land only where program payments are being made for the first time therefore this information could potentially underrepresent the to tal of converted grassla nd assuming not all acres converted would necessarily enroll in commodity payment programs with fsa because the data are so limited and span only two consecutive years speculations on the future rate of conversion using this da ta could be inconclu sive some who have raised concerns about land conversion fear that the amount of land converted in 2007 as identified in this survey may be much greater others contend that additional plantings will come from other crops an d idled land rather than conversion of grassland neither view can be substa ntiated with the

preliminary report september 2006 issues for congress this section discusses three policy issues and their potential impact on land conversion rates and pa tterns 1 the influence of co mmodity

the c onversi on of lands that have previous cropping history what is unclear is the role co mmodity programs play in individual decisions to convert land much of the attention brought to this issue has come from cattle associations and wildlife organizations south dakota cattlemans association and ducks unlimited in particular which report grazing land and grassland losses in large numbers

lossesin wall south dakota12 wendi rinehart beef cattle and equestrian operation owner in central south dakota stated that commodity programs promoted the conversion of land and more recently at an alarming rate judge jessop grassland producer from southcentral south dakota testified that commodity programs were to blame for sod busting in parts of south dakota the commodity programs that concerned both witnesses are the marketing loan program and crop insurance pr ogram which do not require crop base to qualify for participation newly conve rted or broken land such as that being broken in the northern plains does not have cr op base acres or payment yields13 the lack of base acres or payment yields makes this land ineligible for some commodity programs eg direct payments and countercyclical payments14 though not all newly converted land would still rema in eligible for marketin g loans and crop insurance15 those concerned about the high rate of conve rsion have argued that this safety net provides farmers with the incentive to pl ace grassland range and pasture land into production because the programs for whic h the land is eligible place floor on farmers financial risks expiring conservati on reserve program crp contracts the crp is land retirement program that allows farmers to enter into long term contracts usually 10 years to retire from production and restore environmentally sensitive or highly erodi ble land as these contracts expire landowners can decide whether they want to try to reenroll back into the crp or do something else with the land such as c onvert it back to crop production the high number of crp acres scheduled to expire in the next four years in south dakota north dakota and montana heightens cerns about potential conversions

ith previous cropping history conservation compliance landowner decisions about conversion also may be influenced by conservation compliance requirements the food secu rity act of 1985 pl 99198 contained provisions that prohibited pa rticipation in numerous specified usda programs when annually tilled commodity cr ops were produced on highly erodible land hel without adequate erosion protection he l cropland broken out of native vegetation must provide substantial increase20 in soil erosion after the implementation of federally approved cons ervation plan in order to be considered compliant with the hel conservation provisions this provision is referred to as sodbuster following the implementation of cons ervation plan on hels and finding of compliance with the sodbuster provision farmer is allowed to participate in and r eceive usda program benefits native gr assland being converted to cropland in the northern plains could potentially fall under the sodbus ter provision if the land is determined to be highly erodible most land coming out of the crp in this region likely falls under sodbuster requirements because high vels of wind erosion are widespread in this region and acceptance into crp is ba sed on providing environmental benefits one of the most important of which is limiting erosion the administrations 2007 farm bill propos would address this conversion issue by augmenting sodbuster with new sodsaver provi sion the sodsaver recommendation broadens the sodbuster provision to include all grassland rangeland and native grassl and not previously in cr op production converted into cropland as permanently ineligible for specified usda program benefits unlike the sodbuster provision sodsaver would make producers ineligible for many usda programs including conservation programs even if they implement an approved conservation plan in its current form th proposal would still llow for participation in the crop insurance program on newly c onverted cropland th sodsaver provision has been endorsed by most farm and environmental organizations who have commented specifically on it the south dakota cattlemens association has stated that it supports the proposal only if crop insurance is added as an ineligible program21 as stated earlier the availability of subsidized crop insurance is viewed by some as major catalyst for land conversionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33950crs12 remaining questions while several data sources point to continuing ra tes of growth in land conversion of grassland to cropland in the northern plains these sources have limitations leaving basic questions only partially answered these questions include exactly where the conversions are occurring why they are occurring and at what rate they are occurring some are concerned bout the future pattern of land conversion in this region what environmental impact these changes will have and what changes in public policy might slow lt or reverse this process speculation varies based on assumptions about many factors includi ng future market prices for commodities eg continued high commodity prices t echnological advances eg new processes for producing bioenergy and genetic modifica tions that allow highvalue crops to be planted in new areas and commodity policies eg the availability of crop insurance the following questions are intended to help shape and inform future discussions of conversion general conversion questions what types of land are being converted to cropland are c onversions limited to the northern plains or are they occurring elsewhere as well are the driving forces behind conversion generally the same by location and how will those forces affect rates nd locations of conversion in the future other agricultural users is land conversion raising grazing land rental prices what changes are associated with conversion that can be distinguished from more general trends in land rental rates for the remaining grazing land and for cropland wildlife and hunting is conversion having an adverse effect on wildlife and thereby diminishing hunting opportun ities for upland game birds is the quantity or quality of hunting opportunities being reduced by conversion ra tes and patterns or by rising rental rates would any adverse effects on wildlif be reversible if the cropland in the northern plains is returned to grasslands if so how rapidly technology what roles are technolog ical advances including genetic modifications to plants and altered agronomic practices playing in encouraging some of the conversion to cropland technological change continues to improve productivity from year to year how does the potential for increased production affect rates and patterns of conve rsion if at all sustainability the northern plains ve history of frequent drought that increases as one moves from east to west what are the effects of conversion on soil moistu re what sustainable production techniques such as longer cr opping cycles are possible with grassland conversion in the region how do concerns about dealing with dry conditions affect economic incentives to convert grassland to cropland economics how would various farm bill proposals alter the marginal value of converting land from grass to crops can changes in policies and progra ms alter the point at which landowner decides that it is more profitable worth the effort and worth the riskhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33950crs13 to make the conversion economically feasible given current market conditions what are the fiscal implications of providing crop insurance andor disaster paym ents to marginally cropped land how would making converted gr asslands ineligible for crop insurance or ineligible for all commodity program benefits affect landowner decisions will converted lands be more susceptible to catastrophic losses and lead to great er public pressure for disaster assistance conservation compliance and proposed changes currently sodbuster allows landowners to conve rt grassland considered to be highly erodible to cropland without any loss of available benefits if it is farmed following conservation plan do the current conservation compliance requirement s slow conversion are the current sodbuster requirements bein g enforced and if so are they providing disincentives to conve rt land the administrations proposed sodsaver would give some producers in the northern plans fewer options when making decisi ons and the loss of those options could theoretically reduce the valu of their land what effect if any would this proposed policy ch ange have on the rate or pattern of land converted and on the land market in this region
