strategic and operational decisions in the utility industry 2 identifying the drivers for rethinking the way air pollution controls are imposed on the industry 3 describing the elements of four pollutants approach and 4 discussing the ways that this approach would aﬀect the control of emissions and the industrys decisionmaking it concludes with an outline of legislative options for achieving
