agoa increased 30 in 2003 to 384 billion up from 295 billion in 2002 the increase in agoa imports since the laws enactment is impressive but it must be viewed in the broader context of africas declining share of us trade over many years agoa has done little to slow or reverse this trend the growth in agoa trade can be explained by greater number of alreadytraded g oods receiving duty free treatment under agoa one industry has grown substantially under agoa the textile nd apparel industry much of the growth in textile and apparel imports has come from the newly emerging apparel industries in leso tho kenya and swaziland apart from the apparent success of the emer gent apparel industr ies in some african countries the potential benefits from agoa have been slowly realized there has been little export diversification w ith the exception of few countries whose governments have actively promoted divers ification agricultural products are promising area for african export growth but african producer s have faced difficulties in meeting us regulatory and market standards many c ountries have been slow to utilize agoa at all others such as mali rwa nda and senegal have imple mented agoarelated projects but have made insignificant gains thus far in addition to lack of market access there are substantial obstacles to increased export growth in africa key impediments include insufficient domestic markets lack of inve stment capital and poor transportation and power infrastructures other significant challenges include low levels of health and education protectionist trade policies in afri ca and the high cost of doing business in africa due to corruption and inefficient govern ment regulation furt hermore the apparel industry in africa now faces challenge in the dismantled multifibre arrangement quota regime which ended as of january 1 2005 as result africa must now compete more directly with asian appare l producers for the us mark et agoa beneficiaries retain their dutyfree advantage but they have lost their more signifi cant quotafree advantage apparel producers have repor tedly already left lesotho with loss of 7000 jobs3 this makes

gelbkey provisions in agoa iii agoa iii extends the preference program to 2015 from its previous 2008 deadline agoa iii s upporters claimed that many agoa beneficiaries had only r ecently begun to realize gains as result of agoa and that extending agoa benefits would improve the stability of the investme nt climate in africa agoa iii also provides for apparel rules of origin and product ligibility benefits it extends the thir dcountry fabric rule for ldcs and encourages foreign inve stment and the development of agriculture and physical infrastructures extension of lesser deve loped country provision one of the more controversial aspects of agoa iii was the extension of the ldc provisi on if the ldc provision had not been extended ldcs would longer have dutyfree access to the united states for apparel made from thir dcountry fabric af ter september 30 2004 supporters of the extension claimed that if the ldc provision was not extended the apparel industry may have contracted signifi cantly causing loss of many of the gains from agoa as apparel assembly plants were shut down this might have occurred because all agoa beneficiaries would need to source their fabric and yarn from within the agoa region or from the united states in order to get dutyfree access under agoa and the regional supply of fabric and yarn would likely be insufficient to meet the demand4 sourcing materials from the united states would not be viable option because it would entail greater costs some analysts argued for the ldc provision to be extended to allow more time to devel op textile milling industry to s upport the needs of the apparel industry in africa and to prevent the co llapse of the emerging apparel industry opponents of extending the ldc provision cl aimed that the expiration of the ldc provision would provide an incentive for further textile milling investments in africa they argued that the ldc provision has sl owed fabric and yarn production investment in africa because these materials could be imported cheaply from asia for use in agoa eligible apparel with need for costly investments they feared that an extension of the ldc provision would provide disincentive to textile milling investment in africa because the deadline would lose its credibility as investors anticipated further extensions however supporters of the extension argued th at investment in the textile industry would continue because of its i nherent profitability despite the availa bility of thirdc ountry fabric others worried that looser rules of origin under the ldc provision might allow companies to use africa as transshipment point between asia and the united states the outlook for the development of xtile industry in s ubsaharan africa is clouded by the phaseout of the multifibre arrangement mfa quota regime in january 20055 now that quotas have been eliminate d africa will be competing more directly with asia for the us appare l and textile market though they remain eligible for tariff preferences apparel plants are particularly sensitive to price conditions as they do not require large capital investments and can eas ily and rapidly be shifted

africa in the longterm thus it is argued that the promotion of vertical integration betw een apparel textile and cotton producers is necessary to keep apparel plants in africa along with the jobs they provide vertical integration is challenging prospect regardless of the ld c provision extension some investment in textile milling has occurred in africa but inve stors have found it diffi cult to consistently source high quality cotton in large volumes while there is agreement that vertical integration is the key to thriving african textile and apparel i ndustry the question is how to facilitate this process6 agricultural products the growth of agricultural trade holds potential for improved economic growth in africa most africans rely on agricultural production for their income it is estimated that 62 of the labor force in africa works in agriculture and in the poorer countries that portion is as high as 927 by exporting to the us market african agricultural producers could receive high er prices for their goods in order for this to occur the united states may need to further open its market to african agricultural products and provide technical assistance to help african ag ricultural producers meet the high standards of the us market agoa iii seeks to improve african agricultural market access to the united states by providing assistance to african countries to enable them to meet us technical agricultural standards afri can agricultural producers have previously faced difficulties in meeting these standards the agoa accel eration act calls for the placement of 20 fulltime personnel to at least 10 countries in africa to provide this assistance some observers are skeptical about the effectiveness of technical assistance without increased market access others are concerned that us technical assistance is hindered by laws restricting agricultural technical assistance to products that would compete with us farm products however technical assistance propone nts point to the low institutional capacity in africa as the main obstacle to african exportled development they feel that us provided technical assistance can be an importa nt
