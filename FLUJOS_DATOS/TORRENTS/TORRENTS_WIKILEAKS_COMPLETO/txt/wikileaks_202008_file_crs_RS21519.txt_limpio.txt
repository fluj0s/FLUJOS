established by single statutory limit on the total amount of debt that may be outstanding at any time1 in few instances agencies such as the tennessee valley authority operate within their own borrowing limits established separately in law for years the public debt limit has been codified in section 3101b of title 31 united states code periodic adjustments in the debt limit take the form of

chapter 16 federal borrowing and debt feb 2008 pp 229241 for an additional discussion of issues related to increasing the debt limit see crs report rl31967 the debt limit history and recent increases by d andrew austin crs2 amendments to 31 usc 3101b usually by striking the current dollar limitation and inserting new one while most adjustments to the debt limit have been increases in some instances the debt limit has been reduced or extended at its current level for specified interval2 the congressional budget act of 1974 pl 93344 2 usc 601688 requires the house and senate to adopt concurrent resolution on the budget each year before considering revenue spending and debtlimit legislation in addition to recommending the appropriate levels of total revenues spending and the deficit or surplus the budget resolution also specifies the appropriate level of the debt limit for each fiscal year covered by the measure inasmuch as budget resolution does not become law congress and the president must enact legislation implementing budget resolution policies including any needed adjustment in the debt limit even if budget resolution is not adopted by the house and senate as occurred in 1998 2002 2004 and 2006 legislation must be enacted to raise the debt limit whenever it becomes insufficient under current legislative procedures the house and senate may develop and consider legislation adjusting the debt limit in any one of three ways 1 under regular httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21519 legislative procedures in both chambers either as freestanding legislation or as part of measure dealing with other topics 2 pursuant to house rule xxvii the socalled gephardt rule or 3 as part of the budget reconciliation process provided for under the congressional budget act of 1974 while the constitution requires that revenue measures originate in the house this requirement is not considered to apply to debtlimit measures3 over the years however most debtlimit legislation has originated in the house in 2002 and 2004 senateoriginated bill was the vehicle for the debtlimit increase the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee exercise jurisdiction over debtlimit legislation it is extremely difficult for congress to effectively influence fiscal and budgetary policy through action on legislation adjusting the debt limit the need to raise or lower the limit during session is driven by many previous decisions regarding revenues and spending stemming from legislation enacted earlier in the session or in prior years nevertheless the consideration of debtlimit legislation often is viewed as an opportunity to reexamine fiscal and budgetary policy and is marked by controversy consequently house and senate action on legislation adjusting the debt limit often is complicated hindered by political difficulties and subject to delay as shown in figure 1 total of 88 debtlimit measures were enacted into law during the period from 1940 to the present the number of laws rose steadily from the decade of the 1950s through the decade of the 1980s from 6 to 24 but dropped to 13 in the 1990s six of the 13 laws enacted in the 1990s were temporary extensions over three 2 for example pl 455 of the 79th congress 60 stat 316 june 26 1946 reduced the debt limit from 300 billion to 275 billion as budget surpluses reemerged following world war ii and pl 101461 104 stat 1078 october 25 1990 extended the current debt limit level of 3195 trillion for three days as part of series of shortterm extensions while budget summit was underway 3 see the

initiated pursuant to the gephardt rule and four were considered as part of omnibus budget reconciliation legislation compared to regular legislative procedures the gephardt rule accelerates action in the house but not the senate and the budget reconciliation process expedites consideration in both chambers table 1 at the end of this report provides information on the 13 measures adjusting the public debt limit enacted during the period from 1993 to the present of these 13 measures eight were considered under regular legislative procedures in both chambers either as freestanding legislation three measures or as part of legislation involving other matters five measures three were initiated pursuant to the gephardt rule and two were considered as part of omnibus budget reconciliation legislation the three ways of developing and considering debtlimit legislation are discussed briefly below crs4 regular legislative procedures in both chambers the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee may originate measures adjusting the debt limit at any time the senate usually acts on legislation originated by the house in 2002 and 2004 however the senate originated debtlimit bills s 2578 and s 2986 respectively which became pl 107199 and pl 108415 consideration of debtlimit measures in the house usually is subject to special rules reported by the house rules committee that may include debate limitations restrictions on the offering of amendments and other expediting features in the senate consideration of debtlimit measures generally is not subject to expediting procedures nongermane amendments may be offered and the measures may be debated at length unless cloture is invoked or other limitations are agreed to by unanimous consent the most recent adjustment to the public debt limit section 122 div pl 110 343 for instance was considered under the regular legislative process as part of the economic stabilization legislation the senate on october 1 2008 added an increase to the public debt limit among other provisions related to the proposed troubled assets relief program as an amendment to mental health parity legislation hr 1424 under the terms httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21519 of unanimous consent agreement the house subsequently under the terms of special rule hres 1525 agreed to the legislation without change on october 3 president george w bush signed the legislation on the same day gephardt rule procedures debtlimit legislation may be initiated pursuant to house rule xxvii commonly referred to as the gephardt rule named after its author representative richard gephardt4 the gephardt rule was established by pl 9678 93 stat 589591 september 29 1979 and first applied in calendar year 1980 it provides for the automatic engrossment and transmittal to the senate upon the adoption of the budget resolution of joint resolution changing the public debt limit by the amount recommended in the budget resolution the joint resolution is deemed to have passed the house by the same vote as the conference report on the budget resolution the gephardt rule originally was designated as house rule xlix the house recodified the rule as house rule xxiii at the beginning of the 106th congress repealed it at the beginning of the 107th congress and reinstated it as new rule xxvii at the beginning of the 108th congress since the rule was established in 1980 the house has originated 19 joint resolutions under this procedure the senate passed 15 of these joint resolutions passing 10 without amendment and five with amendments of the remaining four joint resolutions the senate began consideration on one but came to resolution on it and took action on three of the 19 joint resolutions originated by the house under the gephardt rule 14 were enacted into law the most recent one enacted into law hjres 43 originated in the house pursuant to the adoption of the fy2008 budget resolution sconres 21 on may 17 2007 the senate passed the measure on september 27 2007 without amendment and president bush signed it into law on september 29 pl 11091 121 stat 988 4 for further information see crs report rl31913 developing debtlimit legislation the houses gephardt rule by bill heniff jr crs5 in 14 years during this period calendar years 1988 19901991 19942002 2004 and 2006 the rule did not apply or was not used due to its suspension or repeal or budget resolution was not finally agreed to in most cases the house suspended the rule because legislation changing the statutory limit was not necessary at the time the senate has comparable procedure if the senate chooses to consider house joint resolution originated pursuant to the gephardt rule it does so under the regular legislative process the senate sometimes has considered such debtlimit measures for days and amended them in 1985 for example the senate added extensive budget enforcement procedures the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 also known as the grammrudmanhollings act to hjres 372 measure that the house had originated under the gephardt rule the budget reconciliation process the reconciliation process is an optional procedure that operates as an adjunct to the budget resolution process5 the chief purpose of the reconciliation process is to enhance congresss ability to change current law in order to bring revenue mandatory spending and debtlimit levels into conformity with the policies of the budget resolution reconciliation legislation is subject to expedited httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21519 consideration in both chambers in the senate in particular debate on reconciliation legislation is limited amendments must be germane and extraneous matter is barred while the predominant focus of reconciliation legislation has been to change revenue and spending levels four such measures also were used to adjust the debt limit the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1986 pl 99509 october 21 1986 section 8201 100 stat 1968 the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 pl 101508 november 5 1990 section 11901 104 stat 1388560 the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 august 10 1993 section
