public educational and governmental peg access channels are those cable television channels that are set aside for use by the general public by local schools colleges and universities and by elem ents of local government peg access channels are not mandated by federal law but the cable communications policy act of 1984 amended the communications ac t to explicitly allow cable franchising authorities to require cable operators to set aside channel capacity for peg use and to provide adequate facilities or financial support fo r those channels these peg provisions have been primary vehicle fo r fostering the longstanding us media policy goal of localism on cable systems several recent developments appear to be affecting the amount and placement of channel capacity set aside for peg use the amount of financial support from cable providers for those peg channels and the technical quality of the peg channels in particular in the past few years approxima tely 20 states have passed laws allowing cable systems to obtain statewide franchises there now is growing controversy about the exte nt to which as result of these laws the peg requirements that had been negotiated by local authorities are being legally or illegally abrogated the fcc recently adopted rules that may limit the amount of peg financial support that local franc hising authorities can require of cable providers att has introduced its uverse service which provides multi channel video service using internet protocol ip technology this service makes peg channels available to subscribers in fashion that some local jurisdictions and peg programmers claim is inferior and discriminatory att res ponds that it is inappropriate to require it to deploy its ip networ k inefficiently in order to meet requirements developed for tr aditional cable architecture as traditional cable providers are migrating from the analog transmission of peg programming to digital transmission in order to conserve bandwidth for new highdefinition and videoondemand services some subscribers are longer able to receive the peg programming or must obtain settop boxes to receive that programming the new statewide franchising laws and recent fcc rules also are affecting the requirements for and funding of institutional networks that many local franchising authorities historically have required cable companies

public educational and governmental peg access channels are those cable television channels that are set aside for use by the general public by local schools colleges and universities and by elem ents of local government peg access channels are not mandated by federal law but the cable communications policy act of 1984 amended the communications ac t to explicitly allow cable franchising authorities to require cable operators to set aside channel capacity for peg use and to provide adequate f acilities or financ ial support for those channels1 these peg provisions have been primary vehicle fo r fostering the longstanding us media policy goal of localism on cable systems2 the alliance for community media acm national membership organization that represents approx imately 3000 peg access centers across the nation estimates that peg channels are used by 12 million volunteers and 250000 community organizations and that cal peg programmers produce 20000 hours of new programs per week3 since many small jurisdictions do not join acm there may be as many as 5000 peg channels in the united states4 although these estimates are provided by peg advocates nd may be inflated there is question that peg channels provide very subs tantial amount of local programming in contrast there are only 354 public broadcast television stations the audiences for virtually all peg channels are quite small however relative to public broadcast television station audiences section 60210 of the communications ac t defines franchising authority to mean any governmental entity empowered by

jurisdictionspecific peg channels in single local market and the bandwidth needed to uplink and downlink all those channels likely would tax the capacity of satellite systemsfranchise5 until recently the vast majority of franchising authorities were local governmental jurisdictions many of these local authorities in both large and small jurisdictions included peg access requirements in their cable franchise agreements in the past few years however approxima tely 20 states have passed laws allowing cable systems to obtain statewide franchi ses there now is growing controversy about the extent to which as result of these laws the peg requirements that had been negotiated by local authorities are being legally or illegally abrogated requirements in franchise agreements to provide peg access channels impose two types of costs on cable systems the direct costs of providing facilities andor financial support to peg pr ogrammers and the opportun ity costs of allocating channels to noncommercia l peg entities when those channels could generate revenues if put to commercial use cable systems therefore have the incentive to minimize the amount of their system capacity allocated to peg channels and the level of outlays they must ma ke in support of peg channels cable service providers subject to th peg provisions in the communications act include traditional cable operators such as comcast and time warner as well as landline telecommunications firms that have recently ente red the multichannel video programming distribution mvpd market such as att and veriz on these telecommunications firms like traditional cable operators use the public rights of way in some states att has asserted that its video service is not cable service and should not be subject to cable franchi agreements in july 2007 however federal judge ruled in connecticut case that atts service is in fact cable service subject to cable regulation6 att is appealing that decision7 peg access channel requirements do not pply to direct broadcast satellite dbs systems although dbs providers compete with cable operators in the mvpd market dbs is satellite service not cable service does not require the use of public rights of way and is not subj ect to cable franchising requirements by federal law if sa tellite operator chooses to offer its subscribers local broadcast television station signals in local market it must provide the signals of all full power broadcast stations in that market but it need not offer peg channels which are cable channels not broadcast channels8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34649crs3 9 section 611a 47 usc 531a 10 section 611b 47 usc 531b 11 section 611c 47 usc 531c 12 section 621a4b 47 usc 541a4b 13 section 622b 47 usc 542b 14 sections

cable ch annels for public educational or governmental use allows franchising authority to establish requirements in franchise with respect to the designation or use of channel capacity for peg use but only to the extent provided in this section9 require that channel capacity be designated for peg use and toestablish rules and procedures for the use of the channel capacity so designated 10 and enforce any requirement in any fra nchise regarding the providing or use of such channel capacity such enforcement includes the authority to enforce any provisions of the franchise for services facilities or equipment proposed by the cable operator which relate to peg use of channel capacity whether or not required by the franchising authority11 section 621 entitled general franchise requirements includes the instruction that in awarding franchise the franc hising authority may require adequate assurance that the cable operator will pr ovide adequate peg access channel capacity facilities or fi nancial support12 section 622 entitled franchise fees ts cap on the franchise fee that franchising authority may charge at 5 of the cable operators gross revenues13 but explicitly states that the term franchise fee does not include 1 in the case of any franchise already in effect payments that are required to be made by the cable operator during the terms of such franchise for or in support of the use of peg access facilities or 2 in the case of any franchise grante d subsequently capital costs that are required by the franchise to be incurred by the cable operator for peg access channels14 thus franchise authorities may impose these peg costs on cable provider over and above th 5 franchise fee limit section 623b entitled establishment of basic service tier rate

has not made the determination that the cable provider faces effective compe tition must include any peg access programming required by the franchise of the cable system to be provided to subscribers15 pegrelated policy issues fcc rulings affecting peg funding in two recent orders the first released in march 2007 nd the second in november 2007 the fcc adopted rules and provided guidance that set restrictions on the process and requirements that local franchising authorities lfas can employ when considering franchise applications from potential new cable service providers such as telephone companies and incumbent cable providers16 the fcc based its actions on its authority under section 621a1 of the communications act17 which prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably refusing to award competitive franchises for the provision of cable services the stated intent of the orders was to foster the ability of competitors to gain entry into video service markets and to enhance broadband development the f cc argued that under the current rules competitors attempting to enter new markets f aced unreasonable regulatory obstacles these orders have been appealed in fe deral court by the na tional association of telecommunications officers and advisors natoa the fccs first order was upheld by the sixth united states circ uit court of appeals but natoa announced on august 11 2008 that it had filed petition for rehearing banc with the sixth circuit the fcc concluded that adequate peg access channe l capacity facilities and financial support means sa tisfactory or sufficient rather than significant support18 and gave the lfas the freedom to establish their own peg requirements provided that the noncapital costs of ch requirements are offset from the cablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34649crs5 19 ibid at 113 20 see for example dissenting statemen t of commissioner jonathan s adelstein amended to the fcc cable fran chise report and order at p 105 21 hrept 98934 at p 65operators franchise fee payments19 that is any pegrelated assessment imposed on the cable operator that is not capital cost must be subtracted from the 5 fee cap rather than imposed over and above th 5 fee subsequent to issuing the orders the fcc clarified that costs re lating to peg equipment would also be considered capital costs under the act peg advocates and the two fcc commissi oners who dissented to the orders argue however that the 1984 cable act per mits broader interpre tation of what may be required from franchisees over and above the 5 franchise fee20 they point to legislative history including the house report accompanying the cable act which states that the franchise fee does not in clude any franchise requirements for the provision of services facilities or equipment21 they claim that the reference to services suggests that cab franchisees can be required to pay for noncapital pegrelated franchise re quirements over and above 5 franchise fee since the act does not define capital co sts or service costs peg programmers and lfas claim they are left with large degree of uncertainty about what assessments they may impose on cable franc hisees over and above the franchise fee historically many franchise agreements ve required cable franchisees to pay for noncapital pegrelated costs in cluding salaries training travel expenses rent and some maintenance expenses going forwar d cable franchisees that are required to pay 5 franchise fee may be able to duct these peg costs from the franchise fees they pay lfas state franchising laws as recently as four years ago most states left cable franchising authority entirely to local jurisdictions about 10 states had some role in the franchising process but many of these just reviewed locally negotiated agreements in the past few years number of states and par ticularly those with large populations ve passed laws establishing statewide cab franchises today approx imately 20 states have such laws att and verizon led the efforts to pass these laws arguing that the need to negotiate franchise agreemen ts with hundreds of localities in state significantly slowed down their entry into the cable and broadband markets all the new state laws permit new entrants to the cable mark et such as att and verizon to bypass local authorities and apply for statewide franchise many of these laws also permit an incumbent cable operator currently under local franchise to apply for statewide franchise upon the expiration of th local agreement or in some states to get out of its local agreement even before it expireshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34649crs6 22 compilation of state cable franchise laws has been developed by telecommunity which identifies itself as the local go vernment telecommunications alliance telecommunity can be reached at http lecommunityallianceorg the discussion in this memorandum of the variation in peg re quirements among state laws is based on that compilationthere are great differences among the state laws22 some of them set specific terms conditions and maximum or minimum requirements that are applicable for all the local jurisdictions in the state served by the franchise applicant others explicitly require the franchise applicant to match the requirements imposed on the incumbent cable provider in each local juri sdiction at the time the law was enacted that is the franchise requirements vary from local jurisdiction to local jurisdiction some laws that would allow incumbent cable franchisees to apply for state franchise upon the completion of their cu rrent local franchises set statewide requirements that would apply to both in cumbent and new franchisees when the incumbents existing local franchise expires but require both to follow the existing local franchise requirements in the interim yet others allow both incumbents and new entrants to immediately obtain statewide franchises subject to statewide requirements in effect annulling some or all of the terms of the incumbent cable operators existing local franchise agreements as result the impact of these state laws on the requirements for the provi sion of peg channel capacity and peg financial and technical support varies significan tly from state to state for example the state franchising laws in texas virginia indiana california michigan florida nevada ohio illinois and wisconsin require new entrants that seek to offer service in multiple local jurisdictions in state to match the specific peg channel capacity requirements currently imposed on the incumbent cable providers by the local franchising author ities in each of those local jurisdictions while setting certain minimum levels for situations in which there is incumbent provider in contrast the state franchisi ng laws in kansas north carolina south carolina new jersey missouri iowa and georgia set statewide maximum or minimum peg channel capacity requirements that are unrelated to the requirements in the existing franchise agreements of incumbent cable providers the state franchising laws have even greater variation with respect to requirements for the state fra nchisee to provide peg fina ncial support some state laws for example texas indiana mich igan florida iowa georgia and ohio require new entrants that seek to offer service in multiple local jurisdictions in state to provide the same level of support as is currently imposed on the incumbent cable providers by the local franchising author ities in each of those local jurisdictions others for example virginia california and illinois set specific statewide minimum or maximum levels of peg support in terms of percentage of revenues yet others for example kansas sout h carolina missouri and nevada do not require the new entrants to provide any peg support new jersey does not set specific requirement but establishes commitment on the part of the applicant to provide equipment and tran sport for peg channels lfas and peg programmers have raised several concerns regarding the impact of these state laws especially where they substitute statewide requirements for localhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34649crs7 23 see for example josh goodm an unscripted ending the pi cture gets blurry for public access television governingcom february 2008 available at

discussed in later section of this reportrequirements there have b een allegations that the new laws as interpreted by new entrants and incumbent cable companies have resulted in limitations on the peg fees that localities can impose on franchisees the elimination of free access to video equipment and television studio space previously provided to peg programmers by franchisees the elimination of cable company staff that had previously been provided to operate the access channels where pe g programming is produced degradation of peg signal quality rendering it longer comparable to that of commercial channels and inferior channel placement for peg channels23 s r s u l t s m p g programmers and local governments claim that statewide requirements fail to meet the needs of their local communities they say this is of particular concern because there is wide variation among communities regarding what peg programming should be made available and how it should be delivered the alliance for community media performed an online survey of its members and the natoa members from around the c ountry in may 2008 to assess the impact of statewide laws24 there were 204 respondents the survey found that under statewide franchising 20 of the respondents reported decreases in funding for peg 17 communities in eight states reported loss of access to peg facilities 26 of the respondents reported loss of or reduction in public cable drops in schools librari and other public centers 41 of the respondents reported ss of or reduction to services to institutional networks inets th at connect peg facilities to schools and government institutions25 in some cases new video provide rs delivered peg channels with impaired signal quality and loss of functionality nearly 25 of the respondents reporte d that they lost or expect to lose peg channels some video providers were moving peg channels to digitalonly cable tiers some respondents reporte d that they are now assessed carriage fees for the delivery of their peg programming twothirds of the respondents re ported an increase in basic cable rates these survey results must be viewed with some caution first the survey was not scientifically performed peg programmers or local officials with grievances likely would have had greater incentive to par ticipate in the online survey second

statewide franchising for example the decrease in peg funding may at least in part be the result of the fccs recent interpretation of the cable acts definition of franchise fees n onetheless the results support the contention that statewide franc hising is changing the environment for peg access channels atts uverse service att has recently begun offering multichannel video programming distribution service using an allinternet protocol ip technology platform it is building out an optical fiber network to neighborhood nodes and using the existing copper connections already in place from t hose nodes to subscribers premises26 each neighborhood node serves veral hundred end user customers this is less capitalintensive alternative to the fibertothepremises network being deployed by verizon in its fios network since copper has less capacity than fiber the att network does not simultaneously broadcast the signals of multiple video channels all the way to the customer premises as cable companie s do and as verizon does with its fios network rather it employs ip technology that allows the subscriber to use the settop box to call up the particular video stream it desires from centralized place where the video stream is stored th video hub office serving the designated market area dma in which the subscriber is located or if that video stream has already been requested by neighbor served by the same neighborhood node that neighborhood node the major constraint on the att uverse network is the capacity of the copper loop currently uve rse can provide at most two highdefinition channels to household simultaneously and for many of its customers it can offer only single highdefinition channel at time to attain the level of audio and video signal compression needed to offer service att must encode the program signals using mpeg4 compression methods mpeg4 is an industry standard still under development the content that att receives from programmers is not encoded in mpeg4 and therefore must be recoded each dditional video stream which appears as channel to subscriber imposes two categories of incremental costs on att the cost of additional equipment to encode the programming and the cost of additional dedicated capacity on an att rver at national or dma hub to store the video stream for programming that is provided in continuing changing flow such as the programming of cable or broadcast channel or peg channel each additional video stream requires dedicat ed encoding equipment to recode the ongoing stream for programming that is received once and then stored such as the programming library used for videoondemand payperview channels there is need for dedicated encoding quipment encoding equipment used for one video on demand program can be reused for anothe r videoondemand programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34649crs9 27 see for example todd spangler att knocked for inferior peg channels multichannel news january 31 2008 available at http

4 2008thus the incremental equipm ent costs associated with an additional videoondemand program selection is lower than that associated with cable or broadcast network or peg channel att claims that the incremental encoding and server capacity costs associated with an ongoing video stream such as that required for cable or broadcast network or for peg channel is approximately 200000 in large metropolitan area with many local jurisdictions each of which currently has several peg channels the upfront incremental costs of offering multiple peg channels thus could be several million dollars att therefore has chosen not to make peg programming available to subscribers in the same fashion that it makes commercial programming available instead it treats peg content the same way it treats internet traffic it has created separate platform for peg with single channel channel 99 at which subscribers can find peg programming just as they ve one channel for internet access the peg content is not encoded in mpeg4 ra ther the subscriber goes to channel 99 and pulls down menu that identifies each of the local jurisdictions in the subscribers dma and after clicking on the desired jurisdiction gets menu that identifies all the peg programs for that jurisdiction for the subscriber to choose from the selected program is then downloaded to the users set top box peg advocates have identified seve ral problems with this system27 first the subscriber experiences substantial delay of several minutes duration in getting to the chosen program the program is not available in the same seamless fashion as other programming second the pe g programming is not shown on atts program guide there is way for the s ubscriber to know what programming is on peg channel without going to the channe l third the att peg platform cannot accommodate closed captioning fourth it does not provide the capability to record the programming on dvr fifth the picture quality on the att peg platform is inferior to that on atts commercial channels peg is transmitted at lower resolution and the picture may stutter when displaying rapid motion as in sports program sixth by requiring the peg pr ogrammers to deliver their signals to dmawide geographic area rather than the local jurisdiction those programmers may be liable for additional costs associ ated with the broader distribution of copyrighted materials some parties are expected to bring lawsuits against att for not meeting its peg responsibilities28 att responds that its ip network arch itecture is fundamentally different from the architectures used by the cable companies and verizon and that it is inappropriate to require it to deploy its network inefficiently in order to meet requirements conceived for traditional cable architecture it argues that it meets the peg requirements in the cable act it also claims that its provision of peg accesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34649crs10 29 this discussion is based in part on september 4 2008 telephone conversation with comcast employee offers subscribers three benefits subscribers can view the peg programming of all the local jurisdictions in their dma not just the programming of their specific community channel 99 is an easytoremember prime channel location and peg programming will be in digital format that can easily be used for the web which enables communities to more easily provide the same content over the internet the transition from analog to digital cable channels and peg channel placement cable systems can transmit as many as six standarddefinition digital signals or one highdefinition digital signal over the same amount of bandwidth as is needed to transmit single standarddefinition analog signal as result cable operators are beginning to migrate their programming from analog signal transmission to digital signal transmission in order to free up bandwidth for highdefinition and videoondemand services in order to receive programming trans mitted digitally subscribers must have either digital television set rather than an analog set or settop box capable of converting digital signals to analog signals separate sett op box is required for each analog television set over time more and more households will purchase digital television sets motivated by the desi re to receive the s uperior quality digital and especially highdefinition signals nd in some cases by cable providers placing the most popular programming only on digital service tier recognizing the desirability of digital signals cable operators charge more for digital service tier than for an analog service tier especially if they have placed some of the most popular programming only on the digital tier today many households already subscribe to digital service or have settop box capable of converting digital signal s to analog but many other households continue to receive analog cable service without the need for settop box or do not have settop box for each television set for the latter the transition to digital cable transmission will require them to replace thei r analog sets with digital sets or to obtain settop boxes in some cases the transition from analog to digital cable service will be affected by the terms of the existing local franchise agreements29 most agreements require the cable provider to continue to make basic analog cable service primarily the retransmitted local broadcast station signals and the peg channels available to its subscribers even if those signals have been digitized the cable provider cannot require its subscribers to purchase digital service tier in order to receive those broadcast and peg channels nd must make settop boxes available if those channels have been digitized it is less likely that an existing local franchise agreement has an analogous requirement that nonbasic cable channels be made available on an analog service tier and thus it is possible to the extent the market would allow for cable provider to make those nonbasic channels available only as part of digital service tier thus in most localities if cable provider were to digitize its peghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34649crs11

leasing fees woul d apply those fees would apply immediately for additional settop boxes30 this move was characterized by comcast as part of its overall transition from analog service to digital

its florida cable systems to digital and charter communications announced that it would dig itize its peg channels in wisconsin and in reno nevada and move them to channels in the 200 or 900series31

location or converting them to digital without the courts permission she found that the local jurisdictions were likely to prevail on number of th eir arguments for example the 2006 michigan law sets requirements on th placement of public access channels but the 1992 federal cable law re quires cable operators to provide public access channels to basic service subscribers without disc rimination the judge found that requiring analog cable customers to obtain separate device the settop box in order to view peg channels that are part of their basi c service subscription could be viewed as unreasonable discriminati on she also found that comcast did not provide subscribers proper notice of the channel change at the same time judge roberts dismissed some of the other arguments raised by the local jurisdiction and indicated the decision to grant the injunction was close call35 some critics of the comcast plan also claim that it fails to address the needs of schools that use peg programming for edu cational purposes ma ny schools have television in each classroom and those sc hools would have had to rent converter box for each classroom comcasts action in michigan prompt ed

to digital36 b u t s v r l representatives including committee chairm an john dingell voiced concerns that the quality and ava ilability of peg channels not be negatively affected by cables transition from analog to digital service it is possible that the transition of peg channels to digital will have less impact on households once the nationwide transition to digital television occurs in 2009 and

900s that are not near other channels what peg advocates have come to call channel slamming highlights the concerns that many peg advocates have that peg programming is being discriminated against relative to commercial programming the cable operators respond however that peg channels tend to have very low viewership and therefore should not command prime channel

institutional networks inets an institutional network is communications system capable of transmitting video voice andor data signals over op tical fiber coaxial cable or both among governmental educational and possibly other nonresidential users37 many local governments have required cab operators to construct and maintain or in some fashion provide support for an instituti onal network as condition for the initial grant transfer or renewal of cab franchise section 611b of the communications act38 allows franchising authority to require cable franchisee to set aside channel capacity on an institutional network constructed or operated by the cable operator for educati onal or governmental use in the past when cable systems typically were designed only to transmit television programming one way from cable operators to residential users cable operators generally dedicated limited number of channels to governmental and educational use or constructed standalone cable systems for that purpose today cable systems routinely are being constructe d as hybrid fibercoaxial cable networks with sufficient capacity and twoway capab ilities to accommodate inet requirements in single integrated system in some recent franchise agreements local governments have obtained number of dar k optical fibers in additi on to or in lieu of channel capacity and are furnishing the enduser electronic equipment necessary to light the fibers themselves providing vast amounts of broadband capacity at low cost these new generation inets can suppor t broad range of uses including highspeed

tend not to require new entrants to provide inets in their areas of operation if the incumbent cable company has already provided these facilities and there is identified need to construct redundant networks some of these laws also would reduce or eliminate the inet requirements in existing local franchise agreements or require the jurisdiction to pay the incremental cable network costs asso ciated with providing the inet cable providers inet requi rements may also have been clouded by the recent fcc orders which created ambiguity about what cons titutes capital costs and therefore what can be charged ove r and above the 5 franchise fee
