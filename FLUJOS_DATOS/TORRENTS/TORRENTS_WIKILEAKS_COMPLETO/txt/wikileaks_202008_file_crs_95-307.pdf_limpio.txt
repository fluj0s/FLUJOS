addresses the accelerating pace of scientific discoveries that are occurring in more competitive international environment the strategic plan lists several investment priorities that are targeted for increased emphasis or funding over the next five years the investments include furthering us economic competitiveness promoting transformational multidisciplinary research improving k12 teaching and learning in science and mathematics developing comprehensive integrated cyberinfrastructure and strengthening the nations collaborative advantage through unique networks and innovative partnerships there has been considerable debate in the academic and scientific community and in congress about the management and oversight of major projects selected for construction and the need for prioritization of potential projects funded in the mrefc account one continuing question has focused on the process for including major projects in the upcoming budget cycle in management report on major projects nsf contends that because of the changing nature of science and technology it is necessary to have the flexibility of reconsidering facilities at the various stages of development 7 in addition nsf asserts that it must be able to respond effectively to possible changes in interagency participation international and cooperative agreements or cofunding for major facilities nsf maintains that while some concepts may evolve into major research projects others may prove infeasible for project support in february 2008 nsf released its third annual facility plan 8 the 2008 facility plan covers readiness stage projects through those projects that are in the process of completion the facility plan describes nsfs goals and strategies for incorporating the existing approaches and practices into system for selecting managing and overseeing large facility projects to make certain that large facility is both constructed properly and is the appropriate facility to build all projects seeking funding in the mrefc move through progressive sequence of increasingly detailed development and assessment steps in order to be considered for construction support several pieces of competitiveness legislation have been introduced in the 110th congress to strengthen science and mathematics education there are concerns about the nations continued ability to compete in
