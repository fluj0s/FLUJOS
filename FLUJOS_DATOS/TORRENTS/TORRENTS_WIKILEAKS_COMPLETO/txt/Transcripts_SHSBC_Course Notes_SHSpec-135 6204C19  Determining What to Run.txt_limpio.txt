6204c19 shspec135 determining what to run details about currently used processes especially prepchecking and 3dxx the rock is the first thing the pc had been ta drifts during session dont count as ta motion eg on problems intensive that you are doing to see whether the ta moves with new pc if the ta is generally between 475 and 50 that is not ta motion to speak of motion is what happens in twenty minutes and it is up and down the way to get ta when the pc doesnt have much is optimally to alternate cchs and prepchecking good cchs and good prepchecking will be real winner but even indifferent cchs and prepchecking will be winner they should be done in different sessions person who cant asis things because he is being it all wont asis much on either cchs or prepchecking but there will be small effect note that the ta he gets while talking to you isnt adjudicative it is the ta he gets while thinking that counts if he doesnt get adequate ta during subjective processes you will know that it will be difficult to get and keep ruds in on him so he needs cchs and prepchecks to keep his ruds in if cchs turn into wrestling match the auditor has missed withhold finish up the session next session prepcheck with the zero question has withhold been missed clean it up if you can do it in not more than three sessions if it is that sticky he is having trouble asising but he will have gotten some missed withholds off so cchs can operate again when they are fairly flat go back to prepchecking etc if in doubt when to switch over go by the auditors code 13 auditors code of 1954 always continue process as long as it produces change and longer see the creation of human ability p 3 and run the process to nochange or switch over when you have gotten gain on cchs or on the prepcheck whichever you are doing the goal you have is to get the rudiments in because then you will get ta the pc has outruds in life continually if you could get rid of all the bad feelings he has about his environment and people you would have done more than any earlier therapy he would also be able to be in session with pc who is getting ta you will bring up his external ruds with cchs and his internal think ruds with prepchecking the combination of the two acts as an introvertextrovert action havingness goes down on think processes and is remedied on cchs you should realize that the longer it takes you to get an item an overt or whatever the longer it takes to accomplish something with auditing the harder it gets because length drifts in the direction of noauditing an item per month is far less auditing than an item per week the longer it takes the more ruds go out and the more violently they go out the less chance you have of getting the item ruds are the most out on the least auditing they can go further out in auditing than they ever do in life this gives another reason for auditing in the direction of wins for the pc pcs at first set very largeeffect session goals despite the fact that they can have only very minor effects the win has to be real to the pc for him to know that he has had one so it has to be consistent with where he is on the effect scale if you keep giving him effects you know he can have he will come up by little gradients the worse off he is the longer it will take to get win alternating cchs and prepchecking gives good chance for him to start getting wins he will then start getting ta as he gets confident in his auditor and feels safer in the session environment he will start looking around as he realizes that he doesnt have to be all the things he is being in order to survive he can look at one of them out of eight million things he is being you will then get some ta prepchecking had the virtue as training process of giving pcs wins at the same time as it was giving the auditor lots of familiarity with the emeter if the pc fell apart on 3dxx if he got all messed up and outruds he could be put back on cchs and prepchecking routine
