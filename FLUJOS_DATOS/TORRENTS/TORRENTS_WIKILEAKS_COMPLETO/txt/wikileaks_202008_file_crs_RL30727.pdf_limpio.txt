intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr the ability to gather accurate and timel information on enemy forces is an essential enabler of modern military operations joint vision 2010 the pentagons conceptual templateto achieve new levels of effectiveness in joint warfighting specifically highlights the importance of achieving information dominance we must have information superiority the capability to collect process and disseminate an uninterrupted flow of information while exploiting or denying an adversarys ability to do the same1 the growing use of precision guided munitions pgms which can destroy specific targets without extensive collateral damage depends upon the availability of precise information as the department of defense dod transforms itself into the force envisioned in joint vision 2010 and organizes its components consistent with network centricwarfighting concepts the importance of accurate and timely information will grow there is consensus among defense policy makers that single platform or technology can satisfy dods need for information at all times in all scenarios the united states currently employs variety of satelli tes that collect information on enemy forces these systems are valuable and their effectiveness and role in intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr is projected to grow however airborne isr platforms can be more rapidly and flexibly deployed than current satellites and an aircrafts unpredictable deployment and flight pattern makes it difficult for adversaries to effectively conceal themselves from observation thus airborne platforms will likely continue to satisfy great deal of dods isr requirements over the next several decades both congress and dod face important decisions regarding current and future us isr capabilities an overarching question is over the next 20 to 30 years what mix of existing and planned manned and unmanned isr aircraft most effectively satisfies dod s requirement for timely and accurate information on enemy forces the information they collect will be integrated or fused with informat ion from satellites groundbased signals intelligence sigint intercept sites

praises u2s operation allied force performance inside the air force october 1 1999 p 3and other sources the particular mix of platforms will depend upon which sensors they can utilize geopolitical conditions and the nature of planned operations many observers believe that ultimately unmanned aerial vehicles uavs will replace manned aircraft for collecting imagery radar data and signals intelligence for operational commanders it is not however clear that manned airborne reconnaissance is completely obsolete some observers believe that pilot can react faster than distant uav operator to unexpected targets of opportunity and take evasive actions that might not otherwise be possible also pilots may be less susceptible than remote uav operators to some information warfare techniques there remain variety of manned reconnaissance aircraft in the inventories of the air force and the other services and some attack aircraft can be equipped with reconnaissance pods containing sensors of various types to enable them to serve on reconnaissance missions the us isr inventory is comprised of variety of manned and unmanned aircra ft which have various strengths and weaknesses see table 1 below presently the u2 dragon lady forms the backbone of this fleet2 although based on design developed in the 1950s u2s have performed admirably in recent operations they provided 50 of all imagery during operation desert storm and 90 of ground forces targeting information during operation allied force the u2 provided more than 80 of the imagery needed for air strikes3 there is however only limited inventory of u2s they are heavily used and the plane is expected to be retired from the air force inventory at some point during the next two decades global hawk uavs are often suggested as replacement for u2s and are portrayed as the main airborne reconnaissance platform of the future the first test version of these planes has been undergoing test and evaluatio n and there is an apparent consensus that it should be acquired for the operating forces the global hawk can operate at altitudes of 65000 feet and for periods in excess of 30 hours although having the important advantage of not putting pilots at risk global hawks do not now match all the capabilities of u2 global hawk is currently in the operational inventory furthermore current acquisition plans do not call for sufficient numbers of global hawks to replace the hoursonstation that can be maintained by existing u2s thus if air force isr capabilities are to be maintained and some believe they need to be expanded if current operations tempos are to be maintained in the future number of serious acquisition and budgetary issues need to be addressed what are the current and anticipated requirements for airborne surveillance platforms httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30727crs3 4 the e3 awacs and e2c hawkeye also perform surveillance functions in the airtoair regime can global hawks be designed to have the capabilities now possessed by the u2 or should multiple uavs be acquired to replace single u2 if larger or accelerated global hawk acquisition effort is approved where will funding be identified should u2s or other manned aircraft be maintained in the air force inventory even as global hawks become operational are additional u2s needed regardless of the introduction of the global hawk what would be the implications for isr if u2s were to be decommissione d at faster rate than planned to free up funds for additional or accelerated global hawk acquisition these questions and others will be discussed in the context of the fy2002 defense budget which the next administration will forward to congress early in 2001 although significant budgetary issues are involved there are also

optical bar camera electrooptic systems include the intelligence reconnaissance imagery system iii and the senior year electrooptical reconnaissance system syers which also collects information in the infra red ir wavelength these systems vary in resolution and aperture but when combined can capture images of territory on the order of 33 x 21 nautical miles9 the advanced synthetic aperture radar

km the senior span pod which is attached to the top of the fuselage allows the u2 to transmit sigint data via satellit to global ranges11 the senior spur pod performs the same function for asars data12 the u2 is notoriously difficult to fly pilots called the u2 dragon lady because of its unforgiving handling characteristics at altitude13 landing the u2 is complex ballet that often entails intentionally stalling the aircraft employing runway chase carsand oftentimes delibe rately dragging the planes wingtip down the runway major challenge for the air force is maintaining an adequate supply of u2 pilots u2 pilots face physical rigors that are unique in the aviation world flying at extreme altitudes pilots must wear pressure suits similar to those worn by astronauts the pilots have to engage in special training and preflight preparations eg special diets and inhaling 100 oxygen 1 hour prior to takeoff to help ward off the profuse sweating fatigue and dizziness caused by 10 hour

concluded that it is difficult to find pilots with the aptitude required to master the difficult handling characteristics of the u214 the air force has however taken steps to reduce the average temporary additional duty tad rates of u2 pilots to bring them into line with other pilots improved u2 pilot morale may have been influenced by the aircraft winning the collier trophy in 1998 awarded by the national aeronautic association for the greatest achievement in aeronautics or astronautics in america15 u2s in postcold war combat operations the u2 was originally designed to fly over the soviet union to acquire information about strategic targets such as airfields and missile bases information acquired from the u2 was of importance to the us intelligence communitys ability to provide adequate assessments of soviet strategic forces but the utility of the platform for this purpose was virtual ly destroyed by the diplomatic embarrassment following the shoot down of u2 in may 1960 and the public trial of its pilot francis gary powers beginning in the 1960s this mission was taken over by surveillance satellites that presented danger of captured pilots u2s were not especially valuable in vietnam where photography of triplecanopy jungle often provided little useful intelligence on troop movements along the ho chi minh trail underneath it was not until desert storm in 1991 that u2s demonstrated their value as the platform that could provide the nearrealtime intelligence that allows military commanders to place bombs on the exact targets intended the greater use of the u 2 derived from improvements in surveillance and communications technologies as well as the much greater availability of precision guided munitions that benefit from u2 derived data desert storm saw the largest u2 operation in history with nine aircraft and thirty pilots flying some five sorties day primary missions were iraqi army field positions bomb damage assessment bda and searching for scud missile launching sites photography and other data collected from u2s was for the first time rapidly available to tactical commanders inevitably there were arguments about collection priorities and especially demands by operational commanders for larger volumes of photographic coverage especially widearea coverage even though some intelligence officials believed that electrooptic and radar collection was better use of assets there were difficulties with developing photography intheater and with disseminating hard copies nonetheless according to one estimate u2s provided 30 of total intelligence 50 of imagery intelligence and 90 of all army targeting intelligence for the entire theater16 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30727crs7 16 continued afb ca 9th reconnaissance wing 1996 17 at

20 operations in kosovo p 56military operations over the former yugoslavia in the mid1990s saw continued reliance on the u2 by military commanders balkan missions were initially related to gathering information on treaty verification troop dispositions and missile sites during the nato attack on serbian forces in the spring of 1999 known as operation allied force u2s were used to identify serbian targets and to conduct bda to determine the accuracy of allied strikes data collected by an airborne u2 was transmitted back to beale air force base in california for analysis17 and then sent back to operations centers and thence to aircraft which could attack the target admiral daniel murphy commander of the us sixth fleet during allied force recalled having satellite positioning data on key serbian early warning radars but that was insufficient for targeting tomahawk missile which was the weapon that we intended to employ so i walked into the intelligence center and sitting there was 22yearold intelligence specialist who was talking to beale air force base via secure telephone and beale air force base was driving u2 over the top of this spot the u2 snapped the picture fed it back to beale air force base where that young sergeant to my young petty officer said we have got it we have confirmation i called admiral ellis commander allied forces southern europe he called general clark sup reme allied commander europe and about 15 minutes later we had three tomahawk missiles route and we destroyed those three radars18 another senior air force general wrote after the kosovo campaign we never dropped bomb on target without having u2 take look at it19 to meet requirements for allied force u2 pilots and support personnel were transferred from other theaters as one senior air force commander noted u2s were stretched to the limit during allied force20 observers suggest that if the air force were required to conduct operations on scale larger than allied force limits on u2 availability would have to be faced and could constrain the effectiveness of precision bombing campaigns in addition to missions in the balkans u2s continue to fly collection missions over iraq and the korean peninsula in those regions they supplement collection by satellite and other systems and are intended to provide early warning of attacks their chief defense is their ability to operate at

mces could theoretically be based anywhere it takes two c17 globemaster aircraft to deploy the two ground elements the global hawk as evidenced by recent flight from the united states to portugal can self deploy as currently designed the global hawk can carry electrooptical ir and synthetic aperture radar sensors it is not designed to carry sigint sensors while the global hawks eo and ir capabilities are onpar with the u2s its sar capabilities are not due to greater power and larger antenna the u2 can more effectively use its sar to detect moving targets than can the global hawk if used to find static targets however the u2 and global hawk sar capabilities are more comparable dods current plan is to manufacture twelve global hawk air vehicles between fy2003 and fy2009 these uavs would carry the eoirsar sensor payload and are described by the air force as complement to the u2 in fy2009 the air force wants to produce four of the next generation global hawks which could carry sigint sensors instead of either the eoir or the sar payload the air force describes the capabilities of this next generation as being on par with the u2 and asserts that they could replace the u226 summary platform comparisons review of table 2 below highlights the key similarities and differences between the u2 and global hawk on onetoone basis comparison of thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30727crs10 characteristics is important for policy makers to consider when making decisions on the overall size and composition of the us airborne isr force structure there are significant similarities the platforms are of similar physical dimension they fly at approximately the same altitude and at similar speeds yet there are important differences between the platforms that stand out when comparing the u2 and global hawk on platformtoplatform basis these differences include 1 pilot requirements 2 range and endurance and 3 mission payload the first difference between the platforms is the global hawks lack of pilot while not putting pilot in danger appears obviously beneficial there are number of associated issues that merit discussion one potential downside to being pilotless is that the platform is not as responsive to changing circumstances as piloted aircraft remotely located mission control personnel cannot in theory make decisions and take action as quickly as pilot on the scene however during mission u2 pilots infrequently take action based on what they personally observe from the cockpit rather they typically make adjustments to their preplanned mission profile based on warnings and orders from mission control elements thus unmanned aircraft may not suffer from lack of responsiveness in the high altitude isr mission as they would if performing other missions the lack of pilot may be more of hindrance when flying through civil controlled us and foreigncountry airspace than it is when overflying combat area civil authorities are concerned that in the event of an unforeseen emergency such as an engine burnout or malfunction pilotless aircraft would be less able to take corrective action such as making controlled landing at local airfield instead they fear that pilotless aircraft would be more likely to crash into inhabited areas therefore civil authorities currently impose very demanding mission planning requirements on unmanned systems if they allow them to overfly at all this exhaustive mission planning takes time manpower and money finally the global hawks lack of pilot doesnt necessarily confer increased operational utility the global hawks size flight profile and lack of stealth features suggest it is approximately as survivable as the u2 it will likely be employed as the u2 is outside of high threat environments such as longrange sams at approximately 50 million each the global hawk is too expensive to be considered expendable the second difference between the global hawk and u2 that bears discussion is that of range and endurance the global hawk has superior range and endurance to the u2 global hawk can fly approximately twice as far as the u2 and its loiter time is three times that of the u2 this suggests important ramifications for the number of platforms required in the overall isr inventory all other things being equal fewer platforms with long endurance can do the same job as more platforms with less endurance the third noteworthy difference between the platforms is payload the u2 enjoys an advantage in payload over the global hawk of more than twoto one this allows it to carry more and different payloads larger payload capability also provides more potential for unforseen upgrades and tradeoffs generically speaking larger volume on an aircraft presents engineers with more choices and opportunities than smaller volume additionally the u2s large engine provides more electricalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30727crs11 27 the usaf refurbished 35

intelligence capabilities is universally acknowledged within dod u2s and uavs are both in high demand and the inventories density of both types of platforms are low although according to some observers the clinton administration may have been somewhat more inclined to deploy forces in peacekeeping missions than either of its likely successors most analysts believe that us military forces will not escape the types of missions in disparate countries that will require precise intelligence of potential targets these missions are as likely to occur in the next few years as they are in 2010 or 2020 dods current plans aim to provide todays and future warfighting cincs with adequate isr planning envisions the continued upgrading of the u2 possibly augmenting it and eventually replacing it with the global hawk uav isr for the foreseeable future will inevitably be limited by availability of airborne platforms at present there are only some 35 u2s the number of pilots and ground crew is

ability to penetrate foliage and camouflage was expressly supported in congressional language the jsaf would provide an upgraded information collection capability for the u2s yet the administrations request was insufficient to procure an entire jsaf suite and required spares and cabling therefore appropriations and authorizations conferees recommended an increase to the defense airborne

and zeroed out the request30 the house armed services and senate appropriations committees matched the administrations request for rdte funding expressing interest in the potential of global hawk to support counterdrug activities the senate armed services committee increased the rdte request by 18 million so global hawk engineers could explore the integration and use of an aesa advanced electronically steered array radar31 the senate appropriations committee and appropriations conferees also supported an 18 million increase but the house did not authorization conferees adopted the aesa provision language but did not increase funding accordingly intelligence budget fy 2001 some information on actions taken by the congress on intelligence programs associated with the u2 and the global hawk is available from committee reports on intelligence authorization bills the published reports are however accompanied by classified annexes that provide greater detail and have legal authority the reports also provide sense of congressional opinion in may 2000 the house intelligence committee concluded in the area of intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr assets we continue to see extensive overutilization of very limited but critical airborne assets with little relief in sight while planning for deployment of new isr airborne capabilities into the theaters the department of defense has taken money from existing supposedly complementary platforms to pay for future capabilities the result our overall isr capabili ties and resources are decreasing at time when our military forces are relying on them more and more32 the house committee approved the administrations total request of 3731 for operations and maintenanc of the u2 and rc135 while designating them as congressional interest items it also recommended increased funding for various u2 modifications including 3 million for initial deployment spares for the syers upgrade and 8 million for jsaf as well as the conversion of one u2 into trainer taken together the house intelligence committee recommended 1326 million an increase of 342 million for u2 modifications the senate intelligence

u2 or the global hawk nor were these actions reflected in the intelligence authorization conference report33 it is likely however that house intelligence committee actions were consistent with those taken by the house armed services committee the budgeting and funding of airborne reconnaissance programs are complicated by overlapping roles of intelligence agencies and congressional intelligence oversight committees on one hand and on the other by the military departments in this case the air force and their congressional overseers in the armed services and appropriations committees there is coordination between intelligence and defense programs both within the executive branch and among congressional committees but some observers believe that the isr platforms inevitably come out second best in competition with bombers and fighter aircraft in may 2000 the house intelligence committ ee stated that it is concerned that funding from many intelligence community programs including intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr aircraft are regularly transferred from the programs for which funds were authorized and appropriated to fund shortfalls in other programs often not related to isr requirements34 in this as in other areas current pressures on defense spending inevitably complicate efforts to provide adequate resources for u2s global hawk uavs and other isr programs there are also longstanding concerns that the relationships between spacebased and airborne surveillance platforms and between national and tactical systems are not always well balanced some observers question the extent to which systems have been designed to maximize the usefulness of systems to both national and tactical consumers suggesting that bureaucratic obstacles more than technological limitations may inhibit use by multiple consumers issues and options the air force persuaded that global hawk will meet many if not all its airborne surveillance requirements is inclined to accel erate the acquisition effort beyond the twelve global hawks planned for fy03fy09 to supply the 960 million required in additional funding secretary of the air force whitten peters has said that he is considering reductions in the u2 program beginning in fy2006 and retirement of all u2s by fy201135 this will inevitably be controversial decision the u2 is one of the most heavily deployed aircraft in the air forces inventory widely acclaimed by the cincs and the beneficiary of series of expensive upgrades in recent years that have elongated its service life congressional interest item

the air force september 29 2000 p 6formal decision to retire the u2 early to free up funds for additional uavs will likely be given close scrutiny by congress and the public advocates of the proposal note that global hawks have performed well in tests they argue that the global hawks long endurance gives it the ability to perform the u2s imagery collection missions with fewer platforms furthermore future upgrades and reconfigurations will give global hawk the u2s sigint collection capability to lay the groundwork for future airborne surveillance capabilities it is reasonable according to this view to retire the u2s beginning in 2006 rather than gradually phasing them out by attrition and make instead the investment in the next generation of airborne reconnaissance platforms air force options on global hawks and u2s appear to be based on the assumption that funding must be adjusted within overall limits on spending for isr programs apparently an early termination of the u2 effort is the most acceptable way for the air force to identify funding for tradeoff to fund accelerated acquisition of the global hawk within its budgetary constraints some observers suggest that air force officials may anticipate that at some point funding might be identified elsewhere within the defense budget or that congress might provide funding specifically for additional global hawks one report noted some service sources say it is unlikely the air force will be able to come up with the money without significant help from osd office of the secretary of defense or congress36 opponents of the proposal believe that the two systems should operate simultaneously they argue that considering the very high demand for todays innumerous airborne isr assets it is essential that the air force increase todays isr capabilities not just replace them on onetoone basis opponents of secretary peterss proposal also argue that the u2 should not be phased out until the global hawk is produced and employed in large numbers and its operational capabilities and limitations are well understood this they say would ensure smooth transition from todays isr fleet to tomorrows and would ensure that the replacement of u2s does not result in loss of an essential capability opponents also argue that decommissioning all u2s which as result of extensive investment in upgrades have an expected service life of up to 50 more years would be wasteful of an important capability they note that whereas fewer uavs than u2s might be needed for the same mission if they were identically equipped the actual number of global hawks require d might vary since they cannot at least at present carry the same set of collection systems as the u2 furthermore they contend it is unclear when air force scientists will be able to overcome the technological impediments that currently limit the global hawks payload there may be other options that could be pursued to maintain or improve dods aerial isr capability until the global hawk is optimally configured and produced in sufficient quantities to replace the u2 these options include 1 increasing the number of operational u2s 2 more effectively managing the existing u2 inventoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30727crs17 37 each aircraft flies an 8 hour mission to maintain three u2s in theater for an extended period of time the air force needs to rotate five aircraft through the mission at any one time three u2s will be in theater fourth is deploying to theater and the fifth is returning home 38 us congress 106th congress 2d session house of representatives conference report making appropriations for the department of defense for the fiscal year ending september 30 2001 and for other purposes july 17 2000 h rept 106754 p1993 attracting and retaining more u2 pilots or 4 returning the sr71 aircraft to active service there are currently 31 operational u2s with another four used as trainers at any one time three of the 31 operational u2s are in depot for maintenance since it takes five u2s to maintain 24 hour orbit37 these 28 u2s can theoretically operate in five to six different spots on the globe at the same time given the limited inventory of u2s key concern is the foreseeable loss of aircraft through accidents and attrition in recent years one u2 has been lost through attrition every two years if this rate persists by 2008 the air force would only have enough u2s to provide 24 hour coverage of four to five different spots at any one time some urge the procurement of additional u2s by reopening the production line this idea has received some congressional attention38 some observers believe that this may be costeffective way to make additional platforms available in relatively short period of time the technology is wellproven under operational conditions and acquiring new platforms woul d not require long leadtimes for research and development and costs would be relatively manageable others argue that such step would be counterproductive in that the air force would have fleet of u2s of varying ages which would present maintenance problems at some point furthermore they suggest that the u2 is representative of decadesold technology and is difficult to fly also the u2 production line has lain fallow for approximately 20 years is reopening this line feasible if so at what cost another key consideration is manning the u2 requires specially trained pilots whose employability in other air force positions becomes limited most importantly it places pilots at risk of death or capture proponents of reopening the u2 line counter however that it should be possible to manufacture future u2s that dont require pilot the additional costs of redesigning the u2 to fly without pilot are unclear but advances and technologies developed under the global hawk and other uav programs could probably be exploited another important action that could be taken to relieve the high operational tempo felt by the u2 force would be to attract more pilots to the program and better retain the ones already qualified to fly the dragon lady u2 proponents suggest that congress may wish to enquire about steps the air force has or has not undertaken to attract more pilots into the u2 program what for example would be the impact on overall recruitment and retention if the air force were to dictate that greater percentage of its pilots enter the u2 program options may also exist to more effectively manage dods current u2 inventory for instance only four u2 training aircraft exist this lack of trainers could slow thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30727crs18 pace of preparing new u2 pilots for their missions it is feasible that twoseat training aircraft could be used to fly operational missi ons if required though with diminished capabil ities however the 31 singleseat aircraft used to fly operations cant be used to train new pilots therefore the reduction in isr capability caused by converting handful of singleseat u2s to twoseat trainers may be outweighed by the improvement in training capabilities another inventory management issue that might be examined is the u2s foreign basing arrangements in addition to bases in the united states u2s currently operate from five air bases located in france cyprus spain south korea and saudi arabia the air force is currently withdrawing the u2 from the french and cypriot locations fewer forward bases may mean that u2s could spend greater percentage of their 10 hour missions transiting to and from the theater to be observed and less time collecting intelligence additional u2s would be required to overfly the theater to maintain the same amount of coverage base consolidation has been justified by the dissolution of the soviet union yet there has also been proliferation of smaller scale contingencies in which the united states has an interest this raises questions about the efficacy of reducing the u2s operational basing by two fifths at time of high operational tempo some observers have suggested that examining the utility of opening additional u2 bases in different theaters may be in order another inventory management issue pertains to the expeditionary air force concept to increase deployment predictability and more evenly distribute the deployment burden the air force is dividing its people and forces into 10 air expeditionary forces aefs these aefs are loose amalgams of resources that will rotate through set training and deployment cycles currently the air force does not have similar strategy for its high demand low density hdld assets such as the u2 instead u2s are sent to given theater as demand rises some within dod have suggested that the u2 and other isr assets could be included in the current aef concept and thus increase u2 deployment predictability this idea may help distribute the deployment burden throughout the u2 force but may not reduce the deployment tempo due to low numbers of operational platforms another suggested option is to devise an aeflike inventory management scheme specifically for the u 2 different variants of the global hawk may have to be develop ed and other uavs or manned aircraft may be acquired the global hawk is not the only uav potentially available but it has been designed to meet certain dod requirements for range and endurance configuring smaller uavs such as the predator to accomplish at least some of global hawks mission capabilities might be feasible but would entail considerable delays and could come at the cost of other operational capabilities yet this idea may merit further investigation final option that may bear investigation is to unretire handful of sr71 black bird aircraft proponents of this approach point out that the sr71 was very capable isr asset its very high speed contributed to the sr71s survivability and increased the potential volume of territory that could be surveilled also several sr 71 airframes still exist they have been preserved at the air force facility in palmdale california also sr71 aircraft have been unretired in the past opponents of this idea point out that the sr71 was very expensive aircraft to flyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30727crs19 and maint ain and that flying just handful would not be cost effective also the airframes may exist but what about pilots are there any pilots qualified to fly the aircraft are there any pilots qualified to teach and train pilots opponents of this idea argue that unretiring the sr71 would be too expensive measure to simply bridge the gap between the u2 and global hawk conclusion it is likely that congress will play key role in dealing with the futures of the global hawk and the u2 direct congressional interest in uavs is longstanding and funding and policy direction for the global hawk has been reflected in series of appropriations and authorization acts similarly congress has also monitored the u2 program closely in recent years identifying funding for upgrades to the aircraft and for additional surveillance and communications equipment plans for the early retirement of the u2 force will undoubtedly be viewed with care and there will be interest in the progress of global hawk acquisition and its integration into the operating forces httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30727crs20 appendix 1 abbreviations and acronyms
