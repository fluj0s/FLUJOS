objectives this lesson will provide an overview of the conduc t of logistics in united nations mission area it will provide some of the major pr inciples and concepts that govern logistics support such as the lead nation concept and discuss the impact of the new reforms for reimbursement and the contribution agreement gene ral roles and responsibilities will also be covered by the end of lesson 1 the student should be able to meet the following objectives understand the different types of missions describe logistics support concepts and their pplication describe logistics command and control and the d ivision of responsibilities between the secretariat and the mission headquarters and understand the financial arrangements and budget ary system used to finance peacekeeping missions the student should note that the main reference for this course is the united nations operational support manual osm first published i n 1995 the osm is currently under review and may vary from some of the topics and des criptions contained in this course the department of peacekeeping operations office of ssion support should be contacted for any clarifications lesson 1 an overview of united nations operationa l logistics 3 11 introduction the last decade of this century has seen larger and more comple x peacekeeping missions than in the previous five decades of the organizations exi stence new procedures and terminology have been introduced to meet the challenges encountered i n peacekeeping operations in his 1992 agenda for peace secretarygeneral boutros boutrosgali described the increasing size scope and complexity of missions and defin ed the three types of missions collectively referred to as peacekeeping as preventi ve diplomacy peacekeeping and peace making in the 1995 supplement to the agenda for peace additional terms such as peace building peace enforcement peace enhancement and disarmament were introduced further broadening the scope of missions now undertaken in whole or in part by the though none of these terms are found in the charter they have com to be grouped as chapter vi and chapter vii interventions these chapters defi ne the measures to be taken by the security council and member states to resolve international disputes generally chapter vi missions involved peaceful dispute resolutions between the parties t hese types of mission tend to be both sanctioned and sponsored chapter vii missions on the other nd involve the use of force to maintain international peace and security typically these missions are only sanctioned by the with the bulk of the support and finances coming fr om the troop contributors or other member states it is important to bear in mind the type of mission when planning nd conducting peacekeeping operations this is particularly important for dete rmining logistics support as the type of mission may define where support to the force will origina and who has the responsibility for sustainment of the force operations are compli cated by number of peculiar characteristics that fundamentally impact upon the provision of operat ional support political complexity and dynamic nature of each operational scenario geographic topographic and climatic variations of theatres of operations number of individual nations involved in each operation variations in national standards in training equipment operational proc edures and operational support and language and communications differences 12 logistics support concepts missions can vary in size from small group of observers who may be civilians police military or mixture to combined operation of land sea and air forces i nvolving tens of thousands of personnel consequently various logistic concepts will need to be considered to fulfill missions logistic requirements any concept will ve to be tailored for specific mission taking into account the operational task space and time manpowe r materiel environment climate infrastructure and resources available it may include elements that are mobile or static civilian or military with intheatre warehous ing or national resupply lines or in most cases combination of all elements there are however number of concepts that have proven their worth in past operations lesson 1 an overview of united nations operationa l logistics 4 self reliance concept in some smaller missions reliance on the local economy may be the best method of support there may be requirement for small reception team at point of entry to maintain logistic links with contributing member states and the while specialist repair of vehicles communication or technical equipment may be ac hieved outoftheatre self sufficiency is highly effective in many areas of the world whe re relatively modern civilian infrastructure is available technical staff may also effect repai rs lead member state concept medium sized missions may be centered around one principal member states contingent in such cases that member state may assume responsibility for all logistic support and would usually maintain resupply links to its home base other elements of the force would rely on the principal member state f or their administrative and logistic needs bilateral or negotiated agreements may be required between the different elements of the mission to ensure financial reimbursement of the services provided national representation within the lead member states logistic organiza tion will ensure that national interests are met the force logistic support group concept specialized logistic support groups can better support large missions with considerable equipment and volume of t ransactions one member state may be required to assume overall responsibility fo r the coordination of the force logistic support group flsg and to incorporate logistic units n ational support elements nses from the contributing member states into the force logis tic base implementing this concept is function of the planning process and will be coordinate d by oms and the force headquarters to coordinate it is prudent to accept that full inter operability is not likely to be achieved and that cooperative effort is likely to be required civilian contract support concept as missions stay longer in an area the opportunities to arrange logistic support from civilian contractors i ncrease assuming that civilian support is possible and cost effective the net effect is release of military personnel for other employment 13 operational support tasks the operational support responsibility of the secretariat for peacekeeping operations is to plan organize mount sustain and account for duly authorized operation s this responsibility implies performance of the individual services and integration and coordination of all types of operational support integration operational support functions at an field mission must be consider ed as common to the mission as whole and provided on uniform and equitabl basis depending on assessed priorities irrespective of whether the unit or element dispensing the function consists of military civilian staff civilian staff provided by gove rnments commercial contractor personnel or combination lesson 1 an overview of united nations operationa l logistics 5 coordination to be effective the coordination function of op erational support should draw together all those elements at the miss ion and at the headquarters which are involved in tasking or furnishing operational suppo rt to peacekeeping operations this requirement for coordination implies fully integrat ed offices at both locations the different support activities for operations are discussed in subsequent lessons sources of logistic support the normally draws logistic support for its fie ld missions from combination of five main sources infrastructure including other hqs field missions hqs and on occasion other agencies unhcr who undp etc functional logistics units or elements provided b contributing countries and operating under the auspices of the commercial sources engaged by the contributing countries via standalone national rrangements support independently provided by member states i n support of specific operations lesson 1 an overview of united nations operationa l logistics 6 14 command and control of logistics the responsibility for direct administrative and l ogistics support to peacekeeping missions operations within unhq is detailed below the department of peacekeeping operations dpko the dpko is responsible for developing policy

nation and contractors however the m ain support is provided by the director of administration doachief of administration cao military operational support units the extent of the military components involvement in operational support depends on the ffers from troop contributing countries and will depend upon each units level of selfsufficie ncy the extent of local and international contracting for materiel and services and the gene ral infrastructure within the theatre of peacekeeping operations supply units two types of supply units may be required for pa rticular mission first missionwide supply depots in cases where the size of the mission is very large in number of personnel and in geography second conventional composite supply units operating as part of national multirole logistics battalionunit res ponsible for supply transport and maintenance in all cases supply agencies should be capable or requisitioning receiving warehousing packaging issuing and disposing of materiel and st ores destined for all components of mission field and multirole engineer units these units should be prepared for detached operations their operational field engineer tasks include explosive ordnance reconnaissance eor and mine awarenesssweepingremoval tasks i f construction engineering expertise is required this will cover the basic requirements of both horizontal and vertical construction engineering moreover multirole engineer units s hall be capable of providing potable water production and treatment technical engineering ex pertise such as engineer tradesmen draftsmen structural design electrical design sp ecification writers and inspectors should form part of the unit where local hiring is limited fo r operational reasons engineer units may be grouped together should this occur the chief eng ineer would assume command of the grouping transport units transport units may be part of larger national or multinational logistic organization transport units will manage both contingent owned and owned vehicles comprising the mission pool of transportat ion resources beyond unit capability although the precise types and quantities of vehicl may vary transport units will usually be deployed with preponderance of generalpurpose ve hicles cargo and buses lesson 1 an overview of united nations operationa l logistics 13 movement control movement control hq will normally be collocated wi th the civilian components traffic section where effectiv coordination of this function can be exercised the unit will be expected to cater to d etached operations hence it is usually formed of number of detachments operating at airports s eaports and railheads air units these units are generally subdivided into the fol lowing components liaison transport heavy tactical transport utility short takeoff and landing stol transpo rt medium tactical transport helicopter utility tactical transport helicopter and medevacair rescue fixedwing planes and helicopt ers each country and contractor providing air assets nd personnel will include sufficient elements to form the missions air operations contr ol centre and air staff air maintenance capabilities and airtoground and airtoair comm unications one of the air units might be expected to deploy with meteorological element traffic control flight safety airfield management as well as mobile air movements subunit s and elements may be called in size and final structure will depend upon the role assigned to each unit maintenance and repair units maintenance support and resources required for particular mission will largely depend upon facilit ies available locally and the level of self sufficiency of mission units maintenance elements may form part of larger national or multinational logistic group the principal task f maintenance units is vehicle repair and recovery therefore they must deploy with sufficie nt vehicle recovery trucks to cater to the worst case scenario other maintenance units will include the equipment necessary to perform repair on electromechanical and electronic componen ts medical units the size composition and mission of the medical its depends upon the size of the mission or force the threat agains t these forces distances between levels of care and time constraints in evacuation the medical inf rastructure of the country where the mission is deployed the contingent providing the support and the level of selfsufficiency in each of the units structure of the units and their configurat ion will follow international definitions of levels of care capabilities and capacities at each of the levels lines of communication transport resource availability and response including air and the distances involved between levels of care will determine the medical capabilities requir ed communications units operating from central unit headquarters norma lly collocated with mission andor force headquarters the force signals unit fulfils its role in consultation

deployed pers onnel interfaces with national contingents may have detachments located in major locations and could be responsible for the movement of classified and uncl assified official mail within the operational area local and regional support memorandum of understanding mou may be negotiated with the host country or neighbouring countrys government for the provision of goods and services such as health services labor public facilities and installations search and rescue telephone services and interpreters private sector private sector support via contracting arrangements particularly local arrangements might be made for services public utilities and services and other infrastructure support facilities and assistance to procure supplies and petroleum products laundry and dry cleaning air transport services and repair and maintenance contracts 17 financial arrangements this section describes the financial system and sets out in broad terms the principles and procedures to be followed in order to secure re imbursement of eligible costs financial responsibilities within the secretaria t the methods of financing the methods of financing united nations peacekeep ing operations may vary depending on the type of operat ion and on the decisions taken by the security council in respect to each one the common denominator is that the budgets of peacekeeping operations must be approved by the gen eral assembly taking into account the advice of the advisory committee on administrative and budgetary questions acabq and of the general assembly fifth committee this is acco mplished through regular budget assessed contributions in accordance with formu determined by the general assembly and voluntary contributions the must rely entire ly on voluntary contributions to finance its share of the cost of that operation lesson 1 an overview of united nations operationa l logistics 15 after political departments recommend an operation to the secretarygeneral survey mission is sent to the area targeted for an operati on to evaluate the required resources the secretarygeneral submits report prepared by the political departments to the security council this report indicates the level of resources requir ed based on this information oms prepares preliminary estimates that are reviewed by the cont rollers office the secretarygeneral attaches this estimate to the report to the securit council the security council approves an operation for specific period of time often six months oms prepares detailed budget which is reviewed by the budget unit and submitted as the secretarygenerals proposed total budget the budget is reviewed by the advisory committee on administrative and budgetary questions the general assembly approves the budget the sec retarygeneral has the authority to spend for that particular operation financial responsibilities within mission area doacao once funds are allocated for the purpose of suppor ting mission the doacao will then be issued with instruments of legation of authority by the secretary general as required for the proper functioning of t he mission the financial limits of such authority including those for the purchase of non expendable property shall be specified in each case and will include the authority to enter into s upport contracts in addition to limits on property survey and claims review the doacao is responsible for overall supervision of financial management systems budgetary control preparing and submitting budget estimates for the mission when required and reconciliation of the financial and related req uirements of the mission chief finance officer cfo under the general supervision of the doacao the cfo is responsible for approving mission payments and maintaining the ssion accounts coordinating the preparation and production of bu dget estimates and program budgets for the mission and ensuring full implementation of and compliance wi th all existing financial rules regulations instructions and procedures laid down in the financial manual financial agreements with the financial agreements with the will normally be included as part of the contribution agreement negotiated between respective contributin g states and the this agreement will detail amongst other matters the financial respon sibilities of each party cost calculation when calculating costs which may be charged to the it is the general practice only to seek recovery of the addit ional costs to the troop contributing member state in some instances such as capital purchase this will equal the full cost of providing lesson 1 an overview of united nations operationa l logistics 16 service full visibility of all costs which are t be the subject of reimbursement by the will be required if payment is to be authorized lack f supporting documentation will likely result in significant delay or even nonpayment there may be some occasions where member state d ecides not to seek recovery of its legitimate costs from the on other occasions t he may agree that the costs incurred will be credited as an offset against assessed contribut ions more commonly member state may decide to deploy more assets than the has sought as contribution on the understanding that the additional resources will be funded nationally and remain under the direct control of the state concerned some national deployments in sup port of the contain elements of cost which are not accepted as legitimate charge by th these can cover such diverse matters as expenditure on the welfare of troops or the prov ision of some natures of ammunition before agreeing to introduce new equipment into theatre r implementing improvements to the deployed troops conditions of service contributin g states must establish whether they will be eligible for reimbursement or whether the cost i ncurred will be national funding responsibility such inquiries should be addressed through member states permanent missions to unny nature of reimbursement most cost reimbursement is authorized through new york on presentation of the necessary documentation by t he troop contributing state the following list although not exhaustive details those reimbu rsable costs that member state may incur when contributing to mission contribution agreement for contingent owned equip ment coe mission subsistence allowance standard troop cost

united nations mission area the lesson will illustrate s ome of the major factors that govern the planning of logistics support and discuss the impac t of the new reimbursement reforms and the contribution agreement general roles and responsi bilities will also be covered by the end of lesson 2 the student should be able to meet the following objectives identify the planning factors and consideration s which influence operational logistics planning understand the planning process identify the phase of mission and their relat ed logistics activities and understand the preparations required for the pro vision of troops equipment materiel and services to peacekeeping missions lesson 2 united nations operational logistics pla nning 23 21 support concepts the logistic system relies on the selfsufficie ncy of member states at unit level for given period normally between 60 and 90 days thi s period is designed to allow time for the mission administration to organize the mission head quarters and the mission logistic structure to acquire real estate and to conclude t he status of forces agreements contracts and local memoranda of understanding following this period the will provide bulk pplies such as water fuel and rations common user items including clothing domestic c onsumables batteries some vehicle spares accommodation stores and services such as c leaning laundry and waste disposal in the case of all but the smallest missions this continu ing support depends on the identifying member state or states who may accept the respons ibility of forming the structure of the force logistic support group flsg notwithstanding the formation of flsg the self sufficiency of member states with respect to elements of resupply particularly tech nical spares national clothing and replacement national equipment is essential therefore nationa l lines of supply are always required integrated logistic support the process by which all available materiel administrative and sustainment systems are combined to form the most efficient and cost effective support system cooperative logistics the process of negotiating planning coordinati ng and implementing logistic support between the civilian and military components of nations and international organizations it incorporates membe r states facilities technologies materiel and services and aims to intermesh policies programs procedures and other applicable components of military and national support to produce an inte grated logistic system between member states contributing to missions around the world

others are implied for example specified task might be to disarm opposing factions this is clear task the implied tasks however may include stor age of and accountability for the weapons destruction procedures and reissue procedures i f the mission analysis only notes the specified task then the resources necessary to perform the i mplied tasks will be understated once the specified and implied tasks are identified the log istic planner considers the tasks estimated in relation to the environment in which they are to be executed logistic planning factors they are listing of relationships between two or more variables eg kgsmanday which can be used to plan resource needs in detail if they are not readily available they should be developed and app lied when planning specific mission lesson 2 united nations operational logistics pla nning 24 determination of logistic requirements this is accomplished by applying the logistic planning factors against the tasks outlined in the mission analysis the gross logistic requirements can then be used by the planner to det ermine the most efficient and cost effective method of supply and distribution sources of logistic support the will normally obtain logistic support for field operations from four main sources member states u n engaged contractor support either local or international owned assets andor host nat ions soliciting member states for logistic contributions once logistic requirements are known the will solicit member states that posse ss the required logistic capability to provide all or part of the logistic force necessary the m ember states will then indicate what support forces can be made available determination of logistic shortfalls once member state contributions are determined the planner can assess whether any capability short falls exist if identified shortfalls cannot be resolved through additional member solicitations or increased host nation or contractor support the planner should recommend that the operational p lan be changed to reflect these differences otherwise the accomplishment of the mission may be in jeopardy 23 phases of peacekeeping operations united nations peacekeeping operations can be brok down into six distinct phases each with their separate logistic support requireme nts these phases are standby warning mounting deployment sustainment and redeployment standby phase this begins when the secretary general sg det ermines that particular situation may require involvement p rior to formal notification of the general assembly fact finding and technical survey am is usually dispatched to the problem area to report on the political diplomatic and mil itary situation at this stage survey will be made of potential troop contributors and informal ffers noted warning phase this is initiated when security council approves resolution calling for the creation of peacekeeping mission in considering this resolution the sg will make available rough order magnitude cost implicat ions based on an initial estimate of the mission type and strength at this point full chnical survey will be dispatched including logistic representatives who can conduct macro gistic reconnaissance to determine the availability of host nation support hns existing logistic infrastructure and possible general support contracting options the results of that m acro reconnaissance coupled with the proposed operational force structure required for the missio n will provide the basis for the initial budget estimate required to support the sg recommendation to the general assembly suggested structure and check list for such reconnaissance is available in the survey handbook following this the preliminary budget and manpower requirement estimates based upon the initial technical survey are approved prior to th actual mounting of the operation more complete budget must be developed reviewed by the advisory committee on administrative lesson 2 united nations operational logistics pla nning 25 and budgetary questions and approved by the general assembly under financial rules funds can be expended until the budget is approved the logistic planner must participate in the budget process and be prepared to offer alternative s in those instances where budget shortfalls exist this requires constant refinement of the gistic planning factors troop contributing nations offers will be confirmed at this stage mounting phase this begins with approval of the budget by the g eneral assembly the department of peacekeeping operations dpko wi ll be given overall responsibility for the technical and operational control of the mission w hile its office of mission support oms will be responsible for budget execution administrative and operational support logistic planning must be further refined and form alized at this time participating states will be invited to perform logistic reconnaissance to refine national logistic requirements dpko will also prepare logistic and operational guidelin the mounting phase will involve the following critical logistic actions determination of phased deployment schedules with priority given to logistic units indicate period of selfsufficiency for each co ntributing state contingent determination of airsea lift requirements for co ntributing states securing airsea lift from contributing states an dor commercial contracts establishment of theatre reception and movement c ontrol capabilities initiation of local andor international contract s for logistic support and deployment of an advance command and control elem ent deployment phase this phase begins with the actual deployment of national contingents and personnel oms will coordinate all transportation into and from the theatre any movements arranged by the troop contributing st ate must be approved by oms failure to do so may result in that state being reimbursed onl that amount the would have otherwise paid had the arranged the move load lists and dangerous cargo details are to be forwarded to oms as soon as possible but later than four weeks prior to deployment sustainment phase once contingents have deployed it is necessary to provide the logistic resources to support them in the mission rea this is the sustainment phase which begins when the normal processes are in place the normal processes are combination of all arranged sources of support contingent rotation policy will be established b the based on the particular mission needs and environment rotation for units and personnel will be arranged by oms normally using chartered commercial aircraft after international bidding it is the responsibility of the contingents government to inform the as early as possible but later than three months prior to rotation of the exact dates propos ed and the number of personnel involved each way the rotation should involve only personnel an d personal equipment including personal weapons up to 45 kg per person unit equipment wi ll usually not be rotated since number of airlines will be requested to submit bids for the c ontract national airline of the troop contributing state can be expected to compete on eq ual footing with others any deviation from the rotation policy established by the for par ticular mission must be approved in advance lesson 2 united nations operational logistics pla nning 26 by oms failure to obtain this approval can result in nonpayment of the expenses by the additionally failure to provide the necessary info rmation in timely manner may result in delays of the requested rotation schedule redeployment prior to the completion of the mandate redeploy ment planning will be conducted in order to phase out the operation thi s planning is usually done in greater detail than for the deployment phase the redeployment phase is conducted in three parts stores drawdown planning out clearance procedures and transportation planning most support problems encountered in operations are the direct result of incomplete or superficial logistic planning it is critical that all logistic planners whether national or assigned ensure that adequate mission analysis is performed along with logistic reconnaissance once mission is approved the logistic planning requirement intensifies and must be constantly managed until redeployment is completed 24 preparations military units this is the responsibility of the troop contribu ting country each designated unit should be fully equipped in accorda nce with national scales of issue for the geographic location of the mission the guidelines for contributing countries will contain specifications where appropriate for the military units required and shortfalls should be declared at this stage weapons and ammunition requirements will be determined on case by case basis once food and water contracts have been establis hed each item will be resupplied in accordance with the ration scale this scale wi ll be modified as necessary to be compatible with the contributing nation scales of issue and to cater for national food tastes and religious dietary customs national ration scales are to be provided to oms and the chief logistic officer clo as soon as possible communications communications between mission headquarters and formed units may initially be provided by the mission military s ignals unit military units should be

are handled in the united nations supply system by the end of lesson 3 the student should be able to meet the following objectives define the supply system provide guidelines for supply planning describe the common supply operations and detail the supply procedures lesson 3 supply 35 31 introduction the objective of supply is to provide the right ma teriel in the right quantity to the right place at the right time and in the most economical manner materiel is generic term covering equipment stores supplies and spares the detail ed attention required for ammunition and fuel is provided as examples of the intricacies of pply operations 32 supply concepts general the united nations is responsible for the provisio n of supplies to its missions and the forces under its control wherever possible the standard supply system is used and the requirements of the mission are met through the procedures established by the headquarters through the oms the will strive t use the most cost effective supply sources while ensuring the most efficient materiel support to the mission missions vary in size from small groups of obse rvers who may be civilian police military or mixture to large force operating full spectrum of military equipment the supply system is tailored for specific mission h owever general concept for supply is common to all operations the concept uses an est ablished structure series of supply functions and an overall command and control frame work based on the requirements and constraints of the mission supply structure the supply structure for missions is based arou nd three distinct levels of support these levels are defin ed as follows first line organizational support those stock holdings intrinsic to unit and normally deployed with it that is the stocks requ ired to make unit selfsufficient for stated period second line direct support the stocks held or obtained within the mission are to replenish first line holdings as they are consum ed normally held by logistics base or national logistics unit in the ssion area each participating member state may have national support element n incorporated into the force logistics support group flsg and third line general support those stocks procured outside to the mission area they may or may not be centrally warehoused in the mission area small missions may combine first and second line pply any mission in which units are deployed from more than one country or have mul tiple task groups will normally establish force logistic support group flsg to provide comm on second line support to different contingents lesson 3 supply 36 figure 31 depicts the supply structure for rge missions the mission logistics base may provide both second and third line supply suppo rt if it is responsible for providing general warehousing in the mission area host nation suppli ers may also be used to provide third line support functions for the mission figure 31 supply functions they are as follows supply planning identifying the requirement and determining the ra nge and quantity of items required to support unit and it s equipment its phases include the identification of items of supply cataloguing scaling and the issue of procedures as required acquisition of materiel the process of obtaining materiel and services fro m military or commercial sources of supply receipt and issue of materiel the process of acceptance and verification of delivery of materiel from supply sources and the bsequent reallocation to meet the requirements of the units care and storage of materiel the process of warehousing conditioning inspecting and packaging stocks for future use disposal the removal of materiel from the supply system thr ough sale demolition or destruction and inventory control the control of materiel by establishing materiel ac counting and management methods and procedures this includ maintaining stocks at the required level troop contributing nation member state forward logistics support group logistics base mission logistics base supply unit national support element unit host nation suppliers third line second line first line lesson 3 supply 37 command and control the command and control of supply in the mission area is exercised by the force commander military and civi lian staffs and subordinate unit commanders under the authority of the head of miss ion the control of supply and replenishment is combined with the logistic staff s tructure that will have number of branch section chiefs eg signals medical transport procurement etc who designate the demand and issue controls on the commodities of their branch the structure of the command and control systems must be responsive to the planning and operational req uirements of the mission be flexible enough to meet the possibility of the materiel requirements for missions of all kinds be capable of using or developing common supply p rocedures forms and returns for requisitioning and inventory control maintain asset visibility so that staffs can prov ide effective control distribution of stocks and use of transport resources be adaptable so that adp techniques and resources can be used be aware of the areas of interoperability and sta ndardization of materiel resources and be capable of integrating national systems where possible in general every demand is to be initially placed upon the supply system each level of the supply system has some form of materiel cont rol the lowest level of control is established in the contingent in which the unit com mander or his delegate will approve the requirement each participating member state will maintain its own materiel control techniques in accordance with its established procedures the highest level of control is at the mission headquarters level some participating member states and their nse may invoke control system in which their units will not submit any demands to the s ystem without approval from their nse 33 supply planning logistic staff planning in the hq of mission two officials and their sta ffs have overall responsibility for the activities of the pply functions in the mission cao and clo their general duties and those of their staff are d etailed in lesson 1 the success of supply operations will depend largely on the cooperation b etween these officials and their respective staff in lesson 1 the various sections responsible to t he cao were described however there is generally specific supply section under the c ao and the functions are spread among several agencies the general services officer han dles the inventory control through the property control unit receipt and issue is usually under the chief procurement officer while other supply functions are split among the function chiefs of engineering transport communications etc lesson 3 supply 38 in the military component the mission senior staf f officer supply sso sup is responsible to the clo for all supply related matte rs including supply policy plans operations and coordination within the military component of t he mission specifically he will prepare requisitions for supplies and services an d forward them to the cao and section chiefs receive all unit demands and redirect them to the appropriate branch or unitelement monitor unit demands contingents and units of th flsg review entitlements issue procedures and assign demand priorities establish the policy for the care and storage of equipment and supplies monitor the inventory control system of the flsg stock control levels and supply planning factors and advise the cao of any required changes assist in the handover procedures receive and monitor the contingent inventory list s of contingent owned and owned equipment establish procedures to maintain the property rec ords supply accounts and establish and manage supply operations cell if required should the mission be large enough that the suppor t structure of the military component requires large independent or specific supply units within the flsg the commanding officer of the supply battalion or mission supply depot will b responsible to the clo for the efficient management and operation of the facilities and the mission commodities within them specifically these supply unit commanding officers will be responsible for receiving inspecting storing securing maintaining the prop erty records and issuing the mission equipment and supplies general guidelines initial planning must address broad range of fac tors strike an effective balance in capabilities to meet changing requirements and retain flexibility planners clearly understand the operational objective and co ncept of operation so they can develop concept of supply support the multinational natur of missions introduces additional complexity to the planning process thus the supp ly planner should take into account supply capabilities of participating countries f orces should be identified early as well as host nation resources sources of supply and th most effective system of supply should be identified to the extent possible participating countries capabilities host nation support contracted services and resources should be int egrated the condition congestion distance and security of sea air and ground lines of communication impact directly on supply plans and m ay dictate combination of distribution methods that increase the complexity f the logistics mission as whole mission areas may lack the infrastructure such s electrical power transportation networks port facilities required to provide supp ly support planning must recognize these shortfalls and find ways to overcome them an d the types and quantities of commodities required for the mission must take account of geographical conditions and cultural diversities lesson 3 supply 39 at the second line of support the clos supply pl anning staff determines stocks to be held the second line stock scale includes items t hat experience or projected need indicated consistent with available funding determining sec ond line stocks is planning process that addresses the operational and logistical aspects of mission approved budget first and second line unit capabilities distribution between nation and stocks and availability of supplies the absence of cataloguing and coding system com mon to all member states means establishing the range of stocked materiel requires contributing countries to clearly identify requirements in manner that enables the supplying unit to obtain the correct item this is particularly true when the item required is critica l for example repair parts and lubricants that affect the performance of weapon or communication system supply planning factors for some items such as ra tions can be expressed in kilogramspounds and litresgallons required per da based on troop strength some items such as repair parts require history of demand or us age to determine the desired stock range and quantity which may need to be adjusted to meet oper ational intensity climatic and cultural factors the stock level is based on time period determin ed by the clo replenishment of consumable supplies is based on standard formula that considers stock balance average monthly demands and procurement lead time repleni shment of nonconsumable major end user items is national responsibility initial provisioning in the absence of consumption data or demand h istory initial provisioning levels will be established by the clo flsg staff officers in coordination with the supply officers of the supported first line units these recommendations can be based on either the comparison or calculation methods comparison demand and consumption data is taken from past mission with similar characteristics such as troop strengths quipment duration and climatic conditions and mandate calculation automated or manual calculations use standard pla nning factors for troop strengths equipment densities anticipated perating intensities and duration such calculations may be made by the mission or pro vided by member state that has support experience for particular type of supply commodity or equipment during the mission standby phase recommended in itial stock scaling and projected consumption for deploying contingents shall be forw arded to the oms to support the budget process minimum information required will be spel led out in the aide memoire issued by the oms to the troopcontributing governments procurement to fill initial scaling may be from th existing stock held elsewhere through letters of assist from member states from host nation government sources local contractors or other sources lesson 3 supply 40 replenishment when manual systems are used second line stocks w

writeoff nontechnical expendable items unserviceable due to normal fair wear and tear examples beds mattresses wardrobes bed linen c utlery chairs hand tools etc technical items unserviceable due to normal wear and tear examples binoculars heaters televisions radios refrigerators camera s etc technical and nontechnical items that have been stolen burnt hijacked shelled or damaged by natural causes such as storms and floodi ng writeoff of contingent materiel writeoffs for contingentowned materiel and equipment are covered under the coe agreement signe d with the prior to deployment to the mission area in most instances the is respons ible for reimbursement for writeoffs over us250000 writeoffs under that threshold are co vered in the monthly payments made to member states however any loss or damage resulti ng in writeoff should be documented in accordance with mission logistics directives to pro vide trail for any future discussions demand procedure preparation of demands selfaccounting units will prepare demands on spec ified log forms that are available from mission headquart ers details for completion are provided in the mission logistics directives routine needs fo r general equipment and stores will be submitted to the clo supply unit demands for spec ial equipment and stores are to be submitted to the appropriate supply staff officer staffing process the clos supply unit will register and scrutiniz the demand as to correctness of information provided by demanding it and indicate the available stock the demands except those issued under automatic distri bution by the supply unit in accordance with scale of issue will be passed to log ops for aut horization or rejection the demand will be reviewed and the unit advised f its status demands may receive partial acceptance because of reduction of amount demanded due to limited stocks cancellation due to stock or automatic issue when stocks are available or rejection due to nonentitlement of requisitioned item transport units must provide unit transport for collection f items from the supply unit the transport unit upon request through hq logistics operations may provide second line transport support immediate operational requirement ior immediate operational requirement demands are processed in similar manner to routin demands except that the ior procedure ensures that the highest priority is attached to th eir issue or procurement as applicable this demand system may be used for mission critical requ irements only eg to ensure uninterrupted performance of an assigned operational mission or t ask or other vital functions such as fire fighting communications ambulance or the like lesson 3 supply 45 automatic distribution some consumable items of limited stock may be subje ct to automatic distribution according to scale of issue and on the basis of fair share such distribution is originated by log ops or specialist supply units consumable items such as cleaning and hygienic materials and stationery are issued according to fixed scale of issue and are distributed or ready for collection at the star t of each month some form of rationing may be used if availability is limited receipt of equipment and supplies general it is essential that proper receipt and inspectio n documents be raised immediately on receipt of equipment and supplies co nsigned to the united nations these are required for the prompt payment of invoices or toge ther with other documents for claims action against vendor or carrier the r i group is collocated with the supply unit and is the focal point for the delivery of all incoming shipments the r i unit is responsible for identifying the shipment and the self accounting unit which placed the demand maintaining register of all items delivered an d notifying the self accounting unit concerned of i tems that have arrived the self accounting unit will make arrangements for collecti on and the items will be handed over against signature only the r i group is responsible for followup with the movement control the transport group and self accounting units so that all receivi ng and inspection reports or discrepancy reports are raised and submitted to the r i group for control and distribution of the various copies of the report the r i group is also resp onsible for processing claims against vendors or carriers to headquarters new york special self accounting units like an flsg are r esponsible for raising the receipt and inspection reports and d iscrepancy reports for all items received verifying items against the procurement document to ensure that specifications have been met regarding quality quantity delivery date and any other special instruction given to the vendor and preparing the r i report and forwarding it to t he r i group for control and distribution lesson 3 supply 46 care and storage general the sites warehouses and depots also may be very different depending on the type of mission warehousing warehousing means receipt sorting identification inspection preservation shelving safekeeping retrieval for issue and preparation for shipment of materiel warehouses are often divided in separate sections s multirole supply point single warehouses for bulk supplies are also possible ma ximum use must be made of indoor and outdoor space manpower handling equipment and sto rage aids proper location system should be used and mater iel stored in manner that permits good selection and consolidation for shipment spe cial attention should be provided for protection against pilferage hazardous materiel general any materiel which because of its properties is f lammable corrosive an oxidizing agent explosive toxic or radioactive be longs to the class of hazardous materiel hazardous materiel must be handled carefully stor age locations for hazardous materiel are based on the concept of compatibility that is if two chemicals or items will or may react dangerously if mixed they are not to be stored tog ether classification of hazardous materiel the method of segregating hazardous materiel by the risk present as the classification system of hazardous materiel may differ in the laws of contributing countries extreme care must be used i n order to avoid confusion the supply system uses classification of 1 to 9 each unit i nvolved in receipt storage issue and disposal of hazardous materiel must identify the classification and manage the materiel in accordance with its national law and guidelines since many hazardous materials have high flammab ility fire prevention and safety are extremely important when storing hazardous materiel therefore smoking and other flame producing or sparking activities are forbidden and explosion proof lighting and electrical connections are to be used in areas of flammable or oxidizing materials the area must also contain personal protective clothing and equipment fire extinguishers fire hoses sprinklers and if possible heat and smoke detectors since the other common problem with hazardous mate riel is toxic fumes proper ventilation is required this not only removes or reduces any toxic fumes it can also prevent the buildup of flammable fumes that may explode or sp ontaneously combust all storage facilities must have the ability to prevent materials mainly liquids from escaping into the environment during spill packaging and preservation packaging is defined as the method of unit protect ion and application or use of appropriate wrappings cushion ing interior containers and identification packaging should ensure that all materiel is protec ted from deterioration physical and mechanical damage and remain in serviceable condit ion from time of acquisition until use lesson 3 supply 47 in the the supply system materiel often has to go long distances through three lines of supply the supply roads into the mission area between second and first line units can be extremely rough therefore packaging is important the packaging policy on procurement of materiel is to accept commercial packaging whenever possible supply operations between secon d and first line units can recommend military packaging for complex cargo or accounts ot her than the commercial package provides in every case the supply unit in the area which th shipment takes place is responsible for the efficient packaging and the fulfilling of all milit ary and civilian transportation and safety requirements the transportation unit is responsibl to control and maintain all packaging according to current regulations disposal of equipment and stores general the supply unit will control the storage and dispo sal of mission property which has been properly condemned in the case of contingents and other self accounti ng units unserviceable items will be transferred to the supply unit only after final aut hority for writeoff has been received from the mission property survey board items which have be condemned but are awaiting final authority for writeoff will not be so transferred or accepted into the supply unit disposal park these items will be stored separately until final uthority for disposal has been received surplus equipment and stores will be reported as xcess stock and returned to the supply unit for storage or redistribution in cases where because of the size of an item or for reasons of safety or health it is impossible or impractical t return it commanders of contingents and other self accounting units will safeguard the equi pment and stores and report it to the supply unit for its disposal in location every precaution will be taken to ensure that prop erty belonging to the government or citizens of the mission area is not included in any category of materiel reported for disposal by sale demolition or destruction by other means in the event of position being closed down fforts must be made by the unit to obliterate all reference to such as signs and m arkings at the position unit commanders must make special efforts to bring to the attention of all personnel the possible consequences of the careless disposal of equipment and clothing wit h markings categories of disposal the disposal of equipment and stores will normally fall into one of the following categories the sale of scrap surplus or condemned materiel and vehicles the destruction of security stores communicatio ns equipment weapons armourers tools and related components and spare parts or it ems having sale value and the demolition of ammunition and explosives lesson 3 supply 48 some items may not be sold and must be disposed so lely by demolition or destruction by other means such items would be clothing flags and decals ammunition and explosives communications equipment weapons armourers too ls and related components and spare parts cut up break and sell as scrap and hazardous materials those by virtue of its prope rties are toxic corrosive or radioactive condemned items of operational equipment will not be disposed of in their whole state military vehicles will be rendered unusable and dis posed of in similar fashion whenever doubt exists as to whether or not an item falls int this category the matter shall be referred to the chief logistics officer clo who will obtain specific ruling from the appropriate authorities deep sea dumping or burial of ammunition or explos ives or hazardous materiel shall not be carried out nor will there be any tentative arra ngements or inquiries made with local authorities without prior approval from headquar ters new york 35 food services general the cpo is responsible to the cao for the contracti ng of food services for all components of the peacekeeping force and mission self sufficiency peacekeeping forces are to be self sufficient in food and ration items for period of 60 days from their deployment this period may vary depending u pon the size of the contingent location proximity to the sourc of supply nevertheless early advice in this regard must be g iven to the contributing member states to allow sufficient time for them to complete food service arrangements payments for t he food and ration items that the respective contingent had bro ught with them will be made by the to the contributing nation the force self sufficiency period will enable personnel to identify sources of supply and systems of provisioning of the food services both close to or away from the deployment areas once established the personn should start meeting the requirements of food services of the force keeping in view their national food tastes and reli gious dietary customs according to the accepted ration scale sources available for food services under normal circumstances four of the under mentioned sources of supply would always be availab to the personnel good combination of these sources by the personnel wo uld enable them to ensure smooth and canadian cook peels potatoes in preparation for supper at

food tastes and religious dietary customs the sources available are host country all efforts should be made to purchase or hire the food services from the host country this arrangement will not only h elp the in speedy procurement and provisioning of food services to the force but may be more economical compared with the other sources host country supply may be useful for small missions and sometimes for medium sized missions due to their li mited requirements contributing member states for large contingent it may not be possible for the to meet requirements of food services from the h ost country alone due to different national food tastes religious dietary customs an d quantities hence the food items and facilities may be purchased or hired from the r espective contributing member states contractors the can also purchase or hire the services of fo od service contractors the contractor support can be arrange d by the locally or internationally either for complete food services r only for those items which are neither available with the host country nor with th contributing member states owned stocks if the is already holding stocks of food items nd related facilities these can be issued to the contingent to meet their requirements however it is not possible for the to hold stocks of foo d items for everyone keeping in view their national food tastes and religious dietary cu stoms to offset this limitation the has to depend on combination of sources of sup ply to ensure smooth uninterrupted and speedy flow of food services to t he forces being supported rations ration is defined as all food commodities authori zed for one person for one day as per the approved mission ration scale rati on entitlement is the number of rations to which contingent is entitled based on the authori zed contingent personnel strength units entitlement to rations is governed by many factors which when combined determine the commodities that contingent is entitled to draw these factors include personnel strength of the unit personnel on leave outside the mission area visiting personnel from other contingents and visitors as directed by the fc civilian kitchen staff personnel hospitalized special increments for national holidays and smal l units the issue of composite rations and approved contingent rations scale lesson 3 supply 50 unit commander is authorized to draw and provide meals free of charge to all military personnel of the force units other force members for whom unit has been form ally tasked to provide this support force and other personnel visiting unit on t emporary duty in the case of personnel other than force members such direction must be included in the visit authorization or itinerary locally recruited kitchen staff as identified by the chief civilian personnel officerccpo and such other personnel authorized by the force comm ander for purely budgetary purposes manday ration cost is determined for each mission this figure is determined by dividing the total rat ion costs incurred during mandate period by the corresponding number of mandays this manday cost is allinclusive comprising daily ration issues additional entitlements small units holiday weather as well as writeoffs it is not identical to the daily ration food basket cost the average daily ration food basket cost ration cost as now being computed by missions is hypothetical figure representing the average cost of daily ration calculated on the basis of scale provisions since consumption does not necessarily mirror scale provisions the ration cost figure does not accurately reflect the average cost of feeding one man in one day the mission ration scale authorizes an extra ratio n supplement for small units in order to compensate for the larger proportion of food ses including preparation losses unusable leftovers etc and difficulties in distributing f ood items to the positions reserve stocks situations may arise whereby units may become isol ated and regular delivery of rations may not be possible due to weat her conditions the operational situation transit difficulties or other reasons therefore reserve rations are to be maintained in first line by units second line reserve stocks are normally held by the log units ration depot unit commanding officers are responsible for the p roper storage control and rotation of reserve rations frequent inspections are to be ca rried out on all holdings of composite rations especially those stored in bunkers the mission reserve of rations will be composed of composite ration it may be issued combat nation or national combat nation as greed with mission reserve of first and second line rations will be established during initial mission planning it is usually maximum of seven days at first line and ten days at second line every unit must maintain its first line holdings at the appropriate level consumption of composite rations may be directed b the mission hqcloso foods when necessary to prevent writeoff due to expirati on of shelf life when this is ordered all composite rations consumed will be accounted for as fresh rations unit commanding officers are responsible to ensure that the composite ration s are consumed before they reach their expiry dates lesson 3 supply 51 water water is one of the most dangerous carriers of comm unicable diseases in addition contamination is often intermittent and ma not be revealed by examination of single sample which provides information only on the condi tions prevailing at the moment of sampling for that reason it is very important that water be continually inspected first line reserve of bottled water should be held at units level in all camps positions and bunkers second line reserve of bottled water should be held at mission level provisioning of food services equipment the provisioning of food services equipment to smaller or observer missions and somet imes to the medium sized mission may not be problem for the staff due to their limited requirements the staff may be able to meet their requirements from within the host countr however for large sized multinational contingent provisioning of food services equipment on short notice will pose problem mainly due to different national food tastes method of co oking and equipment needed to meet cooking standards and requirements of each segment of the c ontingent provisioning of kitchens and dining facilities if the status of force agreement between the and the host country indicates that the host country is responsibility for the provisioning and maintaining of buildings and accom modations including kitchens and dining halls for the contingent then the staff must nsure the following prior to the arrival of the contingent identify the areas and requirements to the host c ountry where buildings accommodations would be needed take over the buildings and accommodations offere d by the host country undertake necessary repairs and maintenance of

lesson 4 engineering support 59 41 introduction the objectives of general engineer support service s are to plan design construct and maintain buildings and physical infrastructure ope rate utility plants and provide fire protection together with other related services in support of the operational commitments of field missions general engineer support services are pr ovided in addition to field engineering services such as mine clearance which may be requir ed in certain missions 42 engineering logistics concepts field missions have unique complex and crit ical engineer logistics environment this involves identifying and preparing bases of op eration identifying and improving utility supply lines projecting and preparing forward logi stics bases identifying potential sources of supply for engineering works negotiating take over of facilities from host nation support hns and forecasting and building operational sto ck assets forward in the theatre many of these actions if not engineer unique are engineer intensive the engineer support relies on national conting ents being selfsufficient at unit level for given period normally between 60 and 120 day s depending on the situation military units may be asked to deploy with capability for selfhelp engineer support to develop their respective areas of responsibility suggested concepts for future missions engineers must be prepared to execute tasks from the full range of engineer functions these m ay include contending with rapid deployment conditions austere living conditions lack of appr opriate maps destroyed infrastructure multiple air and seaport development extensive countermine and force protection operations lack of construction materials and civic action requiremen ts in general engineer support concepts should be guided by the following principles maximum use of existing structures controlled by the or by hns modification of existing structures rather than c onstructing new ones austere design and construction techniques minimum engineer effort maximum use of hns labor and contracting standard designs and specifications and establishment of office and care facilities kitc hen dining and ablutions takes precedent over living accommodations lesson 4 engineering support 60 engineer support the following areas are integral to ensuring approp riate engineer support to the mission engineer reconnaissance this forms the basis for effective and efficient ngineer support and includes the nature of the country to include its geograp hy history demography political and economic climate the laws customs and agreements of the country i ncluding contracting conditions real estate procedures environmental l aws cultural impacts on construction hostnation agreements and internati onal agreements the engineering environment to include climate an d weather terrain and topography soils and geology elevation vegetatio n land use hydrography natural resources and type nature and amount of vailable construction materials and the level and status of infrastructure to include aerial and seaports of debarkation incountry transportation and utiliti electrical power water distribution systems sanitation facilities and pip elines establishing the engineer objective these are derived from the overall objectives established by the head of the mission to achieve b oth specified and implied tasks detail the essential taskings to be executed the ngineer effort required and construction materials needed the approved and pro posed construction standards the estimated time required for execution and any speci considerations such as civic actions etc tailoring the engineering support the engineer resources are tailored to execute the identified taskings considering the capabilitie s of the available engineering support elements military and civilian available engineer capabilities engineer capabilities of the force vary depending on the typ of unit and country of origin many member states separate combat and construction engineer skills others do not thus planners must consider the specific capabilit and availability of the national units when building the engineering support compone nt of the mission this helps the planner request the appropriate type of enginee r units and eliminates potential redundancy or lack of capabilities interoperabili ty must be considered to ensure that assets are complementary if not compatible engin eer planners also consider assets available through the contracts the host natio n support and private agencies obtaining construction materiel engineer operations normally require large amounts of construction materials engineers ident ify prioritize and requisition the required construction materials through supply chan nels engineers are to be involved in the specification and acceptance process const ruction materials not available in country should be requisitioned and delivered in sm all quantities as forces arrive in theatre followon transportation should include l imited and frequent loads of construction materials allowing steady flow into the theatre and precluding storage problems lesson 4 engineering support 61 protection accommodation and other construction ll require large quantities of construction materials this commodity is critical to mission success and is often needed very early in the mission the ceo must estimate requir ements for theatre development and for sustainment flow and what materials are available f rom local sources such as local manufacturers commercial stockpiles or host natio n government assets protection requires large quantities of concertina and barbed wire pic kets and timbers tent accommodation requires construction lumber and nails infrastructure repai r and construction requires concrete asphalt aggregate and dust palliatives etc supply and procurement organizations process the r equisition receive store and transport construction materials engineers track the status of required construction materials in order to keep pace with the operation procurement time of several months may not be acceptable to mission needs therefore constructio n materials procurement may take on extraordinary procedures such as local purchase or contracting in proximity to the theatre this decision on sourcing will be made by the cao taking into consideration the head of missions objectives and timing 43 field mission engineering support concepts engineering support in the peacekeeping missions i s provided through an integrated military and civilian support structure mission ngineering personnel coordinate design construct install and maintain infrastructure mai ntain and operate support systems utility services and provide fire prevention and fire prote ction services in support of the operational commitments and towards the sustainment of the sion the primary task especially at the outset of any mission will be determining the infrastructure requirements and implementing the ssions infrastructure projects at minimum cost most efficient manner depending on nature nd length of the mission the engineering support services will be the resul t of an integrated process where the military and civilian engineering components develo p the infrastructure plans and then implement the projects staffed through and approved by the missions integrated support services unit the engineering and technical component of the f orce from troop contributing countries and the civilian engineering component wi ll be monitored by the missions integrated support services unit the force engineers military staff at the missi on headquarters will consist of engineers from the national contingents that constitute the

and mandate lesson 4 engineering support 62 organization the chief integrated support services ciss will be responsible for coordinating engineering activities within the mission and will be answerable to the cao to the head of the mission thus the feo must maintain close coordin ation with the ciss the primary task of the ciss will be to coordinate engineering related matters with the

44 guidelines for accommodation facilities u tilities standards of accommodation requirements may vary extensively from mission to mission depending on geography climate hns civil contractors support intheatre infrastructure and contributing countries nation contingents facilities materiel and services depending on the national contingents standards of selfsufficiency initial accommodation of certain units may differ from the start in the ea rly days of larger and more complex mission logistic staff and units may provide little assi stance to national contingents therefore national contingents are responsible to ensure they deploy fully equipped water one of the most important provisions is the supply of water since it affects efficiency morale general health and welfare it is required for consumption decontamination sanitation and construction as well as for vehicle operation and maintenance if these systems are nonexistent or destroyed water supply points are established for the deployment phase of the mission whenever possible by the missions engi neering elements national contingents head of mission force commander chief administration officer chief integrated service support chief of staff field engineering units chief engineering officer chief civilian engineering officer lesson 4 engineering support 63 deployed in any mission area must be prepared to in itially secure water for themselves until engineers quartermasters or other supply elements can establish water operations therefore means of purification storage and distribution of water should be top priority when determining contingents equipment and supplies the operational support manual contains chart of environmental conditions that should be co nsidered when planning water support to mission sewage and waste water large troop concentrations at installed facilities generate requirements for sewage and waste collection and tr eatment when using installed facilities including hns in the mission area they usually in clude waste water systems however they may not be operational or suitable for military use these systems should be operated maintained and repaired by engineer elements or qua lified indigenous personnel such as civil contractors field sanitation measures such as pi t or burn out latrines lagoons for hospitals etc may be used in the initial phase of deployment unti l installed facilities are in operation power supply part of the engineering responsibility of providing utilities is the generating and distribution of electrical power p ower generating must be reliable since observation posts op camps and positions check points and hqs must be fully illuminated and visible at all times for safety and security reasons in many cases the mission faces complete lack of locally installed power supply systems or facilities which are in bad repair andor barely covering the needs of the local civilian population therefore when using locally installed systems adequate safeguards have to be taken to ensure reliable power supply operation can be guaranteed for mission elem ents consequently diesel or gasoline generators should be installed and ready as backups lighting as mentioned above the lighting in and of all p ositions from dusk to dawn is essential to safety for personnel the upkee p within contingent camps is continent matter although major repairs and maintenance can be coordinated at force level using generators etc heating when mission areas require heating facilities m ost central heating installations usually are restricted to camps with priority 1 troop accommodations and priority 2 offices dining rooms messes and hospitals the u of electrical heaters should be minimized in order to economize electrical costs and generator l oading however should contingents be deployed in more remote areas in frigid climates t he national contingents should carefully plan what type of heating equipment should be taken to t he mission area type of fuel access to spare parts easy maintenance and fire protection regulations must be taken into consideration propane water heaters are often used in preference to electrical water heaters in order to limit electrical costs and generator loads solar water heaters should be considered for installation in larger troop accommodation buildings hospitals and kitchens wherever the climate allows and the expected duration of the mission contributes to wards economy air conditioning cooling and refrigeration in certain mission areas the installation of air conditioners may be essential for communicat ion rooms operation centres hospital sickrooms dining rooms and troop accommodations cooling and refrigeration of food is another priority for all contingents when install ing small portable refrigerators consideration lesson 4 engineering support 64 should be given to operating both on electricity or gas to increase independence and flexibility any installation of air conditioning or large refri gerators such as beer coolers must be approved by the mission caodoa even if nationally funded as the electrical and gas consumption of the cap or position will increase pol although pol includes wide range of products nece ssary for the success of missions engineer support to the class of supply i s directed at the petroleum distribution effort the distribution of propane in bottles or tanks is part of the supply system of the mission the ceo through the engineering management cell provi des maintenance excluding organizational maintenance and repair of existing distribution systems while these systems include both storage facilities and pipelines forc level assets are limited to that effort above or beyond the capabilities of national contingents t he ceo is also responsible for design construction and expansion of distribution systems in support of operations this includes marine terminals and storage facilities the engin eer tasks associated with petroleum distribution systems include route clearing and fla ttening and constructing gap crossings and pipe supports for pipelines while the construction of storage facilities either for flexible storage tanks or bolted steel storage tanks may require si clearance and levelling 45 infrastructure many of the missions face difficulties in their early stages in deployment and sustainment due to destroyed or nonexisting lines of communication loc main supply routes msr nonexistent or destroyed seaports irfields heliports and logistic facilities and utilities the minimum requirements for mobility survivabili ty and sustainability of all mission contingents and units may vary depending on tasks deployment areas and national support self sufficiency nevertheless the general engineerin g capabilities combined at force level contingent level and where applicable must focus on the basic needs of the troops observers and civilian staff deployed in the mission area arly involvement of the force engineering cell and the national contingents engineering units pre ferably in the planning stage of new mission is essential airfields and heliports for time phased deployment and rapid supply and r esupply of all units airfields and heliports are essential wherever possible the mission will use existing airfields in the mission area the identification of existing airfields and heliports including the requirement for new airfields the extension or rep air of existing facilities and maintenance requirements is very high priority in the early p lanning stages of mission the engineering capabilities of missions force units and nation contingents may often be less than adequate for such tasks except for helipads where the main problem will be to provide dustfree landing areas of limited size most likely the force will lack heavy engineering equipment construction materiel skilled troops and funding for the const ruction of more than helipads therefore once the reconnaissance has established facts of airfiel d and heliport shortfalls for the mission the should be able to consider civil contracts if u nit is available for airfield extension or construction its engineers will have to enter the planning process at the earliest stage possible lesson 4 engineering support 65 seaports whereas the initial elements of mission are most often deployed by air the efficient and economic flow of troops and materiel into the theatre may depend on adequate port facilities as close as possible to the mission area hns agreements granting mission use rights are essential wherever possible existing ports re used rehabilitated or upgraded the construction of new ports is normally beyond capabi lities of national contingents participating in operations the engineer mission is to support construction repair and maintenance of different facilities both above and below the wate rline but again very few member states could provide the units skills and equipment nece ssary for these tasks therefore the planning and mounting of new mission will involve the use of existing and functioning port facilities which require as little as possible repair upgradi ng or maintenance and will focus primarily on the main supply routes msr and lines of communica tion locs from the ports to the area of deployment roads an adequate road network is needed to transport per sonnel equipment and supplies for any mission wherever possible th mission will rely on existing roads as the msrs and locs though engineer unit at force or national contingent level may be designed for road construction solely many engineering elem ents will be engaged in this task during the deployment and sustainment phases of mission in many missions the road network or lack thereof will be essential to the success of the ssion opening country for the flow of relief supplies and for the resettlement of refugees and d isplaced persons will in many cases depend on engineer assets as result of decreased transi t time relief agencies will depend less on air assets of the mission and more upon convoys missio n forces will have more rapid access to critical areas and the opening of msrs will allow h umanitarian agencies to plan for repatriation of refugees opening roads may also act as mecha nism for determining mission force requirements as forces are able to move rapidly long msrs and have access to all areas of the theatre smaller forces will be required humanita rian aid can be delivered in large quantities by road replacing inefficient airdrops as msrs open contingent nations will be able to redeploy forces it should be acknowledged that allweather surface s for all msrs and locs may be beyond the capability of force engineers neverthe less this should be the goal for all major routes the different realities of the mission area such as geography topography intheatre infrastructure host nation support availability f heavy equipment and construction materiel will have major influence on the planning of road s therefore road reconnaissance must be top priority task of the earliest factfinding tea m in the area only then can the necessary planning for upgrading maintenance and repairing f roads be undertaken and at the same time costly and timeconsuming deployment factors be min imized bridges reinforcement or new construction of bridges may be required thus catalogue of all existing bridges including their physical details must be prepared an efficient msr network must be able to carry all expected traf fic loads often bridging is the weak link in the loadcarrying capacity of route lesson 4 engineering support 66 detours and bypasses detours and bypasses are second in priority only t the use of existing bridges reinforcements and repairs of ex isting bridges are third in priority in general detours and bypasses can be found and used more qui ckly than existing bridges can be repaired 46 fire protection services missions typically occupy austere accommodation in areas where fire fighting services are often rudimentary significant amount s of resources are invested in the infrastructure equipment and vehicles of each miss ion more importantly the lives of all mission members are put at risk if fire protection services are inadequate it is therefore essential that each mission create the safest possible condit ions with respect to fire safety the aim of this section is to provide general guidance for the blishment of effective fire protection services in missions organization the ceo is responsible for mission fire protection services he is assisted by force fire marshall who should be f ire services professional each national contingent should appoint fire services officerc ontingent fire chief from within its own organization in observer mission team sites the team leader should appoint an unmo to act as team fire warden responsibilities the force fire marshall ffm is responsible to th ceo for the provision of fire services to the mission he will advise and assist contingents in fire fighting and fire prevention training for all personnel rev iew all contingent fire reports conduct regular fire prevention inspections and control the use an d financing of fire fighting equipment if the mission is established with fire fighting brigade the ffm will exercise command over this unit commanding officers cos are responsible to ensur that fire awareness is developed throughout their command they must appoint the tingent fire chief who shall also be the contingent fire prevention officer and fire prevent ion committee member and promulgate contingent fire orders to be posted in camps and op erational positions contingent fire chiefs are responsible for determi ning potential fire hazards in their unit to reduce hazards and to prevent injury they shou ld prepare contingent fire fighting plans ensure all contingent fire fighting equipment is in serviceable condition on regular basis hold contingent fire prevention and fire fighting meetin gs and established their own fire prevention committees fire fighting if fire breaks out it is everyones responsibil ity to extinguish it immediately using all available means control of fire fighting operations shall be the responsibility of the contingent fire chief and ord ers relevant to the operations shall be given only by the contingent fire chief or his delegated subordinate the contingent fire chief or his delegated subordinate shall take orders only from t he co or his delegated officer such delegated officers shall not interfere in the immed iate direction of fire fighting operations unless it is apparent that this is essential lesson 4 engineering support 67 contingent fire forces are responsible for the imm ediate response to all contingent fire incidents under the direction of the contingent f ire chief they shall carry out all fire fighting and rescue operations within the capability of thei r manpower and resources where the fire incident is beyond their control or capability the shall request assistance from the neighbouring contingent in the mission control of joint fire f ighting between two contingents will be coordinated between the two contingent fire chiefs the chief from the contingent where the fire is located will be in overall command and resp onsible for the operation contingent fire chiefs are responsible for all asp ects of fire fighting training for their fire department personnel training exercises are to be coordinated with the force fire marshall who will attend these sessions periodically to eval uate and assist contingents to ensure high level of preparedness is maintained at all times all fire fighting equipment shall be the responsib ility of the applicable fire department the contingent fire chief will maintain an uptoda inventory of all fire fighting equipment and shall ensure that the equipment is kept in hi gh state of readiness at all times when new equipment is required requests shall be submitted to the force fire marshall for approval and purchase by the mission procurement staff fire reporting and investigation contingent fire chiefs shall submit an immediate fire report on all fire incidents at positions in which there is response by contingent fire force it is the responsibility of the position com mander to submit an immediate report it shall be forwarded to the force fire marshall by the fast est means available telephone radio followed by written copy usually within fourteen days of the incident the appropriate format should be found in the mission logistics directives or similar publication technical investigation of all fires in fixed in stallations shall be carried out by the force fire marshall and contingent fire chief the resul ts of the investigation shall be recorded and if arson or sabotage is suspected the co shall be inf ormed immediately the purpose of the technical investigation is to determine the cause f and the factors contributing to the fire and to determine the size of the loss boards of inquiry will be ordered for all major fires or where death serious injury or arson is involved fire inspections the prime purpose of fire inspections of buildings and facilities is to ensure that hazards are eliminated or controlled to the point of minimum risk to life and property and that fixtures such as exits and fire escapes ar serviceable further purpose of fire inspections is to enable fire protection personnel to relate risks and hazards involved in any particular occupancy with the design aspects of s tructure such as fire escapes and exits main electrical services extinguishing equipment and th general floor plan the force fire marshall shall inspect camps and its on an annual basis to advise cos on fire protection matters and to inspect units and fire protection services when problems arising out of these visits cannot be resolved with in the resources of the camp or unit they shall be submitted to mission hq through normal channels for resolution detailed supporting data and relevant recommendations must be provided to able evaluation lesson 4 engineering support 68 fire orders each mission and contingent within mission shal l develop comprehensive fire orders all personnel in the ssion are to be made familiar with these orders the orders are to be prominently displayed at all times 47 environmental protection as missions take place in nations that have som etimes been undergoing considerable turmoil and strife in their internal affairs envir onmental protection will have assumed low priority compared to other issues of national conce rn this does not give the mission license to ignore environmental protection the has special obligation to act responsibly towards the environment of the host nation and to s et good example responsibilities environmental regulations will differ in every mission area even to the point of there being potentially conflicting legislation between various jurisdictions in the mission area this section summarizes some current and practical information on environmental issues specifically relevant to commanders and staf fs every mission member civilian or military must conduct his or her affairs with the following themes always in mind protection of the environment is every individual s responsibility sound planning is essential to minimize damage to the environment economize on local resources and make best use of funds and the environment must be considered in the plannin g and undertaking of every activity environmental policy each mission should issue an environmental poli cy to guide the actions of its units and individuals this pol icy must be taught to mission members to ensure they are aware of the commitment of the mission to sound environmental practices environmental action plan each mission should create an environmental act ion plan in which specific measurable achievable real istic and timely targets for environmental protection measures to be undertaken are detailed responsibilities for achieving each specific target must be clearly stated and known by everyone energy and water conservation energy saving practices include such simple things as turning off unnecessary lights keeping doors cl osed to conserve heat and maintaining vehicle fleets to reduce fuel consumption water use can b reduced through such elementary methods as using flow reduction devices in bathroom and kit chen facilities natural resource management the environmental action plan should include sustainable management of all the lands occupied by the mission the plan should ensure protection of present resources mitigate against p otential environmental impacts and restore any areas already polluted or damaged in particular rare or endangered species must be identified and protected lesson 4 engineering support 69 hazardous materiel major element of the environmental action plan should be an examination of the missions hazardous materials pr ocedures every mission should have hazardous materiel management plan hazmat plan it must as minimum agree with hazmat handling regulations of the host nation personnel awareness in typical mission the number of nations repr esented by troops and civilian staff will create wide diver gence in the degree of environmental awareness amongst mission personnel any successful personne l awareness campaign will need to be pro active all personnel must share both basic envi ronmental awareness and knowledge of their individual role in environmental protection all c ommanders should ensure that relevant environmental concerns are addressed in all activit ies in the mission in all tasks personnel should be made aware of practices that will preserv the environment community relations an environmental action plan is not complete witho ut an effective community relations program which creates positive public image of the missions commitment to environmental protection cooperatio n with the hn on environmental issues makes the public aware that the is good corpor ate environmental citizen secondary benefit is that operations are likely to gain in creased acceptance once the public sees the commitment to protecting the local environment recognition and reward environmental commitment can be increased by implementing system to recognize the environmenta l achievements of units branches or individuals either informally or through an enviro nmental incentive award program way of promoting and recognizing environmental initiatives is through friendly competition between elements of the mission such as comparing results in fuel reduction programs at the very least the results of environmental programs should be wid ely publicized so that participants can see the results of their collective efforts lesson 4 engineering support 70 48 geographic support few commodities affect missions more than geogr aphic support products and services missions are often dispatched to relativ ely remote areas for which high quality geographic products are not available host nation s are often reluctant to provide the with complete range of geographic information even when it exists contributing nations sometimes have the capability to make up shortfalls for their contingents but this can cause problems of incompatibility between mission hq and contingents when different map scales or datum are used regardless of these potential difficulties adequate amounts of high quality current geographic products and services will be essential to mission success the aim of this section is to provide general guidance for the provision of ge ographic support to missions geographic products and services mission staffs must think in terms of the following representative list some or all of which would be useful to missions paper maps overlays and traces digital terrain data terrain analysis satellite imagery photo mosaics and photo mosaic maps map depot services ground survey services aeronautical charts and hydrographic charts organization the has

movement control unit mcu the headquarters of the movement control unit mcu will normally be collocated with the civilian components mcc under the gso where effective coordination can be xercised the military mcu is responsible for mission area movement of military f orces and equipment and will be expected to cater for detached movements hence t his unit is usually formed of number of detachments operating at airports seapor ts and railheads lesson 5 transportation 79 52 methods and procedures general in describing the methods and procedures of the t ransportation system it is necessary to divide them into two parts namely inter area movements and internal area movements inter area movements are all of those movements which originate or conclude outside of the missions area of operations these outside movements are commonly known as deployment sustainment rotation and redeployment internal area movements are all of those operations or movements which remain within t he missions area of operations these internal movements are commonly known as sustainmen t along with these two types of movements is the unit charged with the coordination and control of the entire transportation system the joint movement control centre jmcc and its responsibilities inter area movements inter area movements also known as strategic mov ements comprises all movements of personnel vehicles equ ipment and materiel from participating countries to and from the mission area by means of transportation by air and sealift or on the ground through transit countries by means of road railway and inlandwaterway transportation the mode of transportation depends on traffic and transportation infrastructure of the mission area as well as its accessibility by variou s means of transportation reconnaissance of all means should be made in advance of any movement s since number of carriers will be requested to submit bids national carrier of the troop contributing country will compete on an equal footing with other carriers for an award of t he contract inter area movements are subdivided into four gen eral types namely deployment this phase begins with the actual deployment of na tional contingents and personnel into the area of operations oms will coordinate all transportation into and from the theatre sustainment initially the forces deployed into the area of ope rations must bring with them enough stores until the sustainment phase s begins this period is designed to allow time for the logistic system to organiz and gradually transition to civilian and contractor support the cao is respon sible for the sustainment for the force both the civilian and military components to improve on cost effectiveness oms may authorize contributing country on the ba sis of letter of assist loa to carry out movements for other countries to coord inate their transportation efforts for their contingents in the mission area element s of the pertinent countries is prerequisite if the contingent is operating under contingent owned equipment agreement then sustainment transportation costs are included in th generic price for equipment and the distance to the mission area rotation normally contingent rotation will be every six mon ths unit rotations will be arranged by the it is the responsibility of the contingents government to inform the at least six weeks prior to the rotat ion of the exact dates they propose for the rotation and the number of troops to be rot ated each way redeployment the procedures for arranging transport are the sam as for rotation while the responsibilities and control are the same as for deployment lesson 5 transportation 80 procedures in general for inter area movements when countr has agreed to provide personnel or equipment to mission or if they are due to rotate their personnel their permanent mission pm is contacted in writing in rder to determine if they agree to the proposed dates number of personnel and equipment t be moved as established by dpko or the mission command if they so desire they may reque st to provide transportation service under loa if country requests to provide the service they must indicate what they expect as far as payment from the if the sum is deemed to be reasonable or if it could be done by contractor for lower price the would then off er to reimburse the government for the lower amount at this time the nation through its perm anent mission must decide if they are still willing to complete the movement for the reimbursab amount if not the will provide the transportation service reimbursement as general rule if required reimbursement will only be made up to the amount it would have cost the to have organi zed the move also the reserves the right to delegate by issuing loa the transporta tion request to the troop contributing nation with its concurrence or to third party movements not covered by the pertinent guidelin or even contradictory to them have to be financed organized and performed by th nations themselves these include transport to cover demands not reimbursable as well as additional national transportation efforts for the wellbeing of mission personnel such as in termediate flights to the home country for vacation or recreation purposes as well as in cases of additional dispatches of mail to the home countries exceeding the limits drawn by the mission related guidelines generally oms will organize all deployments and ro tations however the deployment may be organized by the troop contributing governme nt but in such cases arrangements must be agreed upon by oms in advance since oms is respon sible to coordinate transport into and out of the area to the home country on the completion f the tour of duty they require certain amount of time to accomplish these tasks failure to provide the required information in time may delay the movement of the contingent concerned six to seven weeks plus sailing time for sealift prior to deployment is required to allow proper implementation of the deployment government arranged transportation if the is not handling the deployment or redeployment transportation the contributing natio n must inform the of the details of its movement arrangements the costs of such arrangeme nt are to be borne by the contributing nation rotation arrangements for rotation of troops the same information above is required for the appropriate means of transportatio n except include both the air point of embarkation apoe and air point of debarkation ap od also the following general guidelines apply normal rotation will be every six months in principle the will arrange the transportat ion usually by scheduled or chartered commercial aircraft however nations may prefer to arrange rotation themselves the must be informed at least six weeks prior and usually only troops including personal weapons will be rotated lesson 5 transportation 81 the chartering of aircraft for rotating military p ersonnel of national contingents is arranged and coordinated by the oms in consultation with the relevant national authorities the mission and the contingents concerned in the field once the contract is awarded the oms mcu through the cao will inform the appropriate agencies in the mission area including the jmcc the jmcc is responsible to ensure outgoing personnel baggage and cargo are p resent at the airport at the agreed time and that transport is provided for incoming passengers their baggage and additional cargo to the destinations it is the jmcc who on behalf of the is in charge of the supervision of the rotation of the military personnel of mission and the turnaround of the aircraft according to the flight schedule immediately after the takeoff of rotation fligh t from the mission area the jmcc with general authorization from the cao notifies oms by fax or other electronic means the conclusion of the rotation is to be reported after the last flight in the rotation cycle an evaluation and commendation may be included internal area movements internal area movements also known as theatre movements are normally concerned with sustainment once the sustainment phase has begun internal sustainment pertains to the movement of pplies and equipment within the uns area of operations primarily this is concerned with th transportation movement from rear headquarters operating areas to forward unit op erating areas these movements are usually satisfied by regular scheduled runs by the clo or for incidental requests through normal transportation requesting procedures through the mc c transportation in the mission area is divided into two echelons the 1st echelon 1st line transportation comprises all transportation within contingent area and is executed by transportation ssets organic or attached to contingent or unit and controlled by the contingent or unit commander it may include scheduled transportation such as resupply runs or local shuttle runs and ad hoc transportation requirements the 2nd echelon 2nd line transportation comprises transportation for carrying troops or supplying deliveries within the rear area and forward to contingents as well as transportation for contingents and units which c annot be executed with organic assets 2nd line transportation assets are control led by the force commander these assets may be supplemented with locally hired comme rcial transportation assets or the requirement may be executed by using local tran sportation services such as rail road river barge or air lesson 5 transportation 82 2nd line transportation is coordinated and control led by movement control unit mcu both the civilian and the military componen ts of mission have mcu element attached the civilian mcu is under the chief administrativ officer cao it includes movement control cell mcc for coordinating all 2n d line transportation requirements the mcu will also operate one or mor movement control detachments mcd to control movements through airp orts seaports and railheads this will include incoming and outgoing personnel nd freight movements internal area

economic and efficient use of available resources is prime consideration in the planning and executing of transportation operations the mcc s of the civilian and the military component will be collocated and operate as single joint mc c jmcc the mcus have organic 2nd line transportation ssets they therefore have to coordinate with the chief transport officer cto or in the military organization with the clo for transportation units under his control or the chief operations officer coo for units under his control dualrole units like aviation units will normally be controlled by

components are to be submitted by the jmcc directl to the cpo for approval and eventual contracting 53 tasks and responsibilities the movement control unit mcu is responsible for organizing and executing the movement control function within the mission area the joint movement control centre jmcc is tasked with coordinating all 2nd line transportation requirements within the mission area it has control over all 2nd line transport assets made available to the mission as far as litary assets are concerned the control function is however limited to those assets not required r allocated by force hq for other duties the coo and clo are empowered to set priorities in case of conflicting requirements the jmcc is formed by the movement control centre mcc of the civilian component branch of

maintenance concept and system and provide the student with some of the specifics of maintenance operations policies and programs like vehicle inspections condemnation salvage and contracted services will also be explored by the end of lesson 7 the student should be able to meet the following objectives understand the basic maintenance concepts and lines of support be familiar with basic mission maintenance organiza tions their roles and responsibilities identify common maintenance services and who provid those services and understand the difference in maintenance support fo r contingents providing their own equipment under contribution mou lesson 7 maintenance 101 71 maintenance doctrine while the specific maintenance system will be tail ored for each mission an overview of general principles and general concept of main tenance is offered as guidance maintenance concept the maintenance system is organized into number f lines of support progressively better equipped and more com prehensive able to undertake increasing depth of repair as measured by time and complexity repair equipment and assemblies are moved through this sy stem in number of repair loops which extend from unit level to facilities in theatre recovery normally recovery is aligned with lines of repair s upport but recovery resources can be used to move equipment in any dire ction in addition to the pure extrication function control of recovery is therefore retaine d at formation and force level spares timely availability of spares is critical to the maintenance plan and the management of technical spares impinges at every vel of maintenance activity where the flow of spares is interrupted or delayed reclamation c annibalization and salvage can play part but because these activities can have long term effects on equipment status they require careful consideration before institution and strict control once enacted lines of support equipment maintenance will be performed at the low est level consistent with availability of parts tools facil ities skills and time onsite repairs should be exploited to the maximum unserviceable materiel w hich is beyond the maintenance capability of an organization will be reported and delivered t the next higher maintenance organization unserviceable equipment will be evaluated for repai r at the lowest capable level this can be achieved by number of lines of support each prog ressively better equipped and more comprehensive but with the implication of being ss easy to move and requiring engineering stability to be efficient within such system t he repair priority of unserviceable equipment will be accomplished in accordance with the policy set out by the force commander lines of support are detailed as follows first line the unit maintenance organization responsible for the daily maintenance of equipment first line maintenance organizations may also undertake second line maintenance first line support is provided by sup port integral to unit operating within the parent unit organization but under the t echnical control of the mission maintenance organization second line the maintenance organization responsible for provi ding support to specified first line units and organizations seco nd line organizations may also undertake some third line maintenance second line support is normally provided by an independent workshop or repair facility at force or formation level third line the maintenance organization other than first and second line repair units these organizations although able to under take all depths of maintenance normally undertake third line only static third line organizations may include local national or international industrial facilit ies providing support to the mission under contract lesson 7 maintenance 102 72 maintenance systems an outline framework for maintenance in the text is shown below this shows the relationship between the lines of support and t he maintenance organization equipment and assemblies are moved through the syst em in series of repair loops which extend from unit level to facilities both in and out of th eatre at each line of support an increasing depth of repair is carried out the illustrated co ncept does not attempt to be either complete or prescriptive but illustrates the general way in wh ich the principles of maintenance can be implemented in mission it is applicable to ll levels of missions relevant to whichever logistic support concept may be adopted and adaptab to all types of equipment within the mission the integrity of the maintenance concept must be observed if efficient and effective support is to be provided deployed unit unit maintenance cell flsg maintenance companycontingent workshop mission workshop industry

of repair support within balance of immediacy importance deployment and location t he recovery system is linked to the lines of repair support recovery plans are made and recove ry operations controlled at force level functional control the command and control of maintenance in the mission area is exercised by the cao and the clo the bulk of m aintenance in most missions is managed by military logistic staff the integrated nature of maintenance activities and facilities in particula r the need to effectively and efficiently orchestrate the maintenance effort make it necessary for lesson 7 maintenance 103 there to be clear functional control of the main tenance system this embraces the authority of the maintenance staff acting on behalf of the forc commander to direct the method of operation and manner of employment of the service u nits in order to achieve the common policy objective thus the c maint in the mission will control policy priorities methods equipment

participating states may be asked to perform log istic reconnaissance this will refine national maintenance requirements and c ontribute to the development of the guidelines to troop contributing countries prior to deployment into the mission area it will also aid in establishing the time for which each co ntributing state will be required to be self supporting and when local or international contract s for maintenance support of the mission will take place lesson 7 maintenance 104 the following maintenance support parameters will be adhered to by the contributing states units are to deploy with integral first line and where appropr iate for specialist equipment second line repair and recovery support dpko may ask one or more troop contributing states to establish second line and

scaling and reimbursement ar covered elsewhere deployment phase this phase begins with the actual deployment of national contingents and personnel including second line maintenance workshops by the designated contributing nations arrival inspection serviceability inspections will be conducted for when equipment arrives in the mission area to satisfy contribution agreement or contractual requirements equipment that is not serviceable must be repaired by the contributing country or contractor unserviceablity as result of transportation problems may be ef fected by the if it was responsible for transporting the equipment sustainment phase initially larger missions will rely heavily on military ba sed maintenance support upon deployment and then gradually make transition to civilian and contractor support when it is acceptable and cost effective to do s small missions not requiring military maintenance support will generally be depende nt upon civilian or contract support commencing from the time of arrival in the mission area the sustainment phase begins as soon as these civilian or contractual arrangements are put i n place the purpose of these arrangements is to sustain the mission for the period of the ma ndate however the continued involvement of the military maintenance structure will be required during this phase depending on the specific mandate and feasibility to implement civilian and contrac tor support operational inspection periodically operational inspection will be conducted during the mission to ensure that contingents are meeting the standards s et forth in the contribution mou scheduling and notification will be provided to contingents as direct ed by the cao redeployment phase prior to the completion of the mandate redeployment

details of the inspection are to be included in contingent redeployment plans 74 planning guidelines and responsibilities maintenance guidelines in the mission area there must be all the facilit ies necessary for the maintenance of all vehicles and technical quipment excluding aircraft with which the units are equipped repair techniques and maintena nce methods must be available to meet this task even if they are concentrated in single wor kshop the maintenance activities can be executed depending on the depth of repair at first line workshop daily maintenance short distance between unit and workshop is important but must be balanced with s uitable workshop location second or third line workshop to achieve the target of an availability of 85 or more it is of critical importance to start the mai ntenance as soon as possible but also as economically as possible this could result in centralization of maintenance for specific equipment but with corresponding increase s in repair time third line workshop if the materiel is beyond the repair capacity or ca pability of the maintenance facilities within the mission it m ust be decided whether the materiel is to be condemned evacuated to the providing coun try or whether it should be sent to contractor or industry normally maintenance should be executed in those w orkshops in which all the required engineering resources are available planning responsibilities for maintenance chief maintenance officer the chief maintenance officer is responsible for determining which maintenance facilities are requ ired determining

by unit or maintenance organization for the repair of equipment which is b eyond their own capability the equipment covered by this procedure excludes infrastructure accommodation and utilities request procedure the repair request is normally submitted to the n ext line of support within the maintenance organization in ex ceptional cases the request may be submitted to the maintenance cell responsible for t he command and control of the maintenance organization the request may be made in writing by combat net radio or area communications by telephone or fax response to repair request the maintenance organizations response will be to dispatch repair team dispatch recovery call the equipment into the designated workshop and arrange for local contract services the owning unit is responsible for the condition f equipment prepared for repair such as removal of loose items cleanliness for miscellaneous equipment the owning unit is to ensure that damage is caused in transit suitable packaging is to be used and the item should be securely labelled for identification purposes lesson 7 maintenance 108 77 recovery request responsibility it is primarily unit responsibility to recover or to lift its own vehicles and equipment if the recovery is beyond unit capa city the c maint will allocate second line recovery responsibilities normally by area normally the recovery is performed to the continge nt location where the vehicle can be repaired if recovery has to be carried out to t emporary location the owner unit will arrange further recovery or evacuation to unit

authority to remove it from contingent and mission inventories this p olicy applies to contribution mous as contingents are not permitted to unilaterally dispo of equipment in theatre however some of the common policy will not apply as replacement is the responsibility of the contributing country and not the exceptions procedures suc h battle damage should be clarified with the mission headquarters on arrival in the mission area the condemnation process provides the technical as sessment to enable the mission property survey board to direct the deletion and di sposal of equipment from property records the process does not apply to the disposition of st equipment or materiel which is to be processed in accordance with chapter 2 of the opera tional support manual lesson 7 maintenance 111 the high cost of vehicles and technical equipment require that every effort be made to derive the maximum use from equipment prior to disp osal action equipment and vehicles will not be considered for condemnation provided that th ey are still essential still meet the operational requirement and can be economically ma intained in the case of vehicles condemnation and disposal action is based upon age and mileage criteria for various categories of vehicles which w ill be determined for each mission vehicles will not automatically be proposed for condemnation action by reason of reaching the established age and mileage criteria in many cases the servic life of vehicles may be extended beyond their scheduled replacement date provided that they are in good condition and that they can be economically maintained the decision to retain ve hicles in use beyond their scheduled replacement dates will be made by the chief transpo rt officer cto the c maint will on behalf of the mission hq process all condemnation of vehicles technical equipment assemblies and spare parts maintained and budgeted for by the c maint in accordance with the procedures outlined the initiation of condemnation action is the respo nsibility of the maintenance organization at the appropriate line of support in conjunction with the owning unit technical authorities for condemnation all proposals for condemnation action must be supported by technical assessment and recommen dation from the c maint who has responsibility for the maintenance of vehicles and equipment in the mission

supply unit for salvage or disposal as necessary r emove it from the unit inventory and demand if applicable replacement item through normal ch annels cannibalization salvage and reclamation salvage and reclamation policy where the flow of spare parts is interrupted or delayed the removal of useable spare parts or cannibalization to overcome the shortage is both tempting and common practice such process has part to play in the overall maintenan ce effort but because this activity can have long term effects on equipment status it requires c areful consideration before institution and strict control once enacted the salvage of spare parts from vehicles or equipm ent that have been condemned is useful source of resources again this activity ne eds to be closely controlled clearly there can

familiar with basic mission medical organizat ions their roles and responsibilities and identify common medical services and who provide s those services lesson 8 medical 119 81 introduction operations are complicated by number of pecul iar characteristics which impact fundamentally upon the provision of medical support medical support plans must be purpose built for each operation meet the demands of geogr aphic individual national needs different national medical standards language and communicat ion difficulties plans must be capable of speedy initial reaction and flexible enough to mana ge rapidly changing operational demands medical support planning and management of opera tional medical support must be acceptable to hq and to participating nations as well 82 operational medical support precepts and pri nciples while the general logistic support precepts apply equally to medical support medical staffs face unique problems affecting the health of personnel deployed on operations the overall objective of medical support is the conserv ation of manpower preservation of life and the limitation of residual physical and mental disa bilities operational medical support therefore requires clearly defined and distinctive guidance medical precepts medical support will comply with the following precepts international conventions for the treatment of th sick and wounded medical support for operations will comply with rules id down under the geneva conventions in circumstances where the provisions of the conventions are not directly applicable the standards set out therein will be the minimum acceptable level of treatment entitlement to medical care all persons entitl ed under the terms of the geneva conventions shall without discrimination receive medical treatment on the basis of their clinical needs and the availability of medica l resources standards of medical support operational medica l support to forces must meet standards that are acceptable to all participating nations the aim must be to provide standard of medical care as close as possible to prevailing peacetime medical criteria maintenance of health and the prevention of disea medical support plans must include detailed measures for the prevention and co ntrol of disease and nonbattle injury to deployed forces establishment of medical risk medical resources must watch the assessed risk to the deployed forces from disease nonbattle and c ombat injury the estimation of risk and production of predicted casualty rates is the responsibility of operational staffs capability of medical support the medical capab ility deployed in support of forces must be in balance with the force strength nd the exposure to risk of disease nonbattle and combat injury medical resources mu st be capable from the outset of lesson 8 medical 120 an operation of meeting the demands of predicted c asualty rates and be designed to expand progressively as force strength and risk inc rease readiness availability and flexibility medical resources and staff must be at least at the same state of readiness and availability as the forces they are to support they must also have the flexibility to meet the demands of evolving operation scenarios levels of medical care the four fundamental lev els of medical care must be available to all forces organized on progress ive basis first aid resuscitation and stabilization of vital functions life and limb saving surgery including postoperat ive care definitive treatment and rehabilitation provision of life and limb saving surgery moder n medical protocols are predicated on the need to provide immediate advance d trauma life support to stabilize patient prior to transportation and to provide life and limb saving surgery as soon as possible normally longer than six ho urs after injury continuity of care patients moving through the levels of medical care must be given treatment which is continuous relevant and progres sive when number of casualties occur simultaneously they must be manag ed using the standard criteria for triage in order of priority according to the urgen cy of clinical need for treatment interdependence of evacuation and treatment the size and capability of medical treatment assets at intermediate levels will be det ermined by the operational environment length of evacuation routes type and availability of evacuation assets means of evacuation and intransit care the mea ns of evacuation must be compatible with the need to sustain the patient dur ing the journey intransit care must be available throughout evacuation fitness for evacuation clinical condition will be the key criterion in determining the timing and means of evacuation medical support principles nations retain ultimate accountability for the hea lth of their forces but on the assumption of authority t he force commander will share the responsibility for the health of assigned forces to meet this requirement the force commander needs appropriate medical staff they shall plan nd execute the medical support plan in accordance with the precepts laid down in the prece ding paragraphs and the following policies medical health standards in order to qualify fo r resource medical treatment evacuation and where applicable compensation for p ersonal disability national contingents and individuals allocated or contracted to operations must achieve the basic standards of individual health and physical f itness laid down by the medical policy staffs prior to deployment contingency planning planning for medical suppo rt must be part of contingency planning planning staff cells must include approp riate numbers of experienced lesson 8 medical 121 medical staff to undertake medical support planning supported by an operational medical information system provision of resources resources may be dischar ged in number of ways including agreements with other nations or the appr opriate planning staffs and force commanders or through contingent resources w hen troops are provided statement of requirement medical support requir ements are to be determined by the appropriate force commander in consultation with contributing nations and medical planning staff medical resources will be specified as those necessary to prevent and control disease and to collect evacuat and treat

planning staffs will generally be level 1 national responsibility level 2 responsibility level 3 responsibility level 4 national responsibility evacuation evacuation resources will be provide d appropriate to particular operation overall evacuation policy both intrat heatre and intertheatre will be established by medical planning staffs in concer t with the operational logistics staffs and contributing nations national structures national medical systems of care and evacuation should be retained as much as possible however medical plan ners must seek to take advantage of economies of scale which may be achieved from mu ltinational concepts such as lead nation responsibilities role specialization nd mutual assistance treatment of entitled personnel from the out set of an operation hq establishes policy regarding the entitlement of u n nonmilitary staffs and other authorized personnel in theatre and for all medical treatment other than emergency measures medical liaison medical planning staffs are to ensure that methods are established to provide regular and efficient liaison between na tional contingents and theatre medical resources particularly the monitoring of i npatients at levels 2 3 and 4 and for all intratheatre and intertheatre evacuation definitive treatment provision of definitive tr eatment so far as level 4 treatment is requested is national responsibility and will ge nerally be undertaken outside the theatre of operations medical materiel rates and standards national m edical support contingents must deploy into theatre with standard quantity of med ical materiel as lay down by medical planners this will be based upon estimate d consumption at predicted casualty rates nations must use medical materiel which meets internationally recognized quality standards for the treatment of n onnational patients lesson 8 medical 122 resupply policy policy and planning for the re supply of medical materiel is medical matter and is interrelated directly with p atient treatment medical planning staff must aim to achieve as much standardization s possible and establish an effective means of auditing usage and repayment 83 medical support concept medical operational support must react rapidly and with flexibility this concept must not be considered template but should act as b asis for planning and as means of obtaining coherent medical support structure which can be ap plied by all contributing countries medical planning responsibilities the task of planning executing and controlling operational medical support is complex and needs sp ecific expertise it must be delegated to medically trained planning staff who must have an stablished organization of sufficient experienced manpower communications and informatio n technology medical staffs in all headquarters do not operate in isolation there is very close interface with the personnel operational and logistics staffs to provide the ope rational basis for and to resource and support medical plans medical resources and capabilities the resources and capabilities required to meet the demands of the medical tasks can be fully descr ibed as seven functional elements demonstrated in this diagram lesson 8 medical 123 figure 81 command control communications and information dedicated and structured medical c3i organization is the essential foundatio n of an efficient medical support concept it begins before the operation is launched and will in ter alia crucially depend on good reconnaissance information accurate timely medical information system inte

clearly established lines of accountability and control clearly understood policy directives and orders issued promptly liaison at every level including host nation supp ort hns and any nongovernmental organization ngo in theatre prompt and comprehensive afteraction analysis of operational medical data to provide basis for future planning treatment evacuation personnel material blood medical support parthenon preventative medicine lesson 8 medical 124 preventive medicine in the majority of operations the most likely risk to personnel will be from disease and nonbattle injur medical support plans therefore must include provision for preventive medical measures nd the means to implement them effectively identifying the risks and threats to the health f all personnel deployed in specific theatre of operations from terrain clima endemic disease and special environmental and occupation hazards identifying necessary preventive and controlling measures and advising commanders on their implementation including the production f theatre policy on vaccination and prophylactics measures and the appropriate trai ning of all personnel auditing and in some cases training and supervisi on of implemented measures this will include gathering of epidemiological and other technical statistics and information advising commanders on the overall risks and thre ats and the limitations they may place on the operational plan including estimating the rates of disease and nonbattle injury that may result treatment the key in medical care is to achieve balance bet ween medical capability at each level and the ability to evacuate between t hem evacuation and treatment are integrally linked and should not be planned in isolation med ical treatment at every level must be of standard acceptable to all national contingents and employees overresourcing or duplicating medical effort must be avoided level 1 level 1 medical support includes triage and immediate life saving measures and fir st aid implementation of disease nonbattle injury and combat stress preventive measures casualty collection routine sick calls and the management of the mino r sick and injured and patient reporting level 2 level 2 medical support is normally provided at for mation level including evacuation from level 1 triage resuscitation and stabilization of the riously injured sustaining treatment of those sick and injured re quiring further evacuation management of those minor sick and injured who ca n quickly rtd provision of additional support and reinforcement to level 1 organizations as necessary and centralization of medical resources as appropriat these might include dental support hygiene support and medical resupply level 3 level 3 medical support is normally provided at fo rmation level and will be missiondependant it will usually be deployed in support of operations where relatively large numbers of personnel are involved and where host nation support hns resources are inadequate or inappropriate to meet t he medical requirement lesson 8 medical 125 responsibility for the provision of level 3 support lies with medical planning staff who may utilize hns hospitals national and interna tional or lead nation facilities including hospital ships nongovernmental organiza tion ngo hospitals or combination of all these the key medical precept which dictates the locatio n capability and numbers of level 3 units is the need to ensure that casualty receiv life and limb saving surgery as soon as possible normally longer than six hours afte r injury principal level 3 roles are evacuation from levels 1 and 2 triage resuscitation and stabilization of the riously injured prior to further evacuation life and limb saving surgery of the injured who c

include diagnostic resources specialist surgical nd medical capability dentistry stress reaction management and preventive medicine level 4 in the context of operations level 4 resource s provide definitive care of the injured and sick this embraces specialist surgica l and medical procedures reconstruction rehabilitation and convalescence level 4 treatment is usually highly specialized ex pensive time consuming and of limited availability it is therefore normally provided na tionally in the country of origin inter theatre transfer is normally arranged by the and for reasons of financial compensation and pension retains civilian admi nistrative interest until care is complete medical planning staff will organize level 4 where distance from theatre of operations to coun try of origin is excessive when patient requires only shortterm specialist treatment and is expected to rtd rapidly contributing nations are unable to provide approp riate definitive treatment receives appropriate offer to provide definiti ve care from specific nation and patient is nonun personnel and acceptable l evel 4 treatment facility exists this is particularly important for the definitive c are of detainees prisoners of war and refugees personnel the spectrum of personnel issues which impact upon or are generated by the medical support function is extremely wide they merge during the initial planning stages and continue long after an operation is finished cons equently the working relationship between medical and personnel staffs must be well developed and relevant personnel concerns detailed in lesson 8 medical 126 medical plans the following paragraphs outline th ose issues which impact most obviously on the overall medical concept of operations medical manpower the size shape and capability of medical organizations are dictated by the numbers and quality of individual p ersonnel legal legal issues will concern both internatio nal and national law medical information management the efficient ma nagement of medical information particularly regarding patients is vital element of competent medical support planning this information must be standar dized and distributed rapidly to all who need it without violating medical professio nal confidentially financial financial issues will impact on the size and scope of medical resources available terms of service particularly pay allowances pen sions etc maintenance costs particularly the provision of dical materiel resupply and evacuation and final costs particularly disability pensions and c ompensation for injury welfare and spiritual the general welfare of pa tients is an important element of medical care and therefore supports planning part icular issues will be personal mail contacting relatives management of personal effect s and most importantly spiritual welfare the latter could be complex problem in multinational operation religious and cultural customs may impact upon all aspects of medical care for example diet and feeding of patients evacuation the organization of treatment resources required i n theatre will be determined by evacuation capability the more prob lematic evacuation is between levels of care the greater the treatment capability required at each key determinants in establishing comprehensive and capable medical evacuation system are theatre evacuation policy from the outset of an operation theatre evacuation policy must be established by the operational and m edical planning staff working in concert with the force commander fc and cmedo t his policy will dictate the maximum length of time normally expressed in days patient may be held at particular level of care this in turn dictates th treatment capability required at each level and the supporting evacuation system necessar both intratheatre and inter theatre fitness for evacuation despite the discipline f an evacuation policy the clinical condition of patient will be the key criterion wh determining the timing and means of evacuation between levels time to life and limb saving surgery evacuation must enable the stabilized patient to reach life and limb saving surgery as fast as po ssible and longer than six hours after injury lesson 8 medical 127 materiel an efficient wellregulated and costeffective med ical materiel logistics system is fundamental to medical support the c haracteristics of medical materiel set it apart from other commodities and produce unique req uirements medical stores are afforded protected status unde r the terms of the geneva conventions it is necessary to store and distribu medical materiel separately for it to be considered protected the complex interdependence between treatment cap ability and the availability of medical materiel gives medical logistics key role in patient care management it must be able to respond rapidly to urgent clinical demands the highly technical nature of medical stores and their extensive national and international regulations require tight controls nd highly specialized management the complexity of multinational operations gen erates number of peculiar medical logistic difficulties which arise principal ly from lack of commonality and often compatibility of national medical materiel particularly drugs and consumables disparity between national clinical treatment regim and lack of an established standardized and coherent r esupply and accounting system medical logistics system will be mission depen dant and the resources designed to meet the needs it must however have the foll owing capabilities enable national contingents to be selfsufficient for the majority of commodities from deployment and from period of time specified by planning staff enable those elements providing centralized suppo rt such as hospitals to be self sufficient in the majority of commodities for the t ime specified by planning staff provide the user with straightforward and guar anteed demand system provide theatrewide supply system capable of delivering rapidly establish resupply system equal to supply provide an audit system which is costeffective straightforward and does not constrain demand or supply and supply of medical materiel to the theatre of oper ations will be established and coordinated by medical planning staff the blishment of intheatre demand and distribution systems will be the responsibility of the cmedo blood the supply of blood and blood products to multinat ional operations is complex and sensitive issue stemming from the wide dispari ty of standards between nations and the legal constraints incumbent upon some consequently it is considered as separate function from general medical logistics the availability of blo od and blood products is essential for the management of the seriously injured and sick for the majority of operations this will require its provisioning at level 3 lesson 8 medical 128 the minimum capability for an intheatre system mu st be receiving liquid blood and blood components of standard acceptable to all participating national contingents and individuals moving storing and distributing blood and blood components in accordance with accepted international standards collecting processing and testing blood on an as needed or an emergency basis and all blood and blood products used in theatre must comply with internationally agreed standards where particular nation cannot accept set standards they must organize their own system of supply at national ex pense 84 medical support planning process the disparate nature of operations dictate that medical support plan be purpose built for each operation and that rarely will two p lans be identical although every plan will differ there must be standard planning process w hich is progressive comprehensive and understood at every level the characteristics of contingencies make it sential that outline planning is done rapidly often with limited information and rarely with the benefit of reconnaissance this planning may produce more than an operational timate however it must be sufficiently comprehensive and accurate to allow for reasonabl estimate of resources and particularly funding mission analysis the first and most essential step in the medicine planning process is to have clear understanding of the medical missio n the key issues in initial planning will be the need to access all available medical intelligen ce on the theatre of operations and deploy properly briefed and competent medical representative on rec onnaissance medical intelligence medical planning information must be comprehensiv rapidly available accurate and most importantly up to dat ideally from single source data base to provide information on geographic factors effects of climate and topog raphy on general health endemic diseases types prevalence current pro phylactics measures resistant strains treatment etc special environmental and occupational hazards chemicalbiological warfare capabilities of protagonists radiation hazards ro ad movement hazards pollution etc medical resources available in the theatre of ope rations hns transport for ambulances air land and maritime treatment capa bility and standards at every level of care lesson 8 medical 129 hns capability the availability of medical resources in the theat re of operations is key issue in determining the size and capability of the medical organization the must establish the more hns available for use the less has to be found from contributing nations overall hns capability is assessed by m ixture of medical information analysis and reconnaissance particularly of standards of medica l care available compared to and national contingent criteria resources required will inclu transport for ambulances air land and maritime for both intratheatre and inter theatre evacuation treatment capability at every level of care but particularly at level 3 medical logistics support including the provisio n of drugs and consumables and essential nonmedical logistic support including buildings water power disposal of waste communications laundry labor and other sou rces alliance capability in planning medical support to the standards of c ontributing nations every effort must be made to achieve econo mies of scale and effort maximum effort must be made to tailor medical support to the predi cted demand some contingents may have an abundance of assets whilst others may lack all but the fundamentals medical planners must aim to find balance of capabilities often the m ost costeffective means will be to organize for one nation to provide particular function for all contingents for example air medevac policies two key policy issues are prophylactics policy this policy must be issued as early as possible i ncluding vaccinations that must be taken by all individuals deploying into the theatre of operations instructions will cover measures to be taken prior to deployment those to continue in theatre and post operations evacuation policy theatre evacuation policy known in some nations as holding policy is the key to balancing the treatment capab ility available at each level of care against the medical evacuation assets required th is is achieved stating the maximum period in days patient may be held for medical treatment at each level of care if patient cannot return to duty within the specified time they must be evacuated as soon as possible medical operational concept at later stage in the planning process the medic concept of operations should be refined particular ly by input from the reconnaissance it should now be clear how the medical staff intend to undert ake the mission the next stage is to decide on resources medical operational concepts have to follow all fa ctors of influence using the data accumulated from mission analysis reconnaissance nd policy decisions each of the seven functional areas of the medical parthenon should be examined permanently to decide the size and capability required of each function all facto rs will however influence and be influenced by medical operational support planning therefore constant auditing and permanent medical information is essential lesson 8 medical 130 85 medical support policies and procedures this section provides the policies and procedures which will lay out the interworking relationships between headquarter in new york t he force commander fc the chief medical officer cmedo and the senior medical offi cers smedos as clinical heads of their respective organizations command control communications and information c 3i within the c3i foundation are interrelationships and responsibilit ies which are important for all participants to understand capability the medical c3i organization must be capable of planning executing controlling supporting and auditing the full range of medical support functions it must be capable of providing seamless system of c ontrol of treatment evacuation and passage of information from initial point of in jury or sickness throughout evacuation to definitive treatment organization medical c3i must be so organized t hat each level of operational command has senior medical officer directly acco untable to the operational commander the cmedos must have the full range of equipment support for their task including transport communications and information technolog responsibilities medical director medical advisor dpko chief dical officers and senior medical officers must work closely toget her to guarantee continuously sufficient medical support in theatre medical c3i requirements although in field missions contributing countrie s may always have final approval the cmedo must have t he necessary authority to implement audit and communicate medical policies with each of the f orce contingents the cmedo is the head of the medical unit in missi on hq and the medical advisor to the fc the cmedo therefore must have direct acces s to the force commander it is recommended that the cmedo should be selected from the national contingent providing the majority of medical forces cmedo should not be chief of any other medical unit simultaneously to ensure an uninterrupted chain of responsibility in medical matters between the cmedo and national contingents each national conti ngent with medical forces must have one designated chief medical representative as the seni or medical officer smedo this individual has the clinical responsibility for all national dical matters and must be physician regular medical reports regular medical reports statistical reporting an d patient status reporting are an important element of medica l support in operations to advise the fc the cmedo needs information about organizations utilization of medical units participating and of the health status of all personnel lesson 8 medical 131 other medical reports specific incidents that have resulted in or are l ikely to result in significant casualties or other incidents of medical nature which are likely to attract higher staff public political or media attention such s assassination mass casualties infectious disease outbreak food poisoning etc have to be reported immediately as medical flash reports medical communications the success of medical support will rely heavily n effective communications compatible communication s must be established between all medical elements to support rapid decisions such as medical evacuations and search and rescue medical personnel must be able to speak the requested language fluently interpreters though are an essential part of the medical providers team for c ommunication with foreign patients as well as between contingents of different nationalities there must be dedicated medical communications n etwork established including medical response element cmedo is responsible to coordinate for an emergency medical frequency with the communications network administr ators and the air service administrators cmedo doacao and c air ops must coordinate actio n to ensure dedicated air medevac each nation has mandatory right to liaison with their national personnel when in foreign medical facility but they do not have the r ight to medical supervision of the facilities medical personnel preventive medicine preventive medicine transcends each of the five med ical pillars of medical support discussed above it includes matte rs dealing with vaccinations and immunization as well as hygiene including inspecti on control and advice on water and food kitchen operations camp facilities garbage and wa ste disposal sewage control as well as action against insects vermin rodents and stray animals the medical threat must be fully evaluated prior to during and following the operation preventive health measures involve every individua l in the operational theatre who must be aware of necessary personal protective measures and trained accordingly the organization to undertake them must therefore be in place from the outset and must extend from hq down to the unit and below its shape and size will be mission dependant but will include at least individual advisors at every level of operational c ommand it is national responsibility at national expense to ensure personnel are prepared and appropriately trained in field preventive medicine measures prior to deployment to operation this must include the necessary vaccina tion and immunization although the country contributing forces to mission ultimately must decide what vaccines should be given to its personnel because the immune status of individuals varies from one country to another failure to follow recommended policies on chemoprophylax is and immunizations could result in denial of medical claims and compensation lesson 8 medical 132 once personnel are under command the has res ponsibility for immunization and chemoprophylaxis sustainment cmedo will adjust gu idance as necessary during the conduct of an operation it is national responsibility to maintain interna tional standards in regards to the provisioning of food and water as well as the stand ards for sanitation epidemiology and entomology cmedo will inspect and audit national measures to ensure international standards are maintained in these areas education of prevention of medical diseases typical for the deployment area is national responsibility each participant must have basi c training in measures to aid in the control of diseases and in the prevention of sexually transmit ted diseases and hivaids in theatre food and water acquisition and handling is responsibility of the chief logistics officer the cmedo will ensure medical xpertise available to support the supply personnel in the acquisition and handling of foods medical waste will be disposed of only in accordanc with recognized international standards although disposal of medical waste is t he responsibility of administration cmedoforce hygiene officers have to provide the ne cessary advice in methods and standards treatment medical treatment of personnel is evidently one of the most important issues for the success of every mission and is usually defined as treatment at certain levels providers at each level must be capable and able to provide the medical care as described there certain medical principals applying to each level f medical care are listed below common nations offering forces to operations must dep loy the medical support that is integral to those formations medical units deploying to mission area must ca rry an estimated initial medical supply including consumables for treatment during the first three months national contingents must have nominated medic ally trained individual to be the senior medical officer smedo responsible to the force chief medical officer cmedo for the implementation of force medical policy medical resources should be centralized as approp riate these might include dental support hygiene support and medical resupply each level of care must maintain patient tracki ng and audit system and report to cmedo all medical treatment facilities must be able to provide medical care for civilian personnel as well as military observers u n civilian police and locally hired personnel military medical personnel therefore must be familiar with the treatment for civilians women and children as well all medical personnel and medical facilities with the potential of providing care to females will be appropriately staffed trained and equipped to provide adequate medical care dental support during operations normally will be planned for emergency and pain support therapy only lesson 8 medical 133 the capability to provide for psychiatric and str ess control crisis intervention should be included at the minimum at level 3 facilities i n each operation each level of care must have sufficient laborator equipment however laboratory work up to level 2 should be limited to routine wor k such as complete blood count urinalysis and gram stains wherever the possibility and capability for blood transfusions are intended there must be the capability for pretransfusion crossmatchin g all patients must be in stabilized condition pr ior to evacuation to other or between levels of care the decision for suitability for t ransfer is clinical decision and it and the arrangements for transfer will be the responsib ility of the holding nation levels of care may be skipped if necessary and if the pati ent is stabilized to withstand the transport level 1 level 1 treatment is national responsibility national contingents should deploy their own integral level 1 medical support national contingents of battalion size must be xpected to deploy with the minimum of one medical officer with supporting medical sta ff medical stocks as laid down by the medical planning staff and to be selfsufficien t in transport for unit evacuation medical capabilities and standards at level 1 wil l vary considerably depending upon mission and national resources the minimum accept able standard in addition to the capacities and capabilities is every individual to be capable of undertaking basic first aid medical personnel must be able to treat patients for minor injuries and diseases and hold patients pending medical evacuation they mus t be able to provide emergency medical care and to convey the casualty directly to the next level of care as necessary this care must include beginning of intravenous flu ids control of haemorrhage application of field dressings administration of nalgesics and establishment of an airway providers care must be as mobile as the forces th ey are supporting and they must be capable and able to provide the care prescribed at that level minor units numerically in numbers should be pported by neighbouring units with medical capability time and distance from point of injury to initial required surgery will be six hours or less level 2 whether level 2 medical care will be with natio n or will be organized by planning staffs is mission dependant national tingent forces should deploy with their integral medical and evacuation assets deployed in support of operations level 2 med ical organizations will be task organized at minimum they must be capable of evacuation from and support to level 1 triage resuscitation and stabilization of the seri ously injured prior to evacuation lesson 8 medical 134 diagnosis treatment and holding of minor sick and injured for the minimum time frame laid down by the cmedo usually 15 days maintaining records on and reporting the treatment and evacuation of the sick and injured to cmedo provision of additional support and reinforcement t level 1 organizations as necessary dependent upon mission level 2 organizations might also require the capability to provide emergency dental treatment implementation and monitoring of hygiene and preven tive medicine measures including the management of combat stress reaction medical resupply to formation level 1 organization s level 2 capability on an exceptional basis may be enhanced to provide life and limb saving surgery and postoperative management this will require the addition of field surgical resources together with diagnostic nd nursing support level

involved and where h ost nation support hns resources are inadequate or inappropriate to meet t he medical mission responsibility for the provision of level 3 support lies with m edical planning staff who may utilize hns hospitals national or lead nation faci lities including hospital ships nongovernmental organization ngo hospitals or combination of these this level provides medical care in facility st affed and equipped to provide resuscitation initial wound surgery and postoperat ive care these facilities may provide additional surgical support additional lab oratory and radiological support this is the first level of actual hospitalization physiological monitoring devices and techniques m ust be available and employed equipment and appropriately trained personnel must be available at these levels to monitor and assess patient conditions at medical facilities dietary requirements must be planned with special consideration to cultural or religious factors of those being fed special requirements for acquisition will be coordinated with the force chie f logistics officer whichever resource or combination of resources is provided level 3 medical support must be capable at minimum of evacuation from levels 1 and 2 triage resuscitation and stabilization for further evacuation of the seriously injured and sick life and limb saving surgery for those who could t tolerate further evacuation without immediate treatment or for whom further evacuation would be problematic or inappropriate diagnosis treatment and holding of those injured nd sick who can expect to rtd

medicine measures including the managem ent of stress reaction level 4 level 4 provides medical care in facility staff ed and equipped for full definitive care which includes followup surgery and other rehabili tative therapy for patients in the recovery phase care is normally provided in facilities outside t he theatre of operations ie outside the regional area that is directly supporting the termed in theatre mission however level 4 care can be provided within the pporting region when it is likely the individual patient will return to duty documentation documentation is integral to medical care and an i mportant part throughout the various levels of medical care cha rting of provided care is mandatory requirement and provides trail for any subsequent medical claims that may arise cmedo is responsible to ensure that all medical do cuments pertaining to medical care of the nonmilitary personnel of operation are pr ovided in timely manner as prescribed by hq at each level must be an adequate documentation of all treatment measures documentation must begin at the initial point of injury or illnes s all personnel must have in their possession at all times an international certificate of vaccination showing all vaccinations and immunizati ons received they should also obtain an authoritative record of blood type and rh factor all personnel participating in operation are required to have copies of their relevant healt h records with them at their supporting medical care facility when their mission is over personnel are to ta ke their own health records with them and turn them over to their new supporting medical facility whenever patient leaves the mission area permanently his medical records shoul d be given to him in sealed envelope addressed to the physician who will be responsible for the patients future treatment in the case where medical unit leaves the missio n all medical records should be handed over to the replacing unit unless patient expres ses otherwise medical services to non personnel medical services to personnel outside the mandated mission is matter of some delicacy wher legal commitments must be weighed against humanitarian principles it must be planne d carefully and fully coordinated in concert with the various nongovernmental organizations tha t are present the official policy is that force has obligation to give or to take re sponsibility for medical services to the local population unless the forces mandate advises other wise however emergency cases are always given priority regardless of person and party but m ust be transferred to hn facility as soon as possible health care for the civilian population should be run by the host country aided by national and international relief organizations lesson 8 medical 136 triage triage is the evaluation and categorization of inj ured or ill personnel for treatment and evacuation triage facilitates the i ntelligent use of available resources thus serving the greatest number of patients sorting is accomp lished by special appointed medical personnel best qualified to make sound clinical jud gements promptly and mandatory in continuous action autopsies national contingents will be expeditiously notifie d through the designated national liaison points of contact of individuals t hat become critically injured or ill and die any pathological materials or tissues taken in the cour of conducting an autopsy or preparing death certificate must be turned over to the descen dants national representative personnel the spectrum of personnel issues which impact upon or are generated by the medical support function is extremely wide they merge during the initial planning stages and continue long after an operation is finished cons equently the working relationship between medical and personnel staffs must be well developed and relevant personnel concerns detailed in medical plans the medical standards do not preclude national contingents or military services from establishing higher qualifying medical standards in cases however should an individual be unacceptable for national military duties but be i ncluded in the military contingent force civilian staff including those hired locally military observers and civilian police must be examined according to the medical guidel ines detailed information about the medical examination of staff and locally recruit ed staff can be found in staff rule 10015 and united nations field administration manual cha pter 4 xxiv although testing is not mandatory requirement

assignment to mission is rmally also entitled to reimbursement for the costs of medical treatment an d hospitalization if the illness or accident is incurred while actually assigned to the mission or while in travel status on official business outside the mission area details are laid down in the united nations field administration manual chapter 4 xxxii compensation for injury or death as result of tr ansportation furnished by the organization shall be regarded as service incurred and subject to compensation the united nations provides compensation for injury or death ttributable to the performance of official duties evacuation the overall responsibility for planning and executi ng an effective medical evacuation system lies with the medical plannin g staff and in theatre the administrative operational logistic and medical staffs working in concert the cmedo plans and coordinates the medical evacuation plan in theatre which will b dependant on the evacuation resources available to support the operation lesson 8 medical 137 roles evacuation of the sick and wounded falls into two roles casualty evacuationcasevac and medical evacuationmedevac casualty evacuation casevac describes the eva cuation from points of injury to the next suitable level of care medical evacuation medevac describes the evac uation between the levels of care established in theatre intratheatre or t medical facilities out of theatre intertheatre medical repatriation describes evacuation of patient not expected to rtd in theatre to his home country plan an effective and efficient evacuation plan must balance the medical capability and limit the need for unnecessarily sophisticated resources at each level of in theatre care ensure that while the minor sick and injured are managed and rtd at the correct level the seriously injured or ill are evacuated t appropriate treatment as rapidly as possible be dynamic able to respond to rapidly changing perational imperatives be able to evacuate casualties 24 hours day in all weather and over all terrain evacuate from point of injury to life and limb sa ving surgery as rapidly as possible and normally within six hours enable critical sustainment of the casualty throu ghout the journey include c3i system that can regulate the flow f patients when circumstances require and enable frequent and accurate patient tr acking throughout evacuation holding policy this policy is to be established based on the in t heatre medical capabilities although holding policy may vary vel 1 and level 2 should have holding capability of up to five days level 3 up to 30 day s treatment for more than 30 days should usually cause repatriation at the soonest possible time patients will be transferred to their own national organization at the earliest practical opp ortunity when national desire to evacuate its own personn is contrary to the clinical opinion of the medical officer in charge the decision whether an evacuation has to be executed or not will be made by the cmedo his decision is binding for all parties however when nation insists on evacuation of its personnel against the clinical opinion of the medical officer in charge and the cmedo it becomes national responsibility and may affect future claims against the medically dedicated means of transport are preferre d in support of operations if available they will conspicuously be marked as med ical assets in the absence of dedicated transport specific ground and air assets will be d esignated with the additional mission of medical evacuations medical repatriation is medical evacuation norma lly back to the patients own country medical repatriation on medical grounds applies to all those who are unlikely to be fit for duty within the evacuation or holding policy established or those requiring treatment not available in the mission area in general 30 days is provided as guideline for this evacuation policy once an individual is medically repatriated continuing medical care is national responsibility lesson 8 medical 138 the medical welfare of the patient must be the p aramount consideration evacuations will not take place unless the patient has been cli nically determined to be stabilized to withstand the duration of the movement to the next care facil ity with high probability of not incurring complications requiring invasive

the united nation s guidelines for the provision of computer equipment local and wide area networks and other r elated edp items the emphasis will be on the relationship between the united nations communi cations and computerized network and logistics support to mission by the end of lesson 9 the student should be able to meet the following objectives understand the organization of communications s ervices in mission area understand the basic support concepts and lines of support identify common communications equipment and rvices and understand the difference in maintenance support for contingents providing their own communications support and equipment under co ntribution mou lesson 9 communications 145 91 introduction the united nations with its many missions througho ut the world is required to provide the commanders and their staffs for command and co ntrol with reliable and independent local and global communications to allow them to successf ully achieve their missions very often the countries and regions where operations are takin g place have been devastated by war or conflicts and their infrastructures have been parti ally or completely destroyed therefore the success of any mission relies on the capability of the to readily deploy and provide the required communications services the communications networks normally require an am algamation of technology which can be confusing even to the most experienced user this confusion can arise from factors such as the proliferation of services available the mix of military and civilian equipment the lack of personnel or budgetary management gui delines the failure to clarify where the responsibility l ies for the use control and maintenance of equipment and the ambiguity in the definition of the mandates f the military senior signal officer force signals officer and the civilian chief comm unications officer area of responsibility in general terms the communications sections re sponsibilities are to provide all necessary communications facilit ies and related utilities to enable the missions to carry out their mandates independently efficien tly and within the existing time and budgetary constraints the communications sections are normally responsib for providing the following services to the deployed missions telephone and facsimile services messaging services rtty email landlines links hf vhf uhf radio links microwave links satellite communications links and special equipment such as photocopiers tv sets nd audiovisual equipment in addition it is the responsibility of the commu nications staff in conjunction with their military counterparts to produce and issue communi cation electronics operating instructions ceoi and telephone directories lesson 9 communications 146 92 role organization this section depicts the organization of field c ommunication section the strength of the section and its various units will vary with th missions its complexity and associated requirements but the essence of the organization sh ould generally remain as shown below in figure 91 figure 91 the figure shows the suggested baseline organizati on however it is essential that the chief communications officer in the initial deploy ment phase produces the actual mission organization chart showing all assigned personnel the suggested organization chart is basically broken down in six fields or areas of employment t he operation unit the technical maintenance unit the radio stores unit the billin g unit the generator unit and the electrical unit this organization chart maximizes the common ality between the civilian and military communications organizations to facilitate the requ ired interaction between counterparts the use of organization charts will save time in

comfortable with the communications equipment issued to them in order to avoid failures in critical situations lesson 9 communications 149 96 provision of equipment the introduction of the contingent owned equipment memorandum of understanding coe mou has changed the method and the philosophy of how communications are provided by or to contingents since basic communications is necessity with any military force and certain level of communications capability is expec ted to be integral to military forces when they deploy into the mission area the coe mou concept recognizes this by assigning per person rate for basic communications capability this rat covers the provision and maintenance of internal radio and telephone communications the cco is responsible for the provision of commun ications equipment and its maintenance that are external to the contingents r equirement if the contingent is tasked with providing communications to the force such as co mmunications unit the reimbursement

understand the types of services available and t heir intended purpose lesson 10 postal and courier services 155 101 postal services general the timely and regular arrival of personal mail is of the utmost importance to the morale of the personnel in any field mission s ince the personnel often spend long periods of time in relative isolation with limited means of co mmunication with their families relatives and friends thus field missions must establish their own postal facilities the nature and extent of the services of such facilities depending on the ty pe size and planned duration of the mission base and field post offices in field missions with peacekeeping forces the ited nations usually authorizes the establishment of f orce post office fpo staffed by military personnel and operating under the supervision of th force postal officer additional field post offices may be established when distances deployme nt of the forces or other conditions so require mail and diplomatic pouch unit in all other missions mail is handled by the mai l and diplomatic pouch unit staffed by civilian personnel and operating under the chief general services officer missions with peacekeeping force s normally also have separately established mail and diplomatic pouch unit in addition to for ce post office the chief administrative officer cao is the advi sor to the head of mission on all matters concerning postal services and entitlements and must be consulted in postal policy matters contingent postal matters which cannot be dealt with by the individual contingents will be resolved by contingentcao philatelic services philatelic services are not available from field ssions postal services holders of franking impress means are not permitted to use them for anything else but to stamp free contingent mail more specifical ly their use for cancellation of postage stamps the provisions of postmarks in any other da ily postal operation or fulfilling philatelic requests is strictly forbidden 102 postal operations the handling of mail to and from field missions is governed by local conditions in accordance with the available means of transportati on agreements with troop

strictly forbidden by us legislation central mailing address in the mission area the united nations will establish central mailing address for the field mission thi s usually takes the form of post office box po box dedicated to the exclusive use of the fi eld mission concerned usually set up at suitably located post office in the nearest or best accessible city or town to the mission headquarters to use the central mailing address f field mission mail should be addressed as follows name title full name service number mission component contingent name field mission mission title post office box _ _ _ _ city country this central mailing address may be used by all ssion personnel for their incoming first class and ordinary mail unless specifically autho rized by the united

connection it is suggested that this type of mail be sent poste res tante to suitably located post office and its collection shall be the addressees responsibility special post office box at headquarters except for short term missions of less than three months duration the united nations on request of field mission establishes special post office box at the grand central statio n post office in new york usa dedicated exclusively to mail destined to particular field mission the staff of mail operations of the office of general services unhq is responsible for the collection of the mail and its onward shipment to the field mission through diplomatic po uch channels to use the special post office box of field mission mail should be addressed as follows name rank title full name

special post office box number will be publish ed by the mail and diplomatic pouch unit and also the base post office if established the special post office box is regulated by the applicable instructions governing the united nation s diplomatic pouch services only letters post cards and periodicals may be sent by the offic ial diplomatic pouch all other mail will be rejected by mail operations and returned to the sen der to guarantee timely dispatch of mail to field mission stamps of sufficient value must be affixed to cover the dispatch from the originati ng country to the mission area or as applicable new york usa via regular postal means the united nations does not provide free mail faci lities for mail from home countries to contingents special mail services national arrangements some troopcontributing countries through their own postal or military authorities stablish for their contingents central postal address in the home country internal postal addres s and accept mail for their troops at the local postal rate such mail which is normally limited to first class mail would usually be addressed as shown below rank full name service number po box _ _ _ _ city internal postal address country at predetermined times on specific day of the w eek the home postal or national military authorities will arrange for all mail rece ived at the national postal address to be collected bagged sealed and dispatched by airfre ight to the central mailing address of the mission clearly stating the contingents name the collection and delivery of this mail to the contingent concerned will be arranged through the p ostal facilities of the field mission alternatively some countries provide special servi ce flights for their troops assigned to mission such flights may include the carriage of parcels as well as of first class mail it is emphasized that it is the responsibility of contingents and their national authorities to make such special arrangements for the delivery of mail whether it be via commercial carriers service flights or combination of both consequently the governments of the contingents concerned will bear all charges relatin g to the transportation of the mail from the home country to the central mailing address in the mission area clearing expenses if any may be absorbed by the united nations mail from the mission area or outbound mail field missions usually provide two different dispatch services for mail from the missi on area to outside parties the first one is via the diplomatic pouch for onforwarding from new yor k usa the second one is to dispatch mail through the local postal services in the missi on area if established these services would not only be available for the sending of official c orrespondence but they would normally be provided to all mission personnel for their personal mail however certain limitat ions apply in each case which may differ from one field mission t another lesson 10 postal and courier services 158 all outbound mail through united nations postal fa cilities must be prepaid with stamps of sufficient value to cover the dispatch through r egular

use of this pouch forwarding service pers onal mail must be submitted to the mail and diplomatic pouch unit with uncancelled uni ted nations stamps with us denominations of appropriate value affixed the ma il will then be forwarded via the diplomatic pouch to the united nations headquarters new york there the stamps will be cancelled at the united nations postal office and subsequently dispa tched to its final destination utilizing the available regular governmental mail services mail dispatched through local postal services the postal facilities of mission will provide for the dispatch of official documents nd related mail through regular local postal means depending on the local conditions the unite d nations may decide to extend these services to all mission personnel should this be the case the missions postal facilities will usually accept personal mail newspapers and parcel s provided they are prepaid with national postage the mail will be delivered at predetermin ed days and times to the nearest post office the extent to which these services are offered will be established by each separate field mission and shall be published as appropriate lesson 10 postal and
