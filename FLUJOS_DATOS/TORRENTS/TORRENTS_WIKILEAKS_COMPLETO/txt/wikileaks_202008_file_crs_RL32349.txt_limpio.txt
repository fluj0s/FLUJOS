and proposed regulations an economic analysis april 8 2004 gerald mayer economic analyst domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress the whitecollar exemptions to overtime pay under current and proposed regulations an economic analysis summary the fair labor standards act of 1938 flsa requires employers to pay time andahalf to nonexempt employees who work overtime the main policy objectives of requiring employers to pay timeandahalf for overtime are to reduce involuntary unemployment and lessen overwork employers are not required to pay overtime to bona fide executive administrative and professional employees the department of labor dol has proposed new regulations to administer the whitecollar exemptions as of april 8 2004 the regulations are under review by the office of management and budget omb under current regulations to be classified as whitecollar worker an employee must meet each of three tests salary basis test salary level test and job duties test the proposed regulations would make changes to each of these tests among the changes the proposed regulations would raise the minimum weekly salary level tests from either 155 170 or 250 to 425 an exemption would be allowed for learned professionals who acquire advanced knowledge through combination of work experience and education estimating the potential effects of the proposed regulations is complicated by several factors it is difficult to estimate the number of exempt and nonexempt workers using available survey data many of the proposed changes are open to different interpretations and the immediate impact of the changes may differ from the longterm impact according to estimates for 2002 by the congressional research service crs approximately 10 to 11 million employed fulltime wage and salary executive administrative and professional employees earned more than the current salary test levels but less than 425 week if these employees are currently exempt they would be nonexempt under the proposed regulations an estimated 10 million employed fulltime learned professionals with six or more years of work experience had at least high school education but less than bachelors degree if these employees are currently nonexempt they may be exempt under the proposed regulations finally if the proposed changes create incentives that do not exist under current regulations employers may convert some nonexempt hourly whitecollar workers to exempt salaried workers in 2002 an estimated 84 million employed fulltime whitecollar workers were paid by the hour crs analysis of cps data for 2001 and 2002 suggests that cyclical changes in the levels of employment among lower wage workers who may have been nonexempt instead of exempt and learned professionals who may have been exempt instead of nonexempt under the proposed regulations were consistent with the policy objective of reducing involuntary unemployment

exemptions to overtime pay under current and proposed regulations an economic analysis introduction the fair labor standards act of 1938 flsa pl 75718 requires employers to pay timeandahalf to employees who work over 40 hours week at given job the flsa includes various exemptions to this requirement the largest group of workers exempt from overtime pay are bona fide executive administrative and professional employees the department of labor dol has proposed new regulations that administer the whitecollar exemptions to the flsa12 as of april 2 2004 the regulations are being reviewed by the office of management and budget omb an issue before congress is whether and how to respond to changes in current regulations3 the main policy objectives of requiring employers to pay timeandahalf for overtime are to reduce involuntary unemployment and lessen overwork the proposed regulations if issued as final regulations may redefine some exempt employees as nonexempt and some nonexempt employees as exempt4 the purpose of this report is to examine whether certain changes in the proposed regulations are consistent with these objectives the report is in four parts the first section describes the policy objectives of requiring employers to pay timeandahalf for overtime next the report provides an economic framework for analyzing overtime pay and the whitecollar exemptions the report then summarizes both the current and proposed regulations that administer the whitecollar exemptions finally using selected demographic social and labor market characteristics the report

regulations legislation in the 108th congress in the first session of the 108th congress legislation was introduced to change or postpone final implementation of dols proposed overtime regulations hr 2665 introduced by representative peter king and s 1485 introduced by senator edward kennedy would amend the flsa to prevent dol from implementing new regulations that would exempt from overtime any employee who is not exempt under current regulations an amendment introduced by representative david obey to the fy2004 appropriations bill for dol hr 2660 would have prevented dol from using fy2004 funds to implement regulations that would exempt from overtime any employee who is not exempt under current regulations the obey amendment was defeated by vote of 213 to 210 in the senate similar amendment sponsored by senator tom harkin was approved by vote of 54 to 45 the house later approved by vote of 221 to 203 motion instructing house members to the conference committee on hr 2660 to

overtime employers must pay nonexempt employees oneandahalftimes their regular rate of pay for hours worked in excess of 40 hours week at given job the regular rate of pay includes all payments for employment except for paid vacation and holidays contributions to health insurance or retirement plan income from stock option plans and discretionary bonuses8 the timeandahalf requirement in federal law does not apply to hours worked in excess of given number per day the flsa does not prevent employers from paying more than timeandahalf for overtime or from paying exempt employees premium wage for overtime9 section 13a1 of the flsa exempts bona fide executive administrative and professional workers as well as outside sales workers from overtime coverage it also gives the secretary of labor the authority to administer the exemptions10 requiring employers to pay timeandahalf for overtime is intended to achieve two main policy objectives first timeandahalf is intended to reduce involuntary unemployment the flsa was signed into law in june 1938 during the 1930s the united states was in the midst of prolonged economic depression in 1929 the civilian unemployment rate was 32 it increased to 249 in 1933 and did not fall below 10 until 194111 it was argued that penalty for overtime hours would shorten the workweek and increase employment the second policy objective of requiring timeandahalf for overtime is to reduce overwork during debate over the flsa it was argued that some employees worked overly long hours which was harmful to individual health and public safety12 president franklin d roosevelt said that the flsa was needed to conserve our primary resources of manpower13 7 continued rl31160 disapproval of regulations by congress procedure under the

amounted to government planning and would increase not reduce unemployment economic framework for analysis economics provides framework for analyzing the policy objectives of overtime pay and the whitecollar exemptions according to standard economic theory governments may intervene in labor markets for number of reasons these reasons include policies to reduce involuntary unemployment and to improve competition14 in addition governments sometimes require certain kinds of behavior that policymakers believe may improve individual or public welfare these requirements are called merit goods15 involuntary unemployment to many economists involuntary unemployment is one of the most visible signs that market economy is not functioning properly16 involuntary unemployment occurs when there are qualified individuals who cannot find work at prevailing wages17 involuntary unemployment that is due to inadequate demand for consumption goods investment goods or both is generally associated with an economic slowdown or recession as means of reducing involuntary unemployment during an economic downturn timeandahalf for overtime is intended as an incentive for employers to reduce overtime hours before laying off workers18 when unemployment rises it 13 continued journal vol 39 nov 1988 p 719 hereafter cited as nordlund brief history of the fair labor standards act 14 governments may also intervene in private markets to produce public goods eg national defense improve the distribution of earnings or income or correct instances where the market price of good does not fully reflect its social costs or benefits called respectively negative and positive externalities 15 an example of merit good is the requirement that drivers wear seatbelts 16 joseph stiglitz economics of the public

260261 18 penalty for overtime hours may increase the number of persons employed but may reduce the total number of hours worked penalty for overtime hours raises the average cost per hour worked for persons who work overtime penalty raises the average hourly wage if the penalty reduces overtime fixed costs for example for employerpaid health insurance are spread over fewer hours the higher average cost per hour may cause employers to substitute capital goods for hours worked reducing the total number of hours worked and to substitute additional workers for overtime hours increasing the number of persons employed ehrenberg and smith modern labor economics p 152 daniel s continued crs5 generally increases more for less skilled than for more skilled workers1920 one reason for this difference is that labor costs consist of both variable and fixed costs labor is sometimes called quasifixed factor of production fixed labor costs vary with the number of workers employed while variable costs vary with the number of hours employees work variable costs consist mainly of wages fixed costs include fringe benefits eg health insurance as well as hiring and training costs21 hiring and training costs generally increase with skill level thus the costs of hiring and training executive and professional employees are generally greater than the costs of hiring and training workers with less responsibility22 because of the greater investment employers often make in skilled workers in an economic downturn employers are more likely to lay off less skilled workers23 but since overtime costs more than straighttime requiring timeandahalf for overtime for less skilled workers may lessen the amount of involuntary unemployment during an economic downturn2425 18 continued

education 2nd ed new york columbia university press 1975 pp 3233 24 fiscal and monetary policy are macroeconomic options for reducing involuntary unemployment during an economic slowdown or recession in downturn reducing wages may be an alternative to layoffs 25 the employment effects of penalty for overtime may be diminished if straighttime wages are adjusted downward so that employees total weekly pay is unchanged some evidence suggests that after the flsa was enacted in 1938 some employers reduced the regular hourly rate of pay so that the payment of overtime did not change their total wage continued crs6 overwork overtime may be voluntary or involuntary overtime is voluntary if workers have the option to accept or decline employer requests to work overtime overtime is involuntary if workers do not have the option to accept or decline employer requests to work overtime the difference will generally depend on the degree to which labor markets fit the model of perfect competition for example one of the characteristics of the model of competitive labor market is that there are many employers and many workers if labor market does not have many other employers offering similar work at similar wages employees may have few alternative employment options and may work overtime when they would rather not model of perfect competition according to standard economic theory competitive markets generally result in the most efficient allocation of resources where resources consist of individuals with different skills capital goods eg computers machinery and buildings and natural resources if labor markets fit the model of perfect competition workers are paid according to the value of their contribution to output in competitive labor markets wages include compensation for unfavorable working conditions the latter theory called the theory of compensating wage differentials recognizes that individuals differ in their preferences or tolerance for different working conditions such as the number of hours worked including overtime health and safety conditions vacation time and job security26 if labor markets do not fit the model of perfect competition overtime may be involuntary in imperfect labor markets requiring employers to pay timeandahalf for overtime may either discourage employers from requesting or requiring overtime or ensure that workers who work overtime are paid premium wage for overtime hours reducing involuntary overtime may be difficult policy to implement first identifying the appropriate labor market may be difficult labor markets can be local eg for unskilled labor regional national or even international eg for top executives second labor market competitiveness is difficult to measure27 labor 25 continued bill us congress house

251259 27 requiring timeandahalf for overtime may create an incentive for employees to work more hours some employees may therefore work overtime although they would otherwise prefer shorter workweek some evidence suggests that workers want to work more continued crs7 markets may also change because of economic technological or policy changes in addition requiring timeandahalf for overtime is intended to reduce involuntary unemployment and lessen overwork in one case timeandahalf is required for less skilled workers who may be more likely than skilled workers to lose their jobs during an economic downturn in the other case timeandahalf is required for workers in imperfect labor markets the two groups of workers may not be the same in an economic downswing requiring timeandahalf for less skilled workers may reduce involuntary unemployment but requiring timeandahalf to lessen involuntary overtime depends on the competitiveness of the relevant labor markets merit goods finally some policymakers may believe that employees who voluntarily work overtime are not acting in their best interests or in the best interests of others policymakers who believe that 40hour work week is merit good may favor limits on the number of hours worked or may favor incentives such as time andahalf for overtime that discourage employers from offering overtime the general criticism of this view is that in competitive markets individuals are in better position than governments to judge what is in their best interests28 current and proposed regulations the flsa includes several exceptions and exemptions to the requirement that employers pay workers timeandahalf for overtime whitecollar workers are the largest group of employees exempt from timeandahalf for overtime this section provides brief summary of current and proposed regulations that administer the whitecollar exemptions to the flsa the tables in appendix provide more detail on the current and proposed regulations under current regulations executive administrative and professional workers are generally exempt from timeandahalf for overtime if they meet each of three tests salary basis test salary level test and job duties test29 under the salary basis test an employee must be paid salary and not an hourly wage salaried workers are employees who receive their full salary for any workweek in which they perform any work without regard to the number of days or hours worked30 under 27 continued overtime than the amount that is offered by employers overtime hours may therefore be rationed either by seniority or by rotating the opportunities for overtime among workers reynolds et labor economics and labor relations pp 6263 470 28 the view that governments may know what is in the best interests of individuals has been called paternalism stiglitz economics of the public sector p 87 29 according to dol the application of most exemptions is determined on workweek basis u s department of labor wage and hour division handy reference guide to the fair labor standards act flsa available on the internet at httpwwwdolgovesaregscompliancewhdhrghtm 30 executives must be paid on salary basis administrative and professional employees may be paid on salary or fee basis the salary basis test does not apply to executive continued crs8 the job duties test an employees primary duties must involve executive administrative or professional activities depending on an employees salary an employee must meet one of two duties tests commonly called the short test and the long test the long test has more requirements than the short test the long test applies to executive and administrative employees with weekly salaries of at least 155 but less than 250 and to professional employees with weekly salaries of at least 170 but less than 250 the short duties test applies to executive administrative and professional employees with weekly salaries of 250 or more31 whitecollar workers who are paid less than the minimum salary levels are nonexempt regardless of their job duties the duties tests have remained essentially unchanged since 1949 the salary levels in the short and long duties tests were last raised in 197532 salary requirement does not apply to doctors lawyers and teachers regulations do not include specific salary level test for academic administrative personnel under section 13a17 of the flsa certain employees in computer related occupations are exempt from overtime pay if they are paid by the hour and their wage is 2763 or more an hour33 the flsa also exempts employers from paying overtime to outside sales workers an outside sales worker is salesperson who regularly works away from his employers place of business and who does not devote more than 20 of work hours to work performed by nonexempt employees of the employer outside sales workers are not subject to salary test34 30 continued administrative and professional employees in the motion picture producing industry whitecollar workers in the motion picture producing industry are exempt if they meet the appropriate job duties test and are paid weekly base rate of at least 250 thus for example whitecollar workers in this industry who meet the appropriate duties test are exempt if they are paid daily rate that results in weekly pay of 250 calculated on the basis of sixday workweek 29 cfr 541601 the proposed regulations would raise this weekly base rate to 650 us department of labor defining and delimiting exemptions for executive administrative and professional employees p 15597 31 29 cfr 541

services workers see crs report rl30537 computer services personnel overtime pay under the fair labor standards act by william g whittaker 34 29 cfr 5415 crs9 the regulations proposed by the us department of labor would make changes to each of the three tests the proposed regulations would replace the separate long and short duties test terminology with standard duties test and test for highly compensated employees the current minimum weekly salary levels for executive and administrative employees ie 155 and for professional employees ie 170 would be replaced with single salary test of 42535 highly compensated employees would be exempt from overtime if they meet at least one of the standard duties tests highly compensated employee would be an employee who is paid at least 65000 annually 1250 weekly in total cash compensation under current regulations executive administrative and professional employees as well as outside sales workers are not exempt from overtime if they spend more than 20 of their work hours on nonexempt activities the proposed regulations would eliminate this requirement the discretion and independent judgement tests found in the current job duties tests would be eliminated36 for administrative employees the test would be replaced with requirement that employees hold position of responsibility new provision would be added that may exempt supervisors in retail establishments who spend majority of their time on nonexempt work an exemption would be allowed for learned professionals who acquire advanced knowledge through combination of work experience and education the learned professions include doctors lawyers teachers engineers accountants chemists registered nurses and others the proposed regulations would modify the pay docking rules under the current salary basis test employers would be allowed to suspend exempt employees without pay for disciplinary reasons for periods of full day or more the circumstances under which an improper pay deduction may cause an entire group of employees to become nonexempt would be changed the exemption would be lost only if there is pattern of improper deductions and only for 35 person working fulltime yearround at weekly salary of 425 earns 22100 annually if the salary level tests were adjusted to inflation using the consumer price index for urban consumers or cpiu in 2002 the 155 and 170 salary levels under the long test and the 250 amount under the short test would have been 518 568 and 836 respectively 36 under current regulations an executive employee is an employee who customarily and regularly exercises discretionary powers under the long test an administrative employee is an employee who customarily and regularly exercises discretion and independent judgement under the long test or whose work requires the exercise of discretion and independent judgement under the short test and professional employee is an employee whose work requires the consistent exercise of discretion and judgement under both the long and short tests crs10 employees in the same job classification and working for the same manager responsible for the improper deductions empirical analysis this section uses the economic framework described above to examine whether certain changes in the proposed regulations are consistent with the policy objectives of overtime pay and the whitecollar exemptions the section begins with discussion of the difficulties in estimating the effects of the proposed regulations next estimates are provided of the number of employees who may be affected by two of the changes included in the proposed regulations the increase in the minimum salary level test and the change in the job duties tests that would allow an exemption for learned professionals who acquire advanced knowledge through combination of work experience and education the analysis categorizes employees as exempt or nonexempt based on their occupation industry and other information therefore employees are described as potentially exempt or nonexempt the section then compares recent cyclical changes in the levels of employment among exempt and nonexempt workers under both current and proposed regulations the purpose of these comparisons is to examine whether changes in the levels of employment of employees who may change status under the proposed regulations are similar to the changes in the levels of employment of nonexempt and exempt employees under current regulations finally using selected demographic social and labor market characteristics employees who are exempt or nonexempt under current regulations are compared to employees who may have become exempt or nonexempt if the proposed regulations had been in effect in 2002 it is not possible here to identify and measure the competitiveness of the labor markets of exempt and nonexempt workers thus the purpose of these comparisons is to examine whether employees who may become eligible or ineligible for overtime under the proposed regulations are similar to nonexempt or exempt employees under current regulations the analysis examines employed fulltime wage and salary workers using data from the monthly current population survey cps appendix b provides description of the methodology and assumptions used in this section of the report estimating the number of exempt and nonexempt employees estimating the potential effects of the proposed regulations is complicated by several factors first it is difficult to make estimates from available survey data second many of the proposed changes are open to differences in interpretation if the proposed regulations are issued as final regulations the impact would depend in part on how the regulations are enforced by the wage and hour division of dol and how they are interpreted by the courts37 third the immediate impact of the regulations may differ from the longterm impact this report considers estimates 37 for discussion of issues of interpretation of the proposed regulations see crs report rl31995 the fair labor standards act exemption of the executive administrative and professional employees under section 13 a1 by william g whittaker pp 924 crs11 prepared by dol the economic policy institute epi and the congressional research service crs data limitations data limitations make it difficult to estimate the number of exempt and nonexempt workers dol epi and crs estimates of the potential effects of the proposed regulations rely largely or in part on data from the monthly current population survey cps the cps is monthly household survey conducted by the us bureau of the census for bls the survey collects wide range of labor market information and is the source of data for the monthly unemployment rate but the cps does not ask individuals if they are covered by the overtime provisions of the flsa therefore researchers use information on occupation industry earnings education or other variables to infer who may be exempt or nonexempt from overtime these inferences can involve significant often subjective assumptions interpretation some of the changes that would be made if the proposed regulations are issued as final regulations are open to different interpretations this section examines three such changes first under the proposed regulations two job duties tests would be eliminated the discretion and independent judgement tests see footnote 36 and the 20 limits on nonexempt work in 1999 report the general accounting office gao stated that for both employers and dol compliance investigators the discretion and independent judgement tests are difficult to administer on the other hand gao stated that the compliance cases they reviewed included number of instances where the standard of independent judgement and discretion was key to determining the employees exempt or nonexempt status38 in addition in the case of administrative employees the discretion and independent judgement test would be replaced by requirement that an employee hold position of responsibility it is not clear whether an administrative employee who holds position of responsibility would be more or less likely to be exempt than an employee who exercises discretion and independent judgement second example of how it may it be difficult to interpret the proposed regulations involves the concept of primary duty which appears in the job duties tests under both current and proposed regulations current regulations state that the amount of time spent in the performance of the managerial duties is useful guide in determining whether management is the primary duty of an employee in the ordinary case it may be taken as good rule of thumb that primary duty means the major part or over 50 of the employees time time alone however is not the sole test and in situations where the employee does not spend 38 the gao discussion refers to the discretion and independent judgement tests for administrative and professional employees gao fair labor standards act whitecollar exemptions in the modern work place pp 2324 crs12 over 50 of his time in managerial duties he might nevertheless have management as his primary duty39 the proposed regulations state that the term primary duty means the principal main major or most important duty that the employee performs the term primary duty does not require that employees spend over fifty percent of their time performing exempt work however the amount of time spent performing exempt work can be useful guide and employees who spend over fifty percent of the time performing exempt work will be considered to have primary duty of performing exempt work40 whether in practice the revised definition would differ from the current definition is not certain41 finally the proposed regulations make changes in the definition of learned professionals42 current regulations state that the learned professions are those requiring knowledge of an advanced type in field of science or learning customarily acquired by prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction and study as distinguished from general academic education generally speaking it must be knowledge which cannot be attained at the high school level the typical symbol of professional training is of course the appropriate academic degree43 the proposed regulations state that the learned professions require knowledge of an advanced type in field of science or learning customarily acquired by prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction but which also may be acquired by alternative means such as an equivalent combination of intellectual instruction and work experience the phrase knowledge of an advanced type means knowledge that cannot be attained at the high school level 39 29 cfr 541103 40 us department of labor defining and delimiting exemptions for executive administrative and professional employees p 15595 41 the 1999 gao report cites two 1982 court decisions involving the burger king corporation that underscore how the 50 rule of thumb in current regulations is not hard and fast rule according to gao the court decisions found that the 50 rule was only one factor to consider when determining employees primary duty and that their managerial duties could be carried out at the same time they were performing manual work thus assistant managers could be exempt executives even if they spent most of the day cooking hamburgers as long as they were in charge of the restaurants during their shifts gao fair labor standards act whitecollar exemptions in the modern work place p 29 42 for discussion of the definition of professional employees see crs report rl32323 the fair labor standards act defining professional for overtime pay purposes under section 13a1 by william g whittaker 43 29 cfr 541301 crs13 the proposed regulations go on to say that the phrase customarily acquired by prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction generally restricts the exemption to professions where specialized academic training is standard prerequisite for entrance into the profession however the word customarily means that the exemption is also available to employees in such professions who have substantially the same knowledge level as the degreed employees but who attained such knowledge through combination of work experience training in the armed forces attending technical school attending community college or other intellectual instruction44 in the preamble to the proposed regulations dol states that although some flexibility to focus on the workers knowledge exists in the current regulation it is very limited and rarely used45 thus it appears that the intent of the combined education and work experience test for learned professions is to clarify that training and work experience can be substituted for formal education immediate versus longterm effects finally the longterm impact of the proposed regulations may be different from the shortterm effects for example because of increases in wages due to inflation and higher labor productivity the relative number of whitecollar employees who are nonexempt because they earn less than the current salary level tests has declined over time because the salary level tests in the proposed regulations are not indexed to inflation the relative number of whitecollar workers who may be nonexempt because they earn less than 425 week can also be expected to decline over time on the other hand the occupational and industrial composition of the economy may change resulting in an increase in the relative number of whitecollar employees46 finally the proposed regulations may affect employer or employee behavior some hourly workers may be converted to salaried workers or vice versa similarly the job duties of some employees may be changed in order to more clearly distinguish between exempt and nonexempt employees dol epi and crs estimates of the shortterm effects of the proposed regulations despite the difficulties in estimating the number of employees who may be directly affected by the proposed regulations data from the cps have been used

university of tennessee under contract with the wage and hour division of dol jan 2001 tables 2 7 and 9 available on the internet at httpwwwdolgovaspprograms flsareportneweconomymainhtm crs14 estimate whether more or fewer employees may be exempt or nonexempt under parts of the proposed regulations using 2001 cps and other data study prepared for dol estimated that if the proposed higher salary level test of 425 had been in effect in 2001 an additional 12 to 13 million employees who were exempt may have been nonexempt47 in addition dol estimated that 644000 administrative and professional employees who are paid by the hour and work overtime may be converted to salaried workers48 epi has estimated that under the proposed regulations 25 million nonexempt salaried workers would become exempt in addition epi has estimated that 55 million hourly workers earning 425 or more week excluding doctors lawyers and most teachers could be converted to exempt salaried workers epis estimates are based on an analysis of 78 of 257 occupations including managerial professional and supervisory occupations and technical sales and administrative support occupations49 according to cps data large number of executive administrative and professional employees are paid by the hour presumably if there are significant incentives under current regulations to do so these hourly workers would be converted to salaried workers if the proposed regulations create incentives that do not exist under current regulations employers may convert some or perhaps many nonexempt hourly whitecollar workers to exempt salaried workers epi cites several changes in the proposed regulations that it believes could create incentives for employers to convert hourly whitecollar workers into salaried workers the combined education and work experience test for learned professionals the elimination of the discretion and independent judgement tests the elimination of the 20 limits on nonexempt work and changes in the definition of primary duty50 crs has attempted to estimate some of the potential effects of the proposed regulations given the difficulty in interpreting and quantifying the changes however only three estimates have been made the number of whitecollar employees earning between the current salary level tests and the proposed salary level of 425 the number of learned professionals with at least high school degree but less than bachelors degree and the number of whitecollar workers who report that they are paid by the hour 47 consad research corporation economic analysis of the proposed

bernstein eliminating the right to overtime pay washington economic policy institute pp 511 available on the internet at httpwwwepinetorg epi is nonprofit economic research and education organization funded by foundation grants labor unions corporations individuals and others 50 ibid p 4 crs15 crs estimates indicate that in 2002 an estimated 10 to 11 million employed fulltime wage and salary executive administrative and professional employees earned more than the current weekly salary test levels ie 155 170 or 250 but less than 425 if they are exempt under current regulations they would be nonexempt and eligible for overtime pay under the proposed regulations some or many of these employees may not meet the job duties tests under current regulations and may therefore be nonexempt under both current and proposed regulations the effect of the change in status would depend in part on the nature ie competitiveness of the labor markets involved for employees newly entitled to overtime pay weekly earnings may increase but because of the increased cost some employers may offer or require less overtime see footnote 18 because of the premium for overtime more employees may want to work overtime some salaried workers who work overtime may be converted to hourly workers the hourly wage of some of these employees may leave their weekly earnings relatively unchanged see footnote 25 in its costbenefit analysis dol assumed that six years of work experience is equivalent to bachelors degree in 2002 an estimated 10 million fulltime learned professionals with six or more years of work experience had at least high school degree but had not earned bachelors or advanced degree51 some or many of these employees may be exempt under current regulations if not they may become exempt and therefore ineligible for overtime pay under the proposed regulations52 again the effect of the change in status would depend on the nature of the labor markets involved for some workers the loss of timeandahalf for overtime may result in lower weekly earnings because of the lower cost some employers may offer or require more overtime but because of the loss of timeandahalf fewer workers may want to work overtime some learned professionals who work overtime and are paid by the hour may be converted to salaried workers the weekly earnings of some of these employees may remain unchanged finally in 2002 an estimated 84 million fulltime executive administrative and professional employees were paid by the hour53 if the proposed regulations create incentives that do not exist under current regulations some or many of these hourly workers may be converted to salaried workers cyclical changes in employment one of the objectives of requiring employers to pay timeandahalf for overtime is to reduce involuntary unemployment crs analysis of cps data for 2001 and 2002 suggests that cyclical changes in the levels of employment among lower wage 51 lower and upperbound estimates based on six or more and eight or more years of work experience were made of the number of learned professionals who may have been exempt in 2002 as result of the combined education and work experience test when rounded off both methods resulted in an estimate of 10 million employees see appendix b 52 employees exempt from the flsa requirement of timeandahalf for overtime may receive premium pay for overtime under collective bargaining agreement 53 of the estimated 84 million whitecollar workers who were paid by the hour in 2002 an estimated 12 million received overtime pay commissions or tips crs16 workers who may have been nonexempt instead of exempt and learned professionals who may have been exempt instead of nonexempt under the proposed regulations were consistent with the policy objective of reducing involuntary unemployment during an economic downturn during 2001 and 2002 the employment of fulltime wage and salary workers reached peak during the threemonth period beginning june 2001 and fell to low during the threemonth period beginning december 20015455 from the threemonth period beginning june 2001 to the threemonth period beginning december 2001 employment among potentially nonexempt workers under current regulations fell by an estimated 34 million persons on the other hand employment among potentially exempt executive administrative and professional employees under current regulations increased by an estimated 94000 persons under the proposed regulations the changes in employment were similar for employees who may have become eligible or ineligible for overtime among employees who may have become nonexempt under the proposed regulations because of the proposed 425 salary level test employment fell by an estimated 65000 persons but employment among workers who may have become exempt because of the combined education and work experience test for learned professionals increased by an estimated 365000 persons56 thus from peak to trough changes in the levels of employment among employees who may have changed status under the proposed regulations ie become nonexempt instead of exempt or exempt instead of nonexempt were similar to the changes in employment among nonexempt and exempt employees under current regulations an examination of different time period or of other changes in the proposed regulations may yield different results an analysis of the number and kinds of jobs lost during an economic downturn may not be good indicator of which workers should be eligible for timeandahalf 54 the calculations are based on threemonth moving average that is average employment for jan feb and mar 2001 was compared to average employment for feb mar and apr 2001 and so on 55 according to the national bureau of economic research nber which dates the peaks and troughs of the business cycle the last completed recession began in mar 2001 and ended in nov 2001 nber considers real gross domestic product gdp as the best measure of aggregate economic activity the trend in employment may differ from the trend in output according to nber seasonally adjusted payroll employment reached peak in feb 2001 and fell through july 2002 nber business cycle dating committee national bureau of economic research nber july 17 2003 available on the internet at httpwwwnberorg payroll

than once us department of labor bureau of labor statistics employment and earnings vol 50 jan 2003 pp 218 238 56 the 94000 increase in employment among potentially exempt employees under current regulations and the 65000 decrease in employment among persons who may have been nonexempt under the proposed regulations were not statistically significant nevertheless under current regulations employment among exempt workers did not fall under the proposed regulations employment among workers who may have been nonexempt did not rise crs17 for overtime downturns differ in their depth and duration some may be relatively mild and shortlived others may be more severe and longerlasting the industries and occupations affected may also differ for example using broader definition of whitecollar workers than the one used in this report some research has concluded that during the 19901991 recession whitecollar workers experienced greater job losses relative to bluecollar workers than in previous recessions57 finally cyclical changes in employment may coincide with structural changes in employment during an economic downturn some workers may lose their jobs because of temporary layoffs others may lose their jobs because of shifts in employment from one sector to another eg shift in employment from manufacturing to service industries characteristics of potentially exempt and nonexempt employees the second objective of requiring timeandahalf for overtime is to lessen overwork as discussed above in imperfect labor markets requiring timeandahalf for overtime may discourage employers from requesting overtime or provide employees with higher rate of pay when they work more than 40 hours week voluntary overtime may be discouraged for social reasons eg to allow workers more time for family education and other matters or to improve individual or public safety ie tired workers may be danger to themselves and others this section does not attempt to identify or measure the competitiveness of labor markets for different workers rather table 1 uses selected demographic social and labor market characteristics to compare potentially exempt and nonexempt employees under current regulations with workers who may have become exempt or nonexempt under the proposed regulations the purpose of these comparisons is to examine whether employees who may gain or lose overtime eligibility under the proposed regulations are similar to or different from nonexempt or exempt employees under current regulations58 the percentages in table 1 are based on estimates of the number of employees potentially exempt or nonexempt under current and proposed regulations in 2002 there were an estimated 98 million fulltime wage and salary workers including for the purposes of this analysis employees of the us postal service but not other federal employees under current regulations an estimated 67 million employees 57 jennifer m gardner the 19901991 recession how bad was

federal reserve bank of cleveland vol 28 quarter 4 1992 pp 34 6 in both studies whitecollar workers were defined as the sum of managerial and professional speciality workers and technical sales and administrative workers 58 thus attempt is made to analyze whether the labor markets of workers who may gain overtime coverage are less competitive than the labor markets of exempt workers under current regulations similarly attempt is made to analyze whether the labor markets of workers who may lose overtime coverage are more competitive than the labor markets of nonexempt workers under current regulations crs18 were potentially nonexempt and an estimated 31 million were potentially exempt the tables use the lowerbound estimates of the number of whitecollar workers who may have been nonexempt instead of exempt or exempt instead of nonexempt if the proposed regulations had been in effect in 2002 the lowerbound estimate ie 10 million of the number of employees who may have been nonexempt because of the higher salary test is an estimate of the number of employees with weekly earnings of 250 or more but less than 425 the lowerbound estimate ie 10 million of the number of learned professionals who may have been exempt because of the combined education and work experience test is an estimate of the number of learned professionals with at least high school degree but less than bachelors and with eight or more years of potential work experience see footnote 51 nonexempt employees under current and proposed regulations column 1 of table 1 shows characteristics of potentially nonexempt employees under current regulations column 2 shows characteristics of employees who may have gained eligibility for overtime in 2002 if the proposed 425 salary level test had been in effect some of these employees may be eligible for overtime under current regulations table 1 shows that in some ways workers who may have been eligible for overtime in 2002 because of the higher salary level test were different from other nonexempt workers but in other ways they were much the same in terms of age race and marital status workers who may have gained eligibility for overtime were similar to other nonexempt workers59 however by nature of the proposed change in the salary level test employees who may have been nonexempt instead of exempt had lower weekly earnings than nonexempt workers under current regulations ie they earned less than 425 week60 on the other hand workers who may have become eligible for overtime had more formal education than nonexempt workers under current regulations 323 had bachelors or advanced degree compared to 151 of nonexempt workers under current regulations workers who may have gained overtime eligibility were more likely to be female nonhispanic and nonunion they were also more likely to be employed in retail trade finance real estate and insurance and professional services industries professional services industries include hospitals doctors offices nursing homes law offices schools and colleges and universities exempt employees under current and proposed regulations column 3 of table 1 shows characteristics of potentially exempt employees under current regulations column 4 shows characteristics of employees who may have lost overtime eligibility in 2002 if the combined education and work experience test for learned professionals had been in effect some of these employees may be ineligible for overtime under current regulations 59 the median age was 39 for nonexempt workers under current regulations and for workers who may have been nonexempt in 2002 if the higher salary level test had been in effect 60 unless stated otherwise the differences discussed in the text between the percentages in columns 1 and 2 and columns 3 and 4 are significant at the 95 confidence level see appendix b for discussion of confidence levels crs19 table 1 shows that compared to exempt employees under current regulations employees who may have lost overtime eligibility if the combined education and work experience test had been in effect in 2002 had less formal education than exempt workers under current regulations although threefourths 758 had some college none had bachelors or advanced degree by nature of the change in regulations the employees who may have lost overtime eligibility were learned professionals they had somewhat lower earnings than workers exempt under current regulations 327 of workers who may have lost eligibility for overtime earned over 1015 week compared to 399 of other exempt workers61 workers who may have lost overtime eligibility were more likely to be older female black and nonhispanic62 compared to exempt workers under current regulations they were more likely to be married but they were also more likely to be widowed divorced or separated they were more likely than currently exempt workers to be employed in professional services industries summary if the proposed regulations are issued as final regulations some lower wage workers may gain eligibility for overtime as result of the higher 425 salary level test change in status from exempt to nonexempt may raise the weekly earnings of some workers reduce the amount of overtime or both some salaried workers who work overtime may be converted to hourly workers some of these workers may experience little change in their weekly earnings because less skilled workers are more likely than skilled workers to be laid off during recession requiring timeandahalf for more lower paid workers may during an economic downturn reduce the amount of involuntary unemployment the effect on the overall unemployment rate may be small however some higher wage workers may lose eligibility for overtime as result of the exemption for learned professionals who acquire advanced knowledge through combination of education and work experience change in status from nonexempt to exempt may lower the weekly earnings of some workers increase the amount of overtime or both some learned professionals who work overtime and are paid by the hour may be converted to salaried workers for some of these workers becoming salaried worker may have little effect on their weekly earnings because skilled workers are less likely to be laid off during recession the loss of timeandahalf by learned professional may have limited effect on the amount of involuntary unemployment during an economic downturn 61 median weekly earnings for exempt workers under current regulations were 900 compared to 830 for workers who may have been exempt in 2002 if the combined education and work experience test had been in effect median weekly earnings for nonexempt workers under current regulations were 500 62 the median age was 41 for exempt

report their earnings on an hourly basis earnings reported for period other than week are converted by bls to weekly amount66 the cps does not ask workers if they are exempt or nonexempt from the overtime provisions of the flsa therefore the survey does not allow direct estimates of the number of exempt or nonexempt workers nevertheless using information on an employees occupation industry and in some cases weekly earnings and education it is possible to use cps data to estimate the number of employees who are potentially exempt or nonexempt the flsa includes various exceptions and exemptions to the overtime provisions of the act some exemptions apply to certain employers eg some seasonal amusement or recreational establishments other exemptions are allowed for workers in certain occupations eg outside sales workers or industries eg 63 us bureau of the census measuring 50 years of economic change current population reports p60203 washington sept 1998 p d1 64 us department of labor bureau of labor statistics basic monthly survey available at httpwwwblscensusgovcpsbglosaryhtm 65 households are in the cps survey for four consecutive months out of the survey for eight months and back in the survey for four more months the questions about earnings and union status and hours worked are asked of households leaving the survey either permanently or for eight months during 12month period the observations on earnings are for unique individuals 66 us department of labor bureau of labor statistics employment and earnings vol 48 jan 2001 pp 232 236 241 us

nine workers in addition the wage and hour division of dol administers the flsa with respect to private employers state and local governments and certain federal employees eg us postal service library of congress and tennessee valley authority but the us office of personnel management opm administers the flsa for employees of the executive branch of the federal government the analysis in this report examines employed hourly and nonhourly wage and salary employees ages 16 and over who usually work fulltime selfemployed persons are not included using data from the cps the following employees were categorized as potentially exempt from the overtime provisions of the flsa agricultural and fishing workers employees in the railroad and airline industries outside sales workers seamen taxi drivers newspaper deliverers casual babysitters computer professionals who are paid by the hour and earn more than 2763 an hour drivers and mechanics in the bus and trucking service industries salesmen employed by automobile truck aircraft boat and mobile home dealers and mechanics employed by automobile or truck dealers in addition executive administrative and professional with at least bachelors degree67 employees who meet the current weekly salary level tests for exemption are categorized as exempt according to current regulations executive employees generally perform managerial and supervisory functions68 therefore persons categorized in the cps as managerial and supervisory employees and who meet the weekly salary level test for executives are treated as exempt dental hygienists and health and medical technologists with at least bachelors degree are treated as exempt under current regulations dental hygienists with less than bachelors degree are treated as exempt under the proposed regulations if they meet the proposed work experience test69 except for employees of the us postal service federal employees are excluded from the analysis70 for analytical purposes using the cps to categorize employees who are potentially exempt and nonexempt may result in employees being misclassified for example respondent who is classified as manager in the cps may not meet the requirements under current regulations to be classified as exempt likewise an 67 computer professionals were categorized as exempt whether or not they held bachelors or advanced degree with respect to computer professionals current regulations state that the level of expertise and skill required to qualify for this exemption is generally attained through combinations of education and experience particular academic degree is required for this exemption 29 cfr 541303c 68 29 cfr 541102 69 medical technologists who meet certain educational requirements are generally exempt from the overtime provisions of the flsa 29 cfr 541301 in the cps medical technologists are grouped with medical technicians since it is not possible to separate technologists from technicians it was assumed that workers in these categories with bachelors degree or better were exempt 70 section 4f of the flsa authorizes the us office of personnel management opm to administer the flsa with respect to federal agencies except for the us house of representatives us senate library of congress congressional budget office us postal service and certain other agencies crs27 employee who performs both exempt and nonexempt work may be categorized in the cps as worker who performs manual work but if the worker also supervises other employees the employee may be exempt for overtime purposes similarly whitecollar employees earning 250 or more may not be exempt from the overtime provisions of the flsa if they do not meet the appropriate job duties test the estimates of the number of employees who may have been nonexempt if the proposed salary level test had been in effect in 2002 are based on the salary level tests in the current and proposed regulations the lowerbound is an estimate of the number of employees earning 250 or more per week but less than 425 the upper bound is an estimate of the number of employees earning 155 or more per week 170 for professional employees but less than 425 the estimates of the number of learned professionals who may have been exempt in 2002 because they may have met the job duties test through combination of work experience and education is for employees with at least high school degree but less than bachelors degree the estimates do not include creative professionals but include learned professionals for whom there is federal salary test ie doctors lawyers and teachers for other professionals the estimates are for employees with usual weekly earnings of 425 or more work experience was calculated as potential work experience age minus years of education minus six the estimates include persons who began work earlier than age 18 an upper bound estimate follows the approach described by the us department of labor in its analysis of the impact of the proposed regulations it was assumed that six years of work experience was equivalent to bachelors degree71 because individuals may not work continuously or may not work continuously in the same job lowerbound estimate was calculated for persons with eight years of potential work experience in both cases when rounded off the calculations resulted in an estimate of 10 million learned professionals with less than bachelors degree the proposed regulations do not however provide specific equivalence between years of work experience and bachelors or advanced degree therefore the upperbound estimate would be higher if it were assumed that fewer than six years of work experience is equivalent to bachelors degree similarly the lowerbound estimate would be smaller if it were assumed that more than eight years of work experience is equivalent to bachelors degree the estimate of the number of fulltime executive administrative and professional employees who are paid by the hour consists of whitecollar employees who are paid an hourly wage or who report their earnings on an hourly basis for workers subject to salary level test the estimate includes employees who earn 425 or more week for computer professionals the estimate includes employees who are paid by the hour have weekly earnings of at least 425 and are paid less than 2763 an hour for learned professionals with less than an bachelors degree but at least high school degree the estimate includes employees with six or more years of potential work experience 71 us department of labor defining and delimiting the exemptions for executive administrative and professional employees p 15577 crs28 the earnings intervals used for weekly earnings in table 1 are based on equal quintiles of the earnings distribution that is among all fulltime wage and salary workers in 2002 onefifth earned 366 week or less onefifth earned more than 366 but less than 519 and so on confidence levels the comparisons discussed in the text of this report are statistically significant at the 95 confidence level estimates based on survey responses from sample of households have two kinds of error nonsampling error and sampling error examples of nonsampling error include information that is misreported and errors made in processing collected information sampling error occurs because sample and not the entire population of households is surveyed the difference between an estimate based on sample of households and the actual population value is known as sampling error72 when using sample data researchers typically construct confidence intervals around population estimates confidence intervals provide information about the accuracy of estimated values with 95 confidence interval and repeated samples from population 95 of intervals will generally include the actual value of population characteristic 72 us department of labor bureau of labor statistics employment and earnings vol 49 nov 2002 pp 147148
