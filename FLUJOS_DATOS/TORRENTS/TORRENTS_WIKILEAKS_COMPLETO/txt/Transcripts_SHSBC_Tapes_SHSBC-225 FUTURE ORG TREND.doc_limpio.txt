future org trends lecture given on 9 october 1962 well what are we here weve arrived at the what of what audience october 9 nine october ad 12 what planet is this audience earth oh ho earth anyway the general situation is that i was going to give you an extra week of lecture here and then skip two and then give you an extra week on the other side of it so you dont lose out and take mary sue down and show her the mediterranean for few days she needs it ive been riding around doing nothing you know and so on but shes entitled to it i want to talk to you tonight about very strange subjecta very very strange subject scientology its organizations now this is strange subjectscientology organizations there comes time in any activity when you have to look forward to the shape of things to come and what they will be now let us envision this as an activity we do nothing cohesive everybody just goes his own way we have central control of any kind and people just wander out and process people and so forth and all of this has into its teeth the combined efforts of people with supervested interests in making slaves and that supercombined vested interest then pick us up one by one and throw us on the nearest dung heap and we thereafter find scientology being practiced with electric shock by the governments now just look at that not as necessarily an extreme picture but one which very well might happen now lets look at the other side of this picture the other side of the picture consisting of wellunified united scientology with sufficient international esteem force and wherewithal that somebody suddenly decides to use scientology exclusively to electric shock the chinese to make them work on the farm and collectivize it all and we sneeze and they fold up now scientology would go the way of many other good things unless some thought is put upon its future buddhism went its way collectively and actually wound up enslaving people bum show the east the paralysis of the east the fatalism of the east and so forth are as attributable to buddhism as to any other single item i dont know what gautama siddhartha said but i sure know that people have been saying since if you just sat and regarded your navel for enough years and did nothing you would become part of nirvana and nirvana as far as i can figure out is the gpm well just see picture of it it looks like human being surrounded with lot of little valences nirvana look at piclook at buddhist picture of nirvana sometime and you got the gpmbang so they eventually found out how to put people into the gpm and all kinds of squirrel offbeat offshoots like zen buddhism if you know the answer i hit you if you dont know the answer i hit you because force is knowingness and never the twain shall be separated well isnt that the way it must be i dont know if youre acquainted with zen buddhism but after youve done tremendous amount of study on the subject you finally can make up your mind that if youre hit you know thats the end product now lamaism with ghosts and devils and more gpms splintered off from buddhism everybody went into apathy and there it went of course they didnt have the technology i just say that very advisably the east has never known how to do it that i can tell you out of the depths of my own experience i can show you an indian rope trick the small boy going up the pole i can do it hypnotize the lot of you youd see most anything never did anybody any good anybody wants to dramatize axiom 10 by all means dramatize axiom 10 but theres point where even that catches up with them indian rope trick is mass hypnotism the last fun i ever got out of mass hypnotism was hypnotizing the staff of saint elizabeths hospital in washington i dont know if i ever told you that story i neednt bother to now but this this is all nonsense they didnt have the technology in the east they have never had the technology they knew few answers and they all wound up in the soup so this is the first time on this planet certainlyand i think the first time in this universewhen theres ever been kickback against the ignorance when mansor sentient beings were capable of bettering themselves without worsening somebody else scientology is peculiar and unique it is the game in which everybody wins thats very peculiar thats very unique if somebody were to fight scientology and win over scientology then everybody would lose including that person now any time you ascend above the level of games condition and get out of that mire this other thing takes place and thats what were looking at were looking at tremendous amount of force which is not the kind of force that you put behind bullets and in ballistics it is the force of reason it is the force of knowingness you might sayto use scientology phraseits theta and youre used to seeing man who was being good all of his life get sat on hard and squashed youre used to seeing this example in this universe this fellow was good and he got clobbered and this grasshopper was being good grasshopper and somebody squashed him and this bird was being good bird and somebody throttled him and it begins to look after while that goodness is not force it begins to look after while that goodness is weak and that evil is strong and of course thats the lesson which this universe would love to impart it doesnt happen to be true lesson evil is not strong it is weak let give you an example once upon time there was central organization i saw that it was failing financially and realized suddenly that it was not giving service to the publicnot giving service to the public it was using the technology of scientology internally on favored few and not giving service to the public of course it was failing in all directions because the one thing you darent do is not audit it must audit this organization if its there it must give service its its only reason for being everybody was about to get very mad at this organization if it had gone very much further it would have probably gone bankrupt so i was apprised of this very suddenly and also apprised of the fact that this organization had failed to file certain papers with the government there were great many administrative omissions and so i sent them cable and i put the association secretary of that organization into the hgc to find goals on hgc pcs because the hgc was all stacked up with people for their goals to be found you see had long lists of people but of course they couldnt do anything about it because there was nobody there to find goals took the staff clearing auditor put that person into the hgc to find goals they were both saint hill graduates that was all there was there told them to start finding peoples goals and turn in the proper reports into the government this happens to be the entire length and extent of the perception and the directions given to counteract it are those unwise orders i dont think you would think so perfectly reasonable orders just get busy and give some service and youll be solvent and everything will be fine see but evil must triumph somebody there sent out whole string of telegrams to everybody they could lay their hands on to cable as to how these orders and directions were all bad and couldnt be obeyed and that they were about to follow anything i told them to do except what i directed them to do something like that theyre perfectly faithful to and were perfectly willing to follow my orders while not having followed any of my orders for some time well i know what im doing that was perfectly valid direction with perfectly valid goal in the end in view and exactly what happened im not setting this up as anything in the way of anything that i personally can do it get off that line i mean im just talking about theta communication you see theyre told to start clearing the publicwhich is very theta action i think you would agreeand to straighten it out and turn in the accounts and things like that they were supposed to turn in thats all they were told to do you see and then somebody sends out telegrams in all directions tries to get everybody excited as to how this is the most terrible and awful thing that could possibly happen to them and drags somebody else into itwho wasnt even part of this picture by the way and who was going to stay down clear at the other end of the continent just because you had to have somebody to wear that hat while this organization straightened itself out and honest to pete the explosion is something to behold i every now and then i got ahold of this in 1950 there was somebody cutting line in the new jersey organization somebody cutting line you can always derive power by taking theta line and tapping it and holding it up dont you see theres always certain amount of power residual in the line and can be transferred to the person you see by tapping this line and blocking it but at that time knowing pretty well the mechanics of this situation i made remark to some of the auditors around that by golly that was just about the most adventurous thing for anybody to do i had ever heard of and i said the end product would be that the guy will explode and spatter all over the landscape i actually didnt take any action believe i took action of any kind whatsoever and few weeks later this guy spattered all over the landscape it was just pale pink mist nobody did anything to him you understand what im talking about is the mechanics of the situation these have intrigued for more than dozen years somebody tries to stop theta line or buck theta line and the resultant explosion is something fantastic now so far as anybody knows at this exact moment of reporting all is in order down there all these orders are being carried outthe exact orders which i gave youeverything is smoothing out like mad but the jolt is what im talking about because of the slowness of surface and air mail letters concerning this explosion are beginning to land in other places and some people are quite shuwere quite shaken up getting reports of what happened you see but in actual fact the explosion occurred it wasnt that i said this line you get the idea im not telling you that but those were just very valid actions see theyre very valid actions clear the public and file your account statements see very valid orders and somebody tried to horse them up and throw red herrings around and mess it up and tried to stop those orders from occurring and honest to pete the explosion was fantastic wasnt even an experiment on my part its something i count on and it occurs that if something like that something very sensible that somebody is asked to doif they dont do it something happens something weird happens theres funny magic concerning this sort of thing now how would an organization get in that shape in the first place by individuation an organization pulls off few overts pulls off few more overtsi dont mean pulls them off i mean it commits themcommits few more overts and gets into bit of games condition with other organizations around and the next thing you know starts considering itself something strange and different and it cant talk well anymore and it cant communicate well anymore and it cant function or perform anymore now this cycle of individuation by overt is very interesting phenomenon it is amongst you you see this you see this every day on casual walk through town you will see examples of individuation by overts overts of course are normally followed by withholds that is the still after the confusion all withhold is is the still after the confusion there is the confusion which is followed by the still so youve got the stable datum isvery likely to be much of the time whatever somebody happened to think after the fighting was over see not necessarily the thing that held it all straight at all but it isyou get an apparency that it is stable datum well lets take this battle has been going on and all of sudden accidentally why cavalry horse rides across the scene and trips over into machine gun nest and wipes it out and the other side says you know he says to the fellows around himall the shootings over you see its awful quiawful quiet all of sudden and he says by golly you know that must have been by divine intervention some hidden hand must have directed that cavalry horse across the battlefield and dumped him into that machine gun nest you see to obliterate it all now if you look on this its hell of an overt against the cavalry horse to go dropping him in on top of machine gun nests and all sorts of things how about the cavalry horses rider he must have gotten shot and messed up some place or other we look around here we find really nothing but overts and we dont find any divine intervention involved with it i dont think god would muddy his hands up with that kind of thing see if you subscribe to the big thetan theory but heres this point the other fellows around this soldier as the years go on they look back at that battle and theyre all at this still stuck point see we won the battle by divine intervention they can invent all kinds of fancy stories as to how divine intervention divined at that particular moment you know it materialized in the sky forty feet tall you see and all kinds of odd things occurred right at that exact moment and all these things happened and we get stories coming out of wars time after time after time which are the most miraculous things you ever listened to well theres one fellow said that religion had saved him and he had been saved utterly in the war and he carried around with him little ymca bible and slug had gone into it and torn halfway through it and had stopped just before it enteredor exited from the bible you see and shot him in the heart and obviously his life had been saved by the bible dont you see you can see it now this guybig state of shock hes in state of withhold hes in state of what happened and he reaches you know to feel the blood and he pulls out the bible and he looks at it and it you know there it is this is the quiet moment well that one will tend to stick dont you see that sticks the incident right there nicely tsk well the story is perfectly all right except i knew sailor one time who collected pornographic pictures and he had so you see his still after that ah well anyway thats rather risque and bawdy and blasphemous and that sort of thing anyway the only point im trying to bring in here is you get the overt followed by the withhold and the withhold becomes an action that is it becomes dramatized it becomes source of action that sounds very funny but its the withhold that becomes the source of action not the overt very peculiar anatomy pr show you how that happens bill shoots joe and then doesnt tell the police now the way that happened was is he fired the shot bill fell dead and he thought immediately afterwards his rage now evaporating you see he said my god what have i done i mustnt tell the police so this becomes monitoring datum see shooting bill doesnt really become the monitoring datum but not telling the police does he doesnt necessarily dramatize you see the killing what he does dramatize is not telling the police so now hes not sure what he mustnt tell the police as time goes on and he begins to imagine that hes guilty of many things and in order to get rid of the source of pronouncement of his guilt he will then commit many more overts and each time he commits one of these overtsdo you see the substance of i mustnt tell the policehe might as well have said i am different than and distinct from the police see hes made declaration of individuation now in actual fact in the field of action he mustnt be bill bill is full of holes bleeding and dead and he is not thing to be so we get our individuation there in the field of action joe shoots bill and then has to realize also that hes different than bill so right on the same action we get differentiation an individuation of self from the shot person and an individuation of self from the society all in one fell swoop so actually heres two withholds and one of those withholds is sneaky one now he can possibly remember and give you the withhold i mustnt tell the police but this other is an action unarticulated lowlevel lowconsciousness sort of withhold and that is that he mustnt be bill see thats by example he mustnt be bill yet theres sort of low order decision in that too so here you get individuation do you see that by the commission of an overt we get an individuation thats the only point im trying to make and the more different and the more separate we are of course the less we can communicate and certainly the less we can understand if you want to see somebody really estúpido completely incapable of whats the score find something find anything on which this person has bunch of overts and ask him to explain it to you and that is just about the most hilarious activity you ever wanted to engage in and some mathematician with very fancy eye for equations perhaps someday would like to do this well i did it once i never bothered to keep the notes but i derived all mathematics from affinity reality and communication all mathematics can be derived of whatever kind from those three factors its really fantastic affinity reality and communication thisyoure working in the field of symbolic logic you see youre using instead of numbers youre using meanings you work these things out but you can derive all mathematics from arc you can derive all parts of life from arc and therefore you can derive all understanding from arc and the complete complement of an understanding is arc in the absence of arc there is understanding of course if you havethe reductio ad absurdumno knowledge whatsoever of affinity reality or communication if theres affinity reality and communication there can be knowledge do you see that you get knowledge as the end result of this the fellow has never felt anything for it he has never seen it and hes never heard about it thats sure he doesnt know thing about it do you see that as fact theres an iron bolt let us say buried twentyfive feet deep out in the field in front of the manor house and for the last three hundred years nobodys felt anything about it nobodys felt it and nobodys seen it and there isnt even via on which these is done such as disguised in old records or something like thattheres bolt as far as youre concerned you see so you have to have r and c to know anything now the lower ones or the lower ones r the lower ones c the less one knows about anything its very very remarkable people consider those things dangerous which theyre afraid to communicate with well whats their definition of dangerousness afraid to communicate with now you can make people you can always reverse these decisions this might be interesting to you you can always make person feel he has done something if he has withhold about it thats an interesting mechanic of the mind now lets say we tell this person were going to burn him which i think is the highest level of arc achieved by governments were going to burn him in the electric chair see or something like that and do you know this fellow will turn around and dream up who hes murdered i tell you this is fact hell come around on the other side of the thing and hell dream up crime to fit the punishment hell get delusions about it hell keep protesting his innocence but hell go and sit down in quiet and wonder just who he did kill see this is quite remarkable in other words if the punishment exists therefore the crime must have existed you see that we can work almost anything backwards this way and human being will begin to believe the other thing let give you an example i tell all of you carefully when you come up to the desk or come by the desk or during the daytime when youre in this room to be very very very very careful not to touch this black wire dont touch that black wire i tell you this every lecture even though you knew it was joke do you know that sooner or later youd begin to believe that wire was dangerous you get ththis is the reverse action dont you see peoples definition of dangerousness is something you dont want to communicate with very much see so you just turn it around and you say to them dont communicate with this very much and theyll believe its dangerous you see how you can reverse ends the mind is very funny it normally operates on twopole conclusions in other words theresone conclusions dependent on another conclusion you see the crudest example of this somebody walks up to you and saysthey say youre scientologist what is that is it like t well of course youre stuck at this point to describe scientology because of course it isnt like anything theres never before been scientology so therefore there isnt another scientology extant in the society to compare scientology to and therefore the logical pattern and the communication pattern breaks down at that point and leaves you stammering you say well its not like christian science and its not like religion its really not like buddhism its not like see you can define it by negatives and then they will begin to believe it isnt and your combatif you look back on some of the things youve done in the past of assertions of this character is just to deny the similarity you find yourself in big argument of denying the similarity of course all the time you were talking you were actually saying scientology isnt to the other person thats the way the other person understood it you see if theresor they say oh its like christian science and you say its not like christian science christian science believes that and we go on and on and potter around about it and so forth we all the time are saying that scientology doesnt exist because its not like anything then we wonder mysteriously why the other person isnt interested in what weve been talking about you must always dream up something scientology is just like you want to talk to people about scientology realize that logic is twopole there are two sides to an equation there must be comparison theres data of comparable magnitude to enter an understandingall of these oh whole stream of these things i could go into there must be comparable data they understand something about something and therefore scientology must be compared to the something something and then they understand scientology because its compared to you see well this is quite an interesting quite an interesting complication because you could get over it every time if you realized that you had to compare scientology to something the only thing you have to do is make up your mind of what youre going to compare scientology to so the other person will understand it well the more agreement or the more familiarity or the more arc which he has with the thing youre going to compare scientology to the better he is going to understand scientology so you always compare scientology to himself this sounds idiotic but let us say oh he says scientology what is that like whatwhat is that like well he really means what is that like he wants datum of comparable magnitude and you would be amazed how often you would get away with this crude unthinkably cruderendition of this well its like you youd just be amazed how often this would intrigue the person its almost an idiots argument from that point thereon you say well its like you and hed say well how is it like well you want things better dont you everybody does i dont care what theyre doing in life mans basically good and underneath all of this got to gyp em all or something of this sort why youre going to find some impulse that so on the fellow says oh yes im trying to make things better all right scientologys trying to make things better you get that you say all right now you probably have lot of basic wisdom about life maybe lot of it is out of sight maybe its buried and so forth but nevertheless you have lot of wisdom about life youve been around youve observed things youyou know certain things guy says thats right you say well scientologys just like you in that respect youd like to be free youd like to be out of whatever mess youre in well scientology wants that you get this this sounds like weird argument but you would be surprised how much appeal even the argument rendered that blatantly and that nuttily that crudely would appeal to the bank manager or the janitor herejustguy would say yeah thats right im trying to make things better scientologys trying to make things better i had an uncle who was thirtythird degree mason and scottish rite and other odd things and dianetics and scientology were never quite right with him but he finally figured out that we were trying to do exactly what they were trying to do in the scottish rite and after that hes figured out its all right you couldnt now disabuse him of the fact that wed do everything that is done in the scottish rite we dont but that is his channel of understanding and hed have to be processed before hed change his mind now i dont even think he knows what he means by this but hes satisfied with it because he has familiarity with therefore something is shown to him to be like then he understands this something that was like except he didnt really understand it but he has tendency to understand it in other words arc then monitors understanding to this degree now in the absence of any arc you have observation or knowledge of thats the unobtainable absolute of course but this isthe something exists but you have affinity for it and reality about it and youve never communicated on the subject so you dont know that it exists all right lets take the next level of that something that you feel something about and you have tiny reality on you have an idea it exists and youve communicated to its vicinity slightlysee you wont have very much understanding of that thing understanding of it will be poor but youll know it exists oh im give you an idea im sure that you realize there is british constitution and probably constitutional society of some kind or another lf theres constitution theres usually constitutional society of some kind or another thats supposed existence you could understand that you got an idea that you might be capable of understanding that but you dont know what you should understand about it see you dont really know it exists but you think it probably exists and therefore if it did exist you could understand about it do you get how this works out well thats very thin fringe into the range of understanding now you go up through all of theall of the misemotional buttons on the subject of understanding and you get various understandings theres an understanding goes along with each one of these things even if one only understands that it is bad one understands something about it and this moves up into total understanding now if you have total arc you would have total understanding and if you want to know the road to wisdomthe road to wisdom of course presupposes situation which the buddhist would interpret as nirvana that is part of everything to understand everything youd have to be part of everything its marvelous booby trap man because thats the reverse of individuation enforced association so just as an individual can back away and become individuated from something he can also enforcedly move on into it and obsessively become it so theres two sides to this pattern now oddly enough this follows cycle with an overt with the first overt usually quite unintentional you begin the cycle of individuation from something and then that individuation cycle winds up with reverse and person obsessively becomes what he is fighting how many of you in auditing your pcs have run into your pcs oppterm well the pc associates himself with his own oppterm and youll find this in varying degrees sometimes the pc believes absolutely hes his own oppterm sometimes the pc merely hates his own oppterm see theres varying attitudes from pc to pc you do dynamic assessment and youll get different degree of obsessed association or obsessed beingness of the oppterm and individuation from the oppterm you get this in varying degrees it varies from pc to pc one pc is more his oppterm than another and another pc is more individuated from his oppterm than others do you see youll see this phenomenon throughout existence now this fellow has been committing overtsyou know that onethe old one about tend to become what you resist well lets clarify that and put it with more truth one certainly will become that eventually which he has overts on if he obsessively continues overts against certain target and goes the whole gamut hes been shooting penguins thats the only thing he really does well he shoots penguins he shoots penguins and he shoots penguins and one day you pick him up and he says im penguin now he actually hasnt just directly interiorized into the penguin by the overt actually he has through overts has individuated from because of the withholds he has from them and so forth hes individuated from the penguins and become more and more individual he is himself and penguins are penguins you see and more and more more and more individuated and then his wheels start to skid see hes got this rubber band now stretched as far away from penguins as he can get it stretched and his efforts now to stretch it actually contract it and every time he tries harder not to be penguin he skids little bit forward to become slightly more penguin you see that whole cycle thats very interesting cycle thats cycle of beingness and overts the relationship to the individuals beingness an overt act has yeah you go out here and you shoot sparrow you dont become sparrow but lets say you just had ball and you got up to point where you just had to and all of this logic is backing it up how you have to shoot sparrows and you do shoot sparrows and you go on shooting sparrows and you go on shooting sparrows i almost died one time iyou cant laugh in peoples faces directly the most comical incident i think thats happened to in many monthsthe most comical thing i have seenmanylong time ago i was up at lowestoft little town up on the north sea and couple of herring merchants were getting rid of some of their ships so i wanted to buy one of these ships you know their names didnt sound like herring but i met these fellows the pair of them and of course they have run since time immemorial fleet of herring boats and man this pair had everything but gills theyif herring ever talked they would talk just like that you know their whole facial structure was that of herring who was it that illustrated dickens you know that boy couldnt have done better job of portraying herring it was interesting that their method of handling things were sort of herring methods they were sort of resistive to being slaughtered but it was inevitable i offered small sum of money for the boat and sailed it away and they knew they had to sell it that was enough of lose so they knew they had to sell it this is the result of something like that you see i dont know what theyll pick up in their next life but sooner or later anyway to make long story short this is the cycle of individuation and obsessed beingness and that cycle is very interesting to you because you start picking up sight of it with the dynamic and you get very clear view of it straight in the teeth when you get the item and that is exactly how the person got there and is exactly how the meter rock slams now lets go back and talk about organizations for moment somewhere along the line there was an inadvertent overt by this organization and that built up and then they became more and more different and they became more and more different and they became more and more different and if theyd been permitted to go on this they would have become sort of lowerlevelwhich i think they actually had become sort of lowerlevel beingness you see they could go through whole cycle and come back to becoming an apparency do you know that thetan will actually run whole cycle on clear this way and you pick him up on the meter hes sitting exactly at 2 0 dead thetan well thats how he got there hes run the whole cycle now hes obsessively being what he started out to be see hes obsessively being what he once was part of hes relatively unprocessable youll have more trouble with that character than with any other i am intrigued by this you see hes now fake thetan and so that organization would have become fake organization fantastic you come to think about it would have been lowerlevel clear mockery now ive looked over very carefully this and the organization plan that says that this scientologist is field auditor and that scientologist is staff member and therefore of different breeds and areas and that this central organization is johannesburgs or melbournes or something and ive picked up very fruitful source of inadvertent withholds if were planning anything broad in the way of organizations the first thing we have to take out of is the incipient individuation otherwise were going to wind up with fake scientology which will enslave the multitudes the hco 10 percent is for instance bid for individuation see it says well 90 percent of this is ours and 10 percent of this is yours so therefore you must be different than doesnt that sort of get understood at this line im not at this moment wiping out that and so forth because were dealing with thewere dealing with 1970 whats it going to look like in 1970 well the first rule that one must apply to it is that all the way around this planet its got to be just one organization and that is scientology and you look at this you find that every organization breaks down into individuations and messes up and so forth they have strength and they dont stand but when they finally do stand why theyre sort of false mockery of what they started out to be they say that an organizations ethic is never stronger than it is at its inception that is comment that is made very sadly by peoplephilosophers along this line theres reason why its ethic shouldnt be much higher than at its inception therefore i dont see that its possible looking out across the years for organizations to be different than other organizations in scientology to be different than the central organization to be different than the international organizationto be different than dont you see because youve set up the incipiency of the inadvertent withhold the inadvertent overt may follow and then you get cycle there which will follow on through and everybody will wind up under the sword being the scientology organization or get your head cut of inevitably that would occur but nobody would be free and you really wouldnt have scientology and the way to set it up is set it up as close to the fact as that not happening and then keep it picked up along the line and you get an organization that looks something like this would you like to take look at the future on that about 1970might look very much like this the basic building block would be the district office i dont care what that district office is called whether or not its the suburban center or the this or the that but the district office and it covers only few square miles of houses if that it is tiny its influence is in terms of oh ten thousand people greater than that but that is your basic building block and it has building which is provided for it which has an assembly hall and it has some offices and it has couple of individual processing rooms and it has reception area and you know its little hall actually with some offices attached to it and that is district organization in charge of it is an administrator who is an administrative person and who although he may be trained auditor isstill belongs to the administrative side of the picture so you have the administrative side of the picture and the technical side of the picture running throughout this you get occasional swaps across from one to the other but nevertheless they are distinct branches of action theres two distinct actions the administrator is to keep things there and keep it paid and keep the place clean keep the people walking in and out and handle the money and the mest and that sort of thing and the technical side of it is to keep them processed and keep them happy and so forth thats all the technology of scientology so this little center is actually in the charge of an administrator and he has couple of receptionists they relieve each other and they sort of act as the mail clerk and the switchboard operator and his private secretary and anything else you can think of you see this is all in vignette and alongside of this administrator theres secretary there and you call her the hco secretary actually shes the librarian and theshe handles all the book stocks and she issues the publications and she does checkouts and examinations shes very busy person she wears all factors of an hco actually all in her own vest pocket you see and shes there actually to make sure that the material is available and stays straight and so forth shes not even there to see that any money is collected or anything like that shes just there to see that the materials right and that the material has library materials and you know thats ityou know that you have adequate supplies of these things and to be able to get on the telex and communicate with other organizational centers and that sort of thing because these things are all hooked up one to the other communicationwise well of course theres also janitor and theres maid and theres two technical crews and these two crews consist of two hcas or hpas depending on where you are and saint hill graduate and one of these crews is senior to the other crew depending on length of time that theyve been auditing and so forth so actually have two crews and iteach one is composed of one saint hill graduate and two hpahca level people and the senior technical member is the senior saint hill graduate that is the senior technical member in this particular unit and what do they all do for living thats very simple they engage in mass clearing this is easy this is the easiest one to do so thats what they do and theyve got this little specially built building thats exactly tailormade to their exact requirements to handle this sort of thing and what odds and ends of things do they handle well they dont handle many odds and ends of things because thats all handled for them in the city office which is mainly an administrative center doesnt do anything else its got big account system and it pays all their bills and pays their salary and banks their money and does everything for them you wonder how little district office like thats going to make any money or get forward or handle anything well there are several ways that this takes place and several ways they go about this the main way they go about this is they have an afternoon coaudit and an evening coaudit six nights week and one afternoon coaudit goes of course mondaywednesday friday the other afternoon coaudit goes tuesdaythursdaysaturday one evening coaudit goes on mondaywednesdayfriday and the other evening co audit goes tuesdaythursdaysaturday and you have the mondaywednesday friday crew under one saint hill graduate and two hpas and receptionist and you have the other tuesdaythursdaysaturday people under the other technical crew in other words stagger their week days now what happens well if you look over the economics of this situation it becomes rather interesting because at fifty people in each one of these coaudits you have two hundred people in that center week this is not going to be very difficult to manage there are various ways of recruitment there are various other ways of going about this but the truth of the matter is that at ten dollars week this gets to be rather staggering piece of income thats lot of money ten dollars per person per week thats all youre charging them to go clear well of course youd never charge them ten dollars per person per week the cost would undoubtedly be much higher than that but they enroll in the coaudit and theyre fed on through doesnt cost them anything extra to have their goal found and so forth you just have this coaudit and you kick them out the other end clear its just assembly line clearing they do coauditing in the meantime and so forth technologys going to get even faster youll find goals faster they found out eight goals i think in one week down in bulawayoa couple of saint hill graduates working down there right now so anyhow you see how fast that assembly line could work but the funny part of it is its staggering amount of income it makes saint hill graduate capable in center of earning 250 dollars week or maybe 100 quid week that would be looked on as rather ordinary income it means this is your woolworth aspect this clears everybody and the funny part of it is the woolworth aspect is where it makes the money not taking lot of money from one or two people and as far as i can see thats the basic building block and it goes into an administrative center in the middle of that city and youve got an hca or hpa academy set up with the central organization and youve got some hospitals around which give clinical processing and your big central organizations or your continental organizations are mainly administrative aside from running this little academythis academy that takes care of that continent and then you have your international organization it runs university and doesnt do any processing and it all just feeds through there arent 10 percents and exchanges and whats mine and whats yours and so forth and somebody the biggest crime that has beenever been pulled off is an auditor gets an area all stirred up and interested and then he departs well so somebody in scientology gets tired of being in lower south amboy well they can always be transferred to chicago oh say guy says im awful tired of being here i want to go to chicago and you say well all right why dont you write chicago and they write chicago and chicago would say yeah wed be happy to have you and you go to chicago now thered be money all over the place as far as i can see and in the central organizationjust looking little bit further ahead than thattherell be political officer you want to know what happens when you clear everybody in that neighborhood the only thing that center can become used for is political center because by the time youve done all this you are the government and youll never be able to refuse it therefore these things should be provided for and this thing should be looked over and everybody in scientology should be eared for and the idea of asking for somebody to go out and sweat it through and stumble and fall on his head and collect his funds and that sort of thingthat day should very soon come to an end it hasnt come to an end yet im just giving you little glimpse of 1970 and it looks to like world that someone could walk down the street in the situation between us now and that then is far closer together than you might think at this present moment its just within an ace of coming true any comments you have upon what ive said i would certainly like to hear because this is your world too thank you
