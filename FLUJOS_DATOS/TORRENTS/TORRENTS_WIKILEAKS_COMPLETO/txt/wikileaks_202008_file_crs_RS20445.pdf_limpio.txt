its founding in 1919 several child labor minimum age conventions were among the first adopted by the ilo despite the efforts of many through the years child labor continues to be problem in countries around the world while much of it can be considered apprenticeship or family related work there is growing concern that enslavement abduction and other forced child labor is increasing there is growing public awareness that children are laboring in dangero us occupations from underground mining to smuggling and prostitution information that products purchased by americans are being made by children in such conditions has also led to increased concern in congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20445crs2 2 much of the information in this paper comes from the international labor office international program on the elimination of child labor ipec action against child labor geneva october 1999 httpwwwiloorgpublicenglishstandardsipecalthough all estimates of child labor are of questionable accuracy the ilo estimates that there are 250 million children between the ages of 5 and 14 working in developing countries ilo statistics dont include children working in industrialized countries about half work full time as many as 50 to 60 million of the working children between 5 and 11 are engaged in hazardous work the largest number of working children are in asia 61 of the total while 32 are in africa and 7 are in latin america in terms of percent of children working about 41 of all the children of africa are working while 22 of the children of asia and 17 in latin america work2 international program for the elimination of child labor the ilo has technical assistance program to help governments eliminate child labor the international program for the elimination of child labor ipec was established in 1991 with grant from the german governmen t and began operating in 1992 in 6 countries it has since developed into the largest operational technical cooperation program in the child labor field according to ipec in mid 1999 ipec had child labor programs in 37 countries paid for by 19 donor countries the european community and 4 other nongovernmental labor organizations an additional 30 countries called preparatory countries are working with ipec to determine their needs and develop child labor programs but have not yet begun child labor programs in cooperation with ipec this growth reflects both growing demand for help in addressing child labor and increased financial support from international donors ipec is considered one of the most successful ilo technical assistance programs and it is being used as an example for developing ilo technical assistance programs in other areas of the 37 countries currently participating in ipec programs to reduce child labor 15 are in latin america 10 are in asia 10 are in africa and 2 turkey and albania in europe how ipec works ipec is technical assistance program that is requested by government and carried out with the support of the government with workforce still under 100 persons ipec is an advisory rather than an operational agency during the 199899 biennium ipec had 20 officials at headquarters in geneva and 60 in the field when governments decide to address child labor problems ipec helps them to gather together government and labor representatives indigenous voluntary agencies and other relevant organizations ipec funding supports the gathering of statistical information to determine the child labor situation in the country and assists concerned parties within the country to devise policies that become part of national plan to address the specific child labor problems of that country the government and the ilo generally sign memorandum of understanding to indicate government commitment to implementing the policies adopted by the national committees and to cooperate in taking steps to eliminate child labor ipec also evaluates the country programs both internally and in cooperation with the donor and recipient government staff countries are encouraged to ratify and enforce both ilo conventionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20445crs3

expenditures by budget period138 on minimum age for employment and 182 on eliminating the worst forms of child labor the ipec programs create model for child labor programs customized to the country for children in particular work situations ipecs premise is that child labor can only be eliminated in country locally through locally generated activities and domestic political will in the long term it is important to have national policies and programs of action against child labor ipecs goal is to strengthen the capacities of governments and local indigenous organizations to continue to address these problems throughout the country after the multiyear ipec program ends ipec also realizes the child labor is more than labor problem it must be addressed on the socioeco nomic educational developmental and cultural fronts simultaneously by many participants children work for many reasons among them are lack of available schooling lack of adequate employment for adults and lack of local law enforcement of child labor kidnaping and other relevant statutes ipec works as catalyst or leader to unite the natural allies opposing child labor pulling together the expertise and funding of organizations local and national government agencies labor unions and organizations private voluntary organizations and child welfare groups ipec works with the world bank the internati onal monetary fund the world trade organization unesco unicef the committee on human rights working group on contemporary forms of slavery and the committee on the rights of the child through representation of labor and business organizations in the ilo ipec is also able to gain cooperation with employer and worker organizations at the international regional and local levels because funds are limited and the child labor problems so great ipec programs focus on the most abusive and exploitive forms of child labor enslaved or bonded child laborers very young working children children in dangerous occupations and especially girls in these conditions as of the end of 1997 36 of ipec programs targeted children working in hazardo us conditions 37 doing hazardous work and 15 in forced labor situations ipec estimates that during 199899 130000 children in 5000 families benefitted directly from ipec programs of these nearly 30 were withdrawn from work prevented from being trafficked or provided with safer work environment twenty percent were placed in regular schools the remaining children benefitted from other services such as work based schooling vocational training and health services funding as an ilo technical assistance program ipec programs are funded almost entirely by voluntary contributions from donors ipec programs are multiyear programs the early donors provided contributions for data collection and program planning as well as specific programs some governments still provide funds for these core expenditures in recent years however many governments have chosen to contribute to particular programs in specific countries this is the way thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20445crs4 3 us department of labor office of public affairs usdl 99372 december 22
