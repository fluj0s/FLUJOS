r2h assessment lecture given on 8 august 1963 thank you this is the what audience 8th of august the 8th of august ad 13 the figure 8 is symbol of money actually its original derivation was two moneybags one sitting on the other and when pythagoras came back why he gave us this datum and here we are in greece at the apex of the newest and the best numerology oh its the wrong lecture hall you have to laugh when you consider what man has considered knowledge to be at periods in the past all right here we are saint hill special briefing course and today i have some good news for you and this is the evolution of list one for r2h im going to show you how you can evolve list one matter if you have landed in the middle of pangopango or something of this sort and you dont have textbook to your name you can evolve list one now this has really taken some doing i dont mean to exaggerate itd be impossible to exaggerate the difficulties which have beentold you yesterday in yesterdays lecturea process with new rationale theres new rationale connected with that process this actually is the level ii process case level 2 and r2h really goes into both channels but isnt just headed at otthis gives you your clear way stop because you can move up this process and sooner or later youre going to start seeing free needlesand that kind of phenomena is very likely to occur in running this particular process not necessarily with every case some cases are going to run so headon into gpm that youre going to have to shift to 3n in order to carry out that particular gpm and then shift back to 2h just as you can shift from r3r over to 3n and back again well given the fact that you could shift over to 3n and back to r2h youre dealing now with case level 1 process this will boot them all the way on up the line but if you are dealing with just your normal course of human events and just avoid any ideas of gpmsdont bother with trying to clear up track in that particular directionundoubtedly the pc will come back off the track and youll start getting keyout phenomena you see how that process might very well theoretically branch in other words you keep on running the process itself you eventually make track that looks pretty straight and pretty clean and gives you an apparency of case level 2 which is clear see and that would be with the benefit of keyout and free needle and you probably find the phenomena and this is probably because you understand this has not been done by this process but we have done so many of these that its pretty easy to predict on process line and you would get phenomenon which looked very likethis is just pure r2h see youd get phenomenon that looked very like case level 2 however its keyedout case level 2 the persons whole track really isnt available to them but it would give you all the attributes of clear by all of its definitions all right now if you introduce into it the factor that when you collide with gpm youre going to shift over into 3n then youve got one that goes to case level 1 in other words you could take r2h combine it with 3n when necessary and wind up at case level 1 you understand that this process has this branchforkin the roads now therefore it unexpectedly joins up with what were calling now and you arentreally havent started calling it yetbut scientology three scientology three was more or less suspended in favor of scientology four the levels of scientology theres been recent policy letter out which divided scientology up into five levels and there was scientology one thats for the public thats your pe level scientology and were putting out plea to one and all to please contribute any data they think is vital and necessary to be in this and then theres scientology two which is healing which we havent had too much to do with thats care of the body and so forth and hpahca levels probably get quite bit of scientology two and then theres scientology three and thats advanced auditing advanced academy courses that sort of thing leading up to the area of clear such phenomena as weve had in the past now it doesnt happen to be well wrapped up area because we jumped off of that area to go into scientology four and this occasioned even some of you quite few headaches because there was necessary speedup in research and the place to research toward of course was ot now thats scientology four and the material which youre learning right now is scientology four and then there is scientology five and scientology five is the social political organizational levels of scientology this is takeoff from the level of ot and that isnt just scientology applied to political problems that would be misnomer although it would read like that in textbook and so forth that isnt that at all its actually what does an ot do about it that makes quite different subject doesnt it so anyway it is of interest to have picked up some of the earlier work at scientology three and carried it forward to something of conclusion now youre not really interested in routine 2hand it probably ought to be redesignated youre probably not interested in routine 2h which is by the way also applicable at scientology two dont you seesome other version of it much easier to do something like that youre interested as r2h applies to scientology four which is ot now i want to point out to you and this is just side note here that these things fit with classifications as they exist today see so you have class i auditor he can listen and you have class ii well he could probably cure something up and run repetitive processes and you know cchs something like this reach and withdraw you have scientology three type auditor well he could make better human being thats the level of the better human being scientology four class iv auditor youre heading for ot and five were heading for sane universe so this compares with your classifications and i think you will find that its very neat to have the subject organized like this for instance you can slap onto the covers of textbooks one right after the other scientology one perfectly safe issue for general public dont you see for instance we have newspaper reporter prowling around right now and were feeding him scientology one which of course is about all he should have anything to do with and he doesnt know even what hes looking at see right now he thinks he came down here to investigate our marriages crazy you know anyway hes got copy of regs book and he probably looked at its title i hope and he probably read something of that were getting this thing in some kind of order however were getting this thing squared away one way or the other hes looking for sensationalism so well give him sensationalism at level i do you see it brings little more order to the subject instead of just its all spattered out across these lines why we can subdivide it into its materials and this only becomes possible because we are reaching up at high level of attainment in each one of these levels we have quite bit of accomplishment in the lower levels and we need codifications and publications and in republishing and codifying and that sort of thing we need designations now its very baffling for you to have process which moves on up through more than one of these levels which attains different things at different levels and so on and it is phenomenal to have such process at all it moves around it handles the thing called an arc break well there are many ways you could handle the thing called an arc break there are probably many versions of processes which you could handle arc breaks with so youll probably see this material splintering off into these various levels arc just the explanation of what arc is is level i you see perhaps specific and directed arcs at various body parts and that sort of thing and perhaps ow and that sort of thing would constitute healing applications of arc and at clear level of course youre trying to raise somebodys arc you can do some remarkable things with picking up their arc breaks in this lifetime it would be quite phenomenal to do that well arc has been with us for quite while and to push the levels or demandsof arc this highthe theory of arc the triangle of affinity reality and communicationto push that much stress onto it and say all right lets try to push this into scientology four otwell thats really asking for few blown gaskets because its obvious that if this much stress is put on the theory of arc then any slightest frailty in any scale is going to show up in other words youre really going to have to have the stuff there we havent been asking very much of this but now were asking everything of this and boy some of ournot very much of it fortunately but there were some holesthere were some holes in what we knew of arc it was you might say insufficiently embracive or insufficiently complete to do totality of work its all right to run machine let us sayyou can run machine just fine and it gets along fine and then you put more load on it you see and it starts to heat up little bit and its life seems to shorten and that sort of thing and you put little bit more load on it then any bad connection or any bit of weak metal in it is going to go spling you see and thats approximately whats happened to arc and the cdei scale now those two things togetherthose two things togetherneeded an overhaul and ive been overhauling these things empirically now r2h has only one frailty and that is the list you use for the assessment its the only frailty it has given an auditor who will listen given meter that will react given any kind of decent goodwill in the auditing session at allwell the machine is pretty tolerant in those parts you see r2h itll work just fine i mean you can even flub it and mess it up here and there and make mistakes with it and it doesnt break down the point where it just breaks down absolutely with crash would be wrong assessment list and if that assessment listit could have lot of things that werent necessary on it but if it lacked one single ingredient then the bypassed charge on the ease would not be located and you would succeed in restimulating the case at certain levels and the case would eventually move up to stuck tone arm because the charge would be wrongly placed and encysted here and there and the track wouldnt straighten out you see the liability of this in other words you could miss the charge on one arc break or another arc break without making the ease crash thats one or another arc break but if one specific very important type of charge was missing from the list on all arc breaks eventually that charge would overwhelm the pc and youd result in good high stuck tone arm and an arc broke pc and so forth in other words the limit of this particular process would be the embraciveness of the list which was used so there is the weak point of this process the list so i had to sweat and fume and fuss and fiddle and overhaul and try it again andive had some of the fanciest systems you know these things would make whole psychotherapy up at london university or wherever they teach the stuff here in england they would you know itd just be marvelous whole new systems of interlockings and all of this kind of thing beautiful the logic in them impeccable see but they didnt work that was all that was wrong with them like modern psychiatry its terribly convincing but doesnt work now that list with its liability of bogging case down if an important type of charge is missing you understand that you can miss the charge on an arc break and then get the next one well and then miss the real charge on the next arc break and get the next two well you see and you dont ruin anybody you see but if consistently that type of charge is missing on that list sooner or later your pc has had it see so what is the totality of the list what formula is it that makes this list completely embracive list well youll laugh when i eventually show you this thing because its always these simple things it seems like anybody can discover anything thats complicated i mean that seems to be very easy they go out and they discover the plutons running into the neurons and these fantastic chemical formulas that run on for eight pages and give you better lipstick its these simple things its these simple things wherein lies the genius of the situation you see theyre the ones that you can just take and knock your head off on and you come back to it what makes good auditor an auditor and weve eventually broken it back to five points and theyre all fundamental points and where you dont et auditing done in some hgc or something like that where youre supervising auditing you watch it you go back over those points and youll find out theres one or two of them are just madly outnot even slightly theyre just madly out but the reduction of auditing to just five basics is pretty wild now the breakdown of communication cycle and the breakdown of the auditing cycle and that sort of thingthese things are terribly simple but it takes some discovery like this itsa line im sure you sat there when you saw this itsa line and you said yeah yeah yeah of course you know simple well frankly when you discover these things you feel like complete idiot very selfinvalidative you know its like youve been running into this rock all the time and you finally come back and take look at it you say hey its rock you know and youve never noticed it nobody else has noticed it there its been see these are the discoveries that are something and its this type of discovery that finally wrapped up this other list so that it just springs engrams you know bang bang bang and you could put any kind of significance you ever heard of and you might still miss it on this list so i better give you the formula of derivation and this is derivation formula im going to give you the full derivation formula im not going to give you any little shorthanding of it you by the way dont use this full formula in making up list one but i can show you very trick system by which you could employ it without assessing forever see now it works like this the cdei scale has an upper and lower band and it was on this band that we all fell down now heres your cdei scale curiosity desire enforce inhibit youre very well aware of the cdei scale but thats only piece of the scale now we only needed that piece to do everything weve been doing up to this time and the missingness of the remainder of the scale was not something that destroyed empires but when we run into something like r2h and arc breaks if we havent got the whole scale here were in trouble well what is the whole scale here k uknow or known and unknown well look lets look it over lets look it over what about that know well know is alreadyyou had to postulate you didnt know up above it but that isnt unknown yet see the not know goes up above this the basic fourpostulate stuff is already in this stuff and we dont happen to need that because that simply measures ease gain this we do need known unknown why does that fit in how come its elementary my dear watson you never get curious about something you know about i mean its these damn fool idiot things see that so knowingness must have disintegrated because we know as case progresses its knowingness rises so as the case progresses its knowingness rises and therefore we must be running out unknownnesses and this tells us that things have to be unknown before you enter into the cdei scale at all that gets to be very interesting and youll find out very very interesting part of arc breaks is the unknownness you know the unknown datumweve even got it in our early logics an unknown can cause confusion and so forth and theres obviously where that belongs so thats part of your cdei scale oddly enough which is scale of the way one looks at things but that isnt the complete scale im sorry to have to get into this thing any further but whats that thats nothing nothing that belongs on the cdei scale believe it or not nothing its neither known nor unknown theres nothing there to inhibit enforce desire to be curious about to be unknown or to be known there just isnt anything there and that is pretty obvious too isnt it in fact its an idiotic obviousness its just an absence thats all youre notyou havent got something now to inhibit editors note starting at this point in the lecture ron made diagrams of some of these points these were issued in hcob 14 aug 63 lecture graphs which can be found in technical bulletins volume vii thats the black panther mechanism and you feel more idiotic about this thing appearing on this thing when you realize that its in book one its the black panther mechanism ignore it do nothing about it its just noaction level pretty grisly it doesnt mean arc were not into arc yet this is just well you can inhibit thingswell how about just doing nothing about them just nothing well of course thats one of these of course mechanisms because man routinely does nothing about things that is one of his best mechanisms in fact government on earth could be the way it is if they didnt specialize in this one do nothing about it until its too late or something of the sort which is again just doing nothing about it all right well thats fine but is there anything else on this scale well unfortunately this is the one man this is the one that broke the camels back this is the one weve talked about it we know it exists weve had it around i mean everybody knows about it but we know all about it and so weve never defined it but the basic part of this one was designating it finding some word that designated it that would communicatethat would communicate and its f falsify and after you do nothing about it theres nothing there you can falsify youre not inhibiting something you can falsify it youre not doing nothing about it youre falsifying it but of course that puts something else there so it tends to turn the whole scale up here again in an inversion see after youve gone down this whole scale how do you start it all over again well your k at the top known becomes false and then of course you dont know about falseness and then of course youre curious about you see the falsifications and so forth and this scale then turns round and round on that basis but its just the same scale now it now hits level after level after level after level all the way down by just running this one point so thats what makes the scale invert so its probability in this universe that you almost never see the k the whole scale probably lies below f that part of the arc scale then which most people are working with and so forth are below f so you see as you go downscale it requires all of those primary designations to bring about lower harmonics you see what i mean here let give you an example let give you an example of tremendously involved scale kwell do this very smallk u c d i 0 f u c d i 0 f u see this see whats happening here see theres your whole scale got it it goes on south perversions of perversions falsifications of falsifications dont you see you finally get modern scienceyou go far enough southall based on false premise that man is mud you see something like that and then you can go all the way see you get this now well thats how that thing inverts so there is it top k u c d i 0 fzero f its not an 0 its zero probably better be spelled with z and that is complete band and it takes each one of those levels to make complete band and as long as we only had the cdei scale this was very pure and very upscale but we couldnt deal with aberration we couldnt deal with the raw aberration of an engram because we didnt have enough lower inversions because the scale wasnt complete so we couldnt invert it there were more things in each band than we had and the things that were missing was known unknown at the top and down at the bottom zero and false and there we have total cycle you might say of the scale now again i show you that cycle can turn over again instead of known now you have false so it goes down toyou unknow falseness you see youre curious about falseness the desire of falseness the enforcement of falseness you see and then you get downthe inhibition of falseness and then falseness and then you get falseness about falseness you see that and you just keep on adding this up and you will get more and more and more and more involved lower levels i see youre sitting there bit stunned now what dont you dig out of this what do you see there that you dont understand seemed to to be perfectly obvious youre looking by the way at only one bandwhen you look at the full scale like that youre looking at only one band of the old tone scale thats shown up you can take science of survival the old tone scale of one kind or another and lets take one band lets drop down just one band lets go from 10 to 20 lets just take look at that lets say 20 to 10 and youre going to find all those levels between 20 and 10 and theyll be at some harmonic or another of the upper levels you see now where purea pure scalecall it the cdei scale just for lack of better term at this particular timeis so unimaginably high that its probably never envisioned its terrifically high and most of the scales that we see and so forth are already with falseness at knowingness see its false false false false look what they teach you in school george washington never cut down any cherry trees because he was an englishman and they are orchard men or something you wait youll just see that legend go along far enough and it will become blong see and itll go down another one see very interesting so all truth or actions or data or almost anything else goes down this cdei scale in that fashion known unknown curious desire enforce inhibit do nothing falsify do you see that now all right here we have our old friends r and c nothing to this here you have arc for the incident and here you havethats for the incident itself now were getting into r2hand then we have earlier incident got it and we have r and c for the earlier incident weve got it for the incident were working with and weve got it for an earlier incident see and you just do this and each one of those levels has six we have them for the incident we have them for the earlier incident got that and then just for fun in case they didnt get the word and so forth on each one we put this is for the purposes of really getting the thing scatted into sightwe put missed withhold and over here of course its an earlier missed withhold thats your list one let you digest that for minute thats list one now thats actually all possible levels that will have any reaction on anybody about anything thats an arc break laid out man each one known unknown curious desire enforce inhibit do nothing falsifyeach one of those levels has eight questions each one of those levels has eight questions and those eight questions are the incident attitude communication reality see the attitude reality communication and missed withhold and then is there an earlier incident with bypassed charge of the attitude the reality and the communication and the missed withhold see put the missed withhold in there just for kicks youll find out its bucketload of stuff now thats full list now you can add that up mathematically there are eight questions you can count them up theres one two three four five six seven eight there are eight questions for each level and there are eight levels and that chimes into my gag about the figure 8 beginning of the lecture and you have eight times eight and that gives you sixtyfour questions and thats all the questions there is thats total list onewould consist of sixtyfour separate questions do you see how to evolve this im teaching you how to evolve it im not trying to give you list theres somebody sitting back there saying well hes going to give us the list in moment and so on that isnt what im going to teach you im teaching you how to evolve this thing im assuming that youre on pango pango you have collided one way or the other with the wrong asteroid or something and youre trying to put scientology back together again and run some r2h on somebody and there you go how do you put list one together and there is your list one very important thing sixtyfour questions i actually at this stage of the game dont care what you do with the sixtyfour questions you see its just there is the totality of all possible combinations of an arc break charge thats all the charge there can be on an arc break now you can dream up whole bunch of additional ones oh you can dream up additional ones madly i dont care if you do maybe some of them will communicate maybe some of them wont but they will actually come back to this one and they will not be central charges that really are bypassed charges to amount to anything now this list this list with its sixtyfour questions gives you very interesting application possibilities so that you dont have to assess sixtyfour questions well lets assess the cdei scale first on the incident and then take the biggest read on that and then move that sideways onto its eight questions so that leaves you with totality for assessment of eight and eightsixteen questions im showing you there are trick systems by which you can break this thing down in other words you figure out some communicating name see for each one of these things well for instance enforce you put too much right now youre using the inhibit scale all the time all the time an attitude refused you see communication ignored thats really your inhibit scale and an unknown this and an unknown that and so forth but you can say was there something known about the incident was something unknown about the incident was there some curiosity about the incident was there some desire in the incident was there an enforcement in the incident was there an inhibition in the incident or you can enforcement you say too much something in the incident was it nothingness that upset you in the incident or was it something that was falsified now one of those things bangs and youve then got your standard scale which of course you could put it on separate little cards and its written up specially worded for the level it comes from see did that incident have an unknown attitude did it have an unknown reality was there an unknown communication in that incident was that restimulation of an earlier unknown attitude restimulation of an earlier unknown reality restimulation of an earlier unknown communication restimulation of earlier missed withhold of course the missed withhold questions are always the same not an unknown missed withhold see its just was there missed withhold now that would be quite remarkable system and youll find that system would work that system would work very well but it doesnt happen to be vital system to what youre doing it isnt vital that you do the system that way because whole bunch of these levels are null thats interesting they dont have significant charge on them and under the heading of significant charge you can cross off k u c d leaving you with i you can cross off zero and fyou can leave f now if youre just going to do short list thatll serve you in good stead then the only thing youre really going to leave on the list to amount to anything at all is i and f those are the most pregnant sources of arc breaks they upset people which gives you sixteenquestion list im showing you different ways by which you can handle this situation see im not giving you that as recommended action im just giving you different ways by which you can put together this same scale see you can find out and thats the truth youll find out that for this lifetime certainly i and fthey cause nearly all of your bypassed charge its because of the ease level youre dealing with dont you see and its monitored by other factors that leaves you here with i and f and nothing else thats going to worry your pc at least in the beginning stages then after little while youre going to find your list starts falling short there is something going on here now the list starts falling short and so forth and youll find out that you have to add too muchtoo much attitude see too much communication too much reality too real and you could expand it right back on out again and you start processing somebody around case level 2 that has actually attained case level 2 youre going to find yourself with greatly fanned out listgreatly fannedout im just showing you there are various ways by which you can put this thing together now you can probably scratch your head and get into it and develop yourself quite fancy system of identifying the type of charge and assessing that particular type of charge only thing im trying to put to you is the fact that if youve got something missing on list one youve had it because that tone arm is eventually going to go up and stick and i dont say yet that somebody three quarters of the way up the line isnt all of sudden going to run into type of charge which isnt there in his estimation and as you go on down the line of course the lower case is the more complex the case tends to be and so youre going to have to probably include emotion instead of just attitude thatd probably have to be on your scale now the only thing that varies the scale howeverthis is your basic and fundamental scalethe only thing that varies this scale is the communication of it to the pc this particular pc at his particular state of case you say was there false communication the pc is very odd indeed very low scale or very high scale he may only interpret this as lie lying communication see he immediately interprets it over but its good enough ordinarily false communication false reality false attitude if you dont think false attitudes arent in the keeping the most popular textbook on the handling of your fellow human being is dale carnegie and thats full textbook on how to create and maintain false attitudes and realities psychology actually hasnt even come up to being able to maintain false one that gives you the prevalent popularity of some things and gives you this look at the newspapers people read you dont think theres very much true in newspaper and so forth and yet newspapers sell lot of copies well so where must they be on the arc scale where must they be false attitudes false realities false communications but how false newspaper goes even falser than false the newspaper takes false scientific fact and then falsifies it and thats why i drew you that other picture there so you could show the harmonics that that thing goes down on you can get into the falsification of the falsification of the falsification its like trying to handle some of these trillionsten that you run up on some cases i dont know how were going to handle that thats one of our big problems pc is sitting there trying to count the number of trillions youre saying so he knows whether or not its the right date you know you start holding your hand up so that its trillionsfive but look you only got five fingers you need the other one for the emeter now theres your full scale theres your full scale there isnt anything more really that can cause an arc break because this is the full laydown of life the communication of this to the pc may cause you to make some ramifications of it but you can abstract these ramifications from this scale so you got new cdei scale which had to be expanded for its usability now thats empirical that doesnt necessarily fit in with anything its just what is there what is there that is significant to case and thats known unknown curious about desire enforce inhibit do nothing about and falsify now theres some question as to whether it ought to be zero and then f you see or f and then zero because you say well even lie is some communication i think youre splitting hairs because youll find ordinarily that falsification is worse than communication ordinarily now plotting that sidewaysremember that your basic scale on all of your list ones consists of affinity reality and communication and missed withhold for the incident and then for earliernot even earlier incident just earlierrestimulation of an earlier attitude reality communication missed withhold see thats an earlier missed withhold and missed withhold would actually only have to occurif your big scale is out it reduces the number of questions slightly because youre simply repeating the thing if you break this down into separate cards and thats there becauseand you break it down into separate cards for gods sakes dont omit the missed withhold because this is peculiar communication of the same thing see its didnt communicate you know and also could falsify reality and also change an attitude completely dont you see but its peculiar little mechanism its asking in essence was there bypassed charge but it speaks normally was there something you didnt say or something which you were consciously withholding now if you went and expanded this out and out and out and out and out you would get yourself into trouble if you say youre going to put missed withhold on there then why dont you put an overt well you dont put an overt because it mushes engrams you start running ow in the middle of an engram and you can get the pc in more energy soup than youve gotten him in for some time there are too many gpms and theres too many this too many that and the effect of the bank is that if you run the eighteen buttons of prepcheck or the handful of buttons that we constitute now the big mid ruds or even the old little mid ruds about and into an engram specifically you see that thing will mush itll fold up and you wont have picture see an overt and the big mid ruds particularly run directly against an engram can cause that engram to fold up into so much oatmeal the energy structure of it breaks down and it longer is able to hold its constituents see and who can tell whats in it so you dont do those things against engrams or secondaries you say in that arc break has anything been suppressed well you might get away with that one you see in that arc break is there anything you are careful of uhhh dududadadaooh fail to revealperfectly all right in that arc break has anything been invalidated uhuhuhuhuh uhuh in that arc break has anything been suggested oohhh pc will be going whats happened because frankly youre using 18inch naval cannon to shoot rabbits the buttons are just too fundamental theyre just too powerful i did far far too good job in designing the big mid ruds and isolating those buttons you could never say on the reactive mind has anything been apparently it takes just so much aberration to hold picture together so you can run it anyway they go back too early and theyre too powerful but these these buttonsthey dont do anything to the picture but strip off and disconnect the charge and realign the thing and its very smooth operation indeed the way this happens youre essentially in r2h trying to make somebodys pictures better thats what im trying to call to your attention its all right to say since the last time i audited you you know big mid ruds and in this session big mid ruds dont worry too much about that but on that arc break big mid ruds oh in other words you can run against the physical universe in its nearup environment right now you can run all the big mid ruds you want to on that plank see has anything been suppressed this is the same thing as since the last time i audited you has anything been suppressed still got the whole physical universe around you and youre not going to get this pc to knock the physical universe apart by running the big mid rud buttonsat this state of his case there probably gets point in his processing as you get up the line where youll longer be able to do this safely in this auditing room has anything been suppressed creeeak ghosts see now the point im stressing here is that the list has another importance rather than its significance is we dont want the list to be too beefed up see the list instead of missing some levels could use some buttons we know about in scientology that would be totally destructive of the goals of r2h boom see this guy all of sudden is covered with white energy or something of the sort and mushing engrams and everything is getting blah and so on so there are things you dont want on the list it isnt really all right to just anything you dream up put on the list see you can go quite ways ive tested out nearly all of these various variations of the thing and theyre actually not necessary was anything misunderstood well thats covered of course in your unknown level was any earlier misunderstanding and that sort of thing and you know ive had those on lists and ive never seen them significantly be the cause of bypassed charge youd think communication would be terribly important well it isnt terribly important till you start walking up into engrams the guy was in jail for million years what caused the arc break there was communication shortly after he was locked up they had war and he got killedthe jailer got killed and they forgot to shut the power off and forgot to let him out arc breakno communication youll find that this steeps up the line but frankly in usual running of cases and so forth youll find you wont need it now this is the woof and the warp of how you put together list one this is the formula by which you put together list one this doesnt necessarily give you list one that you promptly and instantly should sit down and audit your pc with madly there are too many ways you can put this thing together now the preassessment of list one probably itself could be done with shortened number of cdei points see just take out those that ordinarily wouldnt fall and leave about four in see leave about four in and preassess was that arc break caused by an unknown was it caused by too much of something was it caused by too little or was it caused by an absence or was you know any way you want to chop it up see but you for sure get false in there and you for sure get inhibit in there see because thats where those arc break live and you start running heavy engrams youll find out sooner or later youre going to need zero also somebody can be found holding on to death now were starting to run heavy stuff see somebody runs death whats wrong with this death why is it in restimulation all the time well he never could find out who shot him that was the arc break never could find out who shot him bullet came out of nowhere it was beautiful day in spring and he was sitting on the lawn of the ladies aid society building in des moines iowa there he sat and he was suddenly hit with rocket blaster cause fellow to think for quite while hes liable to keep that engram in his hip pocket and look at it every once in while wondering if somewhere around the edges of it he hadnt gotten picture of who shot him wrong place wrong atmosphere wrong mood you see and with an unknown in it its pretty certain you see how you can do this hm all right what dont you understand about that scalewhy what is there is there anything in it that you dont understand why its there hm i see you all frowning but i dont see you cogniting on anything its just too formidable is that whats wrong with it or is it tooas i told you little earliertoo nonsensically simple it kind of strickens you with its simplicity doesnt it well ive been overshooting this confounded scale and overshooting it ive had some of the fanciest examples of this scale you ever saw and assessed with them you know and so on and just assessed with them man and gone clear on down to the end of the list and ta remains high and the charge isnt on the list thats how this scale was formulated total empiricism what is it what is it what is the missing charge what is the missing charge and i knew it didnt have it well i finally managed to get around and found out that we were not missing charge and so forth so we obviously had it and the last one on the list was f false and that is what thetan mostly objects to that is one of his heaviest buttons false communication he himself feels guiltiest about uttering false communication or abetting false reality or false attitude under this heading you could say well we should have line that says was there betrayal in this incident you know obviously thatd read but unfortunately it doesnt respond because betrayal is actually just falsity betrayal theres big sign says ice cream cones free inside and so you walk inside and theres this cage drops down and the machinery grinds see well what on earth is every theta trap on the track but false representation falsity its the one thing that aberrates person because his level of trust with the physical universe drops you see he cant trust the very reality hes looking at in some way its been falsified and so he begins to arc break with the stuff so that was key button and the funny part of it is i expressed that one time as twisted or perverted and you know it didnt assess didnt communicate didnt even vaguely communicate perverted communication twisted communication altered communicationthese things just didnt communicate till i finally got down to false communication and man youll find out i think that communicates the pc you assess this on or the pc that you run this process on naturally here and there has to get reinterpretation you say missed withhold well that communicates to thee and but does it communicate to the pc youre running dont you see you say is there something you were holding back heoo was there kept secret that kind of thing was there kept secret in the incident but its actually senseless to give you all possible wordings of all possible questions see thats senseless because that you cant work with all possible wordings of all possible questions is just gobbledygook one arc break you assess dictionary one of these webster dictionaries you know complete with obsolete words so therefore therefore ive given you the basic formula of assessment and that formula of assessment is you take each level of the old cdei scale now expanded to k u c d i zero feach element of that and you move it over here into that now actually each level only has six but if you put them on different cards you have to add your missed withhold in the incident missed withhold earlier which gives you basic list of eight your basic list of eightyou must never get less than eight and by putting that over you can do all sorts of things you can preassess you can bobtail the number of levels youre going to have you can do this and that but still the least i can do is give you the absolute complete list so for each one of the k u c d i zero and f we have the possibility of affinity reality communication and missed withhold in the incident and then an affinity reality communication and missed withhold in earlier incidents or earlier charge something like that and you can make up one of the fanciest little wheels you ever wanted to see i imagine you can take this particular schema of some kind or another and you can draw up dozens of different systems by which this can be used and you can certainly draw up dozens of different wordings for instance right away youre up against at attitude was there tone scale that doesnt communicate see but thats what we mean affinity person says affinity well it must mean love you know bang you know but those semantics are for your delivery to the pc so one of your basic breakdowns is you say attitude and then you also say emotion now you realize you could break that down further and put effort in there you realize that the whole know to mystery scale can go under i hope you recognize that see the whole know to mystery scaleand theyre all part of that or you could have symbols and so forth you could get mighty fancy you just substitute it for that and you start getting that fancy however you sure better develop system of preassessment to get it all sorted out now i have one correction to make in r2h i have led you to believei have led you to believe erroneously perhaps that the best system was to clean every level that is in actual fact the easiesttoaudit system which gives you the least dirty needle and does not necessarily release the most charge from the case and i thought id better give you slight addendum to that because if you can skitter down list rapidly and pick out the major charge the biggest read off of that list and bang that back at the pc youre getting more tone arm action per minute of auditing time you see which gives you then if it can be done the best system that doesnt necessarily say that it is the most doable system you got that now some pc who drags the bypassed charge through the remainder of the list every time you touch any charge at allyou get into endless difficulty if you try to assess the whole list and take the biggest read and give him that and have him explain that in full with the itsa line in full see that gives you the most tone arm action per minute of auditing time see obviously because you get the blowdown right now and so forth but if you run into too much difficulty doing thatand an auditor who is having difficulty at all with pc or pc who is having difficulties coping needle that is hard to read meter that is hard to read and all these things are quite usual in auditing you seeyou treat it like end rudiments treat it like end rudiments and clean it up all the way down but in any event matter what system you use you have to be satisfied now theres liability to treating it with end rudiments that i must inform you of i say this is the easiest for the auditor to do and is very often the most easy and comfortable on the pc because the pc is after all sitting there all during the rest of the assessmentby the time youve bypassed the bypassed charge the pc may almost have steam coming out of his ears you see as you go down this list you can by treating it like end rudiments this has liability destroy the major read because youve bled the charge of read already and all you get is slight hump of the needle as you go past this thing you dont get the major charge that is going to give you the blowdown reading with good sharp tsk see you dont get that instead of that it now when you meet up with it simply puts hump on the needle see because if you took it without bleeding the arc break of any charge the arc break has got enough charge in it to give you good sharp read but if you bleed that arc break down by taking every tick of it off why youre liable to get to situation where the meter is very difficult to read because its just slow or speed will become the major charge so if youre going to do this rudiments system all the way down like rudiments then you also have to take those slows and speeds so it gives you new problem in reading the meter in return for having solved your dirty needle you get new problem there are many ways by which to do this the way that gives you the most tone arm action that you can run that the pc will sit still for is the way to useobvious obvious thats the way to use now if youve got preassessment on this particular list and you could preassess and move right in on the hard chargesee that is the list bangits rather brief assessment dont you see and therefore it goes powie see you just go right on down the line and get your biggest read bow and you say thats it what is it and the pc has to figure it out and give you the itsa on it and be perfectly satisfied with it and youll see that tone arm go pow and down shell come see youre all satisfied with that one that arc break doesnt read on the meter up goes your next one recall an arc break your tone arm starts up with the whatsathe whatsit line and do your assessment get of course your what was it where was it when was it get your assessment in on it get that charge and youll see that tone arm pow itll come down again as soon as the pc picks it up and youll get tone arm which is moving moving moving moving moving getting looser and looser and looser if you do it that particular way too shortened list too abbreviated so as to miss the principal charge leaves you with high ta in actual fact what happens is charge moves the time wrong in an incident the incident is all charged up because of something that happened in 1912 so the charge of the incident is in 1912 the incident is in 1920 wrong date now if your list one does not specify that charge you of course are going to miss the 1912 charge and the incident will continue to look to the pc like 1912 its very interesting your ta will get higher and higher and get stickier and stickier and the thing will eventually go over the moon and youll have it riding up here at 525 and r2h is working less and less well matter what you do well actually youre restimulating charge which you arent picking up and the inevitable fact when you do that is the pc will get harder and harder to audit and eventually hell arc break just on the diagrams i gave you concerning the itsathe whatsit and itsa line want to make one little more remark to you thats all there is about that i hope you can evolve one of the things okay i want to make one other remark to you i thought of process this is just research see i thought of process by which you could possibly see tone arm pump at your will see you could probably see it go you say recall worrysee whatsit because worry is obviously whatsit like crazy see recall worry what was it about recall worry what was it about recall worry what was it about youll be able to drill your tone arm up and down on pc with that particular type of process its not particularly therapeutic im just showing you heres way to make tone arm actually work for you so you would see the whatsititsa line in complete operation providing you let the pc tell you what it was about now i can show you how to get tone arm high and keep it there recall worry recall worry recall worry recall worry recall worry thats all right dont bother to tell what it is recall worry the other thing youre going to worry about and i already had some questions on it youve probably audited pc one time or another that got very good tone arm action but didnt get any better this is possibility that you may have run into let call to your attention something in that bulletin that came out there is tone arm action if present will take the pc eventually to ot but let point out the word eventually and even later in that bulletin it says even if it takes thousands of years you understand you understand youre at least getting somewhere if you have tone arm action is the only point im putting across well what is the expectancy well thats pretty long you have to run the right significances very often youve got pc who is getting tone arm action all right tone arm pumping around you may have changed the process right in the middle of the tone arm action see well now youve got whole bunch of new charge without blowing the old charge and the pc is going to go on feeling very uncomfortable while getting better charge is coming off dont you see but the specific thing that you were after didnt happen with the pc the way to analyze something like that is what did you consider better and how long did you just sit there and let the tone arm waggle without chipping off new charge and throwing it into restimulation on the ease of course the case was getting better but case can get better comfortably and case can get better very uncomfortably and case can get better insufferably bad off thats right you start running screen implantsstuff thats been restimulated on these screens in the between life area you see you got tremendous quantity of track back to the last date that has never been restimulated by the screens see more modern stuff is not screen restimulated you get back earlier and youll run into span where youve got screenrestimulated engrams and my god theyve been restimulated every sixty or seventy years dont you see for the last ten thousand or something like that every time you died you got that particular set of engrams beautifully gorgeously steamed up and man you get in and you start to run them today you get tone arm action but you just wish that you just hadnt started it in the firstwhy not just go up through the betweenlives area again and get it all over with youre getting tone arm action but getting better is not how the pc feels see its whether hes making more progress to more knowingness and more ability also his current state in auditing is not measure of his getting better he can have beautiful memory hit the betweenlives area and his memory goes blop hes getting better he cant remember thing but he is closer to being able to remember everything you understand so you can put certain things into restimulation in case that bring about temporary conditions on the case and theyre pretty ghastly sometimes and sometimes theyre not well taken care of and they stay that way for quite while and then one day they all blow out youve got to review case over period of the thirty days youve got to review case at least over the period of an intensive or the period of thirty days or something like that i had an example of that the other day i was thinking about organizations and dianetics and scientology matter of fact i was giving an auditing session and bunch of data was coming up that spanned that period and you know i was absolutely amazed i had never taken look between the improvement of 1951 and 1963 and its interim states you know i mean justyou knowwhat were we doing then what were the organizations like then what were our communications like then wow you know i thought good heavens at this rate of speed were going to take this planet over practically tomorrow its true too we are thank you very much
