under senate rules amendments may be offered to bill until the bill has been amended in its entirety but not thereafter uc agreement can limit the amendments that are in order for example the agreement may include list of the only or only additional amendments that senators may offer to the bill these amendments may be identified by some combination of number sponsor and subject 2 the uc agreement may also provide that by agreeing to it the senate also be deemed to have adopted specified amendment for example the agreement may provide for the adoption of committee substitute and may also treat it as original text for the purpose of further amendment

committee amendments to bill are acted upon senators may offer amendments to the bill in the order in which they seek and receive recognition from the presiding officer while the parties floor leadersand to lesser extent the bills majority and minority floor managersreceive priority in recognition senate rules and precedents do not otherwise specify sequence in which amendments to bill are to be offered3 uc agreement can provide the order in which senators are to offer certain amendments to bill for example an agreement may specify which amendment the senate will consider after disposing of the pending amendment more encompassing agreement may specify the sequence in which list of amendments will be considered

usually may propose seconddegree amendments to firstdegree amendment while it is pending and may continue doing so until the firstdegree amendment has been completely amended uc agreement can prohibit all seconddegree amendments or all seconddegree amendments on certain subject it can also allow senators to offer only specified seconddegree amendments 1 this report was originally prepared by stanley bach former senior specialist in the legislative process at crs the listed author has updated the report and can respond to inquiries on the subject for broader overview of uc agreements see crs report 98225 unanimous consent agreements in the senate by walter j oleszek 2 inclusion of an amendment in an adopted uc agreement constitutes action on the amendment until the senate has taken some action in relation to an amendment the senator offering it may modify or withdraw it at will but cannot offer an amendment to it 3 for example senators may offer amendments to any unamended section of the bill at any time t httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98310g21g142g151g138g157g142g561g23g151g138g151g146g150g152g158g156g561g5g152g151g156g142g151g157g561g3

rules the debate on an amendment can continue unless cloture has been invoked until senator seeks recognition to speak on it or until the amendment has been disposed of in some way uc agreement can limit the time available for debating particular amendment each of several specific amendments or all amendments to the bill the agreement can provide different amounts of time for debating individual firstdegree amendments and it can provide more time for debating firstdegree amendments than for debating seconddegree amendments uc agreements often divide control of the time for debating an amendment between the senator offering it and another opposing it often the minority manager of the bill or alternatively the minority leader in addition uc agreement can limit the total time devoted to acting and voting on all or all further amendments to bill for example the agreement may specify that consideration of amendments shall end at time specified increasingly uc agreements provide that each of series of amendments be considered and then temporarily laid aside rather than voted on and that votes then be stacked to occur in immediate succession on all of them at some later point often just before final vote on the measure g22g145g142g561g21g158g139g147g142g140g157g156g561g152g143g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g156g561 under senate rules amendments offered to bill need not be germane to that bill except for amendments to general appropriations and budget reconciliation bills or unless the senate has invoked cloture uc agreement may require that certain or all amendments to bill be germane or more often today that they meet the less strict standard of relevancy 4 either standard may also be applied to seconddegree amendments

procedural points of orderfor example to enforce the congressional budget proc essthat if raised and allowed to stand would prevent consideration of the amendment uc agreement may waive points of order against certain or all amendments thereby protecting consideration of certain amendments that senators may offer uc agreements can limit the amending process on the senate floor in ways not mentioned above5 for an explanation of how these agreements can affect other aspects of senate floor proceedings see crs report rs20594 how unanimous consent agreements regulate senate floor action by richard s beth two uc agreements from the 109 th congress follow below each illustrates several dimensions on which an agreement may affect the amending process order 191 first proposes that the senate amend s 1566 by virtue of agreeing to the uc agreement it then allows for only the listed firstdegree amendments setting time limitations for the consideration of each order 4 see floyd m

to relevancy 5 see riddick and frumin senate procedure pp 13141328 for precedents affecting the amending process under uc agreement for example if the agreement specifies time for specific votes or time limitations on debate number of precedents specify the circumstances under which further amendments may be in order but not subject to debate
