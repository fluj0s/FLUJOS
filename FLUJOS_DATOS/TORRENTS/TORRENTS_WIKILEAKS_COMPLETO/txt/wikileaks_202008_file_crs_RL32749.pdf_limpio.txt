taxation of overseas investment and income background and issues summary investment abroad by us individuals and firms is substantial and growing an important aspect of the increased integr ation of the us economy with the rest of the world at the end of 2006 the overall st ock of private us investment abroad was 384 of the total us stock of pr ivate capital the proportion has more than doubled over the past two decades because investment outflow s have grown it is not surprising that us taxation of overs eas investment has been and is likely to remain prominent issue before congress first because investment abroad is an increasingly important part of the economy the effects of taxation on foreign investment are potentially mo re important second the in creased mobility of capital has changed the environment in which ta xes apply some have suggested that capitals mobility may call for change in us tax policy current us tax policy towards inve stment abroad poses patchwork of incentives disincentives and neutrality and different features of the system have different effects the foreign tax credit generally promotes tax neutrality the credit is limited however and the limitation can pose either disincentive or incentive to invest abroad the systems deferral principle in some cases permits us firms to postpone us tax on foreign income it poses an incentive to invest abroad where foreign tax rates are low deferral is re stricted however by the tax codes subpart f which nudges the system back in the direction of tax neutrality whether these various effects are consider ed beneficial depends in part on the perspective policymaker takes traditional economic theory suggests that tax policy that promotes neutrality between investment at home and abroad best promotes world economic welfare economic theory also indicates however that us economic welfare is maximized when overseas investment is to degree discouraged different components of th us tax system are consistent with different perspectives which perspective the us tax system best exemplifies is not clear the varied effects of the us tax system suggest an ambivalence towards overseas investment on the part of policymakers and the public in the 110th congress hr 3970 proposes to implement ch anges that vary in their likely effect on foreign investment echoing the underlying tax system this implied ambivalence along with foreign inves tments growing importance suggests that debate over us interna tional taxation will continue in congress in 2008 and beyond some possible issues include the pl ace of international taxation in possible movement towards fundamental tax reform and whether the united states should move towards territorial tax system or alternatively adopt provisions designed to either promote tax neutrality or limit offshore outsourcing this report was originally written by david l brumbaugh specialist in public finance who has retired from crs it w ill be

report analyzes how the current us tax system applies to foreign inves tment undertaken by us firms abroad and how that application was changed by recent legislati on it also assesses the impact of the tax system and legislation and concludes by discussing variety of issues in international taxation that congress may face in 2008 and be yond it begins with brief examination of the data on international investment the united states in the world economy the most basic economic data clear ly show that the us economy is increasingly involved in the world economy in the language of economics the us economy is growing more open for exampl the data show that the total volume of trade in goods and services that is exports plus imports has increased substantially and steadily over the past 30 years in 1977 exports plus imports were 168 of us gross domestic product gdp by 2007 trade was full 288 of gdp1 but the focus here is on capital investment and if trade has increased substantially investment has grown dramatically rough estimates indicate that in 1976 the stock of us private assets abro ad was 67 of the total us privately owned capital stock by year end 2006 assets abroad we re 384 of the total us private capital stock in 1976 the stock of fo reign private assets in the united states was 37 of the us capital stock at year end 2006 it was 3 88 of private us capital2 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32749crs2 2 continued durable goods for 19972006 survey of current business vol 87 sept 2007 pp 3132 the fixed assets data were adjusted to include estimated

business vol 88 jan 2008 p 22 us capital income data are from bea cu rrent and historical data survey of current business vol 84 nov 2004 p d16it is informative to examine th components of outbound investment traditionally economists have identified two types of overseas investment portfolio investment and direct inves tment with portfolio inve stment the underlying assets are not actively managed by the investor direct investment entails the active management of overseas assets and operations by the inve stor portfolio investment can be thought of as us person or fi rm who has foreign stocks bonds or other assets in his investme nt portfolio direct investment can be thought of as the overseas business operations of us firm the da ta suggest that the rapid growth in us assets abroad has consisted almost entirely of portfolio investment rather than direct investment in overseas bus iness operations at yea rend 1976 portfolio investment abroad was 27 of the total us capita l stock at the end of 2006 it was 294 of the total stock in contrast foreign dir ect investment was 41 of the total in 1976 and 9 at the end of 2006 taxes potentially affect investment by altering the allocation of capital between domestic and foreign locations hence the fo cus thus far on stocks rather than flows however another concern of international taxation is tax revenue to obtain rough idea of how important overseas investment potentially is to the us tax base it is useful to examine income flowing from international investment here the growth in importance while it has occurred is somewhat less imposing in 1976 receipts by private us investors of earnings on overseas assets were 15 of us gdp by 2003 they were 26 of gdp as with the stock of investment most of the growth was in portfolio investment rather than direct investment over the same period receipts from portfolio investment grew from 05 of gdp to 10 of gdp receipts from foreign direct investment grew fro m 10 of gdp to 17 of gdp another way of gauging the importance of overseas investment income is to compare it with total us income from capital in 1976 private receipts from overseas investment were 71 of us capital income by 2003 they had grown to 853 what is the import of these various numbers first they substantiate the notion that overseas investment has grown rapidly both in absolute terms and relative to the rest of the us economy accordingly us tax treatment of that investment is potentially more important than previously its various effects are increasingly important to the economy the next sec tion examines how taxes can affect the allocation of investment between the domestic economy and foreign locations and the implications of those effects for veral important dime nsions of economic performance given portfolio investments magnitude us tax policy towards investment in foreign stocks bonds and othe r portfolio assets is clearly important the remainder of this report however focu ses on overseas direct investment by us firms topic that is frequently focus of attention by congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32749crs3 how taxes affect international investment this section of the report sets forth the basic economic analysis of how taxes in the abstract affect international investment first economic theory stipulates that firms fundamental goal is to maximize its profits after taxes when firm considers where to employ its investment it implicitly weighs the relative rate of return on investment in its various locations again after taxes taxes can therefore pose an incentive for firms to invest overseas if the tax burden abroad is lower than the burden on identical investment in the united states alternatively taxes can pose disincentive towards foreign investment compared to investment in the domestic economy if taxes are relatively high in overseas locations or taxes can be neutral towards the investment decision if the tax burden is the same on foreign investment as on identical domestic proj ects then taxes have impact on where firms invest the implication of this framework is clear if us and foreign tax systems as whole were to favor either cation over the other then us investment in the favored location would be higher th an would otherwise occur the discussion of the impact of particular features of the us system is deferred until the next section but note here that the overall thrust of the system is mixed in its incentive effects with clear net impact identifying the likely impact of taxes on the allocation of investment is only an intermediate answer according to economic theory various important effects result from the allocation of investment between domestic and foreign sources and it is these effects that are ultimately of concern to policymakers investment and the distribution of income changes in the distribution of income both within the united states and abroad is one result of the allocation of investment capital thus when taxes affect the allocation of investment be tween foreign and domestic uses they also affect the income distribution capital flows affect the distribution of income as follows basic principle of economic theory holds that in smoothly operating markets labor compensation is commensurate with bor productivity the more productive labor is the higher wages are because labor productivity is higher the more capital it has to work with the higher the capitallabor ratio domestic labor income generally declines if capital income is diverted abroad at the same time income of domestic capital is increased if investors are free to seek higher returns abroad in short tax policy that increases or diminishes investment abroad has implications for the distribution of domestic income between capital and labor this result likely underlies the contrasting polic recommendations for intern ational taxes that tend to be supported by domestic labor on the one hand and multinational firms on the other in broad terms bor tends to oppose tax measures that pose incentives to invest abroad businesses tend to support them taxes and economic welfare capital export neutrality national neutrality and capital import neutrality along with their impact on how income is distributed taxes on capital flows have broad effects on economic efficiency or how much income is available forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32749crs4 distribution in the first place economic theory has developed two standards for evaluating the efficiency of international taxation each with different perspective capital export neutrality cen which considers the impact of taxes on world economic welfare and national neutrality nn which considers only the economic welfare of the capital exporting c ountry in this case the united states discussions of international taxes also frequently evaluate them for their impact on the competitive position of us firms ab road standard so metimes called capital import neutrality cin capital export neutrality c is based on the idea that the economys supply of capital is employed most efficiently wh each increment of capital is used where it earns the highest return before taxes in economic terms this occurs when the pre tax return on an additional increment of investment marginal investment abroad is equal to the pretax return on identical new domestic investment generally economic theory states that in the absence of taxes profit maximizing investors will accomplish this allocation on their own simply in response to market forces they maximize th eir investment profits by ensuring that the return on additional investment abroad is just equal to the return on additional domestic investment it follows that the most efficient tax system is that which least distorts investors decisions on how capital is employed tax system is thus most efficient when it is neutral towards the decision to invest at home or abroad and when the tax burden on identical investments is the same in either location cen is policy that establishes such conditions policy where taxes do not distort an investors decision of where to invest and the worlds capital resources are employed where they are most productive under cen the worlds economy is getting the most from its capital resources and world economic welfare is maximized tax policy that maximizes world econo mic welfare by establishing identical tax burdens on foreign and domestic inve stment is not necessarily one that maximizes us economic welfare cen in other words is not necessarily optimal from the perspective of the united states nd the united states alone there are two reasons for this first unit of capital that is employed in the united states increases both us labor income and us capital income the labor component accrues because the unit of capital makes labor more productive and increases wages in contrast unit of us capital that is employed abroad produces return for the investor but not for us labor the increase in wages accrues to foreign rather than domestic labor as result national welfare is not maximized by equating the return to marginal unit of capital abroad with marginal investment in the united states instead national welfare is maximized if overseas investment is discouraged by some incremental amount even if us labor were not directly disadvantaged by the shifting of investment abroad neutral taxation woul d still not max imize us ec onomic welfare in cases where foreign host governments impose their own tax on us investors this result occurs because the benefit to the united states of an additional unit of overseas investment is the return on that investment less foreign taxes the return on that same investment made in the united states however is the return on the investment plus any tax collected by the united states httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32749crs5 4 daniel j frisch the economics of in ternational tax policy some old and new approaches tax notes apr 30 1990 pp 590591 5 gary clyde hufbauer us taxation of international income blueprint for reform washington institute for international economics 1992 pp 7794national neutrality nn is the term applied by econo mists to tax policy that maximizes us national welfare in general nn prescribes tax burden on foreign investment that is higher than the burde n on identical domestic investment so that investment abroad is discouraged more specifically nn at least prescribes policy of allowing only deduction for investors foreign taxes and not credit indeed nn may well require an even more onerous tax rate on foreig n investment in general the greater the demand for us capital abroad the higher the optimal tax rate under national neut rality however while nn max imizes us welfare it is beggar thy neighbor policy that increases us welfare by less than it reduces foreign welfare further such polic could redound to the disadvantage of the united states if foreign governments retaliated by restricting capital exports multinational firms and others sometimes argue that tax policy towards foreign investment should be set so as to place us firms on an even tax footing with foreign competitors standard sometimes referred to as cap ital import neutrality cin supporters of cin generally argue that the standard could be achieved and us competitiveness would be maximized if us taxes did not apply to foreignsource income economic theory suggests that such policy distorts the geographic allocation of capital and max imizes the economic welfare of neither the united states nor the world thus even though it estab lishes even taxes when certain comparisons are made ie us firms compared to foreign firms cin is not neutral policy in the same sense as cen or nn notwithstanding economic theory number of arguments are sometimes made in support of cin for example it has been argued that given increasingly open and integrated world capital markets us savers desirous of investing in foreign equity can escape any us corporatelevel tax on overseas direct investment by means of portfolio investment that is by purchasing stock in foreign firms directly rather than relying on us multinational to make foreign investments for them4 for this to be true requires portfolio investment to be perfect substitute in savers eyes for direct investment which may not be the case beyond this however simply because savers can in some cases circumvent the us corporate income tax on foreign direct investment is not strong case agains t taxing foreign direct investment another argument supporting cin holds that overseas investment produces higher return for research and certain ot her activities multinationa ls undertake these activities carry with them external benef its to the economy as whole that make the return to research greater than the private return to the firm conducting the research5 while it can be argued that external benefits from research suggest subsidy is warranted such subsidy seems likely to be more accurately targeted if it were to apply only to research rather than foreign income further the tax code already provides such subsidy in the form of tax credit and deductions for researchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32749crs6 6 thomas horst note on the optimal ta xation of international investment income quarterly journal of economics vol 94 june 1980 pp 793795 7 for an uptodate and thorough review of economics literature on optimal taxation of foreign investment see donald j roussl ang deferral and the optimal taxation of international investment income national tax journal vol 53 sept 2000 pp 589600finally it has been argued that if the supply of saving in the united states expands with reductions in tax on investment then worl d welfare and us welfare would be increased by cutting taxes on overseas investment as in cin6 t h i s analysis however leaves unanswered the fo llowing question if taxes on investment are to be cut why reduce them in manner that distorts the allocation of capital between the domestic economy and abroad7 us taxation of foreign income the general framework relative tax burdens on foreign and domestic investment affect the allocation of investment between us and fore ign locations by posing incentives or disincentives to invest in either locati on the allocation of investment in turn affects the distribution of income with in the domestic economy and affects economic efficiency and economic welfare on inte rnational investment capital export neutrality national neutrality and capital import neutrality are frequently used to gauge the nature of these effects in the case of particular tax system or particular tax provisions the next section examines the basic features of the us tax system and their effects basic jurisdictiona l principles and th foreign tax credit capital export neutrality prescribes equal tax burdens for identical new investment at home and abroad and two ba sic jurisdictional elements of the us system are taken alone consistent with cen taxation based on residence and provision of tax credit for foreign taxe s paid first the residence principle conceptually home country can base its income tax jurisdiction either on who earns income or on the source of income unde r the latter country would confine its application of taxes to income earned within its own borders operating territorial tax system under the former country ge nerally taxes the worldwide income of its citizens and residents regardless of where the income is earned under its residence principle the united states asserts the right to tax both the foreign and domestic income of its citizens and resident individuals and of corporations chartered in the united states ie re sident corporations absent special provision residence based taxation would result in double taxation of foreign income in any case where foreign country imposes its own taxes like most countries in their ro as capital exporters the united states accepts the responsibility for relieving double taxation in its case the united states provides foreign tax credit for foreign income taxes its residents pay on foreign source income in doing so it concedes that the country that is host to overseashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32749crs7 investment has first claim to tax that investment and first claim on the tax revenue it potentially produces additional features of the us system prevent its achievement of full cen indeed some would argue that the system falls substantially short of cen but if residence taxation always applied under the tax system and all fo reign income taxes were creditable cen would result to see how suppose first that the foreign tax rate on uschartered corporation were low relative to the us tax rate using hypothetical foreign rate of 10 and assuming the us firm pays the maximum us corporate rate of 35 in this case the firm would pay its foreign taxes at the 10 rate and use foreign tax credits to ffset 10 percentage points of its precredit us tax the firms total us plus fo reign tax on its fore ign investment would consist of foreign taxes paid at the 10 ra plus 25 percentage points of us tax 35 minus 10 for total of 35 exactly the rate applicable to the firms us investment however what if foreign taxes are higher than us taxes with an unlimited foreign tax credit tax burdens on foreign and domestic investment would still be the same foreign taxes not needed to offset us tax on foreign investments own income could still be credited against us tax on income from us sources the us tax system however does contain limitation that prevents this outcome the foreign tax credit limitation and crosscrediting under the us tax codes foreign ta x credit limitation foreign taxes can only offset us tax on the portion of taxpayers precredit us tax liability that applies to foreign rather than domestic income in effect the tax code places wall between foreign and domestic income and once foreign tax credits have offset all us tax on the foreign side of the barrier any remain ing foreign taxes cannot be credited the extra foreign taxes become excess credits in tax parlance and can be carried back up to one year and carried forward up to 10 years in contrast firm that has insufficient foreign taxes to offset its entire us tax liability is said to have deficit of foreign tax credits the pur pose of the limitation is protect the us tax base absent the limit foreign host countries could in theory divert tax revenue from the us treasury by simply raising their own taxes on us investors without fear of placing an onerous burden on the us firms themselves suppose then that firm has ex isting overseas investment and is contemplating new project in country with high tax rate say 50 foreign tax rate compared to the 35 us tax rate in this case foreign tax credits could be counted on to eliminate all 35 percentage poi nts of us tax on the new investments income but the remaining foreign ta x 50 minus 35 or 15 of the investments income would not be creditable the total tax on the foreign investment would consist of only the 50 fo reign tax but would be high relative to taxes on identical us investment and w ould pose disincentive to invest in the hightax country as described above nn is policy pers pective that recommends disincentive to invest abroad and so in sense the limitation on the foreign tax credit introduces an element of nn into the us system the actual incentive situation however ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32749crs8 complicated by the particular way in which the limitation is applied and by practice known as cross crediting again if firm has existing foreign investments the foreign tax credit limit would result in disincentive for hightax foreign investments but the tax code does not require the foreign tax credits limitation to be calculated on an investmentbyinves tment basis or similarly on percountry basis thus if firm is planning new hightax investment and has existing foreign investment that is lightly taxed and thus subject to residual aftercredit us tax liability it can possibly crosscredit the excess foreign tax credits generated by the new heavily taxed foreign against the existing lightly taxed foreign investment at the extreme all excess credits produced by the new investment could be absorbed reducing the tax burden on the heavily taxed foreign investment to rate equal to the us tax rate neutrality in other words can result even for investment in hightax foreign countries cross crediting can also work where the new investment is in lowtax rather than hightax location but in this case it produces tax incentive for overseas investment here firm with existing h eavilytaxed investment that produces excess credits can use the credits to offset the residual us tax that would otherwise be due on new investment in lowtax country the excess credits in effect shield new investment in low tax countries from new u s taxes thus preserving the relatively low tax burden for investment in the lowtax country the ability of firms to crosscredit foreign taxes has been restricted and relaxed at various times by the us tax code in various ways deferral an additional fundamental feature of the us tax system is the socalled deferral principle or simply deferral if the us tax jurisdiction is based on residence in technical or legal sense deferral is substa ntial departure from residence and towards territoriality in ec onomic substance deferrals impact is to shift the average impact of the tax system away from neutrality and in the direction of general tax incentive for overseas investment deferral works as follows under the us residencebased tax regime corporations chartered in the united states are taxed on their foreign as well as domestic income in contrast the united states generally taxes foreignchartered corporations only on income earned in the united states thus where us parent firm invests abroad through separately in corporated subsidiary firm chartered in foreign country us taxes do not apply to its foreign income as long as the income is reinvested abroad us taxes apply only when the income is repatriated to the us parent firm as income or other income us taxes are in other words deferred or postponed because of disc ounting taxes paid in the future do not matter as much to firm as an identical amount paid in th present because of discounting deferral results in lower overall tax burden for foreign investment compared to domestic investment in cases where foreign taxes ar relatively low the low tax burden under deferral occurs regardless of whether fi rm has excess credits available for cross creditinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32749crs9 since deferral results in wer tax rate for investment in lowtax countries than for identical investment in the united states it poses an incentive for investment in lowtax countries and nudges the us syst em away from cen as noted above cin calls for the exemption of foreign income from us tax under deferral us taxes ultimately apply when and if foreign earnings are repatriated suggesting at least some difference between deferral and cin nonetheless deferral moves the system in that direction and for income that is i ndefinitely reinvested abroad the difference between exemption and ferral is negligible subpart fs restriction of deferral like most tax benefits deferral has both critics and champions the debate over its merits goes back four decades the mo st significant curtailment of the provision subpart f was enacted in 1962 as comp romise after the kennedy administration initially proposed repealing ferral altogether subpart f singles out certain types of income and certain types of ownership arrangements and in those cases taxes the income on current rath er than deferred basis subpart f applies only to foreign corpora tions that the tax code classifies as controlled foreign corporations cfcs fo reign corporations that are more than 50 owned by us stockholders further it applies only to those us shareholders whose stake in the cfc is 10 or greater subpart f applies its current taxation by requiring each 10 shareholder to include their share of cfcs subpart f income in their taxable income even if it has not actually been distributed the types of income subject to current tax under subpart f are generally those that are thought to be easily located in tax havens and lowta x countries income from passive investment that is investment that is primarily financial in nature and that does not involve the active manage ment of business operation and certain other types of income whose source is t hought to be easily manipulated so as to locate it in countries with low tax rates passive investment income generally includes items such as dividends from small blocks of stock as well as interest and royalties the other types of income in subpart f include income from sales transactions with related firms income from services provided to related firms petroleumrelated income other than that derived from extraction and income from international shipping if deferral shifts the system towards cin and away from neutrality and cen subpart f where it applies mitigates deferrals effect the systems overall mix of incentives the framework described presents patchwork of eff ects on relative tax burdens and mix of incentives disincentives and neutrality the tax systems overall average impact on investment is not presented the tax system is not consistent with any one of the three policy perspectives of cen nn and cin the following chart however is useful in identifying the circumstances in which each of the various incentive effects occur as shown in the table whether new overseas investment faces an incentiv disincentive or

effects in isolation it is the relative tax burden on fo reign and domestic investment that is of interest to investors and that potentially changes the allocation of investment capital between the united states and abroad ccordingly investment tax incentives that are available for domestic but not overseas investment are at the same time disincentives to foreign investment pr ior to the tax reform act of 1986 pl 99 514 several broad inve stment incentives were availabl for domestic but not foreign investment and thus posed such disi ncentive these provisions included the investment tax credit which was available for domestic investment in plant and equipment and the accelerated cost recovery system of generous depreciation deductions the 1986 act however repealed the investment credit and scaled back depreciation leaving only scattering of more narrow domestic incentives in place notable among the incentives for domestic investment are the research and development rd tax credit and two separate tax incentives for exporting8 the rd credit provides tax benefit for firms that increase their qualified research expenditures qualified res earch however explicitly excludes research conducted abroad the two export incentives are the inventory source rule and the extraterritorial exemption rules for exporters they provide an incentive for domestic investment because exports by defin ition cannot be produced abroad the inventory source rule provides an export in centive by allowing firms to allocate part of their export income abroad for foreign tax credit limitation purposes thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32749crs11 consequence of the allocati on is potentially an effective exemption for part of export income possible issues in 2008 and beyond what does this context predict as intern ational tax issues that may arise in 2008 in abstract general terms the hybrid natu re of the us system suggests debate over the appropriate course for us policy may continue th rough 2008 in more specific terms number of possible issues suggest themselves and they are discussed in the following sections fundamental tax reform and international taxation the bush administration has been gath ering information on fundamental tax reform during the administrations second term variety of general arguments have been advanced to support tax reform for example that it will simplify the tax system promote economic efficiency and stimulate economic gr owth in addition one type of broad tax reform switching from the current hybrid tax system to tax on consumption has been advocated in part because of its perceived favorable effect on us economic competitiveness economists are generally skeptical of such claims and even of the value of competitiv eness as concept but it is nonetheless likely that if tax reform is given serious consideration in congress its international dimension is likely to be thoroughly debated first if reform takes the form of cons umption tax what might be its principal effects in the international sector of the economy propone nts of national sales tax or of valueadded tax vat sometimes argue that us exports will be increased because as with the vats used by eur opean and other foreign countries the tax will be rebated for exports and levied on imports yet while these socalled border tax adjustments are part of several of the most fullyarticulated reform proposals this is one area where econo mists doubt the impact of moving to consumptionbased tax economic theory indicates that because of adjustments in exchange rates or other mechanisms border tax adjustments ultimately do not alter countrys balance of trade but movement to consumption tax could potentially implement large and important changes in the us tax system and could have importa nt effects in the international sector for example while taxes are an ineffective tool for changing the trade balance they can and likely do aff ect the composition of imports and exports thus if tax reform entails shift in the way taxes apply across products it could alter what the us economy imports and what it exports shift to consumption tax would likely alter the comparative tax burden on domestic compared to foreign investment under consumption tax the return on new domestic investment would be exem pt from us tax while under the most prominent proposals made in past years fo reignsource income would be outside the us tax jurisdiction as result new u s investments would face relatively low tax burden compared to investment abroa d which would continue to face corporatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32749crs12 9 note that the cennncin framework has limited use as an analytical framework under consumption tax in this way the consumption tax is similar to the ajcas domestic production deduction while it poses an incentive for domestic investment it is in contrast to traditional prescriptions for nn in that th shift to domestic investment would occur because of tax cut for domestic investment rather than tax increase for investment abroad the benefit of the shift would thus lik ely principally accrue to domestic capital rather than labortaxes imposed by foreign governments t hus except in jurisdictions with taxes of their own us firms would face tax incentive to invest in the united states rather than abroad9 as cautionary note however some analyses have concluded that shifting to consumption tax may reduce domestic real interest rates even if such tax were revenue neutral in isolatio n this would have an effect in the opposite direction of the direct impact of re lative domestic and fo reign tax burdens while some have proposed that fundamental tax refo rm take the specific form of tax on consumption that outcome is not foregone conclu sion alternatively tax reform could take the form of comprehensive income tax that is tax that applies to all income from all sources and that does not contain the numerous exemptions deductions and credits provided by current law in the international area movement towards comprehensive income tax would likely entail repeal of deferral and implementation of separate foreign tax credit limitations for the various types of foreign income or for income ear ned in each foreign country with respect to investment in lowtax countries such system would be consistent with cen but would be more in accord with nn with resp ect to investment in hightax countries territorial taxation in legal sense the current us tax system bases its jurisdiction to tax on residence that is the united states taxes us resident corporations and individuals on their worldwide income regardless of its source an alternative jurisdictional concept is territoriality in which jurisdiction to tax is based on the source of the income in question rather than the nationality of the individual or firm earning the income under territorial tax system country taxes income earned within its borders but exempts foreignsource income among major us trading partners france and the netherla nds have territorial systems territorial tax would be consistent with the principle of capital import neutrality described above multinational firms nd investors have frequently supported territorial taxation or at least movement in that direction if not for reasons that explicitly have cin in mind then to promote us competitiveness some have argued for example that as the us economy becomes increasingly open and us firms increasingly compete in th global marketplace the tax system should be modified to promote us firms competitiveness while the net overall thrust of the 2004 ajca on incentives towards overseas investment was mixed its contraction of subpart f and consolidation of fore ign tax credit baskets can nonetheless be viewed as incremental move ments in the direction of territoriality it is thus possible that the 110th congress will consider legislation that continues to move the system in that direction httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32749crs13 10 for additional information on taxes and outsourcing crs report rl32587 taxes and offshore outsourcing by donald j marples 11 for complete description of the pr ovisions in hr 3970 see crs report rl34249 the tax reduction and reform ac t of 2007 an overview by jane g gravelletaxes and offshor outsourcing highprofile topic of debate was ffshore outsourcing generally the real or perceived movement of jobs from the united states overseas10 principal way taxes are thought to abet what is sometime s described as the export of jobs is by encouraging us firms to invest abroad and to establish foreign operations rather than operations in the united states as described above deferra l and in some cases crosscrediting poses an incentive for overseas investment the policy prescription of those concerne d with offshore outsourcing is to at least eliminate the tax systems extant incentives for investment abroad prescription that is consistent with capital export neutrality however the focus of outsourcings opponents on the moveme nt of capital abroad and on outbound investments employment effects also suggest sympathy with the principle of national neutrality which as descri bed above would go beyond mere neutrality and would implement tax policy designed to dampen overseas investment proposed legislation in the 110th congress hr 3970 tax reduction and reform act of 2007 hr 3970 contains number of provisions that would change the current law concerning the tax treatment of overseas income and investment11 under current law income from foreign subsidiaries of us firms is not taxed until it is repatriated in the form of dividends to the parent fi rm at the same time the parent firm is able to deduct costs the most important of which is interest even though some of that cost is associated with income that is not immediately subject to us tax such treatment essentially allows firms to use foreign tax havens to effectively shift profit out of the united states and its tax syst em the allocation rule would deny the portion of deductions associated with this income until the income is repatriated and subject to tax companies investing in nontaxhaven countri could avoid the allocation rule by repatriating income an additional allocation provision would re peal rule that involves world wide interest for the foreign tax credit when income from abroad is subject to us tax either as branch income or repatriated income foreign tax credit is allowed for foreign taxes paid up to the us tax due for firms that have more foreign taxes paid than allowable credits increasing the amount of income allocated abroad increases allowable foreign tax credits and reduces us tax liability prior to 2004 us source interest was allocated between foreign and domestic incomes based on relative magnitude of foreign and domestic assets the 2004 pr ovision included interest on foreign borrowing as well as debtfinan ced investment in the calculation whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32749crs14 12 for additional information on tre atyshopping see crs report rl34245 tax treaty legislation in the 110th

interest to domestic source income reduction in interest allocated to foreign income and resulting increase in the foreign tax credit limit another provision relating to international tax issues is

where th withholding rates are re duced firm in country without treaty can benefit by setting up s ubsidiary in treaty country to avoid the withholding tax and this provi sion would eliminate that benefit two provisions relate to inventory acc ounting while inventories are most important in the manufacturing and trad sectors of the economy the economic consequences of change in the taxation of inventories are lik ely small due to generally short holding periods for inventory13 arguably the most significant proposed change contained in hr 3970 is the repeal of provision that allows lastin firstout lifo accounting for inventories in this form of inventory the good being so ld is assumed to be the last acquired and since in general prices tend to rise ove r time this method increases the cost of the good sold and reduces profit and therefore tax liability the ot her inventory method is firstin first out fifo where the good sold is assumed to be the first acquired and thus includes any price increases in in come firms must use the same inventory method for tax and book purposes as resu lt many firms that would find lifo advantageous nevertheless use fifo because profits reported to shareholders would be lower under lifo lifo accounting may on average result in more accurate measure of income because it has the effect of indexing cost and not capturing increases in value due to inflation at the same time when relative prices are changing such as oil prices it allows firms to avoid tax on windfall gains in general the economic consequen ces of taxing the return to inventories at higher or lower rate are probably not very importan t because of the short holding period for most inventories the tax on the return is very small part of the cost second inventory provision eliminates the option to value inventories at market value rather than at cost allowing this option permits the recognition of losses in inventory even though the items ve not been sold treatment inconsistent with the general realization principle for gains and losses
