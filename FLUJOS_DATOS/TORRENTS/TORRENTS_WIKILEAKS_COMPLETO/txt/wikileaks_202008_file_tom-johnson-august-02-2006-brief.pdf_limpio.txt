concept example cbrnevent each column represents single characteristic that applies to that object each row represents single instance of that object duplicates allowed for tables columns or rows primary keys every table must have primary key defined it consists of one or more columns that uniquely identify each row in the table primary key can never be null nonkey fields columns that are not part of the primary key are called nonkey fields foreign keys when the primary key of one table is inhe rited by another table it is called foreign key in the table to which it gets inherited foreign
