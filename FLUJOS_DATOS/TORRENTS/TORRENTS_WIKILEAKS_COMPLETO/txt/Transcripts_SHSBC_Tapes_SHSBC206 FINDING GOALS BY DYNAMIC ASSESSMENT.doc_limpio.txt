finding goals by dynamic assessment lecture given on 21 august 1962 thank you ah thats very good thats very good i thank you my goal thanks you my auditor thanks you all right got some announcements here right off the bat were going to christen the new building as soon as i get back but you are going to be using the chapel here in just few days as soon as they get floor in it why youve got it and well have bit of party when i come back and because well have some space well have some party there for that now and then on weekend and weve also got canteen planned out there small size and few things to make life more livable for you i am leaving thursday on the queen elizabeth for america and ill return here be back here the seventeenth of september now ive given you an extra lecture so that your thursday unit doesnt mess up but actually you are only losing two weeks of lecture because one of them is blank anyway okay audience yes is it all right with thee to do this audience yes all right thank you i always ask the kids is it okay if i go you know and they always think it over very carefully and tell yes all right and the washington congress goes off on labor day and so forth and ill be saying hello for you and so forth and ill tell them how good you are so its up to you not to make liar out of okay all right okay we have some new students amongst us probably some of the older students are already telling the new students about thethey should have been here in the old days when you know you know ill betill bet this has already occurred you think its tough now well you ought to have been here last june i suppose this is already happening all right weve got two lectures tonightboth of them are quite fundamental the first lecture is the dynamic assessment the other one is the basics of auditing the other one depending on how embracive the material is and that sort of thing will be lecture which you better take to heart because you will be using this very lecture in training students but this particular lecture this first lecture lecture number one saint hill special briefing coursedate audience 21st 22nd somebody says the 22nd somebody says the 21st audience 21st twentyfirst all right thank you had mixed up there for minute i was in two days all right the twentyfirst september october december whats the date audience august 21st of august august the 21st of august all right ad 12 thank you very much the way i start my stories to the children saint hill england planet earth solar system this galaxy in this part of this universe see oncet uponet timet all right dynamic assessment now there has been considerable advance made and i gave you the tiger drill i told you at the time when i gave you the tiger drill that i really didnt much like releasing it but you needed it its released all right similarly youve been walking on my heels with dynamic assessment ive got the whole story here on dynamic assessment all the way down the line the first thing you should realize about this is that ordinary routine 3ga exactly as you have had it week or so ago couple of weeks ago when i gave you the full rundown on the thingthat is totally valid there is nothing wrong with it anyplace at all the tiger drill can be little bit improved by which you null the goals but ill give you that improvement in this lecture now but thats perfectly valid you go out and you say to somebody do 850 goals you find the goals list is still charged you ask him who would oppose your goal you know and get that fourway list and get what goal might you have as separate list and you just use all of these things and then you just start from goal one and you go on through and in large majority of cases youll find the pcs goal before youve hit the mark 500 okay providing you do good job of nulling you understand thats perfectly valid procedure thats in the can now another one is this there is fancy way of finding goal and this fancy way is by dynamic assessment and this will be done by class iv auditor you could probably find goal on anybody even though he was riding 8785 goaltype case dont you see i mean you could have him run goals and goals and goals and write goals and goals and the paper is accumulating you use small shopping cart you know coming back and forth from the auditing sessions in order to carry all the goals list you know thing has to be put on ibm microfilm you know special projectors to read the stuff off otherwise it would take up the space of the library of congress or something like that you know now this characterthe goal is almost impossible to find on him and that comprises large percentage of the cases about 25 percent you are not going to find any goal on this character until youve gone out so 3ga would find the goal on this pc you understand that but it is becoming uneconomical see in terms of time and the difference between these two pcs is specifically and directly this that the goal of the pc that is going to take you long long while you see in terms of hundreds of hours of auditing to find on 25 percent of the cases is an overta direct overttype goal in other words its an overt goal that is directly overt you see and the other is an inadvertent overt goal you get the idea the inadvertent overt goal is very easy to find but the one that is direct overt goal is very difficult to find now you think that the wording of the goal is what makes the goal difficult to find lets take such goal as not to be located you see and you offhand would say at once that this was the most difficult type of goal following dianetiephrase reasoning you see therefore the goal would duck whereas as matter of fact that does not hold true those goals very often turn up in the first hundred goals listed by experience and are not the difficult goal to find the difficult goal to find is the direct overt goal its direct overt goal and the pc who has this can be told on the meter because in the process of auditing he commonly has rock slam turn on which is wider than an inch or two and that is that pc thats 25 percent of the pcs and that pc has direct overt goalwide rock slam you run little bit of ow on this pc you are prepchecking this pc you get wide rock slam well actually this wide rock slam is not because your ordinary pc has done something personally to you as an auditor you could have this as freak lets say you are auditing your girlfriend or your boyfriend and youve got dialwide slam starts turning on and they dont have directly overttype goal at all theyve just been twotiming you thats all now you get that overt off against you personally the auditor it has to be against you the auditor to come into that classification it must have been done to you personally see and you will get that dialwide slam but theyve done something pretty wild and that theyre not admitting its not something they are just trying to keep you from finding out you know nothing mild like this you know but they were the person who foreclosed your mortgage and threw you out on the street see you get the idea theyve been having illicit affairs they have prison record and dont want you to know it because if it came to be known of this it would do something to you the auditor you get the difference here now thats what this means you just get that off you keep testing for that as direct overt and if direct overt doesnt exist there you see or if the dialwide slam turns on any other this is better test on any other thing than you commonly why this is direct overttype goal the way to test this is the simplest thing in the world you say what have you done to what overt have you committed against and you fish around for while along this type of line and you get slam well thats just the person has got fantastic overt against you personally but this also can miss as test because you might be included in the goal you got it now it is so infrequent that the overt is against you personally as the auditor even though you are living with the person and everything else it is so infrequent that this is the case that it can be neglected now this is getting much simpler isnt it it can actually be neglected in the main course of auditing but only must be remembered on the off chance that it exists and the error that you could make is not very serious it is not serious at all you see because you would simply take course of action with this person and nothing would work out you just couldnt get to first base with anything remember that there is another chance that the person has fantastically direct overt against you personally got it but oddly enough you could make up your mind to that far too easily see because there is another factor saving it you see that it takes pretty heavy charge to get that much slam you see on needletakes pretty heavy charge and even though the person had an overt against you directly you probably could find the goal anyhow do you see all the logic behind this now it all sums down to this that you could sort this out which one it was but having sorted it out you would only know this that you had to prepcheck the pc more carefully than otherwise and now wait minute the goal could also be found the goal could also be found on the dialwide slam proposition by dynamic assessment even though the person had this much overt against you providing you could read the persons meter you understand providing you could and of course you cant you see you cant read that persons meter persons meter is not responsive do you follow this do you follow this out audience yes so although im giving you all this logic it doesnt matter i dont like to give you statement which is partial truth see so im giving you all the data back of this you could just say for all working principles that any person who turns on at anytime during his processing quarter halfadial slam you do dynamic assessment type goal and you are going to find the goal easily got that if you are able to read the meter at all you can do dynamic assessment you understand if you cant read the meter at all and it never responds at the right points and so forth you must also assume the person has overts on you but then of course what are you doing running nonprepcheck pc on goals run if youd prepared the pc properly you would have found this all out anyhow see you see how this is so i just dont want to give you halftruth but for working purposes you dont have to worry about ityou get any kind of slam i dont care if its only this wide or if its this wide see i dont care if its this wide or only this wide or if its hitting both pinsyou just take look at that that has occurred to the pcjust know then that your chances of finding the goal easily by 3ga usuali mean the commonest not the commonest but the simplest method because you probably all will be using dynamic assessments on all pcs see im just telling you the limitation and you just know that youre in for hell of run thats all but listen on some of those cases ordinary routine 3 oldtime goals assessment found the proper goal on some of them very small percentage of them so it probably scales it down to about 20 percent you would sweat for ahhhhh see and then oh my god months later youd come up with goal you get the idea by ordinary goals assessment now this is the other side of the coin all pcs can have their goals found by dynamic assessment see it is not limited to those pcs im just telling you the pcs that the possibilities of locating the goal are very remoteexcept by dynamic assessment but now on dynamic assessment this makes it even more easy you are talking about 100 percent of your pcs you can use it on all of them if you can use it if you can pull this card trick why it is the fast road to finding goals this is the high fast ml superexpress crossroad highway to finding goals see this is fast it is fast but it is also fatal if an auditor were to do this on pc and bleed all the charge out and get all of the data and not turn it over to his next auditor and not sort of pin it on the pcs lapel youve had it just that youve just had it thats all youve got to meter this pc now and straighten this whole thing out by recalling the sessions the pc has had to get the data back now ill tell you one of the methods of getting the data back we knew that pc who just left here as secondgoal clearwe knew pc had run clear on goal and we didnt even have the goals list and we didnt remember what the goal is so i told her auditor to do list of goals on this pc in which this word occurred which we knew the pc had been run on that was all the data we had see and we did list of i dont know how many goals were done i said fifty i dont know how many got done and then they assessed this list and they found this goal back well of course it was the most obvious one well we couldnt take chance dont you see and we found that goal and then we went ahead and ran and listed that goal and the pc went clear on it dont you see the right goal had been found but remember this you desensitize the case you desensitize the case terribly by doing this dynamic assessment do you realize that by removing the charge on these lines that is the only time you are ever going to get that data at the end line you never are going to be able to do it again it is one shot you understand you are going to be able to do it once now the odd part of it is is you cant do it once wrong you can do it wrong thousand times and the charge will still be on the bank you see this now you could do it wrong all you want to you are not going to bleed any charge off the bank get the wrong dynamic and the wrong item and the wrong this the case will just simply be little more arc breaky to audit thats the final end result of that but do it right and then dont make the data known do itdo it right find the dynamic find the item we are looking for on this dynamic assessment find all these steps and then get goals list and dont find the goal if weve gone this far aghhh this poor pc has had it if we dont make this data known to organizations or auditors or central clearing point for such data some pc is going to get hung man because there is just recovering it thats it you follow you cant do this again it is something on the order of going up on tower and pouring all the water out of the tower and there is pump to ever get any water back up to it again except another 200 trillion years of living now you go up and you empty all the water out of the tower and you are supposed to find the key at the bottom of the barrel next auditor comes along he cant even find the tower much less the key if he doesnt have the data that was found by this see so your auditors reports must note with great carenow let impress this upon younote with great care whether or not certain phenomena such as rock slam dwindling out was present and you must know what dwindlingout rock slam is because you can do it wrong and have the rock slam occur on the first part of the list and then vanish because you are not on the list just like any wrong goal practically will list the first hundred items without killing the pc and even doing him little bit of good after that the second hundred throws him sort of into state of where he isnt quite sure whether he wants to go on living or not the third hundred kills him and the fourth hundred if you can get him to sit still to run them of course you bury him thats just that see it looks awful good there for moment sometimes on the beginning of dynamic assessment or list or something like that we get dizzzza and we say thats it you know and we go to the next step and nothing happens so you want to make all these things clear in your auditors report that you did dynamic assessment and you found hell of slam on the physical universe and you couldnt get anyplace else see make that very clear or if you got someplace else thatas you were listing the items derived from physical universe that you got dwindling slam or you got slam which persisted very widely for the first ten items and then vanished and never went down to dirty needle never went down to dirty needle you know never got smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and mash you saw one of those on my television demonstration you saw type of list and it went bwow and then it didnt do thing see that was one of those see wrong line see i went in the wrong corner of the slot you were watching there actually research auditing sessions not demonstrations see trying to find out about this thought you could learn from it too hoped it would come out all right since that time ive really done some auditing see man the engrams have been flying you know i dont know how much auditing has happened since you last saw the last demonstration last friday but its oh i dont know must be something on the order of aboutwhat is it about thirty five hours thirty hours thirtyfive hours almost as much auditing as there were days and getting this thing taped out getting this thing grooved because its always before i take tripsit was much more vital when i was still riding airplanes you know why im not riding airplanes its just too much responsibility its not whether youd lose you see but its just my responsibility see my responsibility is just little too heavy and furthermore i think that thirtysix thousandfoot fall is very hard on rolleiflex cameras of course they are shedding airplanes out of the sky these days something like raindrops in england and oh you have to wear steel umbrellas lately where they are crashing airplanes you know but it is awfully hard on my cameras and i know you wouldnt want to lose any more cameras i have lost one camera for the sake of dynamic assessment you actually lost two and we dont want to lose any more we can afford so much for research but beyond that all right now let give you packaged statement of the person you must run in case somebody got lost here or he got confused on it the person you must run dynamic assessment on im going to hear somehear some whistles here in minute and oh i see oh yeah what do you know huh yeah thats so true you know that kind of reaction it is just listen now the wide rock slamming needle turning on once in while or now and then whatbut which has been known to turn on on this pc in auditing got it under all those classifications see it turns on and youve seen it an auditor tells you it has turned on dont you see its on lot its on now and then its on rarely just however weve learned about this wide rock slam needle you know heavy searching hunting banging crashing needle you know doesnt matter how we learned about it you neednt try to find goal on that pc by any other method than the dynamic assessment method because you are going to lay an egg you are going to be up there about three thousand goals up the line and you are still sweating got it but remember dont worry about it too much if you can only do old 3ga only see dont worry about it too much because certain percentage of pcs very small percentage of those pcs still have found their goals early on the list you see that so you are not taking your life in your hands now thats type 1 see wide rock slamming needle known reported we dont care how wide rock slamming needle number 2 pc who is unresponsive to the auditor on the meter you say are you willing to talk to about your difficulties and the pc says myah i guess so yeah ill talk about my difficulties and you dont get any knock on the thing and you get suspicious and you sort of put the meter aside for the moment and you say well are there any difficulties that you arent willing to talk to about just check them over carefully and you might oh well and he gives you an automaticity naaahhhh you might say its pc in chronic arc break state unresponsive on meter the pc is too remote there is impingement can be made on this pc now it doesnt matter how good you are this is rare piece notnot too rare but this is special class of pc you can never get rudiment in on him anything the clue and key to this pc is everything is suppressed well go into that later pcs got everything suppressed and suppresses the auditor and suppresses this and suppresses that the clue to this is you ask the pcyou can find out what this pc is doing and establish the suppressed pc rather easilyand you say when i say there there there to you what do you do because the pc is seldom answering you well what do i do pc doesnt react to steering you see you say what do i do pc says what do i do well well i throw aside those that you are saying because they couldnt be it and you know thats quite few pcs and the only thing you have to know about is the pc doesnt answer up to steering thats all you have to know about it that takes care of your whole class ii pc here of this type see thats the whole lot they just dont answer up to steering you say are you willing to talk to about your difficulties and you get tick tiny tick and you say yes there there what difficulty arent you willing to be talking about you know there there there there pc doesnt say anything there there pc doesnt say anything you say there there there you say what are you looking at the pc tells you something get the idea now the normal pc when you say there there pc oh well that yeah well i dont know what that is you know ive got picture of bed i dont know what that is oh i know i know that was where i murdered the policeman yeah i guess thats the sup thats that see they give it to you see give it to you as result of the steering this other type of pc never gives you anything as result of steering so watch the steering keep your weather eye open on this pc pc doesnt react to steering the clue to the case is suppress and the only thing youve got to do with this case is run suppress till it runs out of the pcs ears and you can make the meter operate goal or goal got it all right now your next class of pc is pc who turns on dirty needle ever i see you like that now of course you will get slightly ticktickety needle on missed withhold you will get on failed to reveal on almost any pc you will get ticketytick once in blue moon but pc who regularly gets ticketytick has not got his goal found its not been found it isnt on the list hasnt been elucidated and is nowhere to be located well that was surprise i told you youd say hahaha i didnt expect you to laugh you probably dont believe any pc around whose needle is going bzztbzzt particularly on the other rudiments now thats for sure on the other rudiments but any pc whose needle you have to work to clean up because it is dirty needle you have not got the pcs goal on the list or the pcs goal is so buried and so suppressed and its been found long time ago or something but the probability is it hasnt been found at all good test which you could never find out by the way the data is never available is the pc who had had goal found sometime previously it read with an instant dirty needle any goal that reads with an instant dirty needle is not only not the goal but it indicates that the goal has not been found it doesnt exist on the list and has not been enunciated to the pcby the pc to anybody see does this apply to your pc any pcs you are auditing at the present moment ever turn on dirty needle well that pcs goal is not on the list life becomes fascinating doesnt it what does it take to make dirty needle turn on well brother it is something like the power or force of krakatoa which when it blew its head gave the world red sunsets from the sundaymonday line clear on around and back for three years see theres power theres force underneath that see it is somewhat like trying to sit on plain lid on superheated boiler with the steam accumulating see and as that comes up and hits the underside of the thing youll get this little phenomenon known as dirty needle see its not that the pc is feeling upset or something like that it is that the pc is definitely and desperately suppressed with magnitude and then they are holding charge on that that would blow nova see thats charge now the more goofy the pcs needle is now lets take an emeter essentials the more pattern needle develops the more charge is on the goals line and vaguelywell pc whose goal is on the list or pc whose goal is very accessible or pcs goal is very easy to audit or something like thisnever gets tick or tack youd have to put him into the most remarkable state youd have to run the most weirdly offbeat processes to finally turn on bzzt and then youd only turn it on very briefly but this pc who gets little missed withholdthey want to sneeze and they dont sneeze you know and the needle goes bzztbzztbzzt little tiny dirty rock slam zztzztzztzztzztzzt you say all right what withhold have i missed on you well i wanted to sneeze and it disappears see why look sneeze doesnt turn on that much dirty needle ohhohoho hoho uhuh takes more than that man it takes something like enough force and power to blow the whole planet to pieces see sitting down underneath the bank for person just to think that they dont want to sneeze and turn on dirty needle because these are series of reversing currents in the reactive bank how jammed in does fellow have to get now how about the fellow now that boythat boy you could probably 3ga him routine and find his goal see you probably still could do that rather easily but how about this guy you get quarterofadial rock slam and you say what was that what was that whats that whatwhatwhatwhats happened you know whatwhatwhats the matter you know he says well i was suppressing sneeze there is only one method of finding that characters goal by dynamic assessment unless somebody has shot in the pants with luck see find my goal the other night one of myfor that session one of the session goals was to be lucky and we were first time i ever put it up as session goal now look im probably wasting lot of your time on going into the ramifications of this and that but im just trying to tell you who this is should be runnable on and who its best on but remember it can be run on anybody now exactly what do you do now lets go into the one two three four bang bang bang bang bang well the first thing you do is you get the pc to write 850 goals and then you strip the list one way or the other and then you save that carefully and you save any goals list the pc has you got all that he does that on his own bang thats just 3ga see all right now if you are goalsfinding auditor and you just get this pcyou get pc by the scruff of the neck and youve got himsomebody else has prepared him theyve prepchecked him and everything like that you set him down and you just go right in and you do this action bang bang bang see you do this action you make him build the wheel of life see make him build the wheel of life you give him lot of samples you give him basic wheel thats got eight parts thats just your eight dynamics see its lot of little pies can be put into this thing and the reason you use wheel sort of thing not that it is easy to assess as it is not but it gives him the idea of entirety its good symbolism and you give him some sample lists you give him some samples you know like theres these you know theres sex divides into family children marriage wives so forth and other things you might think of you see other things you might think of you see and he can draw all these things out and he can find these things here get this some oldtime scientologists say well what are the dynamics according to you and he gives you thirty bang thats items on it thats simple the raw meat pc mysticism rears its ugly head see the whole track opens and gapes you see you say do an entirety of existence he wont even be able to embrace an entirety of existence unless you give him some symbolism of some kind to help him you say this is the whole of existence this thing and its divided into eight segments here as you can see and there is all this and that complete it and heres some samples on the back well give you some of them see and you can draw one up give him whole bunch of samples you know divide marriage up into homes and cooking and you know anything and he just goes ahead and he fills this out well i dont care whether he does that in session or not see its good thing when you first hear of him to go around and hand this to him with all of its directions on it hes supposed to complete the wheel of life before he comes in and talks to you see you can sit there with your turban on you see i dont care whether you call it this or not im gagging to some degree but its just your old eight dynamics see but there isyou want some additional segments and its good thing to have whole list of them of various optional segments that might be part of it according to him see its good thing andbut coax him at the same time to believe that there might be lot more missing sort of give him the idea that unless he solves this puzzle all of his auditing may be held up which is absolutely true you tell him to solve this puzzle and get all of it on there see an oldtime scientologist has already solved the puzzle hes thought over this and hes sat around and hes said well lets see there was four in the first book and then there was four more and i think there are also this many and these really divide this way and hes given you several subdivisions of the subdivisions see and hes got his own ideas of what these things are and hes just laid his case in your lap savvy i made mistake the other day the reason you didnt see good session is because i didnt take the pcs list dont often make an error for christs sakes profit by it all right now lookahere you got this thing now see and you assess by rock slam and you just go around this thing calling everything off that is on it until you get rock slam and you go round and round and round on this thing see and its just assessment by elimination just that the ones that are in you go over them second time the same way you do prehav scale and everything else but the auditing command for this assessment is entirely different than an old dynamic assessment and it is not common dynamic assessment its overts against so you say think of doing bad things to or consider committing overts against dynamic see and you just keep that up keep that up keep that up keep that up you got it and consider committing overts to sex consider committing overts to children consider committing overts to marriage consider committing overts to home and family whatever hes put down there you see as these subdivisions you know and you go round and round and round on this thing and you mark each one to its reactionthat reacts but you are looking there not for necessarily instant reaction but one in the vicinity of it and ill tell you something the moreif his item is on there youll get instant rock slams and if his item isnt you wont got it isnt that nice indicator i do you favor every once in while see you are not going to get an instant rock slam if his item is off there the read is late and scrubby and all this sort of thing the item is off that list so if you see that this isnt instant rock slam dont break your heart go around on this thing and if the first couple of times around you havent got something rock slamming takes maybe about three times around to do the whole thing till you know for sure my god is this thing spirit you know you hit spirit its bzzt boom boom knack knack boom boom spurp spurp blurp you know like one of these electronic plays you hear the ions going around inside the tube you know crashcrashcrashcrash it is unmistakable it is something like the difference between driving on rough country road and hitting tree you know you can tell the difference if you dont get that kind of reaction after about the third time around and havent already made up your mind you better get him to do the wheel of life again and just pat him on the back and say well you havent solved this and i think youd better just take this up and youd better consider this more and so forth you can let him consider it in the session but why waste your time you could say now lets get down to business here there are eight basic dynamics you realize that according to hubbard there are eight basic dynamics what youve got to do is correct him on this because there are obviously more what are they now youve obviously left one out here give him another list of things to study like websters international dictionary anything you want to now there will probably be lots of tricks of the trade as to how to get this wheel of life out of the pc but everything else depends on making sure thats complete okay everything depends because what you are going to get if you follow through an incomplete list of the dynamics is they will all come down to little dzzzsdzzzsdzzzsdzzzs and then they all go out and then maybe dirty needle stays on everything and then you say well this dirty needle is more than the rest so we will list it and the whole thing lists to little dirty needle and you get down to the end youve got little dirty needle and theres little dirty needle and he gets rock slam theres little dirty needle and you ask him question he gets little dirty needle and you know its definitely laundry work to hand see and all of that is caused because the dynamic that you want is not on this wheel that whole phenomena is caused by just that there is piece of life that he thinks is an integral section of life that he hasnt put down now the odd part of it is he may not think of it without some suggestions so some lists will sometimes be necessary maybe if you could divide marriage up into thirty parts which one of these are actually parts of marriage you see you know i mean second dynamic into thirty parts which one of these are actually parts of the second dynamic you know let him choose one or two because hes going to be too random for us to make patent basic list hes going to be too random youd be surprised but toothpicks will be necessary dynamic on some pc toothpicks thats the seventh dynamic yes maybe so but if it is man will that assess out you get the rock slam on it its an integral part of life life consists of god and self and sex and hes not sure about mankind or species or living things of the physical universe or that sort of thing but toothpicks see therethats what life consists of and hell give you this item now what do you do with this item now look dont monkey with it if you havent got that item that item will sit there and rock slam you are not going to wear the rock slam out of it as long as the pc stays in session and he isnt all arc breaky and so forth he can even arc break and you still get the rock slam its nice hefty rock slam everything else eventually disappears and the whole reaction goes into this thing its usually couple of divisions three divisions somebody with decent needle you see its nice nice heavy atchatchatchatchachachach achach you read him the next one to it nothing its also instant bang bangbangbangbang bangbangbangbangbang you see physical universe bangbangbangbangbang physical universe bangbangbang bangbang spirits god self sex psst thats one time around sex psst and then physical universe bangbangbangbangbangbangbang you got the idea unmistakable its not one of these equivocal things matter how lousy the needle is this will do now something else i should tell you is it doesnt matter how lousy the pcs needle is to do this it just doesnt matter you should get him into session somehow or another but it really doesnt matter how lousy his needle is because you are going to address this subject hes going to have lousy needle doesnt matter how clean and whistle clean his needle was before you brought up this nasty subject of the wheel of life his needle is now going to be dirty and you start assessing it its going to be mess you got it all right you take that one you found and this is what you do with it you say what represents the dynamic you found its the one that rock slammed to you and you just make list of this and you go on down and you make list of this and this is the way it ought to look and if it doesnt lookit can look three ways everything is dirty needle thats wrong these items as you list them each one goes bzzt he says these you know bzzt bzzt bzzt its undiminishing it never diminishes never gets smaller never gets less little tiny dirtywell you did lousy dynamic assessment in the first place for that to have happened the dynamic wasnt on the list you went and guessed at it out of desperation or you did something corny see something wrong was done at that point now the next action is is it goes and this is also wrong one it goes crash crash crash crash for the first five items and then you dont have anything big rock slam for few items and then you dont have anything well thats also wrong so you haul off of that one the exact proper phenomenon is big rock slam slightly less slightly less slightly less slightly less slightly less slightly less diminishing each item he gives you he may give you couple of null items but the next hot item that is on the list youve got bzzt bang brrr bang brrr bang brr bang br bng tick tick nothing got the idea its almost like going down river which has got less and less water in it and you finally go aground when you are at the end see the idea in other words you steer into this thing called the wheel of lifethe dynamicsyou steer into this thing and you find channel and you go down through this channel and its wide rock slam all the way down this channel see and you get to the end of that list of what represents and you shouldnt have anything left there should be reaction to the question what represents dynamic there should be reaction to dynamic there should be reaction to anything dont you see you run that totally do you have any more items is the list complete all this kind of thing you see thats gone thats dead now the list is relatively short it certainly seldom will exceed i think youll find in actual practice couple of hundred items that would be rather hefty list see all right and thats gone but it sort of dwindled away dont you see it is sort of like going down cone it just dwindled away and got to be nothing see the charge was less and less in other words the phenomenon of bleeding charge off of this thing is definitely present when you see this youll say well how did ron know that you know well ill ask the same question anyhow our next action now is little unexpected and this is all new stuff now you take the item you assess the thing by elimination and youll get this nice big rock slam back but it wont be quite so big and one of them will rock slam you do it by elimination you dont do it by tiger drill or anything like that one of them rock slams and that thing is it there shouldnt be any question in your coco but whatthat is it meantime youve found the dynamic for gods sakes write it on an auditors report in capital letters so it can be seen so it doesnt get lost anyplace because auditor coming in your wake is ever going to find it again because you found it by bleeding the charge and the charge is now gone okay now you do the next action see first the dynamic then youve listed the dynamic then you assess by elimination on that list and you find this item which is now rock slamming and now you take that item and you say what represents that item to you and you do another list and that will do the same thing that will cone down and it will be rather slight this list is much less probably less lengthy less charged and it should dwindle away too and leave one item in it rock slamming and maybe its the same item you found but maybe its slightly different in other words you are asking him to rephrase this item and then you are finding the rephrasing by assessment you got that you got that now all youve got to do is take prehav assessment the old auxiliary prehave scale do it by elimination but by the way all these assessments are you know what represents this to you thats not dynamic against dont you see you follow this its not considered committing overts against these items its just what represents to you dont you see its as simple as that you can assess that way but you can also assess by consider overts against these things and you could go down the line that same way dont you see this would again pep it up and that sort of thing but in actual fact the thing will just rock slam if you just assess it you got that of course you can you know think of committing bad things against thesethis item list you could do that see and what represents that in other words theres couple of ways you could go about this thing neither one of them wrong now you can take the old prehav list and take your final item and that was catfish see haha it was fish see it was dynamics fifth dynamic what assessed out was fish on the first list and youve got fish again all right what represents fish to you and the fellow gives you this and that and the other thing and the other thing and you find out it was catfish hahahaha wasnt fish it was catfish hahahaha now you can actually do prehav assessment on the subject of catfish should you dynamic line catfish should you withdraw from catfish should you leave catfish what should you do to catfish you got this and one of those is going to rock slam and youve got the guys goal in bucket therell be fee for all this heavy work i mean im not going to work for nothing on this thats real fancy dynamic assessment actually you dont have to be quite that fancy to come up with the answer but thats getting real fancy see you not only found the dynamic but you found the item that represented the dynamic and then you found the item that represented the item that represented the dynamic that brought you in awful close didnt it you practically got the exact thing that the goal is worded with and then you did the prehav assessment to find the verb haha hohohohohoho you may get such thing as to withdraw from catfish but you know damn well that it is not exactly this type of goal see its not exactly to withdraw from catfish so now youve got to have list of things goals he might have that would express this action to withdraw from catfish now theres only one hole in this if its an inadvertent goal it may be entirely different but an inadvertent list remember was nonrock slamming not upsetting you do the same thing and youll get the same phenomena and everything else will turn on it will all go up according to hoyle but if its nonovertno i mean its an inadvertent overt see not intentional its just the fact he wants to make steel and you know he wants to make steel thats the goal you see and oddly enough they make fish hooks out of steel and hes committing an overt continuously against catfish with fishhooks see he didnt have catfish in mind thats the inadvertent goalthe inadvertent overt goal he didnt have catfish in mind but its collided with this thing just in the natural course of the events this other goal is to take catfish and do something very overt to them see the overtthe direct overt goal will probably contain the word catfish and the inadvertent goal wont so if the list wasnt much charged why its probably inadvertent now here is the way you get around that you give the pcafter youve done all this and you also then do this list of goals and that runs charge out until there is charge on it but the fact there is charge on it is guarantee that the goal is on that list that is not guarantee you got that it is guarantee at all you could actually ask him to do couple of hundred more goals just off the bat he could go ahead and do that here is why you wrote your 850 list you say now go back to the beginning of your goals list and give him purple pencil with red polka dots see and you say you mark in every goal there that would be an overtwould express anything like withdrawing from catfish see you just mark any goal that would even vaguely mean this or any goal that would be an overt against catfish any goalany goal see you just mark in anything and he starts in at the beginning and he marks in every one of these goals which would be now when you take his goals list to assess it you take the 850 list the items hes marked in and run it from the beginning forward see how you do that he did the 850 list before you fooled around with the dynamic assessment but now he knows where the goal is targeted there is slightest doubt in his mind about where the goal is targeted and you know whether the goal is the right goal or not of course you know whether it is the right goal at that but you can get goal there thatyou spend time on these goals now now the only other thing that can go wrong with this type of assessment is the fact that there is hole in the original tigers drill that i released it to you that is thatsthings can be suppressed below the level of meter read you got that so you prepcheck suppress one of the best ways to handle this the offhand pitch is you prepcheck suppress with the meter laid aside see when i say repetitive prepcheck see with the meter laid aside dont look at the meter look at the goals list and say on the goal to catch catfish has anything been suppressed and you are looking straight at the pc and he says brrjrrnn you say well answer it has it or hasnt it been try to think any suppression on this goal and he says soandso and soandso then ask him do you have any additional answers well he says soandso and soandso and soandso and you say all right now ill check it on the meter see on the goal to catch catfish has anything been suppressed and only then can you promote tick goal can be so suppressed that the suppress wont read and if the suppress wont read nothing else will read and youve got to promote the read and when you are checking an old goal and trying to get it alive again dont worry about the meter until youve got the pc flat on the suppress on the subject of goals on the subject of clearing on the subject of you know your prepcheck but dont do these things down the line the way it is in the policy letter see and forget to ever go back and check any of these things when you finish one of these sections on that prepcheck hahahahaha you better check all of those over and see if there is anything else on in other words youve got to clear each one of those sections not just run over it indifferently one item at time lets find out if there is anything else on this thing do fast check on them after that you find out this thing has hotted up and the suppress may have hotted up on you again because suppress is the only tricky button dont worry about the rest of them being tricky youll find the reads on those but you wont find the read on suppress if you dont find the read on suppress you cant get the read on the rest of them you got that and thats the only hole in goals finding and thats how your goals disappear and thats how goals cant be found and that sort of thing you got it now on the beginning of any goals list by dynamic assessment and so forth you make awfully sure that you have the pcs goals that have been found before put those to the beginning of the list i dont care who prepchecked them i dont care what he did with them i dont care anything else my own goal was found last june and has sat suppressed ever since and five wrong goals were found on top of it one right after the other and only by accident after dynamic assessment did that goal blow into view again and of course it was the perfect overt it was an inadvertent overt that was why it was lying there sleepily you follow this now i dont care whether you do the prehav assessment or not i dont care whether you do that or not it is just another string to your bow got it just another string to the bow that will give you the item the goal is an overt against but an inadvertent overt goal wont have the item mentioned in it and it might be far wide of the point too wide for the pc to guess so that is why you go back over the first 850 goals and have him mark in those that it would be an overt against whatever the final item was he may start marking in too many but dont upset him too much about it the probability is is the goal is in the first few pages maybe hes only marked in twenty on the firstin the first 300 goals you see thats lot different than doing 300 goals isnt it see you are saving time all the way and you know what the goal islooks like see you know about what it is the pc may badger himself around all over the place trying to find out what this goal is but you can locate the goal now there are probably other tricks by which you can define and make the goal definitive and so forth those tricks can be developed from time to time ideas can come up about this we know exactly what the anatomy and structure of goal charge is and exactly what it leads down to now you can probably do tremendous number of things with that but that is dynamic assessment as it exists right now here on the 21st of august ad 12 okay thank you
