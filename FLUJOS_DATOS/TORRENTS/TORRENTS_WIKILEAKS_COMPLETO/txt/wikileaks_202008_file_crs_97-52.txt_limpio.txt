continue broadcasting into five other asian target countries for fy2000 the presidents budget request for rfa and the senate appropriation s 1217 are 23 million on october 1 1999 as result of the foreign affairs reform and restructuring act of 1998 the bbg will become an independent agency in order to maintain its journalistic integrity while the rest of usia will merge into the department of state 1 us surrogate broadcasting provides independent uncensored and accurate news and information of events in the targeted country often closed society as well as cultural programs of that country surrogate broadcasting includes radio free europeradio liberty inc in contrast general broadcasting carried out by voice of america presents reliable source of international news american policies and culture to listeners overseas congressional research service the library of congress crs2 background the idea of us surrogate broadcasting in asia dates back to the korean war and was again raised during the vietnam war interest in creating broadcast service to asia reemerged after the chinese governments 1989 crackdown on the prodemocracy movement in tiananmen square in december 1991 the presidents task force on international broadcasting recommended increasing us surrogate broadcasting activities into the peoples republic of china as did the commission on broadcasting to the peoples republic of china in september 1992 third us government committee the us advisory commission on public diplomacy recommended in august 1992 enhancing voa broadcasting to china in early 1993 the administration sought in its fy1994 budget request 30 million for the creation of surrogate service which was referred to as radio free asia on june 15 1993 the president announced his proposal for major consolidation of us nonmilitary international broadcasting including the creation of new asian democracy radio throughout that year the 103rd congress debated whether and how to broadcast into asia proponents of surrogate broadcasting into asia argued that 1 it would promote democracy especially in china where political repression and government control of news is strong 2 freer and more open countries would enhance us bilateral relations in asia and 3 the united states has an obligation to promote freedom around the world not just in europe opponents claimed that china is much more open society with many sources of information unlike europe and the soviet union in the 1950s when radio free europeradio liberty rferl was established expanding voice of america voa broadcasts rather than creating surrogate service would be less expensive and less confrontational they contended reducing the possible reaction by asian governments of digging in their heels and moving even further away from democratic principles after numerous hearings and debates congress authorized the idea of radio free asia surrogate broadcasting entity in the united states international broadcasting act of 1994 title iii of the foreign relations authorization act fiscal years 1994 and 1995 hr 2333 signed into law on april 30 1994 as pl 103236 the law stipulated that grant could be made to rfa unless 1 detailed plan on the formation of rfa is sent to congress within ninety days after the confirmation of the broadcasting board of governors and 2 the plan certifies that rfa can be established and operate with grants of more than 22 million in any fiscal year with onetime capital costs of more than 8 million radio free asia would assume all obligations not the us government and grants would end after september 30 1999 unless the presidents budget submission to congress recommends one year extension as authorized in sec 309g of pl 103236 eighteen months later the bbg sent the required rfa plan to congress november 15 1995 after some in congress expressed concern that the administration was stonewalling on the issue rfas plan asserted that it would be possible to establish surrogate broadcasting service into asian countries within the budget set forth by congress and that it would be broadcasting as soon as possible the plan stated that full time staff for fy1995 and fy1996 would not exceed 45 in washington dc and 110 crs3 independent contractors the bbg also set out several recommendations that funding for an asia surrogate service continue under the bbg that the new entity be created as private us corporation using existing transmitters where possible that the new service be named the asia pacific network apn that the entity establish its headquarters in washington dc with an office in asia and that it begin operation as soon as transmission site issues are resolved and staff hired despite congressional objections to altering the radio free asia name as cited by law the broadcasting service was incorporated on march 11 1996 as the asia pacific network radio free asia inc in the following months congress reasserted that radio free asia is the authorized name the first rfa broadcast took place on september 29 1996 broadcasting into china in mandarin the initial broadcasts of one hour at 700 am and one hour at 1100 pm included regional news and feature stories the chinese government reacted to the initial broadcasts with strongly worded letters of opposition to top level us government officials as well as editorials in major chinese newspapers claiming that the cia is behind the broadcast operation current status rfas uyghur wu and cantonese programs were added most recently in 1998 in response to the desire of congress under the radio free asia act of 1998 to increase broadcasting in other languages to china in addition to mandarin and tibetan by the end of fy1999 rfa will be broadcasting 24 hours day into china 12 hoursday of mandarin 3 hoursday of cantonese 8 hoursday of tibetan and 1 hourday of uyghur from the beginning of rfa the chinese government vigorously opposed this surrogate broadcasting asserting that the us is using broadcasting to impose its values on asian citizens and interfere in asian countries internal affairs china began jamming rfa mandarin broadcasts in most frequencies on august 18 1997 the government also began jamming tibetan broadcasts in early october 1997 earlier vietnam had begun jamming the vietnamese broadcasts in february 1997 and north korea also had begun jamming the korean broadcasts in june 1997 the chinese government is also jamming rfas uyghur and cantonese broadcasts in all of these cases jamming has been continual but with varying degrees of effectiveness rfa currently is broadcasting into china via multiple transmission sites and on varying frequencies keeping the probability of china government jamming at minimum the broadcast entity has been successful in averting some but not all of the jamming in october 1998 rfa launched its website which provides the audio broadcasts as well as additional written material there is evidence that the vietnamese and chinese governments have since tried to block internet access and have been successful at blocking it in many places the bbgs january 15 1999 report to congress focused on the continuing efforts of rfa to counter the suppression of its programming2 2 radio free asia broadcasting to china report to congress pursuant to section 3903 pl continued crs4 in another report to congress dated april 16 1999 the bbg said the rfa was cost effective and successful in reaching its listeners despite logistical and security difficulties in 1998 private research organization was able to conduct audience surveys on chinese listenership of rfas mandarin broadcasts according to the threesite survey among all international broadcasters only voa and the bbc both of which have been on the air since the 1940s as well as the taiwan government radio station had higher listenership than rfa3 until 1998 all rfa transmitter sites had been leased in 1998 and early 1999 rfa obtained permanent sites on the islands of saipan and tinian respectively in the northern marianas although us broadcast sites in thailand and the philippines would be excellent transmission points for rfa both countries have blocked usage right given them in bilateral accords their reasons have to do with an unwillingness to anger china and some asean association of southeast asian nation governments an underlying principle for radio free asia hiring is that it is to be lean organization full time employees initially were to number 109 but the staff totals in both the field and in washington have grown to 230 as result of increased broadcasts to china and the realization that the original staffing goals would not sustain more than token programming the president of rfa is richard richter formerly producer and executive producer of news programs at abc cbs and weta dan southerland previously beijing bureau chief for the washington post and hong kong bureau chief for the christian science monitor and vietnam correspondent for united press international is vice president of programming and executive editor because usia will be dissolved on october 1 1999 66 fulltime permanent positions will be transferred from usia to the bbg each language service has chief the mandarin service because of its size also has deputy total personnel for each service includes mandarin 33 tibetan 23 burmese 16 vietnamese 15 korean 14 khmer 11 uyghur 4 cantonese 9 and the laotian service 11 the wu broadcast takes place as part of the mandarin service rfas headquarters are located in washington dc it has expanded it bureau in hong kong and has additional smaller offices in tokyo phnom penh dharamsala india bangkok and seoul rfa reporters or stringers are also located throughout asia the united states and europe all are native speakers of one of rfas broadcast languages as are number of editorial consultants who are experts or commentators in specialized fields funding history the fy1995 commerce justice state appropriations pl 103317 provided 10 million in multiyear funds for startup of rfa 5 million of which was rescinded in fy1996 the fy1996 appropriations provided 5 million earmark from the international broadcasting account for fy1997 congress earmarked 93 million for rfa within the omnibus consolidated appropriations act of 1997 earlier in the fy1997 2 continued 105261 january 15 1999 3 other opinions were expressed from chinese listeners via four callin programs report to congress pursuant to section 309f pl 103236 p 8 crs5 appropriations debate members of the house appropriations committee had expressed concern that rfa had not been operating within clear plan the committee requested rfa to submit plan prior to receiving grants under the fy1997 appropriations officials of the broadcast entity sent plan to congress in midseptember 1996 which the committee approved for fy2000 the administration has requested total international broadcasting budget of 4526 million which includes 231 million for radio free asia the senate has agreed to 231 million in its appropriation bill s 1217 following is the radios funding history fy1995 50 million fy1996 50 million fy1997 93 million fy1998 241 million fy1999 220 million estimate fy2000 231 million request issues for congress rfa proved to be an important source of objective information to the chinese after the nato bombing of the chinese embassy in belgrade and the subsequent chinese demonstrations at the us embassy in beijing in may 1999 radio free asia currently broadcasts for total of 28 hours day the bbg plans to increase that figure to 34 hours by the end of fy1999 the issues facing the 106th congress are 1 authorization and appropriation of increased funding to support rfas chinese language expansion 2 continual finetuning of programming and technical transmission support and 3 development of reliable audience surveys the clinton administration endorses the idea of expanding rfas budget and capabilities both the administration and many in congress believe that expanding broadcasting into china is better way to promote democracy and human rights than denying china normal trade relation ntr trade benefits hr 2415 the american embassy security act of 1999 would provide permanent authorization for rfa it would also repeal funding limitations for the broadcast entity for fy2000 the senate foreign relations authorization legislation s 886 would reauthorize rfa through fy2005 and would raise the limit on annual expenditures to 28 million in each of fy2000 and fy2001 the increase in funding in fy1998 allowed rfa to expand its transmission from saipan also increases in fy1998 and fy1999 allowed rfa to expand its broadcast hours and add new languages the fy2000 budget request of just over 23 million may allow rfa to expand its transmission sites rfa officials believe that slight increase in funds in fy2000 would allow them to fully function as congress had intended in the international broadcasting act of 1994 increased radio construction funds amounting to 209 million requested for fy2000 compared to 132 million appropriated for fy1999 would benefit both rfa and voa activities crs6 some concerns regarding expanding the rfa budget exist lawmakers concerned with maintaining balanced budget view these increases as unnecessary expenditures that would tap into the surplus which is being eyed for social security or tax cuts furthermore because the proposed funding levels being debated in congress is three times the fy1997 funding level some fear that such dramatic increase in short time span to an organization that is so young could lead to an inefficient use of taxpayer dollars by rfa others have cited the fact that numerous similar information sources already are reaching china including cnn they say that increasing rfa threefold likely would not result in proportionate increase in democracy promotion in china moreover organizations that promote uschina trade assert that this action will cause further deterioration of uschina relations that could dampen the future growth of us exports in the aftermath of the may 7 1999 nato bombing of the chinese embassy in belgrade rfas coverage of the bombing and demonstrations was extensive in its mandarin cantonese tibetan and uyghur programs rfa reported apologies by the us and nato which the chinese media had failed to mention listeners who responded to the callin programs were critical of both the us and the chinese governments handling of the demonstrations throughout the kosovo crisis rfa reported on the suffering due to ethnic cleansing which the chinese media portrayed as product of nato bombing matter of ongoing interest in congress is overlap duplication and coordination of voa and rfa according to allen heil deputy director of voice of america rfa and voa are closely coordinating and monitoring their activities in asia on september 12 1998 voa dropped its mandarin broadcast during 04000500 gmt the only hour of the day that it had been overlapping with the rfa broadcast rfa agreed to broadcast during number of nonprime hours to avoid overlapping with voa voa and rfa now broadcast 12 hours each in mandarin for total of 24 hours per day jamming of us broadcasts into asia is concern of both administrators and members of congress china government jamming of us international broadcasting both voa and rfareportedly has been very effective especially in the cities according to voice of america and radio free asia officials they believe that increased funding will assist us broadcasters in circumventing the jamming problem broadcast officials admit however that chinas jamming activity may increase proportionately to the increase in us broadcasting activity there nevertheless listeners who have called in to the radio programs from every chinese province are evidence that rfa is reaching its audience for other versions of this document see
