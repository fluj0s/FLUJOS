doctrinal framework for special forces sf personnel involved in tracking and countertracking operations purpose tracking countertracking and dogtracker team operati ons are basic and fundamental to every sf operation whether offensive or defensive in nature this tc describes and illustrates how to track how to avoid being tracked and the theory behind the use of dogtracker teams appendixes and b provide sf soldiers with sample tracking logs for their use this tc does not describe specific electronictracking techniques such as transistortransistor logic cell phone triangulation or ot her sophisticated electronictracking tactics techniques and procedures ttp but it does introduce current doctrin that addresses those topics this tc provides the basis for common sf tactical application primarily in rural environment and it briefly discusses urban tracking using dog teams scope sf soldiers routinely employ unconventional tactics and techniques while conducti ng operations unilaterally and with indigenous assistance the conduct of sf di ffers from conventional operations in the degree of political risk operational techniques independence from friendly support nd dependence on detailed operational intelligence and indigenous assets the success of sf operations within these parameters depends greatly on the teams ability to read signs for defensiv purposes and its ability to use that same knowledge to minimize the signs it leaves when transitioning through hostile terrain applicability this publication applies to the active army the army national guard

introduction 11 this tc describes traditional tracking through rural terrain and to lesser extent discusses urban tracking understanding the ancient art and science of tracking lays firm foundation for variety of activities useful in sf operations soldier trained in tracking techniques can use deception maneuvers that minimize telltale signs and throw off or c onfuse poorly trained trackers who do not have the experience to spot the signs of deception 12 an understanding of the thought proce sses and the ttp used in traditi onal tracking are useful as an adjunct toand basis forunderstanding an array of modern technologicallybased tracking activities traditionally tracking has been defined as the art of being able to follow people or animals by the signs they leave when they move today it is possible to track the enemies of the united states through electronic means such as the equipment used with sensitive site exploitation sse techniques as well as tagging tracking and locating ttp not all enemies the united states encounters ever set foot on traditional battlefield so it is important to reme mber matter how they choose to negotiate or communicate from one location to another it is nearly impossible to do so without leaving signs behind 13 trained and experienced trackers can detect the signs left behind matter how small this is especially true in urban environments through forensic and biometric means including the electronic tracking of email and financial transactions both of which leave behind electronic signs called cookies or breadcrumbs soldiers can find additional information regarding other forms of technological tracking in current sse lessons learned and other sf doctrinal publications 14 successful tracker must z be patient and consistent z move slowly quietly and steadily while simu ltaneously detecting and interpreting signs z avoid fast movement that may cause him to overlook or lose signs or to walk into an enemy ambush z be persistent and be able to continue the missi on when signs are lost or scarce because of bad weather or terrain z be observant and be able to see things not obvious at first glance z use his sense of smell and hearing to augment his sight and intuition z develop his intuition and feel for things that do not look right this ability may help him regain lost trail or discover additional signs 15 as tracker follows trail he uses the abovemen tioned skills to build picture of the enemy in his mind while asking himself these questions z how many people am i following z are they male or female z are they adults or children z what is their state of training z how are they equipped z are they healthy z what is their state of morale z do they know they are being followed z are they familiar with the area chapter 1 12 tc 31344 30 september 2009 16 to answer these questions the tracker uses available indicators figur 11 such as signs that tell an action occurred at specific time and place by comp aring indicators the tracker obtains answers to his questions figure 11 area tracker surveys to find tracking indicators tracking signs 17 signs are visible marks left by individuals or animals as they pass through an area the tracker must know the following categories of signs z ground signs these are signs left below the knees all ground signs are further divided as follows large signs these are signs caused by the movement of 10 or more individuals through the area small signs these are signs caused by the movement of one to nine individuals through the area z high signs also known as top signs these are signs left above the knees they are also divided into large and small signs z temporary signs these signs will eventually fade with time for example footprint z permanent signs these signs require weeks to fade or will leave mark forever for example broken branches or chipped bark tracking indicators 18 one of six tracking indicators defines any signs the tracker discovers those indicators are displacement stains weat hering odor litter and immediateuse intelligence displacement 19 displacement occurs when anything is moved from its original position good example of displacement is welldefined footprin t in soft moist ground figure 12 page 13 the footgear or bare feet of the person who left the pr int displaced the soil by compression leaving an indentation in the ground the tracker can study this sign and determine several important facts for example print left by worn footgear or by bare feet may indicate lack of proper equipment 110 displacement can also results fro m clearing trail by breaking or cutting through heavy vegetation with machete these trails are obvious to the most inexperienced tracker individuals may unconsciously break more branches as they move behind someone who is cutting path tracking 30 september 2009 tc 31344 13 figure 12 footprint in soft moist ground conditions 111 persons carrying heavy loads who stop to rest can so make displacement indicators prints made by box edges can help to identify the load when loads are set down at rest halt or campsite they usually crush grass and twigs figure 13 reclining man can also flatten the vegetation figure 14 page 14 figure 13 print made by box edge indicating equipment rifle stock chapter 1 14 tc 31344 30 september 2009 figure 14 crushed vegetation with toe scuffs indicate person had taken prone posture feet to the upper right head to the lower left analyzing footprints 112 footprints can indicate the direction rate of movement number sex and whether the individual knows he is being tracked the footprint can be whole print but is usually only the heel dig and toe push footprint trackers can find footprints on the underside of large leaves that have not dried out and are lying on the ground 113 if footprints are deep and the pace is long rapid movement is apparent ex tremely long strides and deep prints with toe prints deeper than heel prints indicate running figure 15 prints that are deep with short narrowly paced stride and s how signs of shuffling indicate the pe rson who left the print is carrying heavy load figure 16 page 15 figure 15 footprints left by someone running tracking 30 september 2009 tc 31344 15 figure 16 footprints left by someone carrying heavy load 114 if the party members realize they are being followe d they may try to hide their tracks persons walking backward have short irregular stride fi gures 17 through 19 pages 15 and 16 the prints have an unnaturally deep toe and so il is displaced in the direction of movement these types of prints are characterized by toe digs and heel push as opposed to the normal footprint figure 17 footprints left by someone walking backward in dry sand chapter 1 16 tc 31344 30 september 2009 figure 18 footprints left by someone walking backward in wet sand figure 19 footprints left by someone walking backward over vegetation 115 to determine the sex of member of the party being followed the tracker should study the size and position of the footprints figure 110 page 17 women tend to be pigeontoed men walk with their feet straight ahead or pointed slightly to the outside prints left by women are usually smaller and the stride is usually shorter than that taken by men tracking 30 september 2009 tc 31344 17 figure 110 man versus woman determining key prints 116 normally the last man in the file leaves the clearest footprints these should be the key prints the tracker can use several techniques to create measuri ngtracking stick to aid him in locating these tracks one way is for the tracker to cut stick to match the length of the prints and notch it to show the length of the strides generally 36 inches and the length and widest part of the sole of the key prints the tracker then studies the angle of the key prints in relation to the direction of movement to identify key prints the tracker looks for an identifying mark or feature ch as worn or frayed footgear if the trail becomes vague erased or merges with another the tracker can use his stickmeasuring device and identify the key prints after close study another technique is for the tracker to use his weaponrifle as measuring device this allows him to engage threats more rapidly while tracking hostile forces this method helps the tracker stay on the trail by using the box method he can count up to 18 persons the tracker can also z use the stride as unit of measure when determining key prints figure 111 page 18 the tracker uses these prints and the edges of the road or trail to box in an area to analyze z use the 36inch box method if key prints are not evident figure 112 page 18 to use this method the tracker uses the edges of the road or trail as the sides of the box he measures cross section of the area 36 inches long coun ting each indentation in the box and dividing by two this method gives close estimate of the number of individuals who made the prints however it is not as accurate as the stride measurement recognizing other signs of displacement 117 foliage moss vines sticks or rocks that are scuffed or snapped from their original position form valuable indicators broken dirt seals around rocks mud or dirt moved to rocks or other natural debris and water moved onto the banks of stream are also good indicators figures 113 through 117 pages 19 through 111 vines may be dragged dew droplets displaced or stones and sticks overturned to show different color underneath grass or other vegetation may be bent or broken in the direction of movement 118 the tracker inspects all areas for b its of torn clothing threads or dirt from footgear which can fall and be left on thorns snags or on the ground flushe d from their natural habitat wild animals and birds are also examples of displacement cries of birds excited by unnatura l movement are an indicator moving tops of tall grass or brush on windless day indicate that something is moving the vegetation chapter 1 18 tc 31344 30 september 2009 119 changes in the normal life of insects and spid ers may indicate someone has recently passed valuable clues are disturbed bees ant holes covered by someone moving over them or torn spider webs spiders often spin webs across open areas trails or ro ads to trap flying insects if the tracked person does not avoid these webs he will leave an indicator behind 120 if the person being followed tries to use stream to cover his trail the tracker can still follow successfully when person loses his footing or walk s carelessly he can disp lace algae and other water plants he can also displace or overturn rocks from th eir original position to indi cate lighter or darker color on the opposite side the person entering or exiting stream creates slide marks or footprints or scuffs the bark on roots or sticks figures 118 through 122 pages 111 through 113 normally person or animal seeks the path of least resistance therefore wh searching the stream for an indication of departures trackers will find signs in open areas along the banks figure 111 using the stride as unit of measure figure 112 using the 36inch box method tracking 30 september 2009 tc

creek bank figure 116 crushed or disturbed vegetation high sign tracking 30 september 2009 tc 31344 111 figure 117 crushed or disturbed vegetation figure 118 disturbance at water crossing approximately 15 minutes after the fact chapter 1 112 tc 31344 30 september 2009 figure 119 staining and displacement in water figure 120 slip marks and waterfilled footprints on stream bank indicating movement out of the creek tracking 30 september 2009 tc 31344 113 figure 121 slip marks and waterfilled footprints on stream bank looking from the bank into the creek figure 122 slip marks and waterfilled footprints on stream bank looking from the creek onto the bank chapter 1 114 tc 31344 30 september 2009 stains 121 stain occurs when any substance from one organism or article is smeared or deposited on something else the best example of staining is blood from profusely bleeding wound bloodstains often appear as spatters or drops and are not always on the ground they also appear smeared on leaves or twigs of trees and bushes the tracker can determine the seriousness of the wound and how far the wounded person can move unassisted this process may lead th tracker to enemy bodies or indicate where they have been carried 122 by studying bloodstains the tracker can determine the wounds location as follows z if the blood seems to be dripping steadily it probably came from wound on the trunk z if the blood appears as if it was slung toward the front rear or sides the wound is probably in the extremity z arterial wounds appear to pour blood at regular intervals as if poured from pitcher if the wound is venous the blood pours steadily z lung wound deposits pink bubbly and frothy bloodstains z bloodstain from head wound appears heavy wet and slimy z abdominal wounds often mix blood with digestive juices so the deposit has an odor and is light in color 123 any body fluids such as urine blood or feces deposited on the ground trees bushes or rocks will leave stains fieldexpedient technique for determin ing blood trail is to spray hydrogen peroxide on the suspected stain if the hydrogen peroxide bubblesfoams rapidly it is an indicator of blood trackers can test this technique in specific environmental and weather conditions during rehearsals and proficiency training 124 on calm clear day the leaves from bushes and small trees turn so their dark top sides show however when man passes through an area and distur bs the leaves he will generally cause the lighter side of the leaf to show this movement is also true with some varieties of grass moving causes an unnatural discoloration of the area which is called shine figure 123 grass or leaves that have been stepped on will have bruise on their lighter sides figure 123 example of shine tracking 30 september 2009 tc 31344 115 125 staining can also occur when person drags muddy footgear over grass stones and shrubs thus staining and displacement combine to form movement and direction crushed leaves may stain rocky ground that is too hard to show footprints roots stone s and vines may be stained where leaves or berries are crushed by moving feet figures 124 through 126 pages 115 and 116 figure 124 staining on shoulder of dirt roadway right to left figure 125 staining on roadway left to right chapter 1 116 tc 31344 30 september 2009 figure 126 staining caused by differing soil types 126 the tracker may have difficulty determining the difference between staini ng and displacement since both terms can be applied to some indicators for example muddied water may indicate recent movement displaced mud also stains the wate r muddy footgear can stain stones in streams and algae can be displaced from stones in streams nd can stain other stones or the ba nk figure 127 page 117 muddy water collects in new footprints in swampy ground however the mud settles and the water clears with time the tracker can use this information to indicate time normally the mud clears in about one hour although time varies with the terrain since muddied water travels with the current it is usually best to move downstream weathering 127 weathering either aids or hinders the tracker it so affects indicators in cer tain ways so that the tracker can determine their relative ages however wind snow rain or sunlight can erase indicators entirely and hinder the tracker the tracker should know how weathering affects soil vegetation and other indicators in his area he cannot pr operly determine the age of indicat ors until he understands the effects weathering has on trail signs 128 for example when bloodstains are fresh they are bright red air and sunlight first change blood to deep rubyred color then to dark brown crust wh the moisture evaporates scuff marks on trees or bushes darken with time sap oozes on trees and th hardens when it makes contact with the air 129 weather greatly affects footprints figures 128 through 130 pages 118 and 119 thus by carefully studying the weathering process the tr acker can estimate the ag of the footprints 130 if particles of soil are just beginning to fall into the print it is very recent at this point the tracker should focus on becoming stalker if the edges of the print are dried and crusty the prints are probably about an hour old this process varies with terrain and is only guide 131 light rain may round the edges of the prints by remembering when the last rain occurred the tracker can place the prints into time frames heavy rains may erase all signs tracking 30 september 2009 tc 31344 117 figure 127 staining at creek center rock is wet while the remainder of the rocks are dry 132 trails exiting streams may appear weathered by rain due to water running from clothing or equipment running over the tracks this trait is especially true if the party exits the stream single file then each person deposits water into the track s the existence of wet weathe red trail slowly fading into dry trail indicates the trail is fresh 133 wind dries out tracks and blows litter sticks or l eaves into prints by recalling wind activity the tracker can estimate the age of the tracks for example the tracker may reason the wind is calm at present but blew hard about an hour ago these tracks have litter blown into them so they must be over an hour old however he must be sure the litter was blown into the prints and was not crushed when they were made or thrown on the track in an effort to conceal them 134 wind affects sound and odors if the wind is blowing down the trail toward the tracker sounds and odors may be carried to him conversely if the wind is blowing up the trail away from the tracker he must be extremely cautious since wind also carries sound toward the enemy the tracker can determine wind direction by dropping handful of dust or dried grass fro m shoulder height by pointing in the same direction the wind is blowing the tracker can localize sounds by cupping his hands behind his ears and turning slowly when the sounds are the loudest the tracker is facing the origin 135 in calm weather wind air currents that may be too light to detect can carry sounds to the tracker air cools in the evening and moves downhill to ward the valleys if the tracker is moving uphill late in the day or night air currents will probably be moving toward him if other wind is blowin g as the morning sun warms the air in the valleys it moves uphill the tracker considers these factors when plotting patrol routes or other ope rations if he keeps the wind in his face sounds and odors will be carried to him from his objective or from the party being tracked 136 the tracker should also consider the sun it is difficult to fire directly into the sun but if the tracker has the sun at his back and the wind in his face he has slight advantage chapter 1 118 tc 31344 30 september 2009 figure 128 weathered footprint figure 129 fresh footprint tracking 30 september 2009 tc 31344 119 figure 130 effects of weather on the clarity of footprints odors 137 the tracker should consider dietary habits such as z red meats z tobacco z alcohol z certain spices for example those used in korea 138 with the convenience of an army and air force exchange service facility while deployed many soldiers purchase and use fragrant soaps and body wa shes soaps and body washes cause strong peculiar odors that are excreted through the sw eat glands these scents will be pa rticularly evident to dog teams but can be strong enough for person to detect litter 139 litter consists of anything not i ndigenous to the area that is left on the ground poorly trained or poorly disciplined unit moving over terrain is apt to l eave trail of litter unmi stakable signs of recent movement include gum or candy wrappers ration cans or wrappers cigarette butts and the remains of fires urine and bloody bandages ra in flattens or washes litter away and turns paper into pulp exposure chapter 1 120 tc 31344 30 september 2009 to weather can cause ration cans to rust at the opene d edge then the rust moves toward the center the tracker must consider weather conditions when estimating the age of litter he can use the last rain or strong wind as the basis for determining time frame 140 the tracker should also know what wildlife is in the area even sumps regardless of how well camouflaged are potential source of litter the best policy to follow is for the soldier to take everything he brings with him immediate use intelligence 141 the tracker combines all the indicator s and interprets what he has seen to form composite picture for onthespot intelligence for example indicators may show contact is imminent and require extreme stealth 142 the tracker avoids reporting his interpretations as facts he reports what he has seen rather than stating that these things exist ther are many ways tracker can interpre t the sex and size of the party the load and the type of equipment time frames can be determined by weathering effects on indicators 143 immediateuse intelligence is informa tion about the enemy that can be us ed to gain surprise to keep him off balance or to keep him from escaping the area entirely the commander may have many sources of intelligence such as reports documents or prisoners of war these sources can be combined to form indicators of the enemys last location future plans and destination 144 tracking gives the commander definite information on which to act immediately for example unit may report there are men of military age in village this knowledge is valuable only if combined with other information to create composite enemy picture in the area therefore tr acker who interprets trail signs and reports he is 30 minutes behind known enemy unit moving north and located at specific location gives the commander information on which he can act 30 september 2009 tc 31344 21 chapter 2 countertracking introduction 21 there are two types of human tr ackerscombat trackers and profe ssional trackers combat trackers look ahead for signs and do not n ecessarily look for each individual sign commanders use them for situations when speed is vital and the threat level is high professional trackers go from sign to sign if they cannot find signs they will stop and search till they find one 22 if an enemy tracker finds the track s of two men he may determine that highlytrained specialty team is operating in his area however knowledge of countertracking enables the team to survive by remaining undetected 23 to confuse the combat tracker and throw him off tr ack the team always starts its movement away from its objective the team uses the same maneuve r when evading dogs chapt er 3 provides additional information on dogs the team should travel in strai ght line for about an hour and then change direction changing course will cause the tracker to cast in different directions to find the track 24 use of weather and times of day to defeat dogtracker team is also important weather tends to disintegrate tracks wind blows scents away removing gases and particles that identify the track to the dog wind also aerates dries out and reduces bacterial activity although low to moderate wind condition is an asset for airscent search the less wind the better is the rule for tracking 25 high humidity favors tracking humid conditions combined with high temperatures encourage discrimination in the tracking dog for significant time after the track is laid light rain refreshes track scent however pouring rain or heavy snow disintegrates track the sun can literally burn out track direct sunlight kills bacteria and generates locally high temperatures that dry out and destroy scent producing reactions the best tracking conditions usually are found in the ear ly morning or evening and at night at night however the handler is slower due to limited visibility on northfacing slopes northern hemisphere specific across low areas and in damp grasses camouflage 26 camouflage applies to tracking when the party bei ng followed uses techniques to confuse or slow tracker for example walking backward to leave confusing prints brushing out trails and moving over rocky ground or through streams camouflaged movement indicates trained adversary figures 21 through 28 pages 22 through 25 27 the team being followed may use two types of routes to cover its movement the team must also remember that travel time increases when trying to camouflage the signs left during movement two types of routes include z mostused routes movement on lightly traveled sandy or soft trails is easily tracked however person may try to confuse the tracker by movi ng on hardsurfaced oftentraveled roads or by merging with civilians the tracker should caref ully examine these routes if welldefined approach leads to the enemy it will probably be mined ambushed or covered by some form of security force z leastused routes these routes avoid all manmade trails or roads and are less confusing for the tracker they are normally magne tic azimuths between two points chapter 2 22 tc 31344 30 september 2009 evasion 28 evasion of the tracker or pursu ing element is difficult task re quiring the use of immediateaction drills designed to counter the threat team skilled in tracking techniques can successfully use deception drills to minimize signs left behind which the enemy can use against them however it is very difficult for person let alone group to move across any area w ithout leaving signs noticeab to the trained eye figure 21 countertracking foot

reduced sp eed therefore enabling th experienced tracker to gain time team should use the following methods to reduce trail signs z wrap footgear with rags or wear softsoled sneakers that make footprints rounded and less distinctive z change into footgear with different tread immediately follo wing deceptive maneuver which creates gap or void in the noticeable track z walk lightly on hard or rocky ground to reduce the possibility of displ acing rocks or leaving scuffs for the tracker to follow deception techniques 210 evading skilled and persistent enemy tracker requires the use of skillfully executed maneuvers to deceive the tracker and cause him to lose the trail an emy tracker cannot be out run by team carrying equipment because the tracker travels light and is escorted by emy forces designed for pursuit the size of the pursuing force dictates the teams chances of success in using ambushtype maneuvers teams can use some of the following techniques in immediateaction and deception drills backward walking 211 one of the most basic deception techniques is walki ng backward figure 29 in tracks already made and then stepping off the trail onto terrain or objects that leave little to signs skillful use of this maneuver causes the tracker to look in the wrong direction once he has lost the trail this maneuver must be used in conjunction with anot her deception technique such as t hose described in paragraph 29 however the maneuver will probably fail if professional tracker is following the teams trail figure 29 backwardwalking deception technique big tree 212 good deception tactic is to change directions at large trees fi gure 210 page 27 to change directions the team moves in any given direction and walks past large tree 12 inches wide or larger countertracking 30 september 2009 tc 31344 27 from 5 to 10 paces then carefully wa lks backward to the forward side of the tree and makes 90degree change in their direction of travel passing the tree on its forward side this technique uses the tree as screen to hide the new trail from the pursuing tracker variation used near clear area would be for the team to pass by the side of the tree that it uses to change direction on its next leg they walk past the tree into clear area for 75 to 100 meters and then walk backward to the tree the team then moves 90 degrees and passes on the side away from the tracker this method could cause the tracker to follow the teams sign into the open area where after losing the track he might cast in the wrong direction for the track generally this technique only works on combat trackers not professional trackers figure 210 big tree deception technique note by studying signs an observant tracker can determine if an attempt is being made to confuse him if the team tries to lose the tracker by walking backward footprints will be deepened at the toe and soil will be scuffed or dragged in the direction of movement by following carefully the tracker can normally find turnaround point cut the corner 213 the team uses this deception method when appro aching known road or trail about 100 meters from the road the team changes its direction of move ment either 45 degrees left or right once the team reaches the road they leave visi ble trail in the direction of the deception for short distance down the road the tracker should believe the team cut the corner to save time the team backtracks on the trail to the point where it entered the road and then carefully moves down the road without leaving good trail once the team achieves the desired distance they change direction and continue movement figure 211 page 28 combining the big tree method with this method improves the effectiv eness of this deception slip the stream 214 the team uses this deception method when approach ing known stream it executes this method just like the cutthecorner maneuver the team establishes 45degree deception maneuver upstream and then enters the stream the team moves upstream and establishes false trails if time permits by moving upstream floating debris and silt will flow downstream covering the true direction and exit point the team chapter 2 28 tc 31344 30 september 2009 then moves downstream to escape since creeks and streams gain tributaries that offer more escape alternatives figure 212 page 29 to cause further confusion the team uses false exit points however the team must be careful not to cause false ex it to give away its intended travel direction figure 211 cutthecorner deception technique arctic circle 215 the team should use this deception in snowcovered terrain to escape pursuers or to hide patrol base it establishes trail in circle as large as possible figure 213 page 29 the trail that starts on road and returns to the same start point is effective at some point along the circular trail the team should remove snowshoes if used and carefully step off the tr ail leaving one set of tr acks the team can use the big tree maneuver to screen the trail from its hiding position the team returns over its steps and carefully fills them with snow one at time this technique is especially effective if it is snowing fishhook 216 the team uses this technique to double back on its own trail in an overwatch position figure 214 page 210 it can observe the back trail for trackers and prepare to ambush pursuers if the pursuing force is too large to be destroyed the team should strive to eliminate the tracker it uses hitandrun tactics and then moves to another ambush position the terrain must be used to the teams advantage 217 dog and visual trackers are not infallible they can be confused with simple techniques and clear thinking the team should not panic and try to outrun dog or visual tracker it only makes it easier for the tracking team the successful tracker keeps his head and always plans tw steps ahead even if trackers are not in the area it is always best to use countertracking techniques countertracking 30

term subject is used to refer to the entity being tracked 31 when mentioning urban tracking dogtracker teams are the traditional tool that comes to mind however with modern electronic devices dog is only one tool capable of tracking persons whereabouts traditional tracking techni ques used in rural environments can also be used in urban terrain if the tracker is proficient enough to read the signs 32 the three types of tracker dogs are as follows z visual dogs rely upon their acute vision they usually are the final part of tracking before shifting over to the attack mode z search dogs run free and search using airborne scents z tracker dogs run on leashes and use ground scents 33 many myths surround the abilities and limitations of canine trackers the firs t and perhaps greatest myth is that tracking involves only the dogs sense of smell canine tracking involves teama merging of man and dog dogs use their eyes noses and ears trackers use their eyes and knowledge of the quarry together they create an effective team that maximizes their strengths and minimizes their weaknesses another common myth is that dog teams cannot track at ght this is false as the probability of detection is much greater at night handler safety in difficult terrain is the only reason to hold back search dog teams at night on high priority search besides night the next best times to track using search dog teams is early morning late afternoon and evening 34 midday convection currents in summer decrease dogs effectiveness the subject is not only trying to evade and outwit just dog but also the dogs handler the most common breeds of dog used for tracking are the shepherd german and dutch and the belgian malinois these dogs are trained to respond independently to variety of situati ons and threats good tracking dogs are rare and difficult to replace asset 35 if the dog losses the trail visual tracker assists the dog handlers in finding track he can radio ahead to another tracker and give him an oral account of the track picture visual tracker is slower than dogs because he must always use his powers of obser vation which creates fatigue his effectiveness is limited at night 36 tracker dogs smell microbes in the earth that are released from disturbed soil the trail has innate scent of specific quarry although trails do vary depending on the size and number of the quarry for example scent is like the wake sh ip leaves in the ocean but part of the ship is left in the wake the white foamy disturbed water is the trail the result is entirely different from point smell of the quarry such as sweat urine or cigarette smoke the same training that makes tracking dogs adept at tracking scent trail applies to finding point smell 37 smelling is highly complex process and many variables affect it the most important element in tracking is the actual ground such as earth and grass the ground contains living microbes that are always disturbed by the quarrys passage artificial surfaces concrete and macadam and mainly inorganic surfaces stone provide little or livi ng microbes to form scent track chapter 3 32 tc 31344 30 september 2009 38 the following are some things to consider when working with or against dogtracker teams z human bodies alive or dead constantly sh ed cells and give off gases and vapors z the cells humans shed are lighter than air 014 microns or smaller and stay suspended in the air z cells and odors act like smoke z when the sun is overhead on calm day smoke and scent rise up from convective currents this is the toughest time for dogs to follow track the wind shears the convective column and causes the particles to follow along the ground allowing dogs to overcome the problem z days with low or midlevel clouds reduce conv ection enhancing the dogs ability to detect the scent trail z when shadows are longer the sun is not overheadsuch as during the morning evening and in the winterconditions are better for dogs z the best conditions for dogs are usually at night due to the absence of convection z the warmth of live bodies will cause some c onvective lift on cold d ead calm nights this causes problem on flat terrain on hills there is usually downslope laminar flow of air to overcome the problem 39 cells or rafts commonly categorized as smells are carried in what are known as scent plumes scent plumes like smoke fall into several patterns pending on the weather these patterns are called fumigating lofting fanning plumes coning plumes and looping plumes 310 fumigating occurs when combination of stable air oft and unstable air at the surface meet as the morning sun hits the surface it rapidly warms the cooler scent plume will then diffuse down through the warmer air and bring scents down into valleys and low spots dog below can easily detect subject on hillside dogs should be in the field before dawn 311 lofting is the reverse of fumigating lofting results wh stable air is at the surface with unstable air aloft lofting occurs after the dusk and the ground is c ooling but the air aloft is still warm this is typical of valleys in the late afternoon and elsewhere in the early evening on calm evenings where this situation occurs handlers should work their dogs along ridges and higher slopes 312 fanning plumes occur at night in stable air if the point source is on the flat the scent will hold at the same elevation level if the point source is on hill the scent could be overhead dog may alert on subject across canyon at the same elevation but has way to follow them handlers should note and report alerts series of nighttime alerts at the sa elevation is an important clue and should initiate checks elsewhere in the ar ea at that elevation 313 coning plumes are typical on cloudcovered days the presence of clouds creates the best tracking environment for airscenting dogs 314 looping plumes are typical of clear or high cloudy days and midday highconvection situations scent will rise up cool loop back down heat up again and rise back up in cycle the dog will alert put its head up and then lose the scent an experienced handler will mark the map and possibly can get direction from line of these alerts sometimes severa l dogs in the field will establish the line over half mile or so in this way ultimately pointing to the origin of the scent 315 search or scentdiscrimination dog builds scent picture of the person that it is tracking scent may be shortlived and its lifespan is dependent upon the weather and the area that the person last passed through the sun and the wind as well as time destroy the scent there are both airborne and ground scents airborne scents can be blown away within minutes or few hours ground scents can last longer than 48 hours under ideal conditions bloodhounds have been known to successf ully track scent that was left behind 7 days before 316 wind and moisture are other variables that affect tracking foggy and drizzly weather that keeps the ground moist is best too much rain can wash trail away depending on the strength of the trail it takes persistent hard rain to erase scent trail usually the scent is not washed away but only sealed beneath layer of ground water short violent rainfall could deposit enough water to seal the scent track but after dogtracker teams 30 september 2009 tc 31344 33 the rain stops and the water layer evaporates the micr obe trail would again be detectable by dogs hard dry ground releases the fewest microbes and is the most difficult terrain for dogs to track on 317 dog may also have difficulty following trail on beach or dusty path but his human tracker could easily follow the footprints visually soldiers must always remember man and dog are tracking them tracker dogs track on the trail of the subject whereas search dogs track downwind of the trail 318 wind strength and direction are important factors in tracking strong wind inhibits tracking scent trail but makes it easier for dog to find point scent sourcelike hide general rule is that dog can smell mansized source downwind out to 50 meters and groupsized sourcea hideout to 200 meters under ideal conditions upwind source 1 meter away could be missed figure 31 figure 31 wind strength and direction 319 strong wind disperses microbes that arise from th ground hindering dogs ability to follow trail however strong wind increases the size of point scent helping dog to find the target in an area search 320 an inflexible rule for the life of scent trail cannot be provided in germany trackers rate their chances of following trails more than three days old as negligible terrain weather and the sensitivity of the dog are some of the many variables that affect th scent trail point smell will last as long as the target emits odors 321 although dogs are mainly scent hunters they also have good shortrange vision dogs are colorblind and do not have good distance vision camouflage works extremely well against dogs however they can detect slight movements dogs also have phenom enal sense of hearing extending far beyond human norms in both the frequency range and in sensitivity dogs use smell to approximate target and then rely on sound and movement to pinpoint that target 322 dogs have tremendous detection abilities however they also have limitations following scent trail is the most difficult task dog can perform the level of effort is so intense that most dogs cannot work longer than 20 to 30 minutes at time followed by 10 to 20minute rest dogs can perform this cycle more than 5 or 6 times in 24hour period befo re reaching complete exhaus tion the efficiency of the search also decreases as the dog tires in wartime the situation forces the maximum from men and equipment but times should remain constant for dogs because they alwa ys give 100 percent if the subject keeps moving and stays out of the detection range of the dog and handler the subject could outlast scent trackers 323 when looking for subjects trackers mainly use wood line sweeps and area searches wood line sweep consists of walking the dog upwind of suspected wood line or brush line the key is upwind if the wind is blowing through the woods and out of the wood line trackers move 50 to 100 meters inside chapter 3 34 tc 31344 30 september 2009 wooded area to sweep the woods edge since wood line sweeps tend to be less specific trackers perform them faster trackers perform an area search when subjects location is specific such as small wooded area or block of houses if possible the search area is cordoned off and the dogtracker teams are brought online about 25 to 150 meters apart depending on terrain and visibility the handlers then advance each moving their dogs through specific corridor the handler controls the dog entirely with voice commands and gestures he remains undercover directing the dog in search pattern or to likely target area the search line moves forward with each dog dash ing back and forth in assigned sectors 324 tracker should take every opportunity to practice applying countertracking techniques in all types of terrain and weather conditions when planning training opportunities the tracker should consider the following z wind moderate breeze of 13 to 18 miles per hour mph is needed to overcome high convection if dust and small branches are moving the wind is 13 mph or more z eddies they can form at bends in canyons and at the mouth of tributaries bringing scents from different directions eddies can also form at the edges of meadows behind hedgerows and at any break in vegetation the dogtracker team should check ll edges because the breeze may not have carried the scent away z large roll eddies they can form on the lee of ridges and canyon rims and can cause upslope winds that blow opposite of prevailing winds z ridge top saddles and mountain passes these increase wind flow and are good places to pick up air scents z forest openings openings in forest will heat up and bring in drafts from all directions the dogtracker team should check the middle of the opening to take advantage of this z single trees and telephone poles in field single tree or telephone pole can act like chimney and create vortex that attracts rafts of scent this vortex can provide an opportunity similar to the forest opening described above z breeze 20mph fresh breeze will usually be slowed down to 4 mph or less in dense forest in contrast 4mph breeze will generally onl be slowed to approximately 25 mph z updrafts when the sun is shining on the slopes of hill there will normally be updraft airflow major canyons will normally have an upstream breeze during the day this will cause the updrafts on the slopes to move diagonally upslope and upstream updrafts increase in velocity as they rise which causes ridges to receive scents from the entire slope z downdrafts when the side slopes go into shadow downdraft begins during these conditions it is best to search from the bottom up downdrafts flow down like water and act like dam around debris pile hollows low shady spots nd brush for scent pooling good place to check in the shade and at night is the mouths of side drainages from the terrain creating the downdraft z thunderstorms thunderstorms create downdrafts that push air out in all directions from directly under the cell at the mature stage dog can alert from great distance so the soldier should note the location of the thunderhead and the wind direction when the dog alerts the thunderhead will have strong convective updraft and will suck air toward it before reaching the mature stage when it starts to rain it is important to pay attention to what is happening and note the time and conditions when the dog alerts since the wind may change directions and speed rapidly z smoke candles these are good tool for the tracker to use during practice sessions they help him visualize the effects of air flow techniques to defeat dogtracker teams 325 although dogtracker teams are potent threat there are counteractions available to the subject as always the best defenses are basic infantry t echniques good camouflage and light noise and trash discipline dogs find subject either by detecting tr ail or by point source such as human waste odors at the hide site 326 it is critical to try to obscure or limit trails around the hide especially along the wood line or area closest to the target area surveillance targets are usually major ax of advance trawling the wood lines dogtracker teams 30 september 2009 tc 31344 35 along likelylooking roads or intersections is favorite tactic of dogtracker teams when moving into target area the subject should take the following countermeasures z remain as far away from the targ et area as the situation allows z never establish position at the edge of cove r and concealment nearest the target area z minimize the track try to approach the position area on hard dry ground or along stream or river z urinate in hole and cover it up never urinat more than once in exactly the same spot z deeply bury fecal matter if the duration of the mission permits the subject can use meals ready to eat bags sealed with tape and take them w ith him when leaving if using this technique he ensures the bags are sealed air tight to avoid odors escaping z never smoke z carry all trash until it can be buried elsewhere 327 dogs tracking subject use odors left behind or around the subject to locate him sweat from exertion or fear is one of these wet clothing or material from damp environments holds in the scent soap or deodorant used before infiltration helps the dogs to find the subject foreign odors such as oils preservatives polish and petroleum products aid the dogs if time permits the subject should try to change his diet to that of the local inhabitants before infiltration 328 when the subject first arrives in the operational area it is best for him to move initially in direction that is 90 to 170 degrees away from his objective objects or items of clothing not belonging to the subject should be carried into the operational area in plastic bag when the subject first starts moving he should drop an item of clothing or piece of cl oth out of the bag and leave it on b ack trail this step can confuse dog long enough to give the subject more of head start if dogs are brought in later the subjects scent will be very faint whereas the scent from the dropped item will still be strong 329 while traveling the subject should try to avoid heavily foliaged areas as these areas hold the scent longer when the situation permits the subject should periodically move across an open area that the sun shines on during the day and has the potential of being windswept the wind moves the scent and will eventually blow it away the sun destroys scent very rapidly 330 when the situation permits the subject should make changes in direction at the open points of terrain to force the dog to cast for scent if dogs are very close behind moving through water does not confuse them as scent will be hanging in the air above the water moving through water will only slow the subject down throwing cs gas to the rear or using blood sp ice mixtures or other concoctions will prevent most dogs from smelling the subjects scent but it is not effective on trained tracker dog 331 although water will not confuse dog if he is close running water such as rapidly moving stream will confuse dog if he is several hours behind howe ver areas with foliage stagnant air and little sunlight will hold the scent longer therefore the subject should try to avoid any swampy areas 332 to avoid confusing the scent picture of the dog the dogtracker team should not move through areas frequently traveled by other people on the other nd when more than one subject is being tracked the subjects should split up from time to time to confuse th dogs by dissipating the scent the best place to split up is in areas frequently tr aveled by indi genous personnel 333 if dogtracker team is on the subjects trail th subject should not run because their scent will become stronger the subject may attempt to wear out the dog handler and confuse the dog but should always be on the lookout for good ambush site to fishhook into if it becomes necessary to ambush the tracking party the subject should fishhook into the am bush site and kill or wound the handler not the dog tracker dog is trained with his handler and will pr otect him should the handler become wounded this practice allows the subject to move off and away from the area while the rest of the tracking party tries to give assistance to the handler 334 if dogtracker team moves into the area the subject should first check wind direction and strength if the subject is downwind of the estimated search ar ea the chances are minimal that the subjects point smells will be detected if upwind of the search ar ea the subject should attempt to move downwind terrain and visibility dictat whether the subject can move without be ing detected visually by the handlers chapter 3 36 tc 31344 30 september 2009 sweeps are not always conducted just outside of wood line wind direction determines whether the sweep will be parallel to the outside or 50 to 100 meters inside the wood line 335 the subject has options if caught inside the search area of line search handlers rely on radio communications and often do not have visual contact with each other if the s ubject has been localized through enemy radio detecti onfinding equipment the search net w ill still be loose during the initial sweep single subject has small chance of hiding and escaping detection in deep brush or in woodpiles larger groups will almost certainly be found yet the subject may have the chance to elim inate the handler and to escape the search net 336 if the handler feels threatened he will hide behi nd cover with the dog he searches for movement and then sends the dog out in straight line toward the front usually when the dog has moved about 50 to 75 meters the handler calls the dog back the handler then moves slowly forward and always from covered position to covered position commands are by voice and gesture with backup whistle to signal the dog to return if handler is killed or badly inju red after releasing the dog but before recalling it the dog continues to randomly search out and away fro m the handler the dog usually returns to another handler or to his former handlers last position with in several minutes this time lapse creates gap from 25 to 150 meters wide in search pattern response times by the other searchers tend to be fast given the high degree of radio chatter the injured handler will probably be quickly missed from the radio net killing the dog before the handler will probably delay discovery only by moments dogs are so reliable that if the dog does not return immediately the handler knows something is wrong 337 if the subject does not have firearms he must realize human versus dog combat is hazardous if knife or large club is available it is possible for subject to deal with one dog with relative ease the subject must keep low and use his wrist to strike upward never overhanded dogs are quick and will try to strike the groin or legs most attack dogs are trained to go for the groin or throat tracking dogs are more likely to attack the arms legs or groin regardless the type of dog before attempting to defeat the dog by stabbing it the subject should wrap his arms and legs with as much clothing as possible to reduce the bite effects of the dog if alone and faced with two or more dogs the subject should flee the situation 338 small lightlyarmed dogtracker t eams are potent threat to subj ect because dogs greatly increase the area that rear area security it can search due to the dogtracker teams effectiveness and its lack of firepower subject may be tempted to destroy such an easy target whether s ubject should fight or run depends on the situation 339 eliminating or injuring the dogtracker team only conf irms to security forces that there is hostile subject operating in the area the techniques for attacking dogtracker team should be used only in extreme situations or as last measure the preferred method of defeating dog team is to exhaust the handler thus rendering the dog team useless while not providing solid evidence of the subjects presence in the area 30 september 2009 tc 31344 a1 appendix tracking log soldiers should keep log to
