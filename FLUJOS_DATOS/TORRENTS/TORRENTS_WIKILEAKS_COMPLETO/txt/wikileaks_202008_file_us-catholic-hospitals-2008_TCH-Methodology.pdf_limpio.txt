hospital data the tchxls file was created by research group including biostatistician and medical ethicist as means to facilitate open access to public records containing data from catholic hospitals in the state of texas it is not an advocacy position about what needs to be done but hopefully simply serves to increase transparency and accountability about procedures performed in catho lic hospitals only catholic hospital inpatient data was extracted from the texas public use data file for inclusion in the analysis the c atholic hospitals were identified from the 2006 state list of acute care hospitals in texas the hospitals listed in the official cat holic directory and the websites of the identified health care systems and respective religious orders responsible for their opera tion only one acute care catholic hospital located in brenham is not included since it is not required to report because of its ru ral location for the identified catholic hospitals inpatient data was obtained for the years 2000 through 2003 the state records are coded according to the international classification of diseases guidelines icd9cm published by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc database of the codes obtained from the cdcs national center for health statistics is included in the provided files the researchers responsible for tchxls searched for all records which had codes indicating sterilizations contracep tive procedures legally induced abortions and termination of pregnancy complete listing of all codes used in searching the r ecords is also included in the data file only those fields from the texas public use data file relevant to the research are included in the extracted file each patient record in the extracted file includes the year and quarter of the discharge the hospital id the name of the hospital the s ex of the patient the admitting icd 9cm diagnostic code eight additional fields for diagnostic codes the principle surgical procedure icd9 cm code five additional fields for surgical and obstetrical procedures and the unique patient record id fields in the rec ords regarding charges physician identification and other non relevant information were excluded from the compilation it should b noted that the hospital identification codes are unique identifiers assigned to the hospitals by the state these numbers sometimes change although the hospital remains the same brief note on the selected codes for the search may be helpful the v252 diagnostic code specifically indicates that sterilization for contraceptive purposes is to be done through interruption of the fallopian tubes or the vas deferens ther are distinct diagnostic codes for illegal legal or unspecified induced abortions only legally induced abortions have been sidered also there are procedures such as dilation and curettage dc which can be used either following delivery or abortion or for termination of pregnancy and are given separate codes to distinguish these very different purposes only the codes specifica lly for termination of pregnancy were used for the search the user is advised to view all the diagnostic and procedural codes ina patient record to gain clearer understanding of particular cases complete list of the codes and their descriptions are included in tchxls the data for each hospital is summarized on the hospitals tab totals for each code are given while some records may conta in duplicate codes the totals only count the record once all the records included in each total number may be seen by double clicking on the total complete list of the codes and their descriptions follows the codes are color coded blue indicates contraceptive measures yellow highlights codes related to sterilization and red is for those related to abortions
