0012 of 002 classified by gene cretz ambassador us embassy tripoli department of state reason 14 b d 1 u this is an action request see 8 2 s summary in february 9 meeting with the ambassador the head of libyas scud b destruction program general ahmed azwai insisted that the usg was mostly responsible for libyas delayed fulfillment of scud b destruction commitments azwai blamed the usg for hampering libyan efforts to find missile technology control regime mtcrcompliant alternative weapons system to replace its scud b stock and refused to discuss destruction timeline until libya acquires replacement system the libyans passionately believe that the us committed to assisting in the search for an alternative weapons system and they want the us to fulfill that commitment azwai indicated that libya still wants to purchase the russian iskander missile that libya originally proposed ideally at the originally stipulated purchase price but said that it is up to the us to decide whether that is acceptable if not then he believes the us should find an acceptable alternative azwai made mention of the french scalp missile or any other proposed alternatives during the meeting suggesting that the scalp proposal may have been an independent move by saif alislam alqadhafi azwai requested us support for libyas bid for mtcr membership end summary azwai the us commited to find an alternative system for libya 3 s general ahmed azwai head of libyas scud b destruction program met with the ambassador accompanied by polecon chief on february 9 to reiterate libyas expectations that the usg identify suitable alternative to the scud b system note the meeting was scheduled in response to september 2009 embassy request for status update on libyas mtcrrelated commitments end note azwai joined by tajuri alshiradi of the mfas international organizations office as well as libyas rocket committee reviewed the history of uslibya negotiations on the elimination of libyas scud bs and insisted that the 2004 trilateral agreement included promises by the us and uk to find replacement for the scud b system referencing an english language version of the agreement that azwai provided the ambassador explained that the wording did not commit the us or uk to find replacement system but noted that we had in fact suggested alternative missile systems in the past which libya refused 4 s azwai insisted that the language of the agreement obligates the us and uk to help libya find suitable replacement system azwai argued that instead of helping libya fulfill its commitments the us had thrown obstacles in libyas way first by initially rejecting libyas request to purchase iskander missiles from russia and then by delaying the sale by stalling the approval process azwai noted that libya had already signed contract with russia to purchase the iskander missiles when the us objected he asserted that the uk had assented to the sale the process dragged on for two years and we could not wait that longand now we still do not have an acceptable alternative he said according to azwai the two other systems the us suggested one from ukraine and another from russia were both unacceptable alternatives due to the technical and range specifications needed to guarantee libyas national security we must have replacement system he stated i will not allow 12000 libyan soldiers to remain unarmed and vulnerable if i give up their weapons before i have replacement they will turn on he argued that libya had already given up some of its rocket systems and codes and did not intend to give up any more until it could replace its current stock iskander still best alternative to libyan scud b 5 s while azwai told the ambassador that libya was actively looking for an alternative system he believes that the iskander system originally proposed by the libyan side is still the best alternative to libyas scud bs however according to the rockets committee the price of that system has increased by one hundred percent azwai expressed libyas continued desire to purchase the iskander missile at lower price than that which the russians were currently offering and he sought us approval for such purchase in the beginning he commented we were hoping for us system but you said there was none he continued that the only friend for libya is russia on tripoli 00000115 0022 of 002 weapons sales azwai did not mention the french scalp system that saif alislam alqadhafis staff raised with emboffs in november 2009 suggesting that the proposal may have been an independent move by saif azwai emphasized that he expected the us to suggest viable alternatives and for those suggestions to be offered either in writing or in the context of another meeting with him 6 s the ambassador asked whether libya had begun to develop timeline for the destruction of its scud b missiles and suggested that us technical team come to tripoli to discuss destruction plans per reftel guidance the ambassador offered that the usg could support libyas scud b destruction with technical and financial assistance initially azwai refused to discuss destruction plans until an alternative system has been identified but as the ambassador reiterated his points azwai asked that the rocket committee make note of the us offer he asked whether the us would fund destruction one hundred percent or partially snidely remarking that we libyans need to be careful about what the american offers really mean he underscored that libya will not think about destruction until you the us fulfill your commitment azwai said that he would not be willing to discuss destruction until after contract for replacement system was signed furthermore since the libyans perceive the delays in meeting libyas mtcr commitments as rooted in us inaction on the issue azwai demanded that libya receive an extension on its mtcrcommitment deadline libyas bid for mtcr membership 7 s azwai further complained that the united states had not supported libyas recent bids to become full mtcr member members of the rocket committee specified that they had requested support from several embassies in libya with the exception of the united states but had also requested support in paris at the most recent mtcr meetings azwai said that libya had fulfilled the stipulations the mtcr committee required for membership including adopting new legislation but still could not obtain full membership he inferred that the us was part of the reason libyas membership was blocked the ambassador highlighted that the usg could not act on request that was not directly raised with us and advised the rocket committee to send an official request for us support of libyas membership in order for it to be considered in washington azwai agreed to do so comment and action request 8 snf this meeting revealed what appears to be fundamental misunderstanding regarding the terms and obligations of the involved parties of the 2004 trilateral scud b disposition agreement azwai was adamant that the us was obliged to help libya identify scud b replacement system and made it clear that unless we do he has intention of moving forward on destruction it is unclear whether azwais position is based on concrete libyan legal interpretation of the 2004 agreement or purely political assessment that libya has gotten less than it was promised during the 20032004 negotiations regarding its wmd programs we have been hearing the latter with increasing frequency from the highest levels of the libyan government including libyan leader muammar alqadhafi it is clear that further discussions either at the expert or political level will be required in order to make progress on the replacement and destruction issues the departments guidance on next steps on these issues as well as libyas mtcr membership bid is requested cretz
