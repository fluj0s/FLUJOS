could be used to support foreign governments who playa significant role in assisting the u s in the global war on terrorism 1 these proposed authorities which would set new precedents generated some controversy on the hill on the nondefense side the request pr ovided 55 billion in additional aid for new york whose needs were considered by some members of congress to havebeen shortchanged in the first emergency supplemental the 55 billion includedin the request is intended to fulfill the presidents march 10 2002 pledge to the new mayor of new york michael bloomberg to provide new york city with total of 215 billion to help it recover from the terrorist attacks 2 the new york aid would be dedicated to additional disaster recovery activities rebuilding mass transit andutility

congressional debate on emergency supplemental allocations by amy belasco and larry nowels march 20 2002 p 9 and p 19policy priorities in the administrations request and the enacted verison funding proposed in the fy2002 supplemen tal could be grouped into several major categories for purposes of identifying and understanding significant policypriorities and how these priorities continue or depart from resource allocationsenacted last year in the fy2001 emergency terrorism response etr supplemental major policy priorities are defined the text box below and figure 1 and figure 2 and table 2 below for the policy priorities and the amounts requested for each policy area in the administrations request and compares them with the etr supplemental and with house senate and conference action similarities between fy2002 request and etr both emergency supplementals emphasized defense and recovery needs with physical security ofinfrastructure and aviation close behi nd although dod would receive substantial funding in both the emergency terrorism response etr supplemental of 2001andthe new supplemental dods share in the fy2002 request was almost 10 percentagepoints more than in the enacted level of the fy2001 supplemental congressdecreased the administrations request for dod in the fy2001 supplemental from 53 to 43 of the total partly in anticipation of second supplemental foradditional costs of the war 5 the purposes for the dod funding were also similar prosecuting the war enhancing security at military bases and investing more in surveillance nd reconnaissance also referred to as command control and communication programs both supplementals also targeted substa ntial resources for the recovery needs of new york city the second supplemental placed greater emphasis on aviationsecurity reflecting the cost of carrying out new security standards enacted after the attacks differences between fy2002 request and etr because much of the funding was provided in the wake of the attacks the second supplemental included less monies than in the first supplemental for victim relief and for investigation andlaw enforcement efforts to unravel terrori st networks the second supplemental also included somewhat more for foreign aid but would distribute it in much largerproportions for security assistance rather than for humanitarian relief activities as was the case in the etr supplemental th is reflected the administrations priority to aid frontline states including pakista n jordan and others who were cooperating with us efforts to combat terrorism see

congressional funding by policy priorities as of the completion of floor action both the house and the senate proposed significant changes to the policy priorities reflected in the administrations request as well as the total amount of funding see figure 1 and figure 2 below with total of 288 billion the house bill was about 350 million above theadministrations request and reflected si milar mix of policy priorities at 315 billion the senate bill was 3 billion higher than the administrations request and reflected significantly different policy choices see table 2 and table 3 see table a2 for specifics on items fundedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31406crs7 compared to the senate bill the h ouse placed greater emphasis on funding for defense 55 vs 45 of the total in the supplemental and 18 billion more thanrequested by the administration this higher level primarily reflected the beliefamong house appropriators that the cost of activating reservists would be higher than anticipated by the administration dissatisfied with the validity of theadministrations estimates of cost the house bill reduced the administrations request for aviation security which the senate funded fully both houses provided higher funding levels for security with much of the increase concentrated in enhancing security at department of energy facilities aswell as additional funding to secure nuclear materials in the former soviet union see table a2 both houses fully funded the administrations request for recovery funds for new york city although both houses provided similar shares forinternational security assistance th total was 150 million higher than the administrations request because of additional aid for israel and the palestinians see foreign operations section and table a2 both houses also reduced the administrations proposed funding for aid to dislocated workers see below the largest difference between the houses and with the administration was the proposed funding levels for homeland secur ity activities the senate provided 28 billion more than the administration nd 22 billion more than the house for bioterrorism preparedness and security activities that additional funding wouldrenovate research facility on animal pa thogens 278 million provide additional grants for communications and safety equipment and training for first responders and spend additional resources on security in various agencies see table a2 in the appendix for discussion of conference issues see below in the final conference version of the bill congress changed the mix of spending proposed by the administration see figure 1 and figure 2 below and table 2 for example congress increased security funding requested by the administration threefold from 625 milli on to 18 billion with additional funding for nuclear weapons and doe facilities as well as international safeguard activitiesthe coast guard and port security meas ures congress also provided additional funding for international security assistan ce and to preparedness activities such as first responder programs congress also provided less funding for victim relief bydropping 400 million in funding

issues were difficult to resolve in conference including the overall funding level in the bill and funding levels for individual agencies and programs overall funding level although the total for the senate bill was 26 billion above the house level the discrepancy in funding levels was actually closerto 44 billion when the houses 18 billion in crease for the department of defense was taken into account 46 although the administration stated that the additional funding in the house bill for dod for paying the cost of activating reservists and additional funding for spares and depot ma intenance was not necessary the house provided the funds on contingent emerge ncy basis meaning that the president could decide whether to spend the monies the other significant difference infunding between the house and the sena was the additional 3 billion for homeland security activities in the sena bill including more spending for bioterrorism preparedness activities and security enhancements see section on policy priorities above determining the overall difference in funding between the two bills was complicated by differences in scoring between omb and cbo although the house reported the

to veto th bill if section 2002 in the senate the all or none provision was incl uded that provision required that the president designate as emergency spending all nondefense funding that is classified as contingent emergency spending in the bill in order to spend any of those funds in other words the president would not have the prerogative of spending only someof the contingent emergency spending as would be the case in the house bill according to the 1985 balanced budget and emergency deficit control act as amended both the president and congress must agree that spending is emergencyfor those funds to be exempt from budgetary controls over total spending 49 the final year that those budgetary controls apply is fy2002 if section 2002 wasadopted however the president would l onger have the prerogative to select the spending that would be classed as emergency spending and hence not subject tobudget controls all nonemergency spending must be offset by cuts in otherprograms or offsets according to senator byrd similar provision was includedin the 2001 supplemental 50 see table 4 and discussion above regarding the outcome of this issue budget controls and

provisions that would give dod new authorities to dispense funds to nations who work with the us in the worldwide war on terrorism these general provisions generated concerns inappropriations hearings on foreign operations see below using dods illustrative allocations table 4 compares the administrations priorities in this second supplemental w ith its request in the etr and the fy2003 budget request the second emergency supplemental placed more emphasis oncontinuing to carry out the war in afghani stan and related areas and paying for the costs of mobilizing reservists with less emphasis on command control andcommunication and classified programs in its regular fy2003 budget proposal dod so asks congress for substantial flexibility by requesting 201 billion in the derf account that total includes 10 billion to fund continued operations for the war on terrorism 60 the administration includes details about the use of these funds and acknowledges that this figure isonly rough estimate reflecting the uncertainty about future plans to combatterrorism in afghanistan or elsewhere the remaining 101 billion are requested in the broad functional categories shown below the cost of

future costs 63 crs calculations based on ibid dods fy2002 supplemental request divides total of 103889 million requested for deployment costs see p 7 64 cbo letter to senator pete v domeni ci ranking member committee on the budget united states senate april 10 2002 see httpwwwcbogov 65 ibid p 23 66 based on dod cost factors the cost of re placing expended munitions would be about 80 million per month and the cost of activating 20000 reservists to support the war as cbo assumes would be about 85 million per month or 11 billion for the yearforces military operations by us forces would continue to require about the same resources62 based on this conservative approach dod estimated that wartime military operations in 2002 would cost about 865 million per month63 that cost for military deployments incl uded the resources to deploy and support units and their equipment to operate quipment at higher operating tempo to carry out wartime operations to rotate deployed forces between stateside and overseas to pay active duty forces at higher levels nd to repair and replace equipment damaged or destroyed in combat dods deploymen t cost did not include the expense of activating reservists supporting afghan opera tions or the cost of replacing munitions expended during the war according to recent estimate prepared by the congressional budget office that uses these categories and relies on act ual cost data from operations as well as dods experience in other operations the co st of the war in afghanistan in the second half of fy2002 will be about 750 million per month about 75 of cbos estimated cost for the first half of the ear cbos lower cost estimate for the second half of the year reflects the recent withdraw of naval forces lower munitions usage and the absence of certain onetime costs incurred at the beginning of the conflict64 if the number of forces remained the sa but the pace of operations slowed cbo estimates that the monthly cost of th war would drop to about 600 million per month65 the difference between dod and cbos estimates is somewhat greater than appears from the figures above because cbo s numbers include not only deployment costs but also the cost of replacing expe nded munitions and the cost of activating about 20000 reservists whereas dod includes those costs elsewhere if dodsfigures are adjusted to be comparable to those used by cbo dods estimate of the total cost of the war for the year woul d be about 124 billion rather than the 102 billion assumed by cbo 22 billion difference 66 mobilizing reservists the

terrorism march 2002 p 2829the last eight months of the year dods request assumed that 1 billion was provided in the first emergency supplemental67 that proposal generated concern in congress among some members who believe that this amount may not be adequate to fund the reservists currently on active duty68 according to dod the 41 billion in its request assumed level of 80000 reservists for the remainder of the year number that is close to the 81235reservists currently on active duty 69 dod assumed that the number of reservists would fall in the latter part of the year as the frequency of combat air patrols on theeast and west coast carried out primarily by air force reservists is reduced and as the services trim the number of activat ed reservists who are currently carrying out guard duty at stateside military installations although dod did not provide definitive information about the tasks that reservists are performing it appears that many of the reservists activated by theservices are being used as guards at u s military installations reflecting the heightened concerns of the military in the wake of the terrorist attacks some have suggested that the number of guards could be reduced as dod completes securityenhancements for bases such as more fences and barriers for which 16 billionwas allocated in the first emergency supplemental dod could also reduce the costby using civilian rather than military to perform these duties in fact dod has requested lifting the current statutory pr ovision on contracting out security duty functions in the 2002 supplemental in order to permit dod to use private guardswho would be considerably less costly than the 66000 per person cost of relyingon activated reservists 70 in its regular fy2003 budget dod requested an additional 26 billion to improve physical security at military inst allations but has not specified whether reservists would continue to be used as guards at military installations see table 3 above

quickly is realistic apparently the military leadership were convinced by themanufacturers that doubling of capacity in bout year is possible any expansion will be dependent on both the level and timing of funding the high expenditure rates for jdams that were experienced in th early part of the war which generated such concern among the military may also have fallen in more recent months as

said however that the pr esident supports more aid to israel the palestinians and for hivaids and will seek other means to gain congressionalapproval for these activities in the future this suggests that president bush may submit an amendment to his pending fy 2003 foreign operations budget proposing these additional amounts whether he will also request cuts in the pending appropriation to offset these increases is uncertain funding issues the content of the 128 billion foreign aid supplemental sharply contrasted with the types of ssistance previously provided to frontline states and appeared

colombian national security 80 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31406crs46 although the most immediate effect of the change would be to permit the united states to expand how it shares intelligence

to colombias security the administration however did not ask congress to soften two other colombia aid restrictions concerning 400 person limit on us personnel insidecolombia and the prohibition of
