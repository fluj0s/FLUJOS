force base karen donfried specialist in european affairs foreign affairs and national defense division summary for four decades germany has sent pilots to the united states for training on may 1 1996 this bilateral military cooperation took an im portant step forward when defense secretary perry and german defense minister rühe activated the german air force tactical training center ttc at holloman air force base afb in new mexico by october 1999 the germans plan to have 24 f4 phantom and 42 tornado jets together with roughly 900 german air force staff members at holloman the two governments praised this undertaking as another sign of their continuing strong lliance many analysts argue that the most important benefit of an increasing german military presence in the united states may be to enhance opportunities fo r cooperation at time when the united states has dramatically reduced its military presence in europe some observers however have raised concerns for one they have expressed unease with what they interpret as permanent foreign military base on us soil in response the pentagon has pointed out that the ttc is tenant training unit at holloman afb which remains under the operational control of the us air force 49th fighter wing commander critics have also maintained that the ited states is shouldering the cost of the ttc in fact the germans are fi nancing the entire operation reports also indicate that the increased german presence is providing an economic boost to the region background the united states has long history of training with its allies both here and abroad germany first began training its pilots in the united states in 19551 the scope of these training programs has grown ever since the first extensive bilateral agreement concerning an air force training facility in the united states luke afb in arizona httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96462crs2 2information from the german defense nistry and german embassy washington 3information for this section was taken from tr anscript news briefing by ken bacon defense department spokesperson washi ngton dc may 2 1996 and holloman i and ii press section german embassy washington april 30 1996was concluded in 1964 basic training for je t pilots from the german air force and the german naval air arm began at sheppard afb in texas in 1966 also in 1966 the german air force air defense school began tr aining on the air defense weapons systems hawknike in fort bliss texas the range of training offered in the united states by 1966 led to the establishment of the german air force training command at fort bliss which became the german air force co mmand usacanada in 1994 in 1970 german pilots began to receive training for weapons systems on f4 phantom jets at george afb in california this training was moved to holloman afb in 1992 after george afb closed training for rf4e phantom crews began in 1973 at shaw afb in south carolina and was moved to bergstrom afb in texas later on starting in 1981 german officers began basic flying training fo r weapons systems operator functions on f4 phantom and tornado jets at mather afb in california then at randolph afb in texas and beginning in june 1996 they will train at pensacola naval air station in florida in 1981 german pilots also starte d participating in the euro nato joint jet pilot training program set up for pilots from many nato members at sheppard afb the german air force established basic flight program w ith the airline training center in goodyear arizona in 19902 the german armed forces co mmand based in reston virginia is in charge of all german officers training in the united states the german military presence at holloman afb3 in the fall of 1990 the us secretary of defense and the germ an defense minister agreed to deepen military cooperation in th is context the united states offered the german air force the opportunity to expand training at holloman afb holloman in alamogordo new mexico is the home base of the us air force 49th fighter wing and its stealth fighters the f117 in addition to the f4 phantom jets that had been transferred to holloman from george afb the united states agreed that the germans could station german tornado jets there in may 1994 memorandum of understanding was signed which covered construction of the german air force tactical training element and the stationing of 12 tornado and roughly 300 military and civilia n employees along with their families known as holloman i these planes and pers onnel are part of weapons instructor and flight training program the germans i nvested about 62 million german marks 40 million for constructing the necessary infrastru cture including hang ars and maintenance facilities on may 1 1996 us defense secr etary perry and germ an defense minister rühe activated the german tactical training center at holloman afb starting in october 1999 the german air force will send an additional 30 tornado jets and 600 military and civilian employees to holloman to further expand training this will allow the germans to perform all basic and weapons systems training for tornados at holloman afb and thus ensure comprehen sive training according to the german embassy this program called holloman ii will considerably improve the efficiency and quality of flight training of tornado crews because the trai ning duration can be shortenedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96462crs3 4holloman i and ii press section germ an embassy washington april 30 1996 p 2and the structure of the traini ng can be designed uniformly4 the germans will invest another 175 million german ma rks about 114 milli on to construct hangars noise suppression facility for engine test runs f light simulator and housing for the permanent and training staff upon completion of ho lloman ii in the fall of 1999 24 f4 phantoms 42 tornados and approximately 900 german air force staff members will be stationed at the ttc at holloman afb there are several important reasons for ge rmanys decision to invest in the ttc the issue of population density must be mentione d first holloman is situated in the state of new mexico which is about the same size as germany however new mexico has population of 15 million as compared to germanys 80 million the training opportunities permitted by the vast air space are simply not available to german pilots at home given new mexicos sparse population and the existing special use air space german pilots have greater opportunity to conduct flying training at low altitudes and high speeds they can use the full arra of radar jamming equi pment and conduct live bombing exercises second th weather is much better in new mexico than in germany which ensures training continuity because pilot can fly much greater number of hours per month or year than he can in germany in new mexico pilots can train all year long finally holloman afb is relatively close to fort bliss texas the headquarters for german air force operati ons in north america since the germans have been training in the united states for decades some may wonder what is special about the operation at holloman firs t the german air force has assumed responsib ility for flying training progra m on us soil for the first time previously the german military was essentially buying training courses with us instructors and us aircraft were used in those cases where the germans actually owned planes being used in the training courses those planes were maintained and serviced by the us air force or by civilian contractor companies through the foreign military sales program this will continue to be the case with the f4 training component used for german flying training at holloman with the ttc now activated the germans both own and maintain the tornado jets and german instructors will teach the training courses the ttc thus may represent new model unde r which allies can train beside their us counterparts while the germans have full control over the tornado training program operational control of the base remains in the hands of the us air force us interests and the german presence at holloman the official response in the united states to the activa tion of the german training center at holloman air force base has been overwhelmingly positive supporters of german operations at holloman have stressed the importance of german training in the united states for the strength of the atlantic alliance others however have raised concerns about the command structure at th base and the financing of the project command issues permanent german military base in new mexico on may 1 1996 cnn broadcast report entitled german air force invades holloman in new mexico cnns military affairs corre spondent jamie mcinty re described the situation as german fighter planes str eaked across the new mexico sky on the groundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96462crs4 5quoted from transcript 13477 cable news network may 1 1996 according to the pentagon both the us and german flags were displayed at the ttc activation ceremony on may 1 the us flag was properly displayed on th proper side and higher than the german flag the us flag is the only flag flown on the base 6see for instance john roper perry german counterpart christen base upi may 1 1996 german defence for talks in washington opens air base deutsche presseagentur april 26 1996 7news briefing by ken bacon 8tactical training center for german air fo rce briefing card office of the assistant secretary of defense public affairs may 2 1996a german flag was hoisted higher than the american flag signifying the first time the us has allowed another count ry to establish permanent military base on us soil5 other press reports also suggested that ho lloman afb had been in essence taken over by the germans6 the facts however suggest that these reports reflect certain misconceptions at press briefing on may 2 ken bacon the pentagon spokesperson said that it was not quite accurate to say that the germans had established permanent military base on us soil rather he said they are tenants at an american military base i think that we should not look at this this s hould not be portrayed by anybody as german invasion or occupation of us space its not that this is an opportunity for two allies to train together7 during the briefing bacon was asked again and again about the precise status of the german air force at holloman the briefing card he used stated holloman is us air force base has been in existence since 1942 and will remain us air force installationthe us ai r force 49th fighter wing commander shall exercise overall responsibility nd will have command and contro l of all base operations the germans are tenant unit under his operational control8 as for the permanence of the german presence the year 2004 is the end date of the memorandum of understanding covering the two german programs holloman i and ii thus if for whatever reason either side gr ew unhappy with the arrangement it could be terminated or altered in 2004 both us nd german officials view the ttc as long term commitment and expect the memora ndum of understanding to be extended whenever the germans do decide to stop training at holloman the facilities they have built will become part of the us infrastructure at the base the cost of german operation s at holloman who pays news reports about the german training center at holloma n triggered some stions about which government was bearing the cost for the expa nsion of german operations two points are important here first the germans are bearing the entire cost for expanding their training programs at holloman including about 40 million for c onstruction of new buildings for holloman i and an anticipated 114 million for additiona l facilities for holloman ii the germanshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96462crs5 9news briefing by ken bacon and german military are tenants at us base pentagon says deutsche presseagentur may 2 1996 10tactical training center for german ai r force pentagon briefing card may 2 1996 11robert tomsho alamogordo braces itse lf for an invasion by the luftwaffe wall street journal june 29 1995 p 1 12news briefing by ken baconmust pay for all supplies used from fuel to pencils and for propor tionate share of the operating costs of the base9 second many argue that the increasing ge rman presence offers direct financial benefits to the community around the base the pentagon maintains that the expansion of mission and facilities at hollo man is an economic windfall to the city of alamogordo and the state of new mexico10 currently german air crews and their families are living in the community of alamogordo not on the base reporter from the wall street journal went to alamogordo last summer to cover the story of the growing german presence which he interp reted as financial boon with base closings threatening other military towns this desert outpost is thrilled about the buildup planned for nearby holloman air force basethey the 300 german personnel are expect ed to bring 12 million payroll and as many as 800 dependents to the area where most will live offbasefor struggling military town that hasnt built so much as new apartment complex in 20 years this german invasion means boom times11 the one point of tension th article mentioned may be competition for good housing which is in short supply between germ an military personnel and their american counterparts who receive smaller housing allowances bolstering the atlantic alliance while the german presence at holloman may bring tangible financial gains for alamogor do and new mexico as whole the benefit highlighted by both us and german offi cials relates to the much broader aim of strengthening the atlantic alliance first the type of joint training which is taking place at holloman is seen as directly improving the readiness of nato in the words of the pentagon spokesman by training in the ited states they are increasing the capability of their air force and therefore increasing the capability of the alliance and this alliance remains an extremely important alliance as we are demonstrating in bosnia todaywe are always looking for ways to operate more closely with our allies so that should combat situation ever come we can operate as seamless unit12 second the importance of deepening transatlantic military cooperation and increasing joint training in the united states was felt keenly with the end of the cold war as the united states dramatically reduced its troop presence in europe both the bush and clinton administrations deemed it valuable to increase contacts with the closest allies of the united states as this military drawdown was occurring third officials cite direct benefit for usgerman relations the german facility at holloman represents step forward for bilateral friendship nd cooperation it alsohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96462crs6 13ibid see also remarks by defense secretary perry at ttc activation ceremony holloman afb may 1 1996underscores growing reciprocity in the rela tionship the united states stations about 100000 troops in europe down from over 300000 at the height of the cold war and the lions share of those troops was and is ba sed in germany over 100 us air force planes are stationed in germany the pentagon spokesman described the german training facility as an opportunity for us to actually return 40 years of training that we have performed on german soil this is not complicated operation we train extensively around the world on other peoples soil without much controversy i would expect the germans to be able to train on our soil with controversy whatsoever as allies friends and neighbors13 finally there has been some interest in whether the pentagon is considering making similar arrangements with other allies either at holloman afb or other us bases the pentagon has responded that requests have been received from other countries but it would seriously consider any that were submitted in this context the pentagon spokesman pointed out that the us air fo rce has provided training to nato pilots not just german pilots in the united states for years
