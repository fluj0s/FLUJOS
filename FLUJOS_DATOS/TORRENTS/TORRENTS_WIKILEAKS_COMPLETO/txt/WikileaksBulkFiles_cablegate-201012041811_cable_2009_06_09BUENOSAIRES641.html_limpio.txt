48493 classified by ambassador anthony wayne for reasons 14 b d 1 c summary and introduction argentine fm jorge taiana told the ambassador during the latters may 28 farewell call that the goa had intention of following venezuelas lead on expropriations taiana expressed concern about the visit of team from the faa and the prospect which has since receded of downgrade in the rating of argentinas civil aviation regime the ambassador updated taiana on mod efforts to find new office space for the us military group taiana protect said he knows that argentina in recent submission regarding its antarctic claim left out the language that was agreed with the usg and other key governments in 2004 ref c but claimed the current electoral climate in argentina had made it impossible to submit such specific language due to the malvinasfalklands issues continued prominence here the ambassador complained to taiana that an argentine judicial investigation was inadvertently holding up the reexportation of cars belonging to american diplomats the ambassador urged resolution of paris club and private bondholder debts ref b reports discussion of cuba issue at the oas general assembly end summary venezuelas hugo chavez 2 c the ambassador indirectly asked if the the argentine business communitys alarm regarding the latest wave of venezuelan expropriations including several affecting argentinas techint conglomerate was giving the goa pause about chavez taiana stressed that one senior in the goa neither cfk other ministers or nestor kirchner wanted to follow chavezs lead on expropriations taiana said peron had already gone through nationalization phase in the 1940s and the country had learned its lesson argentina may favor larger state role in the economy than does the united states but it still values the private sector and recognizes the primacy of private property for propelling economic growth and development the goa does not agree with what chavez was doing taiana reiterated comment these comments tracked with interior minister randazzos public comments on the week of may 25 that chavezs expropriations were preperonist end comment civair 3 c taiana said he was concerned about the visit of team from the faa and the possibility of downgrade in argentinas international aviation safety assessment iasa he noted that the transition from military to civilian control of air traffic had been wrenching with the military trying to hold on to power he said he hoped the faa assessment did not blow up publicly into divisive issue the ambassador noted that none of the faas recommendations was difficult or unfeasible note an faa team was in argentina may 2729 completing the iasa evaluation begun in march 2009 while official results have yet to be released an informal readout from the team leader indicates that argentina will maintain its iasa category i status the faa provided similar information to goa civil aviation authorities military group 4 c taiana asked if the ministry of defense had offered the us military group alternate office space per ref discussion the ambassador acknowledged the mod had made an offer and that one military group component located at mod headquarters had moved out of that building to the embassy the ambassador explained that two other military group components currently located at air force and navy facilities were hoping for temporary reprieve pending fuller discussion of updating the 1964 agreement at joint usargentine talks in october taiana asked to be kept informed of developments antarctic 5 c taiana protect said he knows that argentina in the data it submitted to the commission on the limits of the continental shelf regarding its antarctic claim left out the specific language that was agreed with the usg and other key governments in 2004 ref c he claimed that the current electoral climate in argentina had made it impossible to submit such language with the goa data doing so would have subjected the goa to storm of criticism for its surrender of argentine claims and resulted in his removal from office but if you read our submission carefully youll see our language respects all antarctic treaty provisions he said quickly adding that the prime issue for argentina of course was not antarctica but protecting its claim to sovereignty over the malvinasfalkland islands povs 6 c the ambassador explained to taiana that an argentine judge investigating abuse by others of diplomatic importation of vehicles had seized documents effectively holding up the export of privately owned vehicles povs belonging to american diplomats who had served in argentina and are now posted elsewhere the ambassador said washington was very concerned and looking into reciprocity measures taiana said he was not aware of this latest development and would look into it the ambassador subsequently signed letter to the investigating judge to be transmitted through the mfa which explains our serious concerns and seeks positive action paris club 7 c the ambassador told taiana that he had advised president kirchner the night before ref b that resolution of paris club and private bondholder debts is clearly in argentinas longterm interest taiana agreed the goa needed to find way to resolve the matter and the ambassador noted that planning minister vido and others in the goa seemed to be moving toward that position as well wayne
