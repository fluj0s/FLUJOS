from tatiana m dedkova tatminsecquoruseburgsu to kbriffaueaacuk subject from shiyatov date mon 5 may 97 094443 0500 dear keith after our long silence we would like inform you about our sucesses problems and plans 1 the main success to our mind is the next we have filled up the gap 13501250 bc between the absolutely dated 3250year yamal chronology and the nearest floating chronology it was happened few weeks ago using samples collected in 1996 now there are obstacles to develop in the nearest future the 70007500year length continuous chronology now we are working with ancient samples searching the places of missing and false rings making more precise datings of individual chronologies and so on during this time interval we have some problems for example more samples were found up to now to confirm the absence of false ring near 360 bc 2 this summer we intend to hold an expedition from the end of june to the middle of august in the southern part of yamal peninsula to collect more samples of subfossil wood which have great many of rings are sensitive and cover the intervals represented by insufficient quantity of samples at present we think that during this field season we must collect necessary quantity of samples to develop well represented 70007500 years chronology next year we intend to collect subfossil samples of wood from the middle part of yamal peninsula to reconstruct the dynamics of polar timberline during the holocene in detail using large number of tree remnants absolutely dated by dendrochronological method 2 this year we have small grant the from the russsian science foundation for developing the yamal supralong chronology approximately 4000 usd but we are not sure that all this sum we will receive for example last year we have received 37 from the promised sum of money as cost of helicopters rent is increased again this year about 2000 for one hour we have the problem how to reach our research area in the yamal peninsula vaganov have the same problem with organisation of field works over the territory of taimyr peninsula that is why we and evaganov ask you to transfer each of us 78000 usd until the end of june from the advance project if it is possible last summer when i was in england you promised to help us with money to organise field works this year 3 i am finishing measurements of rings of subfossil wood samples collected last year on the surface and in one lake and some bogs in the polar ural mountains i found little more ancient wood not all samples are dated until now and can prolong this chronology at least up to one hundred years this summer i will be in the mountains and try to collect wood from other lakes i want to develop the polar urals chronology for the last 2000 years 4 now we are preparing the paper concerning yamal project in russian and we need to cite the paper prepared for dendrochronologia in english could you send to us the last version of this articles by email or by post we wish you and your family the best we wish the same to phil jones and his family sincerely yours stepan shiyatov and rashit hantemirov
