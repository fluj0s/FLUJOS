lrh congress lecture successes miracle story in new york in 1989 i was passenger in car accident that had resulted in my having limp with shortened walking stride on my right side i was informed several years ago by three different orthopedic surgeons that i needed double hip replacement and that i could expect to have an inability to sit stand or walk without debilitating pain if i did not have this surgery recently i read advanced procedure and axioms and listening to thought emotion and effort lectures it was rigorous and it was tough facing the issues that the book and lectures brought to the surface but my determination to be free from these issues drove through to completion little did i know of all the freedom completing these would afford at 3 am the morning after i finished listening to the lectures i had an incredible experience while i was sleeping i had the urge to turn over as i was turning i got an excruciating twisting pain in my pelvic muscles on my right side i winced from this pain and i was wondering what was going on now because i never knew what pain or lessened physical capability to expect next from the injuries i had sustained even though i was in pain i was amazed by my hips twisting because prior to this i had hip socket rotation ability on either side eventually the pain subsided and i just went back to sleep thinking i had survived another episode of this is how it is when you are disabled in some way soap opera the next morning when i got out of bed i immediately noticed that i did not have my usual morning joint stiffness on my right side and that when i walked my stride was not as restrained as usual i could not believe it you have to understandi had not had that freedom of physical movement on my right side to this extent for over 10 years my limp has markedly diminished and i am excited to see what else will be released and transformed as i continue to study the basics i can only try to imagine the additional emotional mental and lifeempowering freedom and abilities that await as i embark upon this true bridge to being completely alive thank you lrh for developing the technology that gave the gift of this experience and the assurance that my better tomorrows can be today through studying mh harlem new york 2007 bridge publications inc all rights reserved click here for copyright and trademark information mailed from bridge publications 4751 fountain ave angeles ca 90029
