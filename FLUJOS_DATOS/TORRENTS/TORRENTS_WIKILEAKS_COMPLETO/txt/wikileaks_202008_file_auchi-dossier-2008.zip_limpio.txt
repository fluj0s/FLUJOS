nadhmi auchi and the observer posted by martin bright of the new statesman 22 april 2008 i was humbled by many of the winners at the index on censorship awards for freedom of expression last night but i was especially struck by the comments of julian assange of wikileaks the phenomenally successful whistleblowing site in particular he mentioned the importance of the unfashionable concept of syndicalism for most people it seems trade unions are so last century which had helped wikileaks survive legal attacks in the us his words truly warmed my heart more worrying was the news that the guardianobserver has been forced to pull down six articles about nadhmi auchi the iraqi businessman convicted of fraud in france in 2003 auchi has been on the warpath since his name was connected with tony rezko the illinois fundraiser currently on trial in america who was one of barack obamas earliest backers in the uk the times has been pursuing the story with impressive tenacity the articles are still available in various places on the web but its probably wise not to link to them from here here is the full list of the six 1 labour blocks extradition of iraqi tycoon observer 2 february 2003 2 billionaire linked to labour arrested in london guardian 2 april 2003 3 so norman any regrets this time observer 6 april 2003 4 tycoon in quiz over ties to labour observer 6 april 2003 5 politics of sleaze observer 16 november 2003 6 mp questions iraq role of briton tainted over elfthis has also been titled british fraudster to profit from iraq contractobserver 16 november 2003 the observer 6 april 2003 so norman any regrets this time he famously lathered himself while singing je ne regrette rien when britain was humiliatingly jettisoned from the european exchange rate mechanism but it is debatable whether these days lord lamont can affect such cheery disposition the coruscating business career on which he set his heart following his ignominious ousting as chancellor of the exchequer has proved elusive for norman stewart hughson lamont several of his business ventures have fallen by the wayside while others have landed him in deep controversy raising questions over his judgment lamont 61 is battling for credibility as one of the companies he chairs hovers on the brink of collapse shares in galileo innovations the investment company set up by the controversial businessman and former pipefitter paul davidson were suspended by the stock exchange last tuesday after it failed to publish its annual report the cheshirebased companys board is now struggling to work out whether galileo whose shares have crashed from 20p to 1p can continue as going concern it is the latest setback for davidson who achieved notoriety last year when the financial services authority launched an investigation into spread bet he took out shortly before another firm he was involved with cyprotex was floated why lamont who joined investment bank nm rothschild after leaving the cabinet ended up as chairman of tiny floated company is open to question but the chance to share in its potentially lucrative future must have been consideration unlike some of his contemporaries hurd hestletine lamont who declined to return calls is not hugely wealthy he left rothschild in 1995 and several other companies he joined experienced difficulties the taiwan investment trust ecit finance equity consort and first philippine securities all ended up in liquidation number of other companies on whose board lamont sits are not capable of delivering him the sort of salary associated with tory grandees clarges energy is tiddler with near anonymous profile and sitting on the board of the indonesian fund an investment trust is unlikely to be huge money spinner but galileos board believed it had potential to produce stellar financial rewards the company boasted that it had pipeline of exciting companies ready to come to market as sir anthony joliffe one of the nonexecutive directors put it when lamont was appointed in july last year lord lamont shares our views of the companys prospects and opportunities the company had great hopes for its first investment fluid conditioning systems which had developed replenishable oil solutions for the automotive industry another growth business was scientific detectors which made analytical equipment for use in the pharmaceutical and petrochemical industries by the end of last year galileo was predicting that three of its investments would float on the same day in the fourth quarter of 2002 but the triple score never happened possibly because war fears scuppered the chances of getting the companies away at reasonable price fortunately for lamont he has other business interests to fall back on he is consultant to rotch the mayfair based property company run by the iranianborn brothers robert and vincent tchenguiz rotch is reputed to preside over property portfolio valued at 1634bn and is also the largest shareholder in tenanted pubs giant pubmaster the brothers who eschew publicity are ranked 90th in britains rich list lamont is also director of scottish annuity life holdings the bermudabased company that provides reinsurance products to the life insurance industry and wealth management services to highnetworth individuals then there is the directorship of balli group the metals trader headquartered in london which has huge interests in romania balli coowns sidex international with lnm the steel group whose offshore parent company is run by controversial millionaire lakshmi mittal his bid for sidex was famously backed by supportive letter from tony blair in addition to sitting on the board of the british iranian chamber of commerce lamont is director of the british romanian chamber of commerce and organised several dinners to help advance business relations between the two countries one dinner in honour of romanian president ion illiescu was attended by millionaire metals trader virendra rastogi now the subject of serious fraud squad investigation another for the romanian prime minister and attended by trade secretary patricia hewitt was sponsored by mittal lamonts appeal to powerful businessmen must lie at least in part in his extensive political contacts he is chairman of littleknown but hugely influential rightwing body called cercle foun ded in the 1950s by frances antoine pinay and german chancellor konrad adenauer cercle also known as the atlantic circle describes itself as an informal group of european and american professionals politicians retired ambassadors former generals lawyers and active participants in banking oil shipping publishing and trading companies guest attendees have included richard nixon henry kissinger the sultan of oman romanias illiescu and king hussein of jordan comparisons with the highly secretive bilderberg group are inevitable especially as one attendee the late alan clark mp suggested cercle had close links to the cia it is perhaps his links with cercle which reinforce lamonts most controversial business relationship that with iraqi billionaire nadhmi auchi who was arrested in britain last monday auchi who is known to have attended number of cercle meetings made millions selling italian warships to the iraqi regime in 1980 lamont is director of one of auchis biggest companies compagnie internationale participations bancaires et financieres the financial arm of general mediterranean holdings which holds stake in bnp paribas and jordans union bank for savings and investment auchi former baath party activist who is thought to have been advising the uk government on iraq was arrested on french extradition warrant next month the corruption trial involving oil giant totalfinaelf is expected to hear allegations that he channelled 16328m commission from the oil company to buy refinery in kuwait auchi has denied any wrongdoing whatever the outcome lamont could well look back on last week as the point his fortunes took another turn for the worse it may be some time before the peer who pocketed thousands of pounds from cheshire pipefitter and an iraqi billionaire sings in his bath again copyright 2003
