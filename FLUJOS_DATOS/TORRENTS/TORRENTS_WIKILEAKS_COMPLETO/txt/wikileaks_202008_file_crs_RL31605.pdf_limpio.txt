th federal eligibility rules ar maximum income limits for states in designing their ccdf programs states may adopt income eligibility limits below that maximum and currently all but nine states have indeed set lower eligibility limit regardless of the blished limits because ccdf is not an entitlement for individuals states are not required to aid families even if their incomes fall below statedetermined eligibility thresholds although states are not required to gu arantee child care for welfare families states may give special treatment to fa milies receiving assistance from the temporary assistance for needy families tanf progra m recognizing that under tanf both states and individuals are now subject to work requirements generally tanf families continue to have some special status in states ccdf programs in some states tanf families are categorically elig ible for services although they may not actually receive service because funding may not always be available tanf families are not responsible for copayment for child care services in 22 states federal law requires states to assure that payment rates to child care providers ensure that ccdfeligible children receive equal access to care comparable to that available to children not eligible for subsidies states generally set payment rates based on prevailing market rates for child car the most recent state plans indicate that 45 states or territories based their current payment ra tes on market rate surveys conducted in 2000 or 20 01 and rates of the remaining seven states were based on surveys conducted in or prior to 1999 federal law also requires that states us not less than 4 of federal child care funds made available for each fiscal year to administer activities designed to improve the quality of child care prior to 1996 the ccdbg act included list of activities for which the quality improveme nt funds were to be spent however those categories are longer itemized in law nevertheless as part of the ccdf plan states indicate whether they will spend any of their child care quality funds on ac tivities that fall into those categories authorized under prior law and any others

104193 restructured federal child care programs as part of larger initiative to reform the nations welfare system the 1996 welfare reform law repealed three welfarerelated child care prog rams that had been authorized under title iva of the social security act to replace them the law directly authorized and appropriated mandatory funds for child care through fy2002 under section 418 of the social security act the law also amended and extended fourth source of child care funds the child care and developmen t block grant ccdbg act which authorizes discretionary child care funds also through fy20021 in addition to consolidating the various child care assistance programs the welfare reform law established single set of rules applicable to child care both mandatory and discretionary child care funds must be spent in accordance with the provisions of the reconstituted ccdbg b ecause these rules apply to child care supported by multiple funding streams i the ccdbg and section 418 of the social security act the department of health and human services hhs refers to the unified program as the child ca re and development fund ccdf figure 1 depicts the aforementioned changes to child care programs made in 1996 by the personal responsibility and work opportunity r econciliation act under the ccdf states receive combination of discretionary and mandatory grants totaling 4817 billion in fy2002 ccdf appropriated funds part of which is subject to state matching requirements2 states have flexibility within federal parameters to deter mine the population they will serv however the law does not entitle any individual family or category of recipient to child care assistance the intent of the ccdf is to support state administered child care programs for both welfare families and lowincome nonwelfare wo rking families by providing subsidies to cover some or all of the families cost of assistance states establish sliding fee schedules which determine the share of child care costs that eligible families are expected to pay out of their own pockethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31605crs2 3 final rules and regulations for the unified system went into effect august 28 1998 these

average income but rather the income at which half of the families in the state have incomes above and half below the federal eligibility ceiling for each state is 85 of that amount which vari by state the percentage of families whose incomes fall under 85 of smi will also vary although it will be somewhere below 50 of all the states families depending on the distribution of income in the state 6 data are not available on the average size of families served by ccdf funds but the average family size for families receiving welfare one of the target populations for ccdf funds is three singlemother with two children 7 in some cases there is variation within st ates based on locality or whether the individual is new applicant as opposed to current recipient for example new jersey has an eligibility limit of 49 of smi 200 of fpl for entering the ccdf system upon receiving subsidy families may reach high er limit of 61 of smi 250 of fpl before having to exit the system the following states also have different eligibility limits for new applicants and current recipients alabama hawaii indiana massachusetts south carolina and wisconsin quality improvement ac tivities undertaken by the state and health and safety rules eligibility for ccdfsubsidized care federal law defines childre n eligible for ccdfsubsidized care as those under age 13 residing with family whose income does not exceed 85 of the smi for family of equal size5 eligibility is further limited to children whose parents are working or attending job training or ducational program or children who are receiving protective services regulations permit states to waive on casebycase basis income eligibility requirements for children in protective care including foster care if the state chooses to define foster care as part of its protective services states also have the option to aid children aged 13 to 19 who have special needs are in protective care including foster care or are under court supervision income eligibility the federal income eligibility rules are maximum income limits for states to use in designing their individual ccdf programs states may adopt income eligibility limits below those in federal law because ccdf is not an entitlement for individuals states are not required to aid families even if their incomes fall below the eligibility threshold established by the state however federal law does require states to give priority to families with very low incomes as defined by the state in their ccdf plan while states clearly define very low incomes usually in relation to either the state median income smi or the federal poverty level fpl in their state plans it is not clear that very low income families are necessarily the top priority for receiving services for instance several states explicitly prioritize tanf families above other eligib families with very low incomes in their list of priority rules table 1 illustrates the ccdf income eligibility limits across the 50 states and territories for family of three6 because median incomes vary by state the income eligibility as percentage of the states median income is useful for comparing relative eligibility levels across the states and territories as shown in table 1 there is considerable variation among states with respect to eligibility limits 7 eight states use the maximum allowable limit under federa l law or 85 of smi as their eligibility threshold for families applying for ccdf subsidies twentysix stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31605crs4 chose eligibility limits between 39 and 59 of the state median income smi twentytwo states chose income eligibility limits between 60 and 84 of the smi table 1 also shows the general income eligib ility limit for each state as percent of the 2001 federal pove rty

federal poverty guideline for the territo ries the correspondi ng monthly amounts are 1219 1524 and 1403 the last column of table 1 shows the very low income eligibility limits as defined by each state and territory for family of three as noted federal law requires states to give priority to families with very low incomes however those families may compete for services with other priority categories such as tanf recipients children in protective services or children with special needs as with the general income eligibility levels there is considerable variation among states in the setting of very low in come limits several states 14 designate 100 of the federal poverty level as thei r very low income limit while others base their limit on percentage of the state median income in few cases states indicate that they determine the very low income limit with respect to the sliding fee scales established to determine families copaymentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31605 crs5 table

tanf programs by vee burkechanges in eligibility limits over time table 1 reveals the variation among states eligibility limits based on information from the most recent state plans comparison of the current pl ans with the previous plans from fy2000 fy2001 not shown indicates that most st ates and territories increased the dollar amount of their general inco eligibility limits for fy20022003 in many cases states median incomes have increased and the dollar limits set for eligibility have been set to corre spond to those increases for example connecticuts monthly eligibility limit for family of three increased from 3264 to 3966 but both amounts reflect 75 of the smi as measured at the time the respective plans were submitted however it should be noted that an increase in the dollar amount does not necessarily transl ate into an increase in the limit as percentage of smi nine states made change to th eir general income limit dollar amounts between the current and the previous plans in each of those cases the state median incomes had increased resulting in lower limits when measured as percentage of smi only handful of states decreased the dollar amount of their income eligibility limits and in none of the cases does the decrease appear to reflect change due to decrease in the state median income tanf families and transitioning families in addition to making changes to child care programs prwora also ended the program of afdc which provided an entitlement to cash assistance for families that met states standard of need prwora replaced afdc with program of temporary assistance for needy families tanf under tanf cash assistance is longer an entitlement and both states and individual recipients face new work requirements states must have specified percentage of their tanf caseload engaged in work activities each year and tanf recipients are required to engage in work within 2 years of receiving benefits8 unlike under afdc child care is l onger guaranteed to welfare families who need child care to engage in work education or training under pre1996 law families who lost ligibility for welfare due to increased earnings were entitled to transitional child care for up to 1 year if they met the states eligibility requirements though some stat provided transitional child care for longer periods under welfare reform waivers under current w federal rules exist requiring or limiting transitional child care so states may establish their own rules and time limits for providing transitional care however portion of federal child car funds continues to be targeted at welfare families and families leaving welfare under the ccdf program states are required to spend at least 70 of thei r mandatory child care funds the fundshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31605crs10 9 in some states tanf families are categorically eligible for services although they may not actually receive service because funding ma not always be available for example according to arkansas fy20022003 ccdf plan tanf families who need child care to participate in work activities will be provid ed with child care however the plan also states that due to lack of funding new fam ilies have not been added to the child care rolls in arkansas since late 1999 box 1 ccdf and tanf funds in addition to ccdf funds states may spend tanf funds for child care in two separate ways first states are permitted to transfer combined total of 30 of their annual tanf allotments excep t tanf contingency funds to the ccdf and the social services block grant ssbg with maximum limit of 10 to the ssbg transferred funds are treated lik ccdf discretionary funds and services provided using such funds are subject to all ccdf prog ram requirements including applicable state and local hea lth and safety require ments which include prevention and control of infectious dis eases including immunizations building and premises safety and minimum health and safety training appropriate to the provider setting second state may us tanf funds to pay for child care services for tanfeligible families without transferring funds to ccdf in this case the child care is not subject to ccdf rules inc luding health and safety requirements instead funds must be spent in accordance with tanf rules note for more information on states use of tanf funds for child care see crs report rl31274 child care funding and spending under federal block grantsprovided under section 418 of the social security act on th families historically served by the programs replaced under prwora families receiving cash welfare tanf assistance families attempting to transition from tanf to work or those at risk of welfare dependency as part of their ccdf plan states are required to describe their treatment of tanf families families attempting to transition off of tanf through work and families at risk of welfare dependence following is summary discussion of treatment of these three groups for statebystate information see appendix of this report although the federal entitlement to ch ild care longer exists lowincome working families including tanf families continue to have entitlement status in few states in most of the remaining states tanf families retain some special status in states ccdf programs9 in addition tanf families are not respons ible for copayment for child care services in 22 states see table 4 small number of stat do require copayments from working families on tanf although most define work to include only paid activities and exclude unpaid tanf work ac tivities such as internships or educationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31605crs11 10 recent urban institute report found that maintaining child care was not often automatic for families transitioning off welfare and that the process required redetermination administrative hassles and other barriers which might keep former recipients from accessing subsidies for which th ey are eligible for more information see adams gina kathleen snyd er and jodi sandfort 2002 navigating the child care subsidy system policies and practices that affect access and retention washington dc the urban institute the report can be accesse d on the internet at httpwwwurbanorgas noted in box 1 some states use tanf funds to pay for child care services for tanf families while in others child care services for these families are provided with ccdf funds or tanf funds transferred to the ccdf some states have chosen not to treat tanf families differently than other low income families with respect to ccdf subsidies in several states priority for child care subsidies is based solely on income or would be if waiting list were necessary without regard to tanf status many states also continue to offer some form of transitional child care although states vary in how long families are eligible for transitional child care and on whether or not these families are required to make copayment of states that reported time limit for transitional child care services the length of eligibility ranged from 3 months to 3 years among states offering transitional child care minimal co payments were often required of former tanf families there are also differences among states in how families are treated when they reach the time limit on transitional child care in some states these families are automatically transferred to lowincomeatrisk child care subsidy status while in others former tanf families who reach their time limit on transitional child care must then compete for available child care subsidies with other lowincome working families10 in some states this can mean being put on waiting list for services in alabama families who leave tanf for employment are guaranteed child care slot however once they have exhausted their transitional child care eligibility they are served as funds are available on firstcome firstserved basis in nevada on the other hand if family is already on the child care subsidy program ie tanf family or transitioning family they woul d be continued without interruption for other low income families not already in the subsidy program the priority for receiving subsidy would be determined by income families at risk of welfare dependence states may define atrisk as they choose and many states define this group to encompass the same population as is eligible for ccdf subsidies generally in these states the requirement in section 418 of the social security act that 70 of mandatory child care funds be spent on tanf families families transitioning from tanf and families at risk of tanf dependence may not be useful for targ eting funds to the first two groups ie the requirement could be t by spending all of those earmarked funds on atrisk families however as discussed most states continue to assign some priority to tanf families and transitioning families and families at risk of welfare dependence are often mentioned as lower priority for services relative to the tanf populations currently data on ccdf subsidy receipt by tanf status is not available so it ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31605crs12 11 in tennessee social services block grant ssbg funds not ccd f funds are used for this category of childrenunclear what proportion of these funds actually serve tanf recipients or former recipients eligibility for special populations federal law defines child as eligible for ccdf services if they are under 13 year s of age and their familys income does not exceed 85 of the smi for family of the same size regulations however allow states to use ccdf funds to provide child care services to children up to age 19 who are physically or mentally incapacita ted and incapable of selfcare or who are under court supervision states that elect to extend eligibility in this way must also assign an age limit in their ccdf plans and must provide their definition of physical or mental incapacity additionally states may extend ccdf eligibility to children in protective services including foster care even if the foster parents are not in work or training regulations also permit states to waive income eligibility and costsharing requirements for child care rvices on casebycase basis for children who receive or need to receive protective services table 2 shows whether states have extended ccdf eligibility to children in these specific categories all jurisdictions except ohio and the northern mariana islands have granted eligibility to at least one of these groups of the 43 jurisdictions that provide ccdffunded child care in prot ective services cases the majority waive fee and income eligibility re quirements for children who r eceive or need to receive protective services in the other 13 jurisd ictions ccdf funds are not used for child care in protective services cases column three in this table indicates which states elected to provide child care for children age 13 or over who are under c ourt supervision and the age up to which the state provides care for these children thirtysix states or territories extend eligibility to this group with all but one

equal access to care comparable to that available to children not eligible for federal child care subsidies ccdf final rules require states to certify to that effect in their state plans the final regulations require state to consider three elements to determine if its child care program adequa tely fulfills the statutory requirements for equal access the state must 1 assure that it offers parents choice in categories12 and types13 of providers 2 define adequate payment rates based on sufficient market rate survey conducted more than 2 years prior to the effective date of th currently

for child care providers note that these rates reflect the maximum amounts that could be paid by the state to providers they do not include parents outofpocket payments to providers final ccdf regulations require states to conduct survey biennially to ensure that their payments sufficiently reflect current market conditions however as table 3 indicates not all states ra tes are based on surveys conduc ted in the past 2 years under prior law for welfarerelated programs child care payment rates were set at the 75th percentile which meant that at least 75 of all child care providers surveyed by the state charged rates at or below this level in issuing its final regulations hhs suggested that states continue to use the 75th percentile as benchmark for assessing whether the ccdf payment assures equal access to child care for families assisted by the ccdf however neither federal law nor regulations set minimum payment standards the second column of table 3 provides information on the rules used by each state to establish maximum payment rates for child care providers the table also reports the date of the survey upon which the current rates are based and any statehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31605crs17 14 note that states that use the 75th percentile rule do not necessarily apply that rule to current market rate survey in those cases if market rates have

fixed percentage of the payment rates reflected in the survey for example california uses 15 standard deviations from the regional market mean in colorado counties set th eir own rates by varying methods for different types of care ka nsas distinguishes between licensed homes and child care centers and registered homes setting the rate for licensed homes and centers at the 65th percentile and at the 60th percentile for registered homes florida is an example of state that provides tiered reimbursement or enhanced rate s above the normal maximum to providers who have met accreditation standards remaining states describe d various other methods fo r determining their rates among states that described different rate setting methods several indicated that they chose to differentiate their paym ent rates based upon the following type of provider differences in age or special needs of the child geographic area full or parttime care care provided during nontraditional hours number of children in the family for whom care is provided care provided to children of teen parents child care provided to families receivi ng protective services or court based care and provider accreditation status in the case of special needs children or other unique care settings federal law allows for but does not requi re reimbursement rates to be increased to offset the additional costs that may result from specially trained staff or specialized facilities some states indicated that the 75th percentile payment rate allowed providers room for growth and flexibility in the kinds of care they provided as many providers currently charge rates below the maximum child care payment rate according to the state plans submitted for the period covering fy2002fy2003 45 states based their

services each state must establish and periodically revise sliding fee scal for costsharing by families receiving subsidized child care15 by statute costsharing payments must be based on income and family size so payments will generally increase as the familys size and income increase16 as noted the sliding fee scale is the third element in equal access to child care although federal law and regulati ons do not set limits on the amount of the cost of care state may require the family to pay hhs did provide reference point for states to use in creating their sliding fee scales in issuing its final regulations hhs suggested that established fees not require the ccdfsubsidized family to pay more than 10 of its income for child care this benchmark is not meant to limit states but is offered as re ference point for states to consider when determining if their costsharing policy is consistent with the ccdf equal access requirement states vary in how they structure their sliding fee scales with some states requiring that families pay percentage of the cost of care such as hawaii but the majority basing the required copayment on family income most states do not require copayments significantly above 10 of income however several states do require percentages as high as 20 of gross income from families at higher income levels and oregon requires up to 29 of family income for
