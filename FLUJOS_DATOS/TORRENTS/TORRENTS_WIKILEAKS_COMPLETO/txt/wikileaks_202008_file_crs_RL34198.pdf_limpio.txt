made to enhance the safety of food imports critics argue that major reforms are necessary because the present programs are both poorly designed and inadequately funded to meet todays challenges an opposing argument is that imported foods already are subject to the same safety standards as and pose greater hazards thandomestically produced foods an early argument of the bush administration was that smarter allocation of ex isting resources and the food industrys own controls could and should be capable of addressing any problems in early december 2007 science advisory board of the us food and drug administration fda science board concluded that the agency s overall appropriation now at about 15 billion should be more than doubled in the next several years if it is to meet its current responsibilities including but not limited to fo od safety congress did prov ide the fda with some increased funding for fy2008 and part of fy2009 the bush administration in november 2007 also had issued new policy recommendations on food safety and on import safety although these recommendations received some attention in the 110 th congress by the second session many stakeholders were focusing on draft bills circulated by the chairmen of the house energy and commerce committee and the senate health education labor and pensions committee the propo sals differed in detail but both sought broad reforms in fdas oversight of food and drug safety including of imports another comprehensive bill s 3385 also called for broad reforms in food safety oversight numerous other food safety bills in the 110th congress addressed one or more aspects of food import safety elements of these bills could reemerge in legislative proposals expected to be introduced into the 111th congress

the steady increase in imports result of globalization and consumer desire for wider variety of foods yearround with this growth have come new concerns about whether current federal programs sufficiently ensure the safety of these imports import alerts in 2007 and 2008 targeting adulterated pet food ingredients farmed seafood and dairy products and ingredients all from china are among the incidents that heightened interest in the issue in the 110 th congress do us safeguards generally created at an earlier time when most americans obtained their foods domestically remain sufficient to protect public health what if any changes should be made to enhance the safety of food imports critics argue that major reforms are necessary because the present programs are both poorly designed and inadequately funded to meet todays challenges those who oppose major changes assert that imported foods already are subject to the same safety standards asand pose greater hazards thandomestically produced foods they also contend that smarter allocation of existing resources and the food industrys own controls can and should be capable of addressing any problems that arise the issue was explored at numerous congressional hearings in 2007 and 2008 and members of congress introduced variety of bills to modify or overhaul the current system some sought broad reforms in the us food and drug administrations fdas oversight of both food and drug safety including of imports the us depa rtment of agriculture oversees the safety of most meat and poultry fda all other foods the house energy and commerce committee and the senate health education labor and pensions committee the likely starting points for fda food safety reform did not mark up comprehensive legislation in the 110 th congressbut are widely expected to consider major bills in the 111th congress the bush administration had released on november 6 2007 its own import safety plan and an accompanying food protection strategy these documents made number of recommendations some of them entailing new legislative authority and additional funding which the bush administration requested in its fy2009 budget subm ission for fda fda appropriations usually are provided each year as part of the agriculture rural development fda and related agencies appropriations act not by the authorizing committees it was unknown in late 2008 whether an obama administration would incorporate elements of the bush plan into its own food safety strategy and funding recommendations

fsis and the us department of health and human services food and drug administration fdaare responsible for the majority of the total funding and staffing of the governments food regulatory system for imports fsis relies on very different regulatory system than fda including differing approach to addressing equivalence as described below also important are usdas animal and plant health inspection

coordinating agencies food security activities including border inspections by dhss us customs and border protection cbp 3 g8g6g3g561g20g152g149g142g561 the fdas food regulatory authority comes chiefly from the federal food drug and cosmetic act ffdca as amended 21 usc 301 et seq4 this authority makes the agency responsible for the safety of virtually all domestic and imported articles used for food and drink except meat and poultry see fsis role below these include animal as well as human foods fdaregulated foods may be deemed adulterated or misbranded for variety of statutorily prescribed reasons for example food may be deemed adulterated if it contains an added poisonous or deleterious substance or an unsafe food additive or if the food was prepared packed or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have become contaminated or may have been rendered injurious to health 5 of approximately 60700 domestic food facilities such as manufacturers warehouses and shippers fda designates about 8000 as high risk based on the types of foods they handle andor past performance6 in general fda attempts to conduct annual inspections of these facilities nonhigh risk establishments are inspected on average once 2 usda economic research service ers unpublished data obtained may 11 2007 other data including that provided by fda indicate that the current percentage

another of fdas indicate an inspection frequency of once every 10 years7 all domestic and foreign food manufacturing faciliti must adhere to fda s regulations on good manufacturing practices 21 cfr part 110 which address safe handling and plant sanitation exempt are establishments such as farms engaged solely in harvesting storing or distributing raw agricultural commodities normally cleaned or otherwise treated before consumption section 801 of the ffdca empowers the fda to refuse entry to any food import if it appears based on physical examination or otherwise to be adulterated misbranded or in violation of the law8 in exercising its oversight the agency relies on system of prior notifications by importers and document reviews at points of entry ports importers must have an entry bond and file notification for every shipment import information is entered into fdas database the operational and administrative system for import support oasis this system is to help inspectors to determine shipments relative risk and whether it needs closer scrutiny ie wharf or physical examination andor testing fda inspectors are to work closely with cbp officials on these tasks 9 if closer examination is not deemed necessary fda allows the product to enter us commerce shipment found to be noncompliant is subject to number of corrective actions such as relabeling or reconditioning to bring it into compliance refused entry or even seizure and destruction sometimes the agency subjects an import to detention without physical examination 10 based on past history or other information indicating that it may be violative such detention compels the importer to demonstrate to fda that the product is safe before it can enter us commerce examples in 2007 were the detention of all chinese plant protein products including wheat gluten and rice gluten destined for pet foods after some were found to contain melamine an unapproved substance and of all farmraised seafood from china specifically shrimp catfish basa dace and eel until the shippers of these products could demonstrate that they are free of unapproved drug residues in 2008 the fda issued detention import alert for all milk products milkderived ingredients and food products containing milk from china until they can demonstrate that they do not contain melamine or cyanuric acid the volume of fdaregulated imports has increased substantially in the past decade the agency recorded more than 82 million imported food lines in fy2007 compared with fewer than 28 7 for example fda science and mission at risk november 2007 report prepared by subcommittee of the fda science board the commissioners top advisory group cited on p 21 an fda estimate that at most it inspects food manufacturers once every 10 years also the fda food protection plan november 2007 stated that there were over 136000 registered domestic food facilities and approximately 189000 foreign facilities that manufacture process pack or hold food these figures are inflated because facilities engaged in more than one activity are c ounted multiple times the food protection plan is discussed later in this crs report 8 21 usc 381a 9 the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 pl 107188 greatly expands the prior notification requirements for fdaregulated imported foods it also now requires any imported or domestic facility that manufactures processes packs or holds food for us consumption to register with the fda farms and retail establishments are among those exempted further the act requires records sufficient to identify the immediate supplier as well as the subsequent recipient of the product among other provisions 10 fdas authority to detain without physically inspecting an article derives from 21 usc 381a which states that fda must refuse admission of certain imports into the united states if it appears from the examination of such samples or otherwise that such samples are

internationally accepted trade rules any newly adopted measures such as those discussed later in this report would likely be closely scrutinized by us trading partners for their adherence to such agreements more specifically the united states is signatory to multilateral trade rules which allow governments to adopt unilaterally any measures to protect human animal or plant life or health in doing so however they are not to be discriminatory or used as disguised protectionism this principle was clarified in 1994 when most major trading nations including the united states adopted along with other socalled uruguay round agreements the agreement on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary sps measures this document sets out the basic rules for ensuring that each countrys food safety and animal and plant health laws and regulations are transparent scientifically defensible and fair the united states also has signed or is negotiating numerous regional and bilateral free trade agreements ftas that may contain sps language such language in most of the ftas generally references the signing parties rights and obligations under the multilateral sps agreement the united states also participates in the three major international scientific bodies designated by the wto to deal with sps matters one the codex alimentarius commission focuses on human food safety the others are the office of international epizootics oie for animal health and diseases and the international plant protection convention ippc for plant health these bodies meet regularly to discuss threats to human and agricultural health evaluate spsrelated disputes and develop scientifically based sps standards such standards can provide guidance for countries designing their own national sps measures and help resolve trade disputes although us and world trade organization wto officials frequently cite the benefits of sps cooperation under trade agreements some among them food safety and environmental advocacy organizations have been skeptical they have argued that implementation of the agreements can result in downward harmonization rather than upgraded health and safety standards defenders counter that trade rules explicitly recognize the right of individual nations to enact stronger protections than international guidelines if they believe they are appropriate and are justified by scientific risk assessment 22 22 these arguments are covered at greater length in crs report rl33472 sanitary and phytosanitary sps concerns in agricultural trade by geoffrey s becker

have to be either reexported or destroyed by the importer the agency posts these monthly refusal reports on its website but does so only for the most recent 12 months ie only one years worth of refusals also listed in the refusal reports but not examined here are other fdaregulated products drugs medical devices and vitamins crs examined the data for fy2007 and fy2008 ie october through september of each year for each import line the system provides the name of the source company and the reason for refusal line is portion of an import shipment that is listed separately on that imports entry document an item in shipment must have separate line if its tariff description differs from other items in that shipment as noted earlier the size of each shipment in the oasis database varies therefore it is not possible to calculate the volumes of products being rejected either as an absolute quantity or as proportion of total im ports also the types or categories of imports do not correspond directly to the categories reported through the usda trade databases used for table 1 above efforts are under way to improve the collection and use of fda import data the agency reported in late 2008 that it was working on an advanced screening system it calls the predictive risk based evaluation for dynamic import compliance targeting predict elsewhere section 1009 of the food and drug

nearly 40 categories of fdaregulated food and foodrelated products for the entire fy2007 fda logged total of more than 8400 refusals this represents approximately onetenth of one percent of the more

country the ers study found that more than half of all food safety or other violations of fda law during the sevenyear period were among three food categories vegetables and vegetable products 206 of total violations fishery and seafood products 201 and fruits and fruit products 117 the most common violations were unsafe pesticides for vegetables and vegetable products filth unsanitary for both fishery and seafood products and fruits and fruit products and unregistered processes for canned foods from all three categories overall misbranding or lack of appropriate labeling accounted for 33 of the 70369 violations and adulteration or safety and packaging integrity violations for 65 adulteration violations pose wide range of food safety risks from less severe risks such as an insect in cooked soup to immediate risks to human health like botulism in canned food the data indicate that the most common adulteration violations were for the appearance of filth in food product and failure to file information or register specified process 26 although the study revealed recurring problems in certain types of imported foods it did not indicate the actual level or distribution of food safety risk because fda s process for selecting shipments for inspection or other administrative actions is not random the authors wrote in 24 food and water watch import alert government fails

there to stop selling catfish from china after samples tested positive for antibiotics banned in the united states one month later on june 28 2007 fda issued an import alert ordering the detention without physical examination of all of the following aquacultured products from china catfish basa related to catfish shrimp dace related to carp and eel28 fda said it issued the notice after targeted sampling during october 2006 through may 2007 repeatedly found that farmraised seafood imported from china were contaminated with antimicrobial agents antibiotics that are not approved for this use in the united states the agents are nitrofuran malachite green and gentian velvet which have been found to be carcinogenic to laboratory animals and fluoroquinolones which when used in food animals may increase antibiotic resistance in humans the agency said under such an import alert fda detains l covered products until the importing firm demonstrates through testing by an independent laboratory that representative sample of their product is free of these contaminants although the fda has long issued these types of alerts for various imports they generally are more limited in scopefor example to particular firm or product the import alert reiterated that approximately 80 of us seafood consumption is from imports and that over 40 of these imports come from aquaculture operations shrimp and catfish are two of the top 10 most frequently consumed seafood products china is the largest aquaculture producer in the world with 70 of total production and the third largest exporter to the united states the alert observed as the aquaculture industry continues to grow and compete with wildcaught seafood products concerns regarding the use of unapproved animal drugs and unsafe chemicals and the misuse of animal drugs in aquaculture operations have increased substantially g15g142g149g138g150g146g151g142g561g146g151g561g10g158g150g138g151g561g8g152g152g141g156g561 on november 12 2008 fda issued detention without physical examination alert for all milk products milkderived ingredients and finished food products containing milk if they are from china29 in the alert fda stated that these products could be contaminated by melamine andor melamine analogs the substance is an industrial chemical used in the manufacture of plastic including kitchen products countertops and floor tiles when ingested it can crystallize and cause kidney stones and ultimately kidney damage and kidney failure the fda explained that in september 2008 it had become aware of reports that more than 53000 infants had been sickened including 13000 who were hospitalized and four who had died due to consumption of infant formula containing melamine milk used in the formula has been implicated as the source of the melamine added to watereddown bulk milk at collection points in china to inflate the protein content however the problem is not limited to infant formula products chinese government sources also

finished foods dispersed throughout the chinese food supply chain30 in early december 2008 chinese authorities reportedly issued revised estimates indicating that six infants had died and nearly 300000 been sickened after consuming melaminetainted milk products it was reported that 860 babies remain ed hospitalized with kidney or urinarytract problems 154 of them in serious condition31 more than dozen countries throughout asia and europe along with australia and the united states have detected contamination of milkderived ingredients and products with melamine and related contaminant these have included candy and beverages found here by the fda in other countries melamine has been detected in chinesesourced fluid and powdered milk yogurt frozen desserts biscuits cakes and cookies soft candy products chocolates and beverages these are the types of products included in the fda import alert to be released from detention any of these shipments must obtain independent thirdparty laboratory results that they do not contain melamine or cyanuric acid or have documentation that they do not contain milk or milk derived ingredients according to the fda noti ce firm importing such products can request exemption from these testing and documentation re quirementswhich can greatly slow if not completely stop its importsby demonstrating that it has adequate safety controls in place and that it has five consecutive nonviolative shipments the import alert follows an earlier health information advisory issued on september 12 2008 where the fda stated that there is known threat of contamination in infant formulas that have met the requirements to sell such products in the united states fda said that it had been reassured by companies that manufacture infant formula for the us market that they are not importing formula or sourcing milkbased materials from china 32 nonetheless china has been exporting dairy proteins and other products to the united states for some time but at somewhat low levels according to usda trade data china accounted for more than 2 of all us casein imports from january 2007 through july 2008 according to us government study 68 of all casein purchases in 2002 were used here for nondairy food products primarily imitation cheese and coffee creamers fourteen percent were used in specialty nutrition products 9 in other dairy foods and 7 in processed cheese products caseinates are mainly 93 used in specialty nutrition products such as readytodrink beverages drink powders power bars and other forms of sports and medical nutrition applications 33 30 ibid 31 various trade news reports citing figures from chinese ministry of health statement 32 on november 26 2008 the associated press ap reported that the fda had found traces of melamine in samples of us infant formula officials reportedly told the ap that the trace amounts had occurred during manufacturing not intentionally and posed health concerns to date fda tests have found extremely low levels of melamine in one infant formula sample and extremely low levels of cyanuric acid in another the fda subsequently announced on web page melamine contamination in china accessed december 1 2008 the levels were so low well below 1 ppm that they do not pose health risk to infants the fda based this observation on an update of an earlier october 2008 health risk assessment which had previously stated that it cannot establish level of melamine and its analogues in these products that does not raise public health concerns the fda web page accessed on december 1

food and agricultural exporter usda economists had written in 2006 china emerged in the 1990s as lowcost exporter of food products such as vegetables apples seafood and poultry but in recent years chinas exports slowed when shipments of vegetables poultry and shrimp were rejected for failing to meet stringent standards in japan europe and other countries revealing gap between chinese and international food safety standards 34 some analysts have contended that chinas problems in complying with otherusually more developedcountries safety requirements are typical of those faced by most developing countries they point to number of specific obstacles the chinese have encountered in upgrading their safeguards including highly decentralized farm production composed of 200 million households typically farming on plots of one to two noncontiguous acres the difficulty of standardizing and monitoring production practices at the farm production level to which many safety problems can be traced due to widespread noncompliance with existing regulations such as environmental rules heavy use of fertilizers and pesticides to counteract intensively cultivated soils and large pest pressures wide use of antibiotics to control diseases in intensive livestock poultry and aquaculture systems industrialization lax environmental controls and untreated human and animal waste in fields and waters which raise concerns about toxic metal and microbial contaminants in food fragmented marketing system dominated by millions of small firms which handle small volumes often on cash basis with documentation or ability to trace products fragmented regulatory and oversight structure involving 10 national government ministries and little coordination with lower levels of government which often have their own differing standards for food products and for many commodities and industries outdated or nonexistent standards or standards that are inconsistent with internationally accepted ones 35 34 linda calvin et food safety improvements underway in china amber waves november 2006 usda ers the codex alimentarius commission is the major internationa l body for encouraging

center for scholars summarized chinas challenge chinas capacity to effectively protect food quality is hampered by weak legal political and regulatory infrastructure that has not forced food producers and processors to be accountable key weaknesses in chinas food safety governance system include strong local government protectionism of industries lack of product liability law and weak monitoring capacity of food products due both to vast numbers of smallscale food producers and processors and competition among regulating agencies china also lacks an independent court system which could better protect consumers and company whistleblowers consumer education is also lagging in part due to few consumer watchdog organizations 36 the authors noted that contaminated chinese food exports tend to be linked to unsafe use of chemicals including high pesticide use and illegal veterinary drugs in aquaculture37 responsibility for domestic food safety is shared among number of chinese agencies at the national provincial and local levels including the national ministry of agriculture which supervises the quality of primary agricultural products and the ministry of health and the state food and drug administration sfda both with responsibilities in regulating processed foods quality assurance for both imports and exports is under the purview of the general administration for quality supervision inspecti on and quarantine aqsiq which also has oversight over all exports including food and to ys however the ministry of health and the sfda have minimal roles in regulating exports 38 at one 2007 hearing an fda official observed that china has some 400000 food or feed manufacturers from 12000 to 15000 are registered with aqsiq and are therefore eligible to export products yet an estimated onethird of chinas food exports come from nonregistered establishments39 according to another expert china officially has 448000 food enterprises 78 of them cottage industries with 10

the mechanism aims to provide the parties with information to use in judging whether an imported product meets the requirements of the importing country 44 under the agreement china is to require exporters to the united states to register with the chinese aqsiq and to agree to annual inspections to assure that their goods meet us standards aqsiq is to notify fda of those that fail inspection and why and of all companies that have lost their registration status the chinese agency also is to develop both system for tracing products from source of production to point of exportation and statistically valid testing program also under the agreement the two countries are to notify one another within 48 hours of any new public health risks related to food or feed and aqsiq is to facilitate fda access to and inspection of chinese processing and cultivation sites starting with the first phase of implementation aqsiqissued export certificates are to be required of exporters of commodities that have high import refusal rates specifically lowacid canned products or acidified foods pet foods ingredients of food and feed like wheat gluten and rice protein and all farmed seafood

inspectors immediate access to chinese plants several others expressed doubts about chinas willingness or capacity to meet its obligations noting that the government already has strict food standards but has not widely enforced them among other questions are whether the agreement might effectively give unfair preferential treatment for chinese over other foreign imports whether fda will have adequate resources for oversight and enforcement and whether the agency has the appropriate legal authority to share information about us food companies or to demand certificates from foreign importers 46 g17g157g145g142g155g561g5g145g146g151g142g156g142g561g11g151g146g157g146g138g157g146g159g142g156g561 china has cited numerous efforts underway to improve confidence in the safety of its food and drug exports and reassure its own consumers one prominent example is development of new food safety law draft of which was presented to committee of the national peoples congress in december 2007 revised draft circulating in 2008 proposes the creation of an agency under the department of health use of an expert pane l of scientists and stakeholders and development of national risk assessment system food additives would be more stringently regulated among other things the draft would make local governments responsible for oversight of national standards substantially increase penalties for violators establish blacklist for both exporters and domestic importers who distribute unqualified food products and include recall provisions the chinese legislature reportedly began to review the draft law in october 2008 47 other widely reported announcements have included the following reform of the entire chinese dairy industry was announced in late november 2008 following the

on how it wanted to improve food import safety the broader of the two covered the safety of most imports for consumers including but not limited to food this action plan for import safety was prepared for the president by the interagency working group on import safety53 the other report is fdas food protection plan which focused on food whether imported or domestically produced and which contained recommendations for food imports that generally parallel those in the broader report 54 both plans were oriented toward assessing and prioritizing risks regardless of where they occur starting with products origin and preventing rather than waiting for problems to occur both plans appeared to rely heavily on cooperation with others including private industry stakeholders and foreign governments to assure safety but they also would require some new regulations and in number of areas new legislative authorities which would affect importers as well as others in the food system 50 see for

products fresh produce and seafood t his is not to suggest that food imported into the united states as whole poses greater food safety risk than domestically produced food but increases in the volume

critics among them the government accountability office gao consumer organizations and the chair of the house appropriations subcommittee on agriculture have complained that the bush administration failed to provide enough details on the various initiatives including their costs and how they in tended to implement them some criticized both the food safety and import plans as largely collection of objectives lacking resources andor enforcement controls to be effective or otherwise inadequate the fda released in early december 2008 oneyear progress report on its plan taking note of number of accomplishments including the establishment of the first overseas officesthree in china in november 2008 55 the fda also intends to open permanent offices in other foreign countries throughout the world as part of an effort to build and maintain relationships with regulators and companies in those countries and to discourage their export of substandard foods and drugs in the first place56 consumer advocacy organizations expressed skepticism about fdas progress and again challenged the basic plan itself which they asserted does not fundamentally change flawed us food safety system specifically they questioned the potential impacts of opening offices in china and other countries suggesting that the offices might be window dressing one consumer advocate expressed uncertainty about whether china will cooperate with us officials there food safety expert indicated that to be more effective those officials should be skilled at and tasked with conducting inspections for

focusing on food safety with separate import title was s 3385 introduced july 31 2008 by senator durbin among other relevant panels are the house and senate agriculture committees where usda related food safety bills are referred and the appropriations committees which recommend the annual funding for such initiatives if and when these or similar bills are introduced into the 111th congress they could become the chief vehicles for the next round of food safety legislationwhich is widely anticipated to begin in the first session the following selected issues an d options are expected to

legislative option which would have affected importers directly was specific authorization for fda to require import certificat for shippers andor shipments of products prior to their arrival in the united states fda s current statute does not expressly offer this authority the bush administrations plan for example called for electronic certificates for products deemed to be of high risk ie those products that have been shown to pose threat to public health for us consumers and thus would be unlike other imports where there is such showing of risk for such products fda would have to negotiate and implement government togovernment agreements whereby an importer would obtain certificates from either the appropriate foreign agency or an accredited third party this new certification system which appeared to be based at least in part on the concept of the fsis foreign equivalency determinations presumably would have to be consistent with international trade obligations the kennedy draft bill would have authorized but not required the hhs secretary to require an electronic certification by the competent regulatory authority of the exporting country that food shipment entering the united states meets fda food safety standards hhs would have been required to notify the secretary of homeland security of any such requirement who in turn must deny the importation of an item that lacks certification the dingell draft would have required the hhs secretary to establish program for accreditation of foreign governments state or regional food authorities foreign or domestic cooperatives or other appropriate third parties to certify food facilities under the certification program which could be limited to specific food types hhs ie fda would first have to evalua the foreign governments food safety system among other dingell provisions the durbin bill s 3385 contained authority for the secretary to require certifications from qualified entities for foods deemed to be of high risk from countries with which fda has an agreement for such program foods that require such certificate but lack it would have been denied import entry under s 3385 number of other food safety bills also proposed that importing establishments andor the foreign countries in which they are located first receive formal certification from us authorities that their food safety systems demonstrably provide at least the same level of safety assurances as the us system under some of these bills certification could have been denied or revoked if foreign safeguards are found to be insufficient unsafe imports are discovered or foodborne illnesses are linked to such products

warrant or initiate criminal proceedings if it is denied entryauthorities it lacks for overseas establishments some including the bush administration proposed that to provide parity between domestic and imported foods authority should be enacted enabling fda to block imports of foods by foreign firms that impede entry to their facilities that produce process or hold such foods s 3385 for example would have authorized the secretary to enter into agreements with other governments that would enable such inspections imports from facilities that impede such inspections would be refused entry

fda requested mandatory recall authority in cases where firms whether foreign or domestic are unwilling to do so voluntarily or expeditiously the agency noted that it already has the authority to seize adulterated or misbranded food but that may not be practical once product is in wide distribution the agency also was seeking authority to give it more access to records in cases of food emergencies significantly ma jor food industry group the grocery manufacturers association gma endors ed the proposal for mandatory recall authority 58 the day after the bush administration proposed it for fda usda official asserted that the department does not need similar mandatory recall authority for the meat and poultry products it regulates responding to questions on whether he would request such authority he stated that usda already has sufficient enforcement tools and that the voluntary approach now in place works well 59 others however continue to seek it for usda regulated foods and several bills in the 110th congress reflected this proposed change60 the dingell and kennedy drafts both contained authority for fda to require recall if person or firm fails to do so voluntarily although the details of this authority differed among the bills

testing at the border or within other countries and to authorize more research into inspection and testing technologies some wanted fda or another public health agency to undertake more of these activities however some proposals including the bush administrations sought authority for fda accreditation of qualified third parties to conduct some types of inspections and testing both the dingell and kennedy drafts also involved thirdparty certification for certain types of inspection andor testing as did s 3385 conceptually under thirdparty approach fda might officially certify qualified private companies professional organizations or governmental agencies whether foreign state or local which importers could in turn use and presumably pay service fee to certify the safety of their products using prescribed tests inspection regimes or other fdaissued criteria according to proponents socalled thir dparty accreditation could help to address fda 58 gma applauds bush administrations

regardless of the policy approach adopted additional resources are needed to adequately address import safety problems according to report released in early december 2007 by the fda science board the fda commissioners expert advisory panel critical lack of resources has seriously weakened the fdas scientific basis generally and its mission to protect the food supply particularly the panel noted that the fda was unable to sufficiently monitor either the tremendous volume of products manufactured domestically or the exponential growth of imported products during th past 35 years the decrease in fda funding for inspection of our food supply has forced fda to impose 78 percent reduction in food inspections at time when the food industry has been rapidly expanding and food importation has exponentially increased as noted the science board recommended that the overall fda appropriation not just for food be more than doubled over the next several years from its fy2008 level of approximately 15 billion exclusive of user fees 62 fda and fsis receive most of their funding throug h the annual agriculture rural development food and drug administration and related agenci appropriations act however requests for higher appropriations must co mpete with other priorities throughout the federal discretionary budget an alternative to fill perceived shortfalls through new user fees on the food industry always meets with resistance both from the companies that would have to absorb such costs and from consumer advocates who have long argued that industry funds might taint programs that are first and foremost public health programs 63 nonetheless number of food safety bills have included proposed user or other types of fees to pay for such new activities as certification of food imports reinspection of products initially kept out of commerce and the auditing of private food testing laboratories for example the dingell draft would have required importers of food drugs and other fdaregulated products to register and pay an annual fee of 10000 the kennedy draft also would have provided for various registration and certification fees
