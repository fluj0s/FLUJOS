specialist in terrorism and national security foreign affairs defense and trade division 20082009 presidential transition national security considerations and options summary presidential transition is unique time in america and holds the promise of opportunity as well as possible risk to the nations security interests the 2008 2009 election marks the first presidential transition in the post911 era and is of concern to many national security observers while changes in administration during us involvement in national security related activities are not unique to the 2008 2009 election many observers suggest that the current security climate and recent acts of terrorism by individuals wishing to influence national elections and change foreign policies portend time of increased risk to the current presidential transition period whether the enemies of the united states choose to undertake action that may harm the nations security interests during the 20082009 election or the new president experiences relatively peaceful period during the transition many foreign and domestic policy and security challenges will await the new administration how the new president recognizes and responds to these challenges will depend heavily on the planning and learning that occurs prior to the inauguration actions can be taken by the outgoing president and presidentelect that may ameliorate decision making activities in the new administration whether an incident of national security significance occurs just before or soon after the presidential transition the actions or inactions of the outgoing administration may have longlasting effect on the new presidents ability to effectively safeguard us interests and may affect the legacy of the outgoing president this report

security considerations during presidential transitions in chronological order 19632008 47 20082009 presidential transition national security considerations and options introduction presidential transition the period from campaigning through placement of new administration personnel is unique time in american politics and holds the promise of opportunity as well as real or perceived vulnerability1 to our nations security interests on given day the outgoing administration has the ability to change the policies of nation and possibly affect the international security environment yet the following day the president and the national security leadership team are replaced by new set of leaders who may have very different strategy and policy goals2 this political dynamic coupled with the inherent uncertainty accompanying presidential transfer of power may provide target of opportunity that may be too enticing to resist by those who wish to harm us security interests unlike other manmade incidents that may occur with little warning the presidential transition offers broadly defined time frame in which an enemy of the united states3 may decide to undertake an incident of national security significance4 with the 1 throughout this report numerous references are made to the nations increased vulnerability during times of presidential transition vulnerability is the manifestation of potential threat to inflict harm to an area that is not properly defended cannot be completely defended or is indefensible better representation of the environment the us may face during the presidential transition is the degree to which the nation is at riskr r is the product of weighting and multiplying the threat t vulnerability v and consequences c of an incident tvcr ts directed at the electoral process may become known by the federal intelligence community or the federation of national intelligence activities the nations v to national securityrelated incident may be increased or decreased based on the targets chosen by enemies of the united states c however could range from minor to significant based on the severity of an incident and its proximity to the five phases of the transition period 2 the law of presidential transitions boston school of law working paper william p marshal and jack m beerman 2005 the outgoing president retains all the formal legal powers of the presidency yet his last electoral success is four years removed and his political capital is at low ebb the outgoing president will want to protect his policies or accomplishments from being reversed or undermined and may also want to create obstacles to prevent his successor from too quickly achieving political and policy success the incoming president on the other hand will be focused on beginning her own initiatives and may desire to expeditiously reverse the policies of the previous president when the incoming and outgoing presidents are from opposing political parties the conflicts during the transition period may be even more acute 3 enemies that pose risk to the united states may emanate domestically and internationally and take the form of foreign and american citizens who are aligned with nation states continued crs2 hope of manipulating the electoral process or changing the nations foreign and domestic policies presidential transitions during times of us involvement in military operations and national securityrelated activities5 are not unique to the 20082009 presidential transition period see appendix a6 however based on the current international security environment and recent attempts to disrupt transfers of power in other countries many observers see the united states as lurching toward period of uncertainty and increased risk see appendix b while the mere presence of upcoming presidential transition does not ensure an incident of national security significance will occur security experts argue that this window of potential risk is not lost on the enemies of the united states at present the intelligence community assesses that alqaida will increase the frequency sophistication timeliness and western targeting of its propaganda statements as the united states advances toward the presidential election7 while many terrorism experts are concerned about the internal and external threats to the united states during the presidential transition period the intelligence community is uncertain what impact terrorist propaganda statements will have on the western muslim community and other individuals who are alqaedas primary target audience8 according to presidential transitionrelated report provided to the department of homeland security dhs by the homeland security advisory committee hsac briefings research and recent history have provided an appreciation of the potential vulnerabilities during transition periods not only are we united states 3 continued groups or individuals that pledge allegiance or undertake action adverse to us interests 4 while an incident of national security significance could entail catastrophic natural disaster this term for purposes of this paper is used to describe foreign and domestic securityrelated manmade acts including terrorist attack in the united states against interests overseas or against an ally significant offensive action against troops deployed overseas assassination of us or foreign leader seizure of an embassy change in the political environment where the us is undertaking stabilization activities significant foreign power nuclearrelated activity or foreign power or extremist group taking military action against an ally of the us 5 for purposes of this report national security activities encompass all aspects of united states foreign and domestic policy and operations responsible for safeguarding national security interests 6 for purposes of this report the presidential transition period is comprised of five phases extending from presidential campaigning activities to the newly elected presidents formation of national security team and production of accompanying strategies and policies the five phases of the presidential transition period will be discussed later in this report 7 alqaidas 2007 media campaign dhsfbi joint homeland security assessment february 11 2008 congressional quarterlyhomeland security 8 ibid crs3 aware that vulnerabilities exist but our enemies are as well9 as observed by frances townsend former homeland security and counterterrorism advisor to president george w bush10 i worry about the period of vulnerability between the time we have nominees for each party through and just after the inauguration of new president i think thats particular period of vulnerability because of what we know about qaedas attempts to influence the elections in spain weve seen the attacks after gordon brown took over as prime minister in the uk we see in the 2004 election where they were issuing videos days before the united states election including bin laden talking about the streets in the united states running with blood we know from their history that qaeda wants to influence elections and have political influence the executive branch is not alone in attempting to ensure the country passes power from one administration to the next in safe and thoughtful manner11 however the outgoing and incoming administrations are viewed as primarily responsible for addressing risks to the nation and taking actions to prevent and respond to any incident that may affect the electoral process whether the enemies of the united states choose to undertake action that may harm national security interests during this period of transition or the new president experiences relative peaceful period shortly after entering office many national security issues will be awaiting the new administration how the newly elected president recognizes and responds to these challenges will depend heavily upon the planning and learning that takes place during the transition from one administration to another12 during recent presidential transitions13 the current and incoming administrations and 9 report of the

2001 edition pp 67 13 president harry s truman is often credited with establishing the tradition of the outgoing president offering administration transitionrelated assistance to the incoming administration he directed each agency leader to provide him report on activities related to transitioning the new administration into power shortly after the election of dwight eisenhower president truman invited him to meeting at the white house to discuss among other concerns national securityrelated issues prior to president trumans actions and the subsequent enactment of the presidential transition act of 1963 presidential continued crs4 congress have traditionally undertaken numerous activities to facilitate smooth transfer of executive branch power some of the actions often taken during presidential transitions include consulting with government and private sector experts who have presidential transition expertise providing information to the presidentelect after the election and prior to the inauguration offering operational briefings on ongoing national security matters to prospective presidential nominees and their staff preparing briefings books and policy memos detailing the issues of most concern to the current administration and expediting security clearances for presidentelect transition team members other activities that the current and incoming administrations and congress may wish to consider undertaking during the presidential transition period include undertaking public outreach efforts to discuss possible risks to the nation involving the national security representatives of presidential hopefuls in all transitionrelated discussions establishing joint advisory councils responsible for addressing all transitionrelated risks requiring the director of national intelligence dni to undertake efforts to support the nations awareness of risks reflecting the national security priorities of the new administration in the 2009 budget passing the fy2009 appropriations without undue delay quickly assigning newly elected and existing members of congress to committees focused on national security holding hearings comprised of national security experts to gather ideas on prospective us national security policies and goals and holding hearings soon after the inauguration of the new president to determine the administrations national securityrelated priorities national security issues the next administration is likely to encounter the next administration is likely to face many national security challenges on taking office some security experts suggest that the presidential transition period of 20082009 may be unique given the quantity diversity and breadth of security 13 continued transition activities rarely focused on substantive issues the presidential transition act of 1963 pl 88277 was enacted on march 7 1964 and codified at 3 usc 102 for more indepth discussion of historical presidential transition processes and activities see crs report rl30736 presidential transitions by stephanie smith crs5 risks confronting the nation the incoming administration is likely to face three distinct types of national security challenges that could translate into short and long term national security risks for purposes of this report the national security challenges the next administration might face include the following current us military engagements iraq afghanistan and other military support or training activities related to the global war on terrorism and counterproliferation efforts risks posed in countries and regions of concern iran north korea russia china republic of serbia venezuela cuba and the middle east and risks associated with contemporary issues the role of us foreign policy in international security matters the role of the military in nationbuilding activities and diplomatic endeavors international terrorism nonproliferation and homeland security while the issues are not exhaustive and may not require the same level of attention and priority based on the new administrations foreign and domestic security objectives time devoted to understanding these and other challenges prior to the inauguration to may better prepare the newly elected president to make well reasoned decisions on assuming office the presidential transition period many presidential historians argue that during the early days of the new administration the knowledge and decisionmaking activities will in part be based on information provided by the outgoing administration with the presidential transition period running from the formal announcement of candidates for the office of the presidency to long past the inauguration14 members of the current administration and potential incoming administration may wish to initiate substantive transition activities in an efficient and productive manner as soon as possible15 specifically some scholars state that enhanced cooperation and communication between the two administrations is demanded by national security and foreign policy concerns16 it is further observed that as the world becomes 14 ibid after the inauguration difficult situations can also arise when new and untested administration faces sudden crisis and emergency 15 the law of presidential transitions boston school of law working paper william p marshal and jack m beerman 2005 for number of reasons there is now greater need than any time in our nations history for incoming and outgoing administrations to work cooperatively during transitions periods to begin with government is more complex and an incoming administration faces an inestimable learning curve in assuming office and digesting the mounds of information necessary to be able to understand the powers at its disposal and govern effectively 16 todd j zywicki the law of presidential transitions and the 2000 election 2001 continued crs6 more dangerous and the risks to harm more immediate the need for effective and seamless transitions becomes correspondingly greater17 thus with respect to national security issues in particular the need for outgoing and incoming presidents to work together is longer an option but an unavoidable demand of the contemporary world18 considerations and options that span the presidential transition period throughout the entire presidential transition period number of national securityrelated concerns and opportunities may be presented to the incoming and outgoing administrations even under the best of circumstances the sitting president and presidentelect may encounter unexpected issues that can lead to decision making perils however many observers argue that the national securityrelated collaborative efforts of the current administration and members of the potential new administration coupled with oversight activities throughout the transition period offer the nation the best hope of being prepared to recognize and respond to acts taken to disrupt the transfer of power or change us policies congress may wish to request classified and unclassified hearings and reports regarding the administrations knowledge and efforts related to the following issues possible actions by entities wishing to disrupt the presidential transition period threats to the 20082009 presidential election may be numerous with dangers associated with the transition emanating both from within the homeland and internationally19 some national security observers are convinced that terrorist group will take action against united stares interests during the presidential transition period20 it is argued that enemies of the us may see the nation as physically and politically vulnerable and that disseminating threatening propaganda or undertaking an incident of national security significance during the election period would likely result in change in the election results or future policies statements or incidents may be undertaken with the desire to demonstrate groups ability to reestablish its status as an entity to be feared21 intimidate the 16 continued byul rev 1573 2001 17 ibid 18 the law of presidential transitions boston

korade april 4 2008 in response to question about alqaedas troubles continued crs7 voting public suggest perceived weaknesses in given candidates national security position22 change the results of the election or change future us policies many national security observers speculate that if an incident of national security significance is to occur enemies of the united states would prefer to take action just prior to the presidential election date however such acts at anytime during the presidential transition period could have desired and unintended effects on the presidential election and resulting policies23 conversely while many national security experts speculate that qaeda other extremist groups and some foreign powers may see the presidential transition period as desirable time to undertake action against us interests the mere fact that such activity occurs may not necessarily indicate that the act was committed with the desire to manipulate the results of the election the timing of such acts may be solely based on the convergence of an entity attaining desired capability with perceived best opportunity to successfully complete its objective post 911 national securityfocused organizations one factor complicating the 20082009 transition is the recent establishment of numerous new national security agencies with responsibilities for preventing future terrorist attacks or harms to us interests24 these organizations have not undergone presidential transition and may see many political appointees depart federal government service prior to the inauguration of the next president also the organizations that existed during the last presidential transition and the new agencies may have employed many new personnel who are not wellversed in addressing matters of national security during times of presidential transition additionally organizations that predate the attacks of september 11 2001 and that previously had national security 21 continued in maintaining support for it organization panel members noted that the possible decline in followers coupled with the upcoming presidential election could be potent mix for group desperate to reassert its relevancy 22 kerry says bin laden tape gave bush lift new york times adam nagourney january 31 2005 senator john kerry said on sunday that the attacks of sept 11 were the central deciding thing in his contest with president bush and that the release of an osama bin laden videotape the weekend before election day had effectively erased any hope he had of victory 23 for example while the terrorist attacks of march 2004 did appear to have an affect on the election outcome and the spanish governments support of military actions in iraq the new prime minister actually increased spains commitment to counterterrorism military efforts in afghanistan it is speculated that while the tactical operation may have been success the longterm results of the attack were counter to the strategic desires of the terrorist group it may also be worth noting that an incident occurring during the transition period may have relatively shortterm minor effect on targeted country based in sound principle and engendering resilient societal behavior while the shortterm affects of an attack may change the outcome of an election or current policies the attack may have little longterm impact on countrys societal mores and desire for customary transfer of national power 24 examples of federal government organizations with significant national security responsibilities that were established post 911 include the homeland security council the dhs the office of the director of national intelligence and the national counter terrorism center crs8 responsibilities may be asked to devote additional attention and resources to presidential transitionrelated issues25 based on the length of time between the previous presidential transition the departure of senior political and career officials and the influx of new personnel addressing national security issues it is possible that some federal agencies may not be properly anticipating the attention required or resources needed to support the incoming administrations preparation and policy familiarization efforts26 some security observers contend that if proper planning has not occurred efforts to support the incoming administration may require personnel and resources to be transferred this reallocation could detract from ongoing national security related activities and possibly place the nation at risk cog and coop concerns in may 2007 president bush signed presidential directives focused on continuity of government cog and continuity of operations coop procedures during times of crisis27 contained in these directives was provision describing the national essential functions that are to be continued to support the perseverance of the us government during times of crisis in recognizing the importance to plan for unforeseeable events that may effect the functioning of the nation the directives identified need for cooperative effort among the executive legislative and judicial branches of the federal government to preserve the constitutional framework under which the nation is governed and to execute constitutional responsibilities and provide for orderly succession appropriate transition of leadership and interoperability and support of the national essential functions during catastrophic emergency28 some security observers contend that the outgoing and incoming administrations may wish to coordinate closely throughout the presidential transition period on these two activities planning for the unforeseen and communicating transition related information to the american public during previous presidential elections some officials in the federal government have seen the need to address and plan for options that might be considered should the presidential election be delayed while noting federal election dates are set by law requiring congressional action to change the current schedule deforest soaries former chairperson of the united 25 its busy and costly presidential election cycle for the secret service cq homeland security rob margetta april 3 2008 26 examples of federal government organizations that could have current national security activities adversely affected by the need to assist incoming administration transition efforts include the department of defense the state department 16 intelligence community organizations and the us secret service an organization within the dhs 27 the term continuity of government is defined as coordinated effort within the federal governments executive branch to ensure that national essential functions continue to be performed during catastrophic emergency continuity of operations is defined as an effort within individual executive departments and agencies to ensure that primary mission essential functions

federal interagency structure provide assistance to federal state and local governments by collaborating on plan to address voting options should terrorist attack occur around the time of the election29 many security experts argue that federal state and local electioncontingency planning and coordination should occur during the early phases of the transition period it is further suggested that barring such discussions the issuance of general guidelines or genuine effort toward collaboration the prospects for electoral chaos might occur should an incident of national security significance take place just before or on the date of election during all phases of the presidential transition process many national security experts suspect the federal government will receive information that heightens the risks to us national security interests that may be in part based on activities by enemies of the united states attempting to influence the upcoming election30 should such heightened risk environment occur some observers suggest that one of the best ways to meet this challenge is by showing of national unity among the outgoing administration and individuals vying for the presidency to support collegial and collaborative environment the homeland security advisory council hsac suggests the nominees issue joint statement addressing potential threats to the nation or in response to an incident of national significance31 some foreign policy experts suggest joint statements and activities by the current president and the prospective presidentselect take place with regularity to put forth common voice to both the american public and the enemies of the united states that security issues will be addressed in unified and coordinated manner throughout the

security advisory council january 2008 httpwwwdhsgovxlibraryassetshsac_attf_reportpdf crs10 provide confidence to concerned voting public activities such as this may prove useful in preparing the voting public to be aware of the possibility of an incident of national security significance occurring during the presidential transition period and also may lower the anxiety of citizens planning on participating in the electoral process with respect to securityrelated issues in the homeland many observers argue that awareness on the part of the citizenry offers the best opportunity to provide indicators of anomalies that might be indicative of groups preparation to undertake criminal activity to affect the presidential election process to this degree the dhs hsac contends that continuous interaction with the media32 and the public regarding potential threats during this time period will maximize the chances of having nation prepared for harmful activities that may occur during any phase of the presidential transition the dhs hsac specifically opined it is important that the american public become engaged in understanding the unique vulnerabilities posed by this transition period this will require public education and media engagement during this critical period in our history before during and after the transition the public must learn about the choices faced by the nation communities families and individuals the public must become partner with their government sharing the burden in addition dhs should continue to engage the media as an ally in the timely dissemination of accurate and actionable information dhs must work with the multiple messengers trusted within diverse communities to effectively communicate this information33 the dhs has the responsibility to notify the american public of current or prospective threats to us domestic security interests34 and the department of state has the responsibility to alert us citizens located overseas of security related concerns both organizations have numerous communication mechanisms to inform us citizens and organizations regarding concerns related to the presidential transition period and when required to share threat information communication 32 it should be noted that numerous reports have been written about the alqaedas use of the media to bring attention to the organization similarly while directly related to the upcoming united states presidential transition recently major general john f kelly of the 1st marine expeditionary force in iraq stated that there are indications that they alqaeda in iraq may change their tactics and do some bigger events that capture the attention of the world through the media sara carter united states general warns of bigger attacks in iraq washington times march 11 2008 many security observers suggest that significant attack occurring on united states forces deployed overseas just before or after the election may be undertaken to influence the results of the election or test new administrations policies and response 33 report of the administration transition task force homeland security advisory council january

act of 2007pl 11053 6 usc 124 assigns the secretary of dhs has primary responsibility for providing warning regarding threats or risk from acts of terrorism in the homeland however it is common for the fbi or dhs and the fbi to make statement or disseminate joint bulletin regarding security issues of concern crs11 mechanisms for conveying information about the presidential transition period include department of homeland security official public announcements to the media public service announcements changes to the homeland security advisory system dissemination of information to state and local fusion centers and to private sector organizations and posting information to dhs managed websites department of state official public announcements to the media warden system alerts35 travel alerts country specific warnings country background notes and posting information to state department managed websites considerations and options unique to each phase of the presidential transition period modern presidential transition activities are longer constrained to the time between the election and inauguration36 some presidential historians argue that history tells us that any winning candidate who has not started transition efforts at least six months before the election will be woefully behind come the day after the election day37 while the time period and phases of presidential transition are not statutorily derived for purposes of this paper the presidential transition period is comprised of five phases extending from presidential campaigning activities to the new presidents establishment of national security team and accompanying strategies and policies each phase identifies issues to consider by the outgoing and incoming administrations and the congress38 the phases of the presidential transition are as follows phase 1 campaigning by presidential candidates phase 2 selection of party nominees phase 3 election day 35 the warden system allows americans overseas to receive security warnings and other important notices as quickly as possible wardens are american citizens who will contact other americans with relevant information from the embassy or

httptransition2008wordpresscom 38 transitions in american government power are not reserved for the executive branch congressional elections and changes in state and local leadership are also occasions where individuals wishing to harm us national security interests could place the nation at risk while the focus of this paper is on security implications during presidential transition it is acknowledged that planning prevention preparedness response and recovery activities could also be hampered should an incident of national security concern occur during congressional or nonfederal government election period crs12 phase 4 post election day to prior to the inauguration phase 5 presidential inauguration to formation of the new administrations national security team and issuance of policy directives phase 1 campaigning by presidential candidates phase 1 of the presidential transition includes the time frame from campaigning by presidential hopefuls to the national political conventions that officially select the party nominees39 this period can last few months to year or longer depending on number of factors including the current presidents desires and constitutional ability to run for reelection the plans of individuals from the same party as that of the sitting president to challenge the presidents reelection bid and the opposing partys time frame for launching unofficial or official presidential nomination activities outgoing administration considerations and options number of activities can occur during the first phase of presidential transition activities that would benefit the incoming president and may prove useful toward providing continuity with respect to us national security matters as noted in the homeland security advisory council presidential transition report it is important that dhs take action now to ensure seamless and agile transition to new leadership and optimize the new leaderships ability to assume operational control of the department40 recommendations offered by the advisory council that could be undertaken during the first phase of the transition include clarifying the meaning of heightened threat during the transition period by notifying all homeland security partners of historical patterns developing contingency plans around the homeland security themes of prevent prepare respond and recover providing prospective presidential nominees information regarding lessons learned from incidents occurring during previous leadership transitions and offering operational briefings on ongoing national security matters to prospective presidential nominees and their staff the current administration may wish to consider initiating information exchanges and collaborative efforts with the major party candidates in this the earliest phase of the transition generally speaking as the campaign for president progresses through the spring and leading up to the presidential conventions relatively few leading candidates will emerge as viable contenders for gaining the nomination of given political party the current administration could bring this 39 the field of presidential hopefuls may be winnowed down during this process with individuals emerging as the facto party nominee prior to being officially acknowledged as such by the represented political party 26 usc section 9002 defines major party as political party whose candidate for the office of president in the preceding presidential election received 25 percent or more of the total number of popular votes received by all candidates for such office 40 report of the administration transition task force homeland security advisory council january 2008 httpwwwdhsgovxlibraryassetshsac_attf_reportpdf crs13 relatively few number of individuals and their designated senior national security staff into briefings and discussions regarding national security issues that will likely be of concern to incoming administrations as stated by the former homeland security advisor and counterterrorism advisor to president george w bush over the next 12 months the current administration has special obligation to have far more robust transition plan in post911 world than weve ever seen before41 an issue of concern to some presidential transition observers is the turnover of personnel occupying key positions in the federal government there are over 7000 federal government leadership management and support positions that are non competitively filled by political appointees42 some observers suggest that many of the 7000 positions have as part of their primary function national security responsibilities should large numbers of political appointees depart in the months preceding the inauguration the federal government would likely rely on senior executive service personnel career diplomats senior military officers and senior generalschedule employees for continuity of operations leadership and management of most national security related activities while the occupation of senior policy positions by career government employees may not necessarily be problem number of considerations arise in such an environment appointing career civil servants to mid to highlevel positions in federal departments and agencies has been offered by national security observers as way to provide continuity during presidential transitions43 this action may allow agencies to operate without interruption and provide the new congressionally confirmed or presidentially appointed agency directors with inhouse expertise and historical context about the organization as proponent of converting some of the federal governments national security leadership positions to career civil servants dhs acting deputy secretary schneider noted its important to realize that major terrorist attacks both here and abroad are often launched shortly before or after national elections or inaugurations by promoting dedicated civil servants whove proven their mettle

national security and foreign policy matters with senior national security advisors and cabinet officials46 whereas as the homeland security councils hsc purpose is to ensure coordination of all homeland securityrelated activities among executive departments and agencies and to promote the effective development and implementation of all homeland security policies47 the current administration might consider establishing joint advisory council that draws on the expertise and experience of both the nsc and hsc to assist with transition issues this new body could be comprised of political and career staff from the nsc and hsc outside experts with transition expertise and members of the prospective presidentelects national security team organizational responsibilities could include coordinating the presidential transition policies of agencies having national security missions in assisting the transition process the entity could attempt to ensure presidential transition period activities are coordinated in an interagency manner and are cognizant of the effects current efforts may have on new administration if so desired by the presidentelect this organization could continue

congressional research service january 18 2008 54 conversation with senior administration official december 2007 crs16 deal of time addressing transitionrelated issues55 in consideration of some work already being pursued at dhs and in making new recommendations the hsac presidential transition report proposed that the following issue areas be addressed during the departments transition threat leadership congressional oversight policy operations succession and training56 while many national security observers found the report to be good effort at addressing transition related issues that require the focus of dhs others argue that the report fell short of meeting the needs of all facets of the transition period57 specifically some national security observers argued that the options put forth were to narrow in scope and found the report lacking in the following areas too much focus on outgoing administration efforts and too little attention given to the activities related to preparing the incoming administration for the challenges it will likely face too much emphasis on the administrative process of transitioning to new administration rather than ensuring incoming administration employees are cognizant of current and projected substantive homeland security issues likely to be faced during the first year of the presidency discussion of how state local tribal and private sector leaders with homeland security responsibilities should prepare for activities related to the upcoming presidential administration transition little detail provided on how training education and exercise activities can be used to prepare incoming administration officials with national security responsibilities to be better prepared to meet current and future challenges and discussion or apparent plans to use the members of the hsac task force to provide assistance or support to incoming administration homeland security leaders58 what is unclear is whether the transitionrelated efforts pursued by dhs or recommended by the hsac are being undertaken by other federal agencies with national security responsibilities also unclear is the role if any of nonfederal entities with security responsibilities and members of the prospective presidential candidates national security teams in participating in the current administrations transition planning efforts current administration officials responsible for 55 pressure points for the department of homeland security congressional quarterly homeland security weekly edition october 22 2007 56 while the hsac exclusively efforts focused on assisting dhs transition efforts many of the findings and recommendations are considered to be relevant to other organizations with national security responsibilities 57 it should be noted that the objective of the hsac presidential transition report was to provide recommendations to the current dhs secretary on matters related to homeland security the report did not focus on issues of possible concern to the incoming administrations nominee for secretary of the dhs and does not address transition issues that may be relevant to other federal departments or agencies 58 conversation with senior administration official and members of the hsac task force march 2008 crs17 interagency coordination activities have stated that they have and will continue to undertake number of transition efforts designed for the next administrations national security leaders59 the stated focus of these efforts include meeting with government and private sector experts who have presidential transition expertise preparing briefings books and policy memos detailing the issues of most concern to the current administration and developing interagency policy coordination reference manuals60 senior administration officials also stated that after election day and prior to the inauguration the current administration plans to offer the incoming administrations national security team the opportunity to attend exercises focused on understanding and testing national security coordination capabilities61 while this idea may have merit some argue that in order for such an activity to be useful to the incoming administration early participation by members of the prospective presidentelects national security team should be included in initial discussions of designing the parameters of these exercises some national security observers are concerned about the selection of the issues that the current administration decides to use as the basis for the incoming administrations exercise activities some suggest that the exercises should focus on catastrophic issues nuclear terrorism at home or abroad major natural disaster major offensive against deployed military forces or some other significant national security incident others opine that the most likely noncatastrophic scenarios should be used as basis of these exercises increased threat environment detonation of an improvised explosive device in the homeland or some less significant incident regardless of the scenario it does not appear that the goals of the exercises are to convey sense of subject matter expertise on topic or design the perfect prevention or response plan for each possible incident that might affect united states interests rather the training appears to be focused on assisting the incoming national security team members to understand united states national security capabilities and limitations and how the federal governments interagency team might coordinate activities in heightened risk environment congressional considerations and options some national security observers see congressional interest in and support of presidential transitions as crucial aspect of orderly transfers of power in the executive branch others argue that congress should confine its activities to simply providing the funds necessary to support the transfer of presidential authority and act quickly to confirm the president elects nominated senior leadership team regardless of the level of involvement in the presidential transition desired by the incoming and outgoing administrations congressional leaders have already voiced concern about the upcoming election period and noted desire to provide oversight and resources to support the change of administrations62 some

the known and projected risks during the transition period and providing sense of the congress resolution that notes the importance of effective and collaborative activities between the departing administration and the incoming administration congress may also wish for the current administration to provide the names of agency leaders responsible for making national security related decisions during the presidential transition period briefings on the possible risks to the presidential transition process information about the significant national security operations that will be ongoing during the transfer of power and briefing about the administrations efforts to engage and collaborate with prospective new administration senior security officials congress may also consider addressing the upcoming presidential transition with legislation requiring the outgoing administration to refrain from activities that could commit the next administration to national security actions

national security observers expect that members of congress will increase the number of questions posed to current national security leaders about plans to support the presidential transition period and require more specificity with respect to current and future planning efforts67 phase 2 selection of party nominee phase 2 of the presidential transition includes the time frame from the selection

time when the specter of increased risks to the nation is heightened officials at all levels of government may become concerned about national security interests being affected during the time leading up to election day it is possible that the current administration may consider undertaking military or law enforcementrelated actions during this time to prevent group from disrupting the election or threatening national security interests such actions while possibly needed to safeguarded the nations security interest are often the source of frustration as some question the veracity of the threat information and the need for related preventative actions some see these activities as pursued purely for political purposes others argue that the current national security leaders are placed in an unenviable position of trying to protect national security interests during times of heightened political skepticism69 with the field of potential presidential candidates likely reduced to two major party candidates the outgoing administration may wish to consider continuing the historical pattern of routinely providing presidential nominees and their senior staff information and briefings on matters of national security scholars who follow matters of national security note that in the preelection period it has proved feasible and desirable to provide intelligence briefings to candidates from both or even multiple political parties for the most part this has been done and it should certainly be continued70 incoming administration considerations and options section 7601 c2 of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 irtpa pl 108458 50 usc 435b allows each major party candidate for president to submit before the date of the general election requests for security clearances of prospective transition team members who will require access to classified information to carry out their responsibilities as member of the presidentelects transition team the act further states that to the fullest extent practicable necessary background investigations and eligibility determinations of prospective transition team members shall be completed by the day after the date of the general election during phase 2 of presidential transition activities the prospective presidents and their staffs will likely undertake efforts to fully understand current united states national security policies and related operational activities and may request meetings with current administration security officials completion of security clearance reviews for relevant personnel would greatly assist these efforts congressional considerations and options during phase 2 of the federal transfer of executive branch power congress may desire to provide resources to

responsibilities some national security observers are concerned that lack of sufficient coordination and planning between federal and state security entities could affect the presidential electoral results should an incident of national security significance occur prior to or on election day71 in addition to providing funds to the incoming and outgoing administrations to support transition related activities including national security related support provided by departments and agencies congress may wish to provide resources to nonfederal entities responsible for safeguarding the homeland during the presidential transition just as all homeland security issues emanate from local community an incident occurring in the united states will initially be managed by local responders72 whether its manmade incident or natural disaster some scholars state that all levels of government may wish to consider the constitutional73 and practical options74 that would facilitate transfer of power in the event domestic security incident occurs prior to or on the day of election75 with possibility of decisionmaking paralysis during phase two due to the departure of key national security personnel prior to the election and acting directors assigned to positions of significant responsibility having uncertainty about agency roles and capabilities federal prevention response and recovery

httpwwwfemagovpdfemergencynrfnrfcorepdf 73 some security experts are concerned about state governments ability to ensure federal elections occur in the event of an incident of national security significance should such an event occur on the day of the election many options are available to allow the election to continue including keeping polling places open for an extended period of time or rescheduling the election on different day some scholars suggest that as the united states constitution explicitly delegates the authority to conduct presidential elections to the states it can be argued that states could create procedure in advance that would include provision for postponing an election for designating particular officials to decide whether or not an election has to be postponed and for setting out procedures for rescheduling the election states should develop procedures now to deal with potential terrorist disruption of presidential election university of buffalo news release james gardner july 29 2004 74 depending on the location and nature of the incident should catastrophic event occur just prior to or on election day multijurisdictional decisions would be required regarding whether to reschedule the presidential election or allow for rescheduling of the election in those localities affected by the incident in order to abide by the constitution and allow for the incoming administration to have time to prepare for current and national security challenges decisions regarding the presidential election would need to be made in relatively quick manner the 20th amendment of the united states constitution states that the terms of the president and vice president shall end at noon on the 20th day of january following an election with the terms of their successors beginning thereafter 75 states should develop procedures now to deal with potential terrorist disruption of presidential election university of buffalo news release james gardner july 29 2004 crs22 should such dynamic occur greater burden will be placed on local homeland security entities to identify risks to local communities and respond to an incident or set of incidents76 phase 3 election day phase 3 of the presidential transition is the actual day of the presidential election77 outgoing administration considerations and options consistent with the opportunities for public outreach efforts noted in phase 2 senior federal government leaders may wish address risks to the homeland on the day of election in addressing any known or possible threats senior federal officials might offer that citizen involvement in the democratic process is an effective way to demonstrate to those who wish to harm the nation that acts of intimidation will not affect the electoral process other actions the administration might take to support the voting publics confidence in participating in the presidential elections include providing relevant threat information to state homeland security fusion centers in expedited manner working with state and local security officials to secure the nations polling places and increasing security for suspected targets in the united states to prevent or mitigate damage from attacks meant to disrupt the voting activities78 incoming administration considerations and options resolving the presidential election in timely manner is crucial to allowing the incoming administration the time necessary to prepare for current and future national security challenges79 the longer the presidential election results are delayed the less time the current administration has to assist the new administration presidentelect 76 see generally security officials gear up for united states elections carol eisenberg newsday march 8 2008 when

given all the partisan bickering he further went on to state that he has told his team to be prepared for anything and that we have to continue operating matter what happens at the federal level 77 normally the presidential election is singleday event when the election is held with the results and determination of the presidentelect to be ratified by the electoral college shortly thereafter there are instances such as the presidential election of 2000 where the determination of the winning candidate did not occur for approximately five weeks given that presidential election brings wholesale change in personnel loss of time hampers new administration in identifying recruiting clearing and obtaining senate confirmation of key appointees 911 commission report july 22 2004 p 215 78 it should be noted that any actions taken to safeguard and preserve the sanctity of the us electoral process should recognize the tension between undertaking actions in the name of national security interests and acting in manner that could be perceived as taking action to disenfranchise certain voters disrupt the voting process or negatively affect individual privacy and civil liberties 79 see generally clock is running on presidential transition effort cnn brooks jackson november 27 2000 crs23 personnel decisions are delayed and some security observers would see the us as increasingly at risk due to the uncertainty in who will lead the country congressional considerations and options while the actual day of the presidential election may be uneventful some observers argue that legislative oversight of transition activities of the current administration taken to this point may key to ensuring the incoming administration is as well prepared as possible in enacting the presidential transition act of 1963 congress provided the current administration significant discretion in deciding the level of support to be given to the incoming administration in recognizing the potential risks that may be associated with presidential transition the act noted the need for an orderly transfer of executive power the national interest requires that such transitions in the office of the president be accomplished so as to assure continuity in the faithful execution of the laws and in the conduct of the affairs of the federal government both domestic and foreign any disruption occasioned by the transfer of the executive power could produce results detrimental to the safety and wellbeing of the united states and it people accordingly it is the intent of congress that appropriate actions be authorized and taken to avoid or minimize any disruption80 phase 4 post election day to presidential inauguration phase 4 of the presidential transition includes the elevenweek time frame from the selection of the winning candidate to the date the presidentelect is sworn in to office inauguration day unique risks to phase 4 national security considerations unique to this phase of the transition period include incidents of national security significance that are intended to take advantage of the perceived confusion in national leadership such incidents may be undertaken with the idea of attempting to have the outgoing and incoming administrations at odds with one another with respect to presidential decisionmaking desires and to try and take advantage of perceived interagency coordination confusion81 with many of the prior administrations political appointees stepping down from their positions and the as of yet to be named or confirmed new political appointees placed in their agencies some are concerned about the ability of the federal governments ability to effectively recognize prevent or respond to an incident of national security interest some security experts are concerned that the remaining leadership in various departments and agencies some of whom are presumably career civil servants that are serving in an acting capacity 80 the presidential transition act of 1963 sec 2 march 7 1964 3 usc 102 81 see also dhs secretary chertoffs january 10 2008 remarks to the dhs homeland security advisory committee we know that the period of transition is period of heightened vulnerability not because we have any specific piece of intelligence but because our observation over the last several years including as recently as this summer when the new british administration came in and faced attacks within matter of days underscores for us the fact that it is in the transition period when people are doing the handoff that there is natural degree of confusion which creates an invitation to people to carry out terrorist attacks or other damaging enterprises crs24 could fall victim to receiving conflicting direction from both the outgoing and incoming national security leaders outgoing administration considerations and options while some presidential observers argue that there is little motivation for the staff of the outgoing administration to cooperate with incoming administration members others suggest that when it comes to matters of national security the desire to protect us interests and preserve the outgoing presidents legacy should supersede adverse actions or lack of effort by those soon to depart the white house it is often observed that the level of animus shown by the outgoing president to the presidentelect will have great deal to do with the cooperation the incoming administrations transition planning team receives from individuals currently in positions of power it has also been noted that transitions between administrations of the same party appear to go smoother the presidents statements and actions with respect to the ongoing transition specifically as it involves matters of national security will set the tone and spirit of efforts taken by current staff to assist members of the incoming administration82 any actions or statements that are perceived to undermine the incoming administrations policy views on national security matters could be seen as attempting to frustrate the transition process and have negative security repercussions for the new administrations efforts to conduct foreign policy or address national securityrelated issues83 some presidential historians see the primary role of the outgoing administration during the postelection day period as facilitating transparent and productive transition environment the desire is that such actions will allow the incoming administration to be in the best possible position to identify and respond to any significant national security issues that may arise soon after taking office such securityrelated strategic operational and policy transitionrelated activities can be offered in the form of briefings written product exercises to simulate daytoday and crisis environments and other aspects of collaboration and coordination awareness activities84 activities that could facilitate an effective national security transition 82 the chief impediment to establishing the proper links in the past has been the fact that at the highest levels of the policy agencies virtually everyone empowered to put these support arrangements in place has been political appointee whose loyalties are to the outgoing administration hence they have little at stake in supporting the incoming administration john halgerson

lessons learned from past policy and operational national security activities expedited security clearance processing for presidentelect transition team members and nominated members of the new administration if not already occurring during an earlier phase of the transition period soon after the election it is common for the president elect vice president elect and senior members of the incoming administrations transition security team to start receiving classified intelligence briefings for those individuals who do not already possess an active security clearance the irpta of 200494 allows the presidentelect to submit to the fbi or other appropriate agency the names of candidates to be nominated for highlevel national security positions through the level of under secretary as soon as possible after the date of the general elections prior to the inauguration the fbi or other appropriate agencies are responsible for undertaking the background investigations necessary to provide appropriate security clearances to individuals who have been designated by the presidentelect as key administration officials while the adjudication of security clearances is often concern for individuals who have recently been hired into the federal government it appears the fbi does have the ability to put forth the resources necessary to ensure senior national security officials are investigated and where warranted receive the approval to view classified material in an expeditious manner95 incoming administration considerations and options from national security standpoint phase 4 of the transition period is quite possibly the most hectic and exciting with eleven weeks between election day and the inauguration ceremony the outgoing and incoming administrations have much work to accomplish as the presidential transition period continues and the window for affecting the electoral process narrows some see this phase as the most likely time for an enemy of the united states to undertake an action to attempt to throw the country into presidential decisionmaking chaos with the campaigning and the election longer concern the presidentelect will have little time for celebration and reflecting on the past as collaboration with the current administration being seen as an essential element of future success in this regard the hsac administration task force has proposed the incoming and outgoing administrations work closely together toward shared commitment to ensuring smooth transition of power this is facilitated by positive attitude and open mind in both incoming and outgoing administrations combined with the willingness to respect and listen to each 94 section 7601 f1 95 terry frieden fbi to speed presidential transition background checks cnn november 27 2000 crs28 others concerns and priorities the same attitude must also characterize the behaviors of the senior career personnel who remain with the department and will be counted on to ensure smooth transition between administrations96 while numerous transitionrelated activities commence shortly after presidential election some national security experts suggest that none is more important than the efforts undertaken by the national security and intelligence communities to assist in providing information and context to the incoming president and the accompanying new national security team given current and projected security challenges the transition can longer be taken for granted as honeymoon period and significant attention needs to be provided to managing the transition97 while the incoming administration has eleven weeks to prepare for assuming the presidency many activities will need to occur98 the presidentelect will formally announce leaders of the transition team personnel will be interviewed to possibly occupy positions in the new administration and interaction with the outgoing administration congress and foreign leaders may occur the incoming administration may also select cabinet members with the desire to formally submit to congress soon after the presidential inauguration phase 5 prioritized list of names of those individuals

authors further stated the time frame of eleven weeks is simply inadequate for extensive planning in the policy or process areas presidential candidates need to do all they can to ensure an orderly organized and politically profitable transition if presidential candidates are successful during the phase for transition period then their presidencies can begin on confident note if they are unsuccessful foreign policy and national security issues may overwhelm them and their presidency 99 department leaders with significant national security responsibilities requiring senate confirmation

website to seek out individuals with national security expertise who will be needed to meet the upcoming challenges and opportunities101 request current administration political appointees to remain in their jobs through the inauguration and possibly the confirmation of new national security leaders to allow for continuity and collaboration102 overlap in key positions is allowed for limited circumstances while agencies cannot employ multiple individuals in the same job billet dual incumbency options exist to temporarily allow both outgoing and incoming administration personnel to be assigned to an organization103 select career federal employees with significant national security expertise to be detailed to the transition team104 specific focus 100 of note it should be recognized that while the nsc does maintain cadre of fulltime career employees that will presumably stay in place during presidential transition it appears the hsc is primarily comprised of political appointees with few career detailees from cabinet level agencies the decision making ability and effectiveness of policy and operational direction provided to departments and agencies by the hsc may be lessened due to fewer numbers of permanent personnel and the possibility of lack of expertise to address the various aspects of homeland security related issues interestingly security experts are divided on whether future administrations may see the need for separate nsc and hsc many national security experts think that homeland security is subset of national security future administrations may only establish nsc with an office responsible for addressing the nexus of national security and homeland security issues contained therein 101 bush campaign creates website for presidential transition december 4 2000 cnn 102 while it is customary for the current administrations political appointees to resign prior to the new president taking office specifically if the incoming administration is of

continued crs30 given to members of the military intelligence community and diplomatic corps with expertise in the policy priorities of the new administration request substantive briefings on policies and programs of concern to assess historical challenges prior to deciding to revise or eliminate current activities some security observers are concerned about perceived leadership void that can occur during the transition period when the outgoing administration has constitutional authority but diminished influence and the presidentelect has much influence but authority105 however actions can be taken by the outgoing president and presidentelect to ameliorate any suspected appearance of presidential decisionmaking ambiguity issues of foreign policy were hotly debated during the presidential campaign of 1992 after the general election in which bill clinton was elected president many wondered if the presidentelect would attempt to initiate foreign policy changes prior to the inauguration during the transition period presidentelect clinton addressed these concerns by stating president bush is to be viewed as the sole voice of united states policy and that the greatest mistake any adversary could make would be to doubt americas resolve during this period of transition106 also during this phase of the transition period the incoming administration may wish to discuss prospective strategy and policy changes to national security programmatic activities with members of congress if the new administration desires to announce any new initiatives or changes to existing national security policy or programs much work will have to be done between the time of the inauguration and the time in which the budget will need to be transmitted to congress after the inauguration the new administration will have approximately two weeks to submit to congress revision of the fiscal year budget proposal submitted by the previous administration107 congressional considerations and options during phase 4 congress has required some agencies such as dhs to have current senior departmental official develop transition and succession plan to be presented to the incoming secretary and under secretary for management to guide the transition of management functions in new administration108 the deadline for submitting the plan is the first of december of the year in which presidential election occurs while this legislative requirement appears to provide agency transition guidance that some security experts argue was lacking during previous transfers of power others 104 continued

in which it will be implemented for the current administrations transition plan to be of strategic substantive value some observers recommend that the individual responsible for drafting the plan should be career civil servant with multiyear term appointment this requirement would allow the main author and proponent of the transition plan to remain with the agency for prescribed period of time and provide continuity and advice to new administration109 traditionally congress is out of session during much of the phase 4 transition period and may also be undergoing change in membership thus congressional oversight activities during this phase are uncommon however some security experts contend that given the current risks to us national security interests special session of congress may be beneficial to ensuring the two administrations are properly coordinating on national securityrelated issues once congress returns to session and the new members are sworn in little time is available prior to the presidential inauguration to inquire about past actions and recommend changes special session of congress might be considered soon after the election to ascertain what the outgoing and incoming administrations will do with respect to transition related activities if still in session during the later stages of phase 4 congress may wish to hold additional hearings to assess the administrations progress on stated national security transitionrelated activities congressional concerns during this phase might include the status of incoming and outgoing administration collaboration efforts how resources are being expended and toward what purpose and to ascertain the incoming administrations national security foreign and domestic policy goals congress may also wish to make itself available during phase 4 to address resource requests that emanate from the two administrations should an incident of national security significance occur phase 5 presidential inauguration placement of new administration officials and formation of new policies phase 5 of the presidential transition includes the time frame from the presidential inauguration to period when the new administration has its senior national security leaders confirmed designated other noncongressionally confirmed political appointees and advisors in place and established and implemented new national security policies this phase can last few months to well into the first year of the presidency unique risks to phase 5 national security considerations unique to this phase of the transition period would include incidents of national security significance that are intended to subject the new administration to crisis and test the actions and policies of the new leaders110 an incident of

considerations and options while the outgoing administration will longer have constitutional responsibility or authority for safeguarding the country the actions that were or were not taken prior to the presidential inauguration will be part of the departing presidents legacy the protective poweras referenced in the presidential oath has been interpreted as investing the president with expansive authority to take actions necessary to protect the property and personnel of the united states from attack or other dangers112 some scholars argue that the presidents duty to protect the country is not limited to the time in which the office was occupied with responsibility extending into the next presidents term to point at which the new administration has had reasonable opportunity to organize itself and formulate national security policies as such any failure to alert and cooperate with the incoming president with respect to imminent dangers facing the nation directly exposes the country to substantial risk113 and may negatively affect the previous presidents legacy similarly the outgoing president should be cautious of any activity taken in the last few days of the administration or after the inauguration that could hamper the incoming administrations transition efforts such actions might include 111 for example less than five weeks after the first inauguration of president clinton february 26 1993 the first attack on the world trade center occurred whether the attacks were coincidentally timed with the new presidency or the perpetrators perceived an opportunity to test the new administration is debate among national security experts also less than eight months after president george w bush was sworn in as the nations forty third president alqaeda launched series of

complex information much of it classified and much of it conflicting regarding potential dangers to the united states upon taking office and still be able to craft an effective response reliance on the advice and direction of the previous administration is absolutely necessary to protect the united states an outgoing presidents refusal to provide that national security related information and warn his successor as to potential dangers contradicts his protective duties accordingly the outgoing presidents decisions whether or not to brief his successor on domestic and international threats to national security are not optional to preserve protect and defend means cooperating to the fullest degree to protect the united states against impending danger crs33 establishing or revising national security organizations policies or programs that are clearly counter to the positions of the incoming president interacting with foreign leaders that may have the perception of attempting to portray future us foreign policy desires114 and undertaking any steps that would have negative effect or produce unintended national security consequences new administration considerations and options the newly elected president who will wish to quickly set an agenda and move toward implementing goals stated during the campaign may find the issuance of executive orders and other presidential directives as way to distinguish new policies from the outgoing president this may be particularly desirable when outgoing and new president are from different parties and such changes might offer the appearance of instituting change in the early days of the new administration115 likewise the new administration may wish to quickly promulgate new national security policies and strategies for departments and agencies that have national security responsibilities while the issuance of new strategies and policies may not in and of themselves make the country safer they will convey the new administrations national security priorities and provide the nation an opportunity to assess the new presidents intentions in undertaking efforts to memorialize the new presidents national security policies many national security observers suggest that the new president may be well served to proceed cautiously and take the time to review and assess current policies116 and listen to the views of outgoing political officials and remaining career government military and diplomatic personnel prior to implementing significant changes in current strategies or operations117 to support continued transition efforts and to be afforded the opportunity to learn of the previous 114 ibid the president must be aware and solicitous of the likely directions that the new president may take on foreign affairs issues and not work in manner that may undermine the ability of the new president to achieve those goals 115 crs report rs20731 presidential transitions and executive orders by l elaine

decisionmaking efforts could encounter the challenges of threepart syndrome 1 being caught by surprise by events in the domestic or foreign arena 2 attempting to demonstrate capacity to lead resulting

and failures the new president may wish to have prior administration officials maintain their security clearances and routinely receive briefings regarding current and emerging threats to united states interests118 congressional considerations and options some presidential historians suggest that legislative inquiry and support during the incoming administrations transition efforts is crucial if congress is to provide effective oversight during the new presidency professor williams of the massachusetts institute of technology argues that the coming transition to new administration and congress opens window for reform of the organizational structures and processes that surround planning and resource allocation for homeland and national security in the executive branch and congress119 while the transition is an opportunity for members and staff to interact and have substantive discussions regarding the national security policies and goals of the new administration some presidential historians note that transitions are hitandmiss affairs that handicap the new president in shifting from campaigning to governing and create problems for the congress120 should the new administration not make an effort to avail congress of its foreign and domestic security policy intentions and if congress does not undertake an active role in understanding the policies and direction of the new administration both entities might encounter frustration as neither will feel it is receiving the necessary support to fully uphold its responsibilities as noted by mr ink president emeritus of the institute of public administration new appointees are in danger of stumbling during the first crucial weeks and months of an administration not so much from what they are striving to do but from how they are functioning and lack of familiarity with the techniques that are most likely to get things done in complex washington environment121 in overseeing and supporting the new administrations national security objectives congress has number of activities it can undertake prioritize hearings for nominated senior executive branch leaders who have significant national security responsibilities congressional authority that is often noted for making it possible for the incoming administration to be in the best position to address national security issues shortly after inauguration is to quickly confirm qualified key political appointees122 while congress will also be 118 if desired all former presidents and vice presidents are afforded the opportunity to receive classified briefings some suggest the new administration might benefit from other senior national security officials retaining their security clearance and being granted continued access to classified information 119 cindy williams strengthening homeland security reforming planning and resource allocation 2008 presidential transition series february 2008 ibm center for the business of government

which the incoming president should nominate continued crs35 undergoing transition having just been sworn in two weeks prior to the presidential inauguration some analysts see this as the ideal time for the new congress to meet with the incoming presidents national security leadership team and put in place foundation to allow for expedited confirmation hearings soon after the president takes the oath of office as noted by recommendation of the 911 commission report of 2004123 since catastrophic attack could occur with little or notice the federal government should minimize as much as possible the disruption of national security policymaking during the change of administrations by accelerating the process for national security appointments we 911 commission think the process could be improved significantly so transitions can work more effectively and allow new officials to assume their new responsibilities as quicky as possible consistent with recommendations contained in the 911 commission report irpta of 2004124 provides sense of the congress regarding an expedited consideration of individuals nominated by the presidentelect to be confirmed by the senate the act further holds that the senate committees to which these nominations are referred and the full senate should attempt to complete consideration of these nominations within 30 days of submission by the newly elected president in undertaking this responsibility many security observers see healthy tension between congress desire to act quickly to hold confirmation hearings and the need to ensure that individuals with the relevant national security background and experience have been put forth by the presidentelect in many cases highly qualified career senior executive service personnel will be in an acting capacity for some of these senate confirmed positions thus the perceived urgency to fill these positions quickly may be negated while congress ensures individuals capable of meeting the demands of the position are selected and confirmed congress may also work with the new administration to understand its national security priorities and where applicable have the changes in policies and programs reflected in the 2009 budget pass fy2009 appropriations without undue delay quickly assign new and existing members of congress to committees focusing on national security issues to allow these individuals to receive briefings and understand the issues for which they have oversight hold hearings comprised of national security experts to gather ideas on prospective us national security policies and goals and 122 continued or congress should hold hearings regarding new senior administration officials with national security responsibilities review of the cabinet positions noted in the presidential succession act of 1947 3 usc section 19 and the previous administrations national security council and homeland security councils may provide some assistance in prioritizing personnel placement activities 123 911 commission report july 2004 chapter 13 p 422 124 section 7601b crs36 hold hearings soon after the new administration has produced its national security strategies policies and presidential directives to discuss objectives and determine presidential priorities conclusion while the first presidential transition in the post 911 era is of concern to many national security observers risks during the transition period may be minimized with proactive executive branch and congressional actions it is likely the new president will face many national securityrelated challenges upon taking office whether the enemies of the united states choose to undertake action counter to the nations security interests or the new president experiences relatively peaceful period during the transition the new administrations recognition and response to these challenges will depend heavily on the preparation and education activities that have occurred prior to the inauguration while it may be impossible to stop an incident of national security significance during the presidential election process there are steps that can be taken during all phases of the transition to lessen the risks to the nation such actions may be helpful in preparing the nation for possible risks to the presidential election period and mitigating the effects of acts taken by those that wish to cause confusion during the transfer of presidential power the transitionrelated actions or inactions of the outgoing and incoming administration may have longlasting affect on new presidents ability to effectively safeguard united states interests and may also effect the legacy of the outgoing president crs37 appendix recent military operations occurring during united states presidential

representative examples of incidents of national security interest occurring during periods of governmental transition126 appendix b provides representative listing of incidents of terrorism that have occurred during times of transitions of heads of state the criteria for inclusion in this chart was based on the aggressors real or perceived intent to change the course of an election or affect future policy of the country during time of transfer of presidential authority it should be noted that barring relatively few examples there is little evidence that incidents of national security significance were planned for specific date prior to an election while varying levels of planning occur prior to an incident as with most criminal acts the leader directs or the individuals act when opportunity for the best possible outcome is presented with respect to times of presidential transition the most optimal time for an attack for variety of reasons may not present the best opportunity for the aggressors to attempt an incident as such the potential time frame for risk is present during any phase of the transition with the effects of an incident differing based on the location of the event the proximity to the election date and the reaction and actions of the us national security enterprise many security experts believe that some of the incidences noted below had significant impact on the outcome of the countrys national election or subsequent policies national security observers are fearful that terrorists groups may see some of the incidences as successes and feel embolden to attempt to affect future national transfers of power by launching attack just before the election these groups may see the timing of such an action as viable strategic opportunity to further the goals of their cause however it should be noted other security experts suggest that incidences of national significance taken prior to national election could produce reaction that is
