minimal revisions were made to the school meal programs themselves for example expansion of eligibility for homeless runaway and migrant children loosened rules for certain higher school breakfast subsidies and major proposal to phase in higher in come eligibility limits for free school meals was limited to an authorization for pilot project relatively minor amendments also affected the summer food service and child and adult care food programs for example making permanent and expanding coverage of lugar rules facilitating participa tion by summer program sponsors and making permanent and nationally applicable rule loosening ch ild and adult care food program eligibility rules for forprofit child care centers another area of concern addressed by the reauthorization law was nutrition health and nutrition educati on here the biggest initia tive was requirement that all schools particip ating in school meal programs establish locally designed wellness policies to set nutr ition physical activity and other go als and strategies for meeting them coupled with it were 1 authorizations for new nutrition education efforts 2 an expansion of the program offering free fresh fruit and vegetables in selected schools and 3 significant ch anges in food safety rules finally large number of revisions were made to the law governing the wic program the most important among them were

and 109th congresses background child nutrition programs and the speci supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children the wic progra m are governed by three basic federal laws1 the richard b russell national school lunch act this law was originally enacted in 1946 as th national school lunch act it was renamed in 1999 it provides authority for the school lunch program the child and adult ca re food program the summer food service program afterschool pr ograms those run under both the aegis of the school lunch progra m and the child and adult care food program food commodity support for child nutrition programs training and technical assistance including the food service management institute compliance program integrity and accountability activities and an info rmation clearinghouse it also includes number of generalpur pose provisions governing the operation of multiple child nutrition programs eg income eligibility and inflation indexing rules nutrition requirements for meals general rules partic ipating schools must follow the child nutrition act this law was originally enacted in 1966 it provides authority for the school breakfast program the wic program the special milk program assistance for state administrative expenses related to child nutrition programs and nutrition education activities section 32 of the act of august 24 1935 7 usc 612c section 32 authority provides funding for cash child nutrition subsidies permanent appropriati ons under section 32 are transferred to the child nutrition account annually as part of the

were made by the 1998 william f goodling child nutrition reauthorization act pl 1053363 and under the reauthorization schedule the next wideranging review of child nut rition and wic programs was set for 2003 however number of significant laws affecting the child nutrition and wic programs were enacted in the 106th and 107th congresses 1999 thr ough 2002 these are covered in the immediate pr edecessor to this report crs report rl31578 child nutrition and wic legislation in the 106th and 107th congresses by joe richardson information on the prog rams covered by ch ild nutrition and wic legislation is contai ned in crs report rl33307 child nutrition and wic programs background and recent funding by joe richardson only one significant law governing ch ild nutrition programs eg school meal programs and the wic program has been or is likely to be enacted in the 108th and 109th congresses the child nutrition and wic re authorization act of 2004 pl 108265 signed on june 30 2004 the child nutrition and wic reauthorization act of 2004 pl 108265 history the authorization of appropriations for several child nutriti on programs and the wic program as well as authority to carry out certain child nutrition activities were scheduled to expire september 30 2003 under the terms of the previous reauthorization law pl 1053364 anticipating renewal of these authorizations congress began consideration of child nut ritionwic reauthorization legislation in the spring of 2003 however primarily because of budgetrelated concerns as to how much if any new funding might be available to be spent on new or expanded initiatives action was taken in 2003 other than hearings and the introduction of bills proposing various individual program ch anges instead shortterm extension of expiring authorizations pl108134 wa s enacted pushing most expiration dates to march 31 2004 and giving congress time to acthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33299crs3 5 virtually all child nutrition programs are ma ndatory entitlements on the other hand the wic program is discretionaryon march 24 2004 the house passed an am ended version of its child nutrition wic reauthorization bill the child nutr ition improvement and integrity act hr 3873 hrept 108445 which included provi sions that would have resulted in estimated net new mandatory spending of 235 million through fy2009 however with the march 31st deadline approaching and definitive senate action another stopgap law extending most expiring authorities through june 30 2004 was enacted pl 108211 while there was formal action in the senate the house and senate committees of jurisdiction the house education and the workforce committee and the senate agriculture nutrition nd forestry committee with the administrations par ticipation informally discusse d potential final bill through march april may and into june 2004 on may 19 2004 the senate agriculture nutrition and forestry committee ordered reported the child nutrition and wic reauthorization act of 2004 s 2507 sre pt 108279 reported june 7 2004 this bill as amended with unanimous consent on the senate floor passed the senate on june 23 2004 it reflected agreements that had been reached in the housesenate discussions that had been taking place ove r the past several months and included many house and administration proposals and perspectives on june 24 2004 the house passed it without objection this fi nal measure encompassed changes in law estimated to result in 232 milli on in net new mandatory sp ending outlays slightly more in budget authority through fy2009 t he end of the reauthorization period it was enacted as the child nutrition nd wic reauthorization act of 2004 pl 108265 on june 30 2004 the new law much of the debate over and content of the 2004 reauthorization law was driven by the availability or lack of availability of funding for new initiatives or program expansions budget reconciliation agreements offered little new mandatory money total of about 230 million through fy2009 and if hous and senate legislators wanted to fund new initiatives or expansi ons with mandatory dollars beyond these budget constraints they effectively were forced to use savings from changes they made within child nutrition programs5 in the alternative they could and did authorize appropriations for new initiativesexpansions or establish pilot projects rather than create or expand entitlemen tmandatory programs the final product encompassed some 395 million in new gross spending through fy2009 however this was financed with an estimated 163 million in savings ach ieved primarily by revisions to the system for certifying and verifying eligibility for free and reduced price school meals s ee immediately below perhaps the biggest issue confront ed by congress was concern over overcertification the degree to which ineligible children are judged eligible for free or reducedprice school m eals though estimates and perceptions differed as to the extent and seriousness of the problem overcertification wa s widely judged significant issue and provoked accompanying questions as to schools administrativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33299crs4 6 five authorities were made permanent 1 requirement to use section 32 f unds to maintain commodity support for child nut rition programs 2 simplified summer food programs 3 certain rules governing the trea tment of forprofit child care centers 4 the fresh fruit and vegetable program and 5 perm ission to use section 32 funds to dispose of continuedstrength and how to ensure that eligible children were not disadvantaged by any legislative solution as result the mo st important amendments in the 2004 law dealt with program integrity improveme nts to rules governing certification and verification of eligibility ne w procedures to upgrade ad ministration of school meal programs and new technical assistance and training as to school meal program operations fe w changes were made eg expansion of eligibility for homeless runaway and migrant children and youth loosened rules for higher severe need school breakfast subsidies and major and costly proposal to phase in higher income ligibility limits for free school meals was limited to authorization for small pilot project another major set of issues involved nutrition health and nutrition education aspects of child nutrition programs partic ularly childhood obesity trends and the role of child nutrition programs and school nvironments like physical activities in dealing with this the rules governing the offering of milk and milk substitutes foods sold in competition with school meals food safety and the desire of some to substantially increase funding commitments for nutrition education while number of federally led options were offered in the end the most significant change was requirement that all schools participating in school meal programs establish locally designed wellness policies to tackle obesity and nutritionhealthrelated issues like competitive foods and students phy sical activity with federal technical assistance and other support nutrition ducation provisions encompassed series of authorizations but new funding in related amendments the program offering free fresh fruit and vegetables operating in selected schools in few states was expanded and made permanen t and important changes were made to food safety rules small changes also were made in the summer food service and child and adult care food programs for example maki ng permanent and expanding the coverage of preexisting simplified summer program socalled lugar rules that make it easier for summer program sponsors to par ticipate making pe rmanent and nationally applicable preexisting rule loosening eligibility requirements for forprofit child care centers wishing to participate in the child and adult care food program finally large number of revisions were made to the wic program but the most significant were seve ral aimed at strengthening rules containing food costs incurred by the program of these th most controversial was new provision placing substantial limits on vendors receiving the majority of their revenue from wic vouchers socalled wiconly stores the 2004 reauthorization law extended virt ually all expiring child nutrition and wic appropriations authorizations and other
