american law division updated august 20 1996 abstract the war powers act of 1933 is name given by some members of the militia and patriot movement to emergency banking legislation passed in 1933 ﬁve days after president roosevelt came into oﬃce it has apparently been so labeled by some because the banking legislation amended the trading with the enemy act of 1917 in order to give legal underpinning to president roosevelts eﬀorts to cope with the banking crisis it is alleged by its modernday critics that by that amendment the government in eﬀect declared war on the american people and began reign of unconstitutional rule through president emergency powers these allegations overlook the facts that the amendment of the trading with the enemy act has subsequently been repealed but the powers exercised pursuant to president roosevelts proclamation of national emergency have been terminated and that the presidents exercise of emergency powers is now regulated under the national emergencies acthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs957531it should also be noted that this legislation has nothing to do with the war powers resolution of 1973 see pl 93148 nov 7 1973 87 stat 555 15 usc 1541 et seq the war powers resolution imposes responsibilit ies on the president relating to the commitment of us military forces into hostilities or situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances like the exercise of presidential emergency powers the issue of presidential and congressional war powers is subject of continuing debate but the so called war

of the militia and patriot movement to emergency banking legislation passed in 1933 five days after president roosevelt came into office1 the legislation did not in fact have the title attributed to it it has apparently been so labelled by some because the banking legislation amended the trading with the enemy act of 1917 in order to give legal underpinning to president roosevelts efforts to cope with the banking crisis it is alleged by its modernday critics that by that amendment the government in effect declared war on the american people and began reign of unconstitutional rule through presidential emergency powers these allegations overlook the facts that the amendment of the trading with the enemy act has subsequentl been repealed that president roosevelts proclamation of national emergency has been effectively terminated and that any presidents exercise of emergency powers is now regulated under the national emergencies act background president roosevelt came into office on

heretofore or hereafter taken promulgated made or issued by the president since march 4 1933 pursuant to the authority continuedmay be made by the executive2 on the second day he declared that massive withdrawals of gold and currency from the banks had created national emergency and ordered that the banks be closed from march 69 in order to prevent the export hoarding or earmarking of gold or silver coin or bullion or currency 3 as the legal authority for this proclamation he cited the portion of 5b of the trading with the enemy act4 providing that the president may investigate regulate or prohibit under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe by means of licenses or otherwise any transactions in foreign exchange export hoarding melting or earmarkings of gold or silver coin or bullion or currency 40 stat 411 415 1917 as amended by 40 stat 965 966 1918 the trading with the enemy act had been enacted in 1917 to give the president authority to regulate all economic and other transactions between persons in the united states and foreign countries during world war i by its terms however the act seemed intended for use only in time of war on march 9 congress convened and promptly enacted the presidents emergency banking legislation5 recognizing the limitations of the legal authority the president had cited for his declaration of national bank holiday the legislation amended 5b of the trading with the enemy act to allow it to be used not only in time of war but also during any other period of national emergency declared by the president6 the banking legislation also declared that serious emergency exists conferred extensive discretionary powers over the banking and currency systems on the president and the federal reserve board and gave both retroactive and

on march 6 until further proclamation by the president8 and subsequently he issued number of executive orders regulating the banking and currency systems including one barring the private ownership of gold coins and bullion9 the part of the emergency banking statute quoted above giving retroactive and prospective approval to the actions of the president taken pursuant to 5b of the trading with the enemy act has not been repealed and that has led some to assert that the us is still under emergency rule but in fact president roosevelts declaration of national emergency has been terminated the amendment of 5b of the trading with the enemy act has been repealed and the presidential proclamations and executive orders issued pursuant to that authority have been eliminated in addition congress has enacted legislation regulating future declarations of national emergency by the president most of these actions occurred during the 1970s in the middle of that decade the senate created special committee on national emergencies and delegated emergency powers to conduct an investigation into presidential use and abuse of emergency powers on the basis of that committees findings and recommendations10 congress in 1976 enacted the national emergencies act11 the act repealed several statutory delegations of emergency powers and in addition imposed number of controls on the presidents exercise of emergency powers as follows 1 with one pertinent exception it terminated all powers and authorities possessed by the president any other officer or employee of the federal government or any executive agency as result of the existence of any declaration of national emergency in effect on september 14 197612 the senate special committee had found that not only president roosevelts 1933 proclamation of national emergency but also proclamation by president truman and two by president nixon were still extant technically the national emergencies act did not repeal or terminate those four declarations of national emergency but with the exception noted below this section of the act did render them hollow shellshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95753crs4 13id 1621a 14id 1631 15id 1622 16id 16412 the act provided that any standby emergency authority provided to the president by statute the senate special committee had found 470 such statutes could be activated in the future only by new presidential declaration of national emergency that was transmitted to congress and published in the federal register 13 3 the act required that in any future declared national emergency the president could only use those standby statutory authorities which he specifically identified and communicated to congress and the public14 that is declaration of national emergency would longer automatically activate all of the standby authorities which the special committee had identified in its study or which congress enacted in the future but only those specified and publicized by the president as pertinent to the crisis at hand 4 the act provided that any future declaration of national emergency by the president would terminate automatically one year after its declaration unless the president explicitly renewed it each year and could also be terminated at any time by joint resolution of congress or presidential proclamation15 5 the act required the president to make periodic reports to congress on all actions taken with respect to declared emergency16 in sum the national emergencies act now subjects any presidential exercise of congressionally delegated emergency powers to the requirements of public declaration specification of powers to be used periodic reporting congressional oversight and automatic termination the one initial exception to the foregoing framework for national emergencies concerned the trading with the enemy act as first adopted in 1976 the national emergencies act excluded from its purview section 5b of the trading with the enemy act as noted above that is the provision of law under which president roosevelt issued his declaration of national emergency with respect to the banking crisis but with the advent of the cold war that section had also been used by the executive branch as the legal basis for imposing economic sanctions on the communist nations of north korea cuba china and north vietnam and at the time the national emergencies act was enacted there was other legal basis for continuing the sanctions against those countries as consequence the state department asked that section 5b be excluded from the national emergencies act until other legislation providing basis for the continuation of economic sanctions against those countries could be enacted httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95753crs5 17pl

were the result of presidential declaration of national emergency and were in effect on july 1 1977 subject to automatic termination unless they were renewed annually this provision allowed the sanctions regimes against cuba north korea china and north vietnam to continue without the president having to declare new national emergency under ieepa see 50 usca app 5 note 20pl 95223 supra 101d

congress enacted that alternative basis for economic sanctions against foreign countries17 ieepa gives the president broad discretionary authority to impose economic sanctions on foreign countries to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the united states to the national security foreign policy or economy of the united states if the president declares national emergency with respect to such threat18 with this alternative legal basis for economic sanctions in place congress eliminated the former exclusion of 5b of the trading with the enemy act from the national emergencies act and also amended 5b so that it could longer be triggered by declaration of national emergency the amendment of 5b provided that the act can only be invoked during the time of war19 the elimination of the exclusion made clear that any and all emergency powers that might have previously been available pursuant to national emergency declared under 5b including president roosevelts 1933 proclamation 2040 were terminated20 as with the other preexisting presidential declarations of national emergency congress did not formally terminate the one declared by president roosevelt apparently believing that only the president could do so but it did render it toothless finally in 1982 the treasury department formally eliminated the presidential proclamations and executive orders pertaining to the 1933 banking crisis citing congress restriction of 5b of the trading with the enemy act and the enactment of ieepa and terming the various proclamations and executive orders to have been obsolete for many years the department issued regulation specifically terminating them21 the measures eliminated included president roosevelts proclamations 2039 and 2040 his executive order barring the private ownership of gold had previously been overturned by statute22 conclusionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95753crs6 the issue of presidential emergency powers is necessarily matter of continuing concern in democracy because the potential for the concentration and abuse of power is everpresent the emergency banking legislation of 1933 denominated by some as the war powers act of 1933 conferred extraordinary powers on the president with respect to the banking and currency systems as an initial step in trying to cope with the depression it also made the powers conferred by 5b of the trading with the enemy act available in times of national emergency as well as in times of war subsequently 5b was used as the basis for certain actions unrelated to the depression most notably the imposition of economic sanctions on certain foreign countries but president roosevelts 1933 declaration of national emergency and the various measures taken pursuant to that declaration have been terminated moreover section 5b of the trading with the enemy act is now explicitly restricted to use only in time of war and is longer available for use in national emergency finally the national emergencies act subjects any future exercise of emergency power by the president to the constraints of public declaration of the emergency specific designation of the statutory authorities to be used during the emergency congressional oversight and automatic termination whether those constraints are sufficient may be debatable but the socalled war powers act of 1933 is longer source of presidential emergency power
