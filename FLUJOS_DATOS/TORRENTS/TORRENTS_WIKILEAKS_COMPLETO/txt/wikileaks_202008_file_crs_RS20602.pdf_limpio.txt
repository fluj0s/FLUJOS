on the coastal plain of the arctic national wildlife refuge and possible effects of designation pamela baldwin legislative attorney american law division summary in the antiquities act of 1906 congress authorized the president to create national monuments recently there has been discussion of possible monument designation involving the coastal plain of the arctic national wildlife refuge in alaska an area rich in wildlife and quite possibly also rich in oil reserves several issues surround that possibility including the potential size of such monument whether provisions of the alaska national interest lands conservation act anilca might preclude or limit such designation and how protections afforded by monument designation might differ from current protection of the coastal plain this report will be updated as circumstances warrant background in the antiquities act of 19061 congress authorized the president to create national monuments to protect historic landmarks historic or prehistoric structures and other objects of historic or scientific interest national monuments are to be created on lands owned or controlled by the government of the united states and are to be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected numerous presidents have used this authority and president clinton has recently created eleven new monuments and expanded two others2 the coastal plain of the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr in alask has great diversity of wildlife and includes the calving area of the porcupine caribou herd andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20602crs2 3 pub l 96487 94 stat 2374 codified in part at 16 usc 3101 et seq section 1002 of the act 16 usc 3142 directed studies of the coastal plain and 1003

and gas deposits beneath it in 1980 when congress enacted the alaska national interest lands conservation act anilca congress directed studies of the coastal plain and precluded oil and gas development in the refuge unless development is specifically authorized by congress3 therefore the coastal plain currently is protected from development unless congress enacts law to permit it some have advocated wilderness designation for the coastal plain to give it more permanent protection from roads and development of any kind and others have advocated opening it to oil and gas development but legislation has been enacted to date that accomplishes either of these alternatives4 monument designation issues there has been discussion recently of the possibility that president clinton might designate the coastal plain of anwr as national monument doing so could raise several issues size one issue might be the size of coastal plain monument since that area is approximately 15 million acres the antiquities act states that national monuments in all cases shall be confine d to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected many national monuments have been large eg the lands comprising and surrounding grand canyon were originally withdrawn as national monument of over 800000 acres and the wrangellst elias national monument was 10950000 acres president clinton recently created several large monuments notably the grand staircaseescalante national monument which is now approximately 19 million acres5 and the grand canyon parashant national monument which is approximately 1014000 acres6 lawsuits have been filed that challenge these two recent monuments in part because of their size but there have not yet been rulings on this issue however the supreme court upheld the creation of the grand canyo n national monument before it later became park7 and another federal court has indicated that president has considerable discretion as to what is protected with monument designations and as to the size compatible with the proper care of the protected objects8 the size issue was raised when president carter created the large monuments in alaska before thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20602crs3 9 the district court for alaska granted partial summary judgment for the united states on the issue of construction of the 1906 act the court concluded that although the act limited the authority of the president as to size and subject matter of withdrawals the outermost parameters of that authority had not yet been articulated and the withdrawals before the court did not exceed the authority of the president unreported bench opinion anaconda copper company v andrus a79161 civ dal july 1 1980 10 cameron v united

wyoming v franke 58 f supp 890 d wy 1945 which dismissed for lack of reviewable question on whether the discretion given the president had been improperly exercised with regard to the size of the jackson hole national monument and its protection of natural phenomena and anaconda copper supraenactment of anilca in 1980 lawsuits were filed challenging the alaska monuments but only one unreported opinion on point resulted9 although courts today might prove to be less deferential to president it is still true that the president has broad discretion under the 1906 act and although the issue is not free from doubt successfully challenging monument based solely on its size appears difficult purpose similarly whether particular national monument comports with the purposes of the act could also be challenged historically although many national monuments preserve historical sites many have been made to protect natural and biological phenomena as well the wildlife resources of the coastal plain are renowned the authority to create national monuments to protect areas of natural or biological interest has been upheld by the supreme court on several occasions10 mana gement the fish and wildlife service fws currently manages anwr whether the fish and wildlife service fws would continue to manage coastal plain monument if one were to be created could present another issue presumably management by fws would be logical and desirable given the wildlife resources of the area most monuments have been managed by the national park service nps but management of some of the recent monuments created by president clinton has been given to other agencies including the fws the authority of the president to assign management of monuments to an agency other than the nps may not be clear especially if the managing agency is outside the department of the interior both the nps and fish and wildlife service are in the departmen t of the interior some contend that the authority of the president encompasses the discretion to choose the managi ng agency others allege that doing so may constitute reorganization of the government which the president currently lacks authority to do however the president may be able to assign management that previously has been that of the nps to the fish and wildlife service under the congressionallyapproved authority allowing transfers of function within the department of the interior in reorganization plan 3 of 1950 protection of resources and anilca limitations some people who have urged president clinton to create monument on the coastal plain also urge that the area be withdrawn from all mineral development as part of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20602crs4 11 for example new oil and gas leasing is allowed under some circumstances in the canyons of the ancients national monument proc 7317 june 9 2000 12 16 usc 3213 note that the section applies to withdrawals of public lands in alaska that term can have diverse meanings and inquiry must always be made as to its meaning in any particular instance at times public lands is interpreted as meaning unreserved federal public domain lands and hence would not include anwr lands as subject to 1326 however anilca defines public lands as federal lands title in the us situated in alaska except for certain native lands and lands subject to selections by natives or the state therefore even reserved lands in alaska appear to be subject to 1326 13 this provision seems to be grant of temporary withdrawal authority with the power reserved to congress to extend or make permanent any such withdrawal through an act of congress joint resolutions are acted upon by both chambers and presented to the president and hence can become laws as such this does not appear to present the same constitutional issues as did the partial congressional action legislative veto that was the subject of ins v chadha 462 us 919 1983 14 congress has sometimes converted national monument into national park but also terminated some of the carter monuments in anilca and replaced them with enacted conservation unitsprotections provided presidents have broad discretion in fashioning protections for national monument and withdrawing monument lands from mineral development is commonly but not always done11 the exact protections that might be provided for the coastal plain of course cannot be known until president makes such designation however if president were to withdraw the coastal plain from mineral leasing or mineral development this withdrawal would appear to trigger 1326 of anilca section 1326 of anilca limits the authority of the president or the secretary of the interior to create large withdrawals in alaska subsection of that section states that withdrawal of public lands in alaska larger than five thousand acres terminates unless congress extends the withdrawal by approving it in legislation enacted within one year after the withdrawal is made future executive branch action which withdraws more than five thousand acres in the aggregate of public lands within the state of alaska shall be effective except by compliance with this subsection to the extent authorized by existing law the president or the secretary may withdraw public lands in the state of alaska exceeding five thousand acres in the aggregate which withdrawal shall not become effective until notice is provided in the federal register and to both houses of congress such withdrawal shall terminate unless congress passes joint resolution of approval within one year after the notice of such withdrawal has been submitted to congress12 this provision appears to limit withdrawal to create national monument to one year duration unless congress legislates to approve the withdrawal13 congress has acted in the past to terminate national monuments although often as part of strengthening the applicable conservation designation14 and could terminate new monu ment withdrawal in alaska even before the expiration of the oneyear period absent congressional approval it appears the monument designation would terminate and thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20602crs5 15 see eg the definition of withdrawal in the federal land policy management act at 43 usc 1702j the term withdrawal means withholding an area of federal land from settlement sale location or entry under some or all of the general lands laws for the purpose of limiting activities under those laws in order to maintain other public values in the area or reserving the area for particular public purpose or program situation as to the coastal plain would be as it is now that oil and gas development in the refuge is prohibited unless and until congress acts to approve development some suggestions related to possible coastal plain designation raise the question of what constitutes withdrawal some observers have suggested that the president might simply prohibit mineral development without withdrawing lands thereby avoiding the limitations of 1326 however it could be argued that prohibiting mineral development significant land use is withdrawal because the prohibi tion removes the lands from entry under the mining laws in order to limit mineral activities withdrawal in the legal sense can be said to be the removing of lands from certain types of activities that the lands otherwise could be subject to15 in other words the withdrawal is the management action with respect to the lands as well as any paper indication of that legal action if so any action by president to limit mineral development arguably would be the act that triggers 1326 whether the word withdrawal is used or not another option that has also been discussed is that president might declare an area to be national monument without either withdrawing the area or making any management directives this action arguably would not trigger the 1326 limitations such designation would not provide any greater legal protection s than are currently available but migh t make it more difficult politically to change the status quo while congress can modify or revoke monument designation to whatever extent designation might highlight the conservation values of the area designation might serve to raise the bar for enacting legislation to change the designation or to open the area to development another section of anilca also may be relevant to designation matter how constituted section 101d of anilca stated the sentiment of congress in 1980 that anilca presented balance between conservation units and economic development and disposal of lands this act provides sufficient protection for the national interest in the scenic natural cultural and environmental values on the public lands in alaska and at the same time provides adequate oppo rtunity for satisfaction of the economic and social needs of the state of alaska and its people accordingly the designation and disposition of the public lands in alaska pursuant to this act are found to represent proper balance between the reservation of national conservation system units and those public lands necessary and appropriate for more intensive use and disposition and thus congress believes that the need for future legislation designating new conservation system units new national conservation areas or new national recreation areas has been obviated therebyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20602crs6 16 section 102 of anilca defines national conservation unit in manner that does not include national monumentsit could be argued that this section does not preclude monument designation because technically this section speaks of types of conservation units other than national monuments16 and one congress cannot tie the hands of another on the other hand one could argue that national monument is type of conservation unit and that creation of new monument would violate the spirit if not the letter of the law it could also be argued that because the fate of the coastal plain was expressly left to be decided in the future after additional studies of the area the possibility of additional protection for the coastal plain was contemplated as part of anilca and designation of the coastal plain ought not to be subject to the 101 policy however 101 may ensure lively debate if congress is faced with consid ering an anwr national monument whether in the context of joint resolution to approve its creation or otherwise
