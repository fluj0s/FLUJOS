r3mx part i lecture given on 7 february 1963 wevehave lecture here from my office and this is the 7th of february 1963 and saint hill special briefing course lecture number one lecturing here in my office in front of the tv camera and weve got lot to cover here in 3mx all right as you realize now that weve gotten our materials pretty well lined up the saint hill special briefing course is going to be specializing in routine 3 were going to do minimum of routine 2 and therefore its very much to our point to have decent understanding of routine 3mx and thats what this lecture is all about this is the first lecture on routine 3mx and gives us our first fundamentals all right if routine 3 never went any further and there was nothing else ever done and nobody ever heard again of routine 212a it has served its purposebecause it has piloted the way in listing all the rules of routine 12a arein listing and so forthare followed in 3mx and it gives us very good look at what goal is and what its all about and how it should be listed out so that brandnew method here of listing out goals has been developed and it is evidently tremendously successful now of course i have subjective reality on what im talking about here i also have subjective reality on routine 212a probably one of the most spectacular sessions ive ever seen conducted completely aside from the fact that it was conducted on was the session done by mary sue on what was that the beginning in the evening of5th february now that was tremendous session in terms of results in that session we found the rsing item which began the goals entrance into 3mx and just before that completed 212 package so that the total score on that in actual fact the number of items found in that fiveandahalf hour session consisted of four 212a packagesthat is four itemsmaking one complete package and four routine 3mx itemsmaking eight items in all in just that one session now that at once gives you an erroneous idea of how fast you ought to audit and is of course an open invitation for you to just grab items all over the place to make record and it is very bad publicity in the first place im very easy to audit and the second place mary sue can audit and in the third place this was pretty well set up to give you some of the more gruesome details of this might be very instructive to you in actual fact the path was not as smooth as it might have looked at first glance i had goal found back in augustthe goal to findand this goal failed to check out consistently and folded up sometime in september it was listed bit under the old methods of listing and it didnt get too far in fact today the goalthat is not today but last weekthe goal wasnt even firing it had collapsed completely nobody had seen any reads on it or anything of the sort for long while well now having done quite bit of 212a on in the past month or so why mary sue and i decided that we had better take crack at listing this goal properly and we did some goals research i very often am used as guinea pig in this particular lineup and we did some goals research by trying to list this goal one way and the other way and some other way in order to make the thing spark and that was on sunday night the 3rd of februaryand we listed this 3mx method amongst the other methods but rocket reads showed up of any kind whatsoever and mary sue was quite disappointed about the thing and didnt do anything further with it and on the 4th of february mary sue started out on long arduous hammerandtongs pound trying to locate something with routine 212a but in actual fact that didnt go anyplace in that particular session we didnt do anything with it on the contrary i had worked out new theoretical process which goes as followsthat if you run out the overts on peoples goals your own goal will pop up sounds awfully good doesnt it it almost killed the truth of the matter is that as youre listing goals you have overts on the overts themselvesnot being given to the auditor of course youre just telling him what goals you have overts onanything like that gives you nothing but missed withholds left and right so there were something on the orderi thinki think she listed about five hundred items that is five hundred goals or purposes i had overts on and to give you something very amusing it ran about twelve missed withholds per goal so that was five hundred times twelve or about six thousand missed withholds thats in one session thats pretty good isnt it well that caved in masses and an electronic mass that i got into in dublin keyed in and it keyed back in thoroughly and i was frying as though iwell i was frying as well as the dream citizen of kennedys administration you know totally fried atomic fissioni was bright red i was in terrible shape so that wasthat was really cavein so in the next session which occurred on the 5th of february we tried to get back on the run again with 212a and if youve ever seen nervous pcs that was the one i had more or less been steering this to marked degree but i was very nervous pc i didnt want anything overlisted even one item because the second we overlisted something just one item in would come this fryelectronic atomic mass and it was really quite painful when i first ran into it by the way i became completely speechless couldnt talk and the auditor went on asking the auditing question you see mary sue has been demanding fee on this so ii dont want you to think that all auditors are perfect shes pretty good though anyway that thing really really fried and i was very dangerously minded on the 5th trying to keep this atomic mass off of and trying to keep the thing running on the rails somehow or anotherand she was listing various variety of beginning lists you see wed already run out of all of the old lists all the old source lists and heres datum for you by the way that we found out in all this is you cant go further than the four notnot with 212 you can go further on 3mx than four consecutive ris but you can only go four ris with 212a dont try for that fifth one while were on it any ri that only rocket reads that much you see that only about that much tiny little little ri thats about third of dial something like that well this one only about so much anything less than third of dial is very dangerous it pulls in mass like mad actually if you find one like that on pc its only rsing that much just pat the pc on the head and say thats dandy and dont have anything more to do with it now just skip it just bail out you want to go back and find something that did rs decently now in 212a we managed to work around first list and i was listing what isnt part of existence i think what isnt part of existence by the way there was another test list in there i just remembered what arent you now dont try that either thatthats just dynamite but 212a we managed to list on and isnt part of existence some such list and we wound up with an item that had good thirdofa dial rs and so forth and at the end of the session why on the 5th everything was very happy and so forth she sailed into this on the 6th and decided she was going to complete this package on 212a well this was very interestingly brief package source list on 212a you must realize can have its item occur anyplace the source list does not follow the rules now thats hard to cope with that is to say any of the rses on the source list can be the rs youve got problem here in where does it occur because the pcs mind is not well channeled on present time lists and what is part of exist what isnt part of existence and so forth and in actual fact the source list item that we got was the first item on the list it rsed and she couldnt even separate the list question out from the item for moment or two and then i managed to suppress it and she got that out and she ran about page and half of that im looking at these lists here im not tremendously familiar with them yeshere it is what isnt part of existence and in doing what isnt part of existence thiscan you see this now itits this list right here at the top thats number one thats number one item you notice that rs all right the list question was what isnt part of your existence now thats fine but it the first item unlimited wealth was there and therethere it is it was the item it turned out but if you will notice looking this over you would list it normally and you come down here and about eight or nine items from the top tone arm 20 you have here an rs and an rs and dr and an rs and then you have on the reverse side of the sheet here again you have the same onethe first one put back on the list again this is back on the list again and this time it gave pain in other words i put it back on the list so that of course rsed and then you notice here there is another rs and an rs and by this time she didnt continue on over because the mass was pulling in so tight that there was just continuing and she took that on the 4th is when she did that and on the 5th she took this as an item and she ran it on around the clock and so that we got package out of this theres lot of test experimental and research lists here one kind or another that im pawing through and apparently the list i am looking for justoh here we are nownow we come down to test for pain or sen which is greatly superior to any test which you happen to be using and instead of determining by pn or sen you determine by mass and you say to the pc consider unlimited wealth committing overts two or three times and you ask him did it turn on any more mass and he doesnt know because he hasnt been looking so you say it two or three more times would unlimited or consider unlimited wealth committing overts and then you bay consider committing overts against unlimited wealth consider committing overts against unlimited wealth you say did that turn on more mass he says well yeah theres something out here and it started to go out from my body andand so forth and thats of course wrong in other words you tested as term and oppterm and the one which doesnt turn on more massof course these things all have little mass associated with thembut the one that doesnt turn on more mass is the right way it is if you say unlimited wealth oppose when it should be oppose unlimited wealth you of course are running wrong item you recognize that by using it as terminal or using it as an oppterm you get wrong item manifestation all youve got to do is say that the thing is terminal when its an oppterm or an oppterm when its terminaland youve got wrong item you recognize that and the thing behaves like wrong item so here is test the right way to turns on less mass than the wrong way to because of course wrong item turns on mass thats your stable datum the wrong item turns on mass always you can keep that in mind anyway here is this very interestingly brief 212a package we look on here and we see here this is who or what would unlimited wealth oppose and of course here we start in our list as we normally would just go right on down here with this list on down here with the list and only is two more items on the other side of the page now that should be of considerable interest to you that 212a list can be that short because very few of them are that short but this is the equivalent thatwe talk in pages this is the equivalent ofof course one two and bit pages fantastically brief so it must have been right up on top of the bank and she did this and this is done exactly according to the rules now the rules are simply this that you get down here youre listing down from the top down down down down down from the top to the bottom of the page you take your next page and youre at the top down here and here your ta motion ceases now you characters have been having an awfully awfully hard time of it i sympathize with you terribly youre going to think yourself to death someday iafter my absence of being kicked in the head earlier few weeks ago i havent been very alert on whats going on and let tell you rumor that there is such thing as still ta is more asinine than i have heard since 1950 anybody that will take meteranybody that will take meter and hold the meter on cognitionsurge basis and every time every time the needle ducks duck the ta you you see that now the needle does cognition surge so they think immediatelyi tell you youre going to think yourself to death someday im not kidding you you know youre going to think yourself right straight into the grave god give simple auditor who can just sit down and just list and pick up the item and pat the pc on the back and say thats it people got to get fancy every time the tone armevery time the needle goes this way see needle goesso so pc had thought see comes back to the approximate place then the auditor figures out of course that this tone arm would have gone that way that way seethere we go so therefore didnt still tone arm you nut i mean im being very very insulting but when i heard about this i said my god this can go on at saint hill what the hell goes on in keokuk now thats athats an interesting question isnt it look you dont count the surges still ta is still ta where have you got to put the ta in order to read the needle well if you dont have to put the ta any other place in order to read the needle thats still ta you got it do you know there have been two or three cases out here that have been wrecked with thatwrecked with it im not kidding you somebody just figured himself to death see so you quit that you know i could probably dream up more problems for you to solve in dianetics and scientology than you could count in the next million years but youve got to pick on something like this there is such thing as still ta thats ridiculous still ta still ta is still ta of course you did something better than that today as class there was member amongst us who thought that an rs was tick was fall was dirty read was rocket readand all the pcs items all the pcs lists were beefing up because the rs was on everything and mary sue got bright enough being an old d of p to look over somebodys shoulder and say what on earth do you think an rs is and anything was an rs so of course it looked like the pcs lists were all beefing up yes im giving youim giving you bad time but im giving you bad time with malice aforethought and that is because when i tell you something very simple like you put the pc in the chair you say start of session give your goals now here is the list were going to list and can you answer the question and the pc says yes he can answer the question and then hethe auditor simply sits there and writes down the items one after the other without tripping the pc without spitting in the pcs face without dropping the emeter without getting in the mid ruds for yesterday without getting in the mid ruds for tomorrow and so forthjust finishes the list and goes through the 212a routine and comes up at the end of the session with nice item and everything is firingand there it is give that auditor please because the evolution the evolution which you go through as an auditor is very interesting the first day you confront the pc you do everything you can think of youve heardyouve heard of 8c and youve heard of this and youve heard of auditor control and youve heard of this and the other thing the more complicated the auditor is being the less certain he is of the tools of his trade and you can just put that down in your book and thats the only thing that gets in the road of routine 2 and will get in the road of 3mx mark my words its just somebody who really doesnt know what hes doing so hes doing everything i heard this afternoon with some horror of staff auditor in central organization who couldnt get much done because the last twoand threequarter hours of the session every session had to be taken up with the end rudiments on 212 oh you know how you end the session theres reversal on this if you justif you could just end the session like you say make any part of your goals and you make any gains you got the item see you make any part of your goals you make any part of your gains all right fine now notice the ceiling notice the floor notice the walls of the room thank you is it all right with you if i end the session now thats the end of session you know that didnt take two hours and fortyfive minutes you know its infinitely better than anything else anybodys doing you see what i mean sabotage comes with uncertainty if your trs are perfect if you can sit there and hold pc insessionlisten to you dont need any mid ruds you know ive had people right here at this desk over here i had them sit down and say whats your goal do goals list of fifteen you know lot of those goals worked out and they did little goals list and id go over the thing and theyre happy about it and im happy about it and somebody was standing across the desk from just yesterday and he said do you know one of the biggest session gains i ever had you brought in here one day and you found something that might be my goal and you didnt say it was but you so on and its the biggest session gain i ever had had lot of cognitions on it and so forth total session timeten minutes total mid rudszero there wasnt even start of session why well he didnt have to be told he was insession i was auditing him im sorry but thats the way these things go now lookahere you can see this paper better here all in one fell swoop this is list down here im sorry toto chew you out on such things as there is such thing as still ta because you actually just destroyed your primary indicator dont you see now she got down to hereim not showing you these because these are mine but i just happen to be set of stuff that i know about on 212 and on 3mx so ii can show you very intimately and correctly exactly where these things are all right we come down here weve got tone arm read of 40 on this border here on this border weve got 475 475 and nothing moved obviously and there are more reads its all 475 475 475 in other words the auditor did not have to move the ta in order to read the needle so it was still ta thats all there is to that now youll notice in all this that after youve gone in 212a fifty items your needle starts to tighten not only do you have motionless ta but you have tightening needle now here we go five items deep we had an rs this is all still 212 see we add another four or five itemswe had another rs four itemsan rs about two items lateran rs three items lateran rs then an rs and an rs and an rs and an rs and an rs and an rs and then it skips an item and rs rs and then another rs you say this thing is hotter than pistol well it was thats because the whole thing is being hit right there into the middle of the package all right and we get up here to this second column here and weve got an rs and then weve got another rs weve got another rs and then weve got another rs and then it goes twoand theres another rs and theres rs and rs and rs and nothing and so forth ta has already hit its still point now shes got to list herselfher fifty items see so she did actually it wasneedle started to tighten up so that she didnt finish off listing her fifty items on this particular thing because it was just getting asinine there isnt anything going to happen why finish listing the things so its just jump of that thing based on the smartness of the auditor not to list the pc into the ground the needle is getting tighter and tighter and tighter and tighterand the ta actually has been still for quite long time and theres nothing else happening here nothing else happeningand theres nothing else going to happen either so there it is theres the last rs all right so she saysso she says right away to the pc she says now im going to read the next to the last rock slamming itemthe next to the last rock slam item im going to read to you see itstheres the rfactor shes not going to read the pcs item so he can arc break you see and say its not my item well i didnt say it was your i can hear you now omit the r factor see well heres the item joe blow thats not my item well i didnt say it was your item how to not get along all right so weall those rses ended up down here with one rs so she reads the next to the last rsing item to see if it reads it had better not and out it goesbang she marks it outdidnt read she reads it to pcdidnt read tiger drill or nothing like that and then she says now im going to read the last rock slamming item on the list not even this is your item see and she reads being homeless see she said that rses you see sheshe doesnt do this and i dont do this and youre not supposed to do this you sit there being homeless being homeless being homeless oh well pc says well did it did it did it did it rs oh yes yes rs well how big was the rs oh about third of dial so forth lets see now weve got to get over onto this and so forth i dont know if thats your item or not and pcs saying but gosh do you know thats always what i worry about yeah well just minute iive got to get someget my auditors report written up here now lets see lets see that doesnt really seem to be your item and so forth because i cant figure out the significance of it that would be bad show wouldnt it i hate to get this sarcastic but i have some things reported from organizations particularly that make hold my head in my hands something like this arewell heres an item here irresponsibility how do you like that oh itits all right the pc said thats all right all right all right always been pretty irresponsible the auditor supervisor comes along and says well did it rs we dont know what this interlude was all about dont you see we havent clue why was he reading this item to the pc in the first place now its just direct positive action and in 212a your rules are very direct you take your source listthe item can appear on it anyplace so you go over every item on the source list that rsed just make sure there arent two rsing items on the source list take it wherever you found it if its not big rs dont do thing with it you hear scuttle it find out why this pc doesnt have big rs something else has been done to this case in the past now take that reliable item find out if its pain or sen and start opposing it do your painsen test on the one that didnt turn on more mass on consider committing overts against and consider soandso committing overts then just start listing it look dont get in youryour beginningend ruds with the mid ruds on the thisruds on the thatruds and so forthunless the pcs fallen out of his chair or screaming or something like this you see dont use the tools of auditing unless you have to use them youhowwhat would you think of plumber who went into room and he sees an awful lot of fittings so he gets out spanners and just work working on all the fittings and so forth and pretty soon the whole place is leaking so he gets out big spanners this time to repair it and thats the way youll go you see hes got to get out sledgehammers after while and demolish the whole works the pcs sitting there pcs interested you start listingpocketa pocketapocketapocketa bangbangbangbang now some other genius around here someplace dreamed up one that you tell the pc what rsed you say that rsed this is an absolute invitationa complete utter invitation to the pc then to represent rock slamming item i4es trying to get his item on the list so you have something like penurious person so he says penurious person and the auditor says that rsed you know this hope factor see so after that the pc says cheap person person without any money person that aint got nothing auh broke person you see why hes representing rock slamming item actually you mustnt even let the pc see your list you understand i dont care if youve got to get cardboard barrier across from you thats better now when you flub and dont complete list and read it to the pc which you will do every now and then the best of auditors willthe pc then almost certainly is liable to take the next to the last rock slamming item that you read and the last rock slamming item that you read that didnt and hes almost certain completely certain to represent those unless you the auditor say now that we have those your items probably nothing like them now just answer this auditing question who or what would catfish oppose now thats all i want answered because if he starts representing in order to get his item on the list you are going to get false increase of rs its going to look like its wrong way to and its not going to list out and youre not going to get the item on the list do you understand all right so those are the things you can do wrong lets take look at what you do right you come right down the list here you start in here you go you arelist and list and list and list and listand there are your rses the pc seems anxious he looks at you and so forth you say there are rses on the list its okay you do the same thing with with 3mx you say there are there are rses on the list its all right oh yeah oh okay and he plows right ahead all right you list on down your page and keep your note of your ta over here on the side keep itkeep pegging it in pegging it in writing it down whether you see it oh every five ten items something like that and when it doesnt change why you probably should make list notation occasionally get on down here and all of sudden you notice that about this placeand by the way most lists are much longer than the one im showing you this is freak list this is very short list lists usually go seven eight nine pages this makes good illustration for you so right about this point here tone arm motion ceases youve still got needle moving every time he cognites you understand but you dont have to move the ta to keep the needle on so for all intents and purposes you have tone arm motion and there we go down the line down the lineall of sudden we see that rshahaha we see that rs its the last one that we got we dont see another one see we dont see another one we keep on going going going going going going going going so on actually we count from this last rsfifty for routine 212a and twentyfive for 3mx never more than twentyfive for 3mx never more than fifty for 212a thats fifty items after the ta stopped moving fifty items after the tone arm stopped moving or after the last rs seeeither one but not fifty items after the tone arm stopped moving if you now have an rs see your rs cancels out the point from where the ta stopped moving on down to the last rsand youve got to have fifty items now from that last rs you got it and you just list them and the pc says isnt this getting awfully tough and you say yes its getting awfully tough and so forth count them up you knowyou know thats twenty twentyfive twenty six twentyseven twentyeight youve got twentytwo items to go twenty two let have twentytwo and the pc will sit there and snarl and list the twentytwo for you but nevertheless list them because every now and then he will pick up rock slam and then you should go on by the rock slam go on by the rock slam and when youre safely by it so that he cant identify it you say to him im afraid i got to have fifty more items ive had rock slam oh you have well fine and hell give you the fifty more items those are the exact rules of listing now look there isnt any more to themexcept in 3mx the difference is simply this the difference in 3nm is just this one differencethat its twentyfive not fiftybecause 3mx caves in fast and 212a caves in more slowly after the still ta all right so anyway to get back on this other sprint justim talking about thisnot because its my case im trying to show youbecause this was research sprint and im trying to give you the stuff that we got out of it we got the rest of that package carrying it right straight on around pocketapocketapocketapocketapocketa and that gave us four ris and now having four ris why we were all set that was the end of that 212 package and all of sudden mary sue says to herself rs i had big rs on that but she was muttering and she went back to this goals list that she had been listing two days before and she decided to test the rs she tested the rs she tested the one before and found that the last rs on the list fired as it should and simply took off and opposed it and what did she turn up with but rocket reading item which was an ri and we had to go to town right at that point in other words the first part of the package started out with an rs now thats the goal oppose that we were doing you know now you have to have question there that the pc can answer and one of the ways that pc doesnt answer the question is not be asked the right question youve got to have goal oppose well that can have several wordings there are several ways that can be worded who or what would somebody or something with the goal to catch catfish oppose well all right he can answer that but he cant answer who or what would catching catfish oppose you understand you got to have question that pc can answer and listing that on out the linethat was the one that had been listed two days beforewed listed shed listed that out and she found an rs and this was proper rock slamming item the kind youd expect to see in 212 well turning that thingtesting it for terminal or oppterm and listing it further produced another rock slamrocka rocket reading item produced another reliable item but it rocket read and from that moment on opposing and using the exact same rules that we had already worked out it was little bit tough being audited and working out the rules at the same timebut found out that the tightening of the needle is more rapid in the middle of the gpm than it is out on the fringes you see 212a is out on the fringes of the gpm and when you list goal you go right straight into the middle of the gpm and the tightening of the needle is much more rapid so you get something that looks like this it also apparentlyi wouldnt say so at first glancebut apparently compared to 212 average lists the lists of 3mx are shorter they are shorter list but theyre not lists of one or two theyre little longer than that now heres one of the item lists that came off of this and heres one of thesenow were into 3mx and heres the way 3mx works you ask the pc who or what would consider committing overts against in this casedetectives consider committing overts against detectives consider detectives committing overts say one one way two or three times say it the other way two or three times which one turned on the most mass the pc tells you and thats the wrong one so you pick the one that didnt turn on any mass and he says thats right and that is the item so therefore its an oppterm seewhatever it was oppose consider committing overts against detectives turned on less mass so therefore it is who or what would oppose detectives as simple as that so we take this and we list this right on down here who or what would oppose detectives we list it down against the meter now if that needle were tightening and were getting ta of any kind we would come off of it because theres something wrong but youre not likely to get these items as wrong as you were 212 items all right who or what would oppose detectives and were listing here pocketapocketapocketapocketapocketapocketa we come down the line here and were about seven or eight down the line and we get an rs and then we come about ten down the line here and we have another rs and then we got eleven and we get twelve is another rs and thirteen fourteen fourteen is rocket read theres your rocket readfirst rocket read and then we come down here fifteen sixteen eighteen twenty something like thatwe have another rocket readand at that moment ta action has ceased it has ceased there is ta action and so she went on and on and was just getting along fine with tr actionno ta action and almost had her twentyfive and so help pete she got an rs on the list so that cancelled the other twentyfive and now shes got to have twentyfive more much over the pcs dead body you see but gets the twentyfive more pocketapocketapocketapocketa pocketa lists twentyfive more on down now this later thing was an effort to patch up package but theres line drawn there to show distinctly that it didnt belong to this first package actually this first package was quite correct this was just to come back as experimental test to see which way was what we found out you could get ta action after youve listed something and found its oppterm you can get ta action back on it again thats very interesting all right so all right she gets down here tas been stopped all this time theres twentyfive items past this rs there we go all set lets go back here now lets read the last rock slam on the list if there is one to the pc because we know that isnt it but of course if that was rock slamming theres still charge on this list so theres something wrong we knocked that out and there shes marked it x and we come back here to the next to the last rocket read and knock that out read it to the pc say its the next to the last didnt rocket read all right then we say now heres the last rocket reading item on the list personality and she says that rocket reads you see so shes got rocket read she reads personality couple of times and thats all set now youll find the cognitions are sometimes not as bountiful on pc when they get rocket reading items they sometimes merely say yes yes thats the item haha yeah of course yep and you sit there in vain waiting for them to cognite hell they cognited it blew what dowhat do you want whatwhat do you want rodgers and hammersteins oklahoma because youre not going to get anything its gone but the pc knew it was his item now lookahere letslets get another one here now you see how this goes its quite mathematical theres nothingnothing ever different in it theres variation in it you do it the same way and if it works any other wayyou see your listing for 212a and your listing for 3mx are both identical there is difference in this listing and if you have listed something and youve flubbed the dub and it doesnt follow the exact rules the last rocket read doesnt read the last rs on the list doesnt rs somebody has goofed see something you have taken it from is wrong your list isnt complete theres something wrong see your source item was wrong somethingsomethings wrong thats the way you work this out and you watch these things because here was patchup she had to do and she was all arc broke so i had to come out of session and tell her that the auditor arc broke everything had gone along i think this was about the eighth consecutive reliable itemnow were into the session of the 6th of februaryand this is the 8th consecutive or 6th consecutive or something like that reliable item found from this goal everything has rocket read she takes this personality and she goes right in she tests it it works everything works everything is fine everything is beautiful she lists it and it goes down brrrrr and you never saw so many rocket reads in your life its just rocket reads rocket reads rocket reads rocket reads rocket reads rocket reads rocket reads oh my action action action and then suddenly rocket reads and we go way down and then some rocket reads and then down here and then some rses and then one rs and then way down here and then the twentyfive from the last rs and she calls off the last rs and it doesnt rs she calls off the next to the last rocket read it doesnt rocket read all is well you see then she calls off the last rocket read and it doesnt rocket read in hurry theni had to hold her hand while shes doing this this is nervy stuff you knowshe went back over all the rrs on the whole list read them all like to blew my bank upnothing you know what the rule for that isif you cant get the item on the listshe went and extended it after that and she still couldnt get the item on the listif you cant get the item on the list youve lost one someplace its back of you and thats true of 212a and its true of 3mx its true of all listing in other words if you cant get an item on the list then there is item to be put on the list because its already been found or something like that its been found elsewhere but in actual fact this would have been catastrophe because we were listing right down the center of the gpm rocket reading item reliable items one after the other all of them following this rule you list it all the way down to your last rs or rr still ta twentyfive more items the last rocket read is it every time everythings just going like clockwork and then all of sudden heres one that doesnt go like clockwork well thats the time when you pass in the chips and try to commit suicide or something because thatthats gruesome day and pc feels little arc broke along about that time so we sat down we had conference i knew i had to think fast to save the auditor so i dreamed up rule which youll be using and i think youll be very interested in this rule and the rule is is simply that if you suddenly draw blank well go back and find the item terminal or oppterm that the pc was less least happy about in other words show him the items and say which one of these werent you quite as happy about as the others and he will sayhe will say well detectives i just wasnt happy about detectives look back and see where detectives came from and continue the list that you got detectives on in other words continue the list just before that you understand the one that detectives appeared on lets continue that list because the pc says hes unhappy with it and heres the trick you get your next item which belongs where you should have found it here in other words heres this personality list that didnt have an item on ityouve got this nowheres personality list couldnt get an item on this list went back and took an item the pc was unhappy about and all the same he scrubbed that one and continued the same list that it occurred on another item did come up late rrtheres where the thing had gone astray dont you seeand used that rr not canceling out everything the pc has found on him but just using that as your next consecutive rr why did it come up in the first place well it came up now because its ready to come up not because the auditor missed it in other words this is another method of finding your consecutive line plot item that belongs on that heres rocket reading item then convention which gorgeously rocket read everything was fine and it simply fitted exactly into the line plot where the oppterm of personality should have had point see dont even tell the pc youve destroyed his items dont tell him youve scrubbed anything youve just reached back backwards found something the pc wasnt happy about continued the listing of that found another item and just moved it up the line plot and used it as normal and just keep right on going well were nine rocket reading items and one rsing itemwhich was the source that came off the goaldeep at this particular time ive had quite few rsing 212 items found and over the period of time were now nine rocket reading items deep into the gpm now about the only thing that showed up is darkening of skin lightening actually of body mass and look bit better but at first when you start into this youre liable to get lot of black showing up on the pc anyhow thats apparently one of the characteristics and after hes been audited foryouve gotten few rocket reading items then he starts to lighten up but at first why hes liable to look kind of black that doesntdoesnt mean anything it does mean something when the pc turns black you start running list or list an item or something the pc goes black on you you just better get off of that now goes blacker than he was at the beginning of the list you understand that any of you characters use this just so you can abandon the list why ill have your thetan anyhow theres youryour setup of 3mx is very precise listing which is the same listing pattern as routine 212 except that in routine 3 you only use rocket reads except when you have to have an rs on your goals opposition in order to start you into the bank sometimes that will be an rs now an rs and an rr fade into each other that i have also found recently theyan rs if it will become one can become an rr and an rr can become an rs but it doesnt mean that these are interchangeable they definitely are not you cant say well im running rocket reading line because look at all the rses see thats not true an rs is little bit further out than an rr you get that so an rs normally is rather lock phenomenon on an rr and thats how these things are related so if youre running rses youre really running locks if youre running rrs youre running right in through the goals problem mass so you see anybody that knew how to run 212a perfectly could convert over and list with much greater ease by the waybecause its precision is greatercould move right over and at once list on 3mx because its twenty five items beyond the still ta or the last rs whichever comes last twentyfive items beyond that for 3mx and its fifty itemsnow 212ain 2 12a in 212a youre dealing with less precision of action than you are dealing with 3mx this is their main difference because in 212a you will occasionally be horrified having gone exactly fifty items just like the book said to start the pc listing again and have the item that he gives you the very next item that he gives youwhich is item 51rses and is the reliable item for that list youve gone around and round holding your head wondering where it was in other words that can vary sometimes if your sources are poor and so on you will find the rsing item is not the last rs on the list but is number fifteen on the front page oh there must be something wrong there someplace actually the best thing to do is to bear on rather than to keep repair repair repair all the time now this is the score then with regard to 3mx and ive given you this mostly on the basis of personal experience of the material ive seen how this material operates myself been over the jumps on it ive been trying to find goals line in that we could really give you and really square up and want to get all those old goals straightened out and so forth well ill talk about that in the next lecture i just wanted to give you good review of whats been happening here with the old man and research ive been getting killed daily for the last hundred and fifty hours but thats not quite fair because the last fifteen hours of those were more processing than i have ever seen in the last twelve years so it all paid off and you have my bravery to thank for the whole lot so thank you very much
