as part of this riskbased approach to preparedness dhs fiscal year 2006 fy06 risk methodology represents major step forward in the analysis of the risk of terrorism resulting in the most accurate estimation todate of the rela tive risk faced by our nations communities in response to state and local pa rtner feedback the fy06 methodol ogy incorporates number of significant enhancements over previ ous years analyses including incorporation of strategic threat analysis from the intelligence community improved attribution of threat nd law enforcement activity data greater depth and breadth in critical infrastructure and key asset data inclusion of populated areas out side official city limits to encourage regionalization incorporation of transi ent populations such as tourists and commuters dhs defines risk by thr ee principal variables threat or the likelihood of type of attack that might be attempted vulnerability or the likelihood that an at tacker would succeed with particular attack type and consequence or the potential impact of particular attack the risk model used to allocate hsgp funds includes both assetbased and geographicallybased terrorist risk calculations dhs combines these co mplementary risk calculations to produce an estimate of the relative risk of terrorism faced by given area assetbased risk the assetbased approach uses st rategic threat estimates from the intelligence community of an adversarys intent and capability to attack different types of assets such as chemical plants stadiums and commerc ial airports using different attack methods dhs analyzes the vulnerability of each asset type relativ to each attack method to determine the form of attack most likely to be successful additionally dhs estimates the c onsequences that succ essful attacks would have on each asset type including human health economic strate gic mission and psychological impacts this analysis yields relative risk estimate for each asset type which dhs applies to given geographic area based on the number of each asset type present within that area geographicallybased risk the geographicbased approach llows dhs to consider general characteristics of geographic area mostly independent of the assets that exist within that area first dhs evaluates reported threats law enforcement activity using federal bureau of investigation and immigration and customs enfo rcement terrorism case data and suspicious incidents reported during the evaluation period next dhs consid ers vulnerability factors for each geographic area such as the areas proximity to international borders lastly dhs estimates the potential consequences of an attack on that area including human health eg population population density transien t populations economy eg percentage of gross domestic product total agriculture sales international cargo va lue strategic mission eg defense industrial base and psychological impacts for official use only for

richmond santa clara sunnyvale and vallejo and ten mile buffer extending from the limits of those cities dhs then evaluated both the risk to indi vidual assets residing within that combined area and the risk to the geographic area itself the sum of which placed the urban area into the top 25 t op 50 bottom 50 or bottom 25 of the 46 eligible urban areas total of 3961 assets in elev critical infrastructure sectors met the criteria for consideration in the analysis for the bay ar ea the largest concentration of these was commercial assets when the assetbased risk analysis was applied to these assets the bay area fell in the top 25 of the eligible ur ban areas meaning that the risk associated with individual assets in the bay area wa s higher than at least threequarters of the eligible urban areas in the geographicbased risk analysis the ba area fell in the top 25 of the eligible urban areas indicating that it had higher level of risk asso ciated with reported threat and investigative activity resi dent and visitor populations and other geographic criteria than at least threequarters of the eligible urban areas when the assetbased and geogr aphicbased risk data for th

customersbay area urban area total risk top 25 asset risk is the numerical value that is the product of consequence vulnerability and threat associated with specific asset asset risk is calculated for each unique asset as well as being summed for all assets associated with specific candidate in given grant to determine candidate asset risk the assetbased risk percentage indicates the relative risk to assets for the urban area based on the results of the risk analysis geographic risk is the numerical value of the product of consequence vulnerability and threat associated with specific candidate consequence vulnerability and threat scores rely on inherent attributes of the geographic candidate the geographicbased risk percentage indicates the relative risk to populations and geographic areas for the urban area based on the results of the risk analysis there were 38 urban area asset types considered for the assetbased risk calculations the asset types were grouped into twelve sectors which each have specific thresholds and criteria for inclusion in the calculations considered together the sum of the numeric assetbased and geographicallybased risk values provides calculation of the total risk to the urban area with the top 25 corresponding to those urban areas that were considered to be at higher level of risk than at least threequarters of the 46 eligible urban areas considered in
