standard deduction amount provi des tax relief that recognizes the increased costs of living and associated costs of employment for blind taxpayers since many blind taxpayers have low incomes they are able to use the additional standard deduction amount provided under cu rrent tax law however this extra amount arguably does not meet the tax tests of horizontal equ ity and effectiveness the provision has not been extended to other taxpayers with handicapping conditions because of administrative difficulties and the loss of additional federal tax revenues this report will be updated in future years to reflect ch anges in law or in the additional standard deduction amount that is adjusted for inflation current tax law federal income tax laws provi certain allowances for the blind the most important of which is the additional st andard deduction amount allowed to legally blind taxpayers other special tax allowances are included in other provisions of the law such as the exception

public law 99514 prepared by the staff of the joint committee on taxation defines such expenses of handicapped individual as defined in sec 190b3 for attendant care services at the individuals place of employment th at are necessary for such individual to be able to work provided such expenses are otherwise deductible under sec 162 for further discussion of the floor on deductibility of employee business expenses see the general explanation at pages 7681 2 us congress house committee on ways and means the revenue bill of 1943 report to accompany hr 3687 hrept 871 78th cong 1st sess washington gpo 1943 p 21related work expenses of handicapped employees1 only the additional standard deduction amount for the blind however is discussed in this short report under present law in 2008 individuals in general are entitled for income tax purposes to deduct from their income in lieu of itemizing ductions standard deduction amount of 5450 if single 8000 as head of household or 10900 if married and filing jointly in addition each married taxpayer is allowed an additional standard deduction amount of 1050 if heshe is at least 65 years of age or blind if both blind and 65 years of age or older they are each llowed an additional st andard deduction amount of 2100 thus the total added deduction for married couple both of whom are blind and over 65 would be 4 200 if single or filing as head of household the additional standard deduction amount is 1350 for age or blindness and 2700 for both however the additional standard deduction amount is not allowable for dependent who is 65 years old or bli nd the forgoing amounts are subject to adjustments for inflation an additional standard deduction for other form s of handicap is currently not allowed by federal tax laws legislative history and rationale the advocates of the special tax provisions for blind taxpayers justify it on the basis of need they argue that blind persons incur certain expenses that sighted persons normally would not incur for example they say the blind often incur taxi fares to go shopping or to their place of em ployment whereas sighted pers ons may walk or take less expensive form of transportation further advocates say those who are blind cannot mow their lawn make many necessary home repairs or perform all their own house cleaning consequently blind persons pay fo r these services that would ordinarily be performed by those with sight an employed blind person will frequently live near their place of employment which may result in higher rent than if heshe could live elsewhere thus it was the incurring of additional expenses on account of blindness that was recognized when special tax concession was first allowed blind taxpayers initially in introducing the provision as deduction in the reve nue act of 1943 the house ways and means committee stated the committee has provided for special deduction of 500 from the gross income of ev ery blind person in order to cover the expenses resulting directly from blindness such as the cost of readers and guides this would relieve many blind pe rsons of any tax whatsoever and would reduce the tax of other blind persons2 in later tax bill which b ecame the revenue act of 1948 the deduction was changed to an additional pe rsonal exemption amount of 600 on the basishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20555crs3 3 us congress house committee on ways and means revenue act of 1948 report to accompany hr 4790 hrept 1274 80th cong 2nd sess washington gpo 1948 p 2021 4 the higher standard deduction amounts were ffective one year earlier 1987 for elderly or blind individuals 5 the 1986 act provided that beginning in 1988 the personal exemption is reduced or phased out serially for highincome taxpayers the phaseout levels are adjusted for inflation in the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 pl 10716 modification provides for fiveyear phasein of the repeal of the personal exemption phaseout beginning in 2006 of these same considerations in discussing the change the house ways and means committee noted that blind persons were be nefitted by more than the 100 increase in amount by substituting the exemption for th deduction blind persons did not forfeit the ability to use the standard deduction additi onally as personal exemption it was easier to reflect the tax benefit in the income ta x withholding tables so that tax relief was provided throughout the year rather than ving to wait for refund after tax filing3 the tax provision for the blind in the reve nue act of 1948 was incorporated in the internal revenue code of 1954 substantially unchanged as the personal exemption increased over the years so too did the am ount of the additional exemption provided the blind the exemption amount increased from 625 in 1970 to 1080 in 1986 comprehensive revision of the income tax code was made with enactment of the tax reform act of 1986 designed to lead to fairer more efficient and simpler tax system the act broadened the tax base so that tax rates could be lowered by removing the preferential treatment of certain classes of income and expenditures eg capital gains twoearner wage deducti on personal interest deductions etc further the act provided for the repeal of th dividend exclusion the political contributions credit and the provision of income averaging for all taxpayer s both the personal exemption amount and the standard deduction amounts were raised thus reducing the number of taxpayers who would find it advantageous to itemize their ductions further the act repealed the additional personal exemption amount for the b lind and elderly and in its place instituted an extra standard deduction amount for both blind andor elderly taxpayers this additional standard duction amount is combined with the increased standard deduction provided by the 1986 act4 both the standard deduction and additional st andard deduction amount for blind andor elderly taxpayers we re indexed for inflation in future years in general higher income taxpayers are more likely to itemize while lower and moderate income taxpayers more frequently use the standard deduction the personal exemption is typically of greater value to higher income than lower income taxpayers5 thus congress in the 1986 tax act effectively targeted the tax benefits to lower and moderate income elderly and blind taxpayers by substituting an additional standard deduction amount for the additional persona l exemption permitted under prior law httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20555crs4 assessment advocates of the blind justify special tax tr eatment on the basis of need it is argued that the blind face increased living costs th costs arise from the need to hire readers and guides etc the blind are also frequen tly faced with additional expenses associated with earning income these expenses are typi cally in the form of cab fares specialized work equipment etc to the extent that the blind make these expenditures it affects their ability to pay income taxes thus the extr standard deduction amount can be seen as an attempt to compensate the blind for these added living and business expenses however as discussed below it may also be said that the additional standard deduction accorded the blind does not meet horizontal equity principles in that all taxpayers with equal net incomes are not treated equally many blind individuals have low incomes lowincome taxpayers most frequently use the standard deduction while higher income taxpayers are more likely than low income individuals to itemize deductible items thus as an additi onal standard deduction amount this tax benefit for the blind is more likely to go to lower or moderate income blind taxpayers than higher income blind taxpayers who are more likely to itemize deductions however if this tax provision is trul based on need then one objection opponents offer is that the provision does not offer quivalent treatment to other taxpayers with different handicapping conditions who may be in as much need of tax relief for just as the blind often incur special expenses due to their blindness many other handicapped persons eg amputees learning disabled hearing impaired etc also incur special expenses due to their indivi dual impairments some of the special expenditures made by the blind are frequently the same types of expenditures made by those with other handicapping conditions ie travel costs to work or home upkeep and repair services further like the blind the handicapped as class usually have low incomes it has been suggested that equity may not be the best tool to measure the merits of the additional standard deduction for blind taxpayers rath er than equity the question has been raised as to its effectiveness that is does the added standa rd deduction amount aid those needing tax relief the provision fails the effectiveness test since some low income blind individuals who already would be exempt from tax without the benefit of the additional standard deduction amount receive benefit while these individuals are the most in need of financial assistance they receive benefit from the tax concession additionally the provision does not benefit those blind ta xpayers who itemize deductions for example those with large medical ex penditures moreover the value of the additional standard deduction amount is of great er benefit to higher rather than lower income taxpayers in those cases where the taxpayer does not itemize as mentioned in the brief summary of the law taxpayer th at supports blind dependent may not claim the additional standard deduc tion amount some believe that taxpayer who incurs additional expenses on behalf of blind dependent has as much justification to claim the additional standard deduction amount as that dependent questions arise as to why the provision for the blind has not spread to those taxpayers with other serious handicapping c onditions the legislative history indicates that administrative reasons initially pr ecluded the addition of other handicappinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20555crs5 6 the question became which handicaps to recognize and if the tax benefit should be scaled ie do you provide the same level of benefit for taxpayer that has lost one leg as taxpayer that has lost both arms or all limbs at what point do you provide ta x benefit for those with hearing loss etcprovisions6 critics have argued that if it is appropriate and desirable to provide subsidy to the lowerincome blind then similar subsid ies should also be provided to other lower income groups facing equivalent handicaps some have supported shift from tax provisions to grant program since under grant program the revenue costs are known and benefits precisely targeted with conclusive rules and re gulations however grant results in taxable income to the recipient unless specifically excluded by statute the current provision leads to pressures for tax concessions from other similar groups however the passage of an act whic h allows many other handicaps the same tax advantage as the blind would result in s ubstantial loss of reve nue to the federal government in general enforcement pro cedures under the congressional budget process may raise significant hurdles to the consideration of legislation that would cause an additional revenue loss that is not accommoda ted by the annual budget resolution even so legislation pr oposing such re venue loss may be considered without triggering procedural sanctions if it is supported by majorities in the house and senate sufficient to waive the enforcement procedures additiona l enforcement procedures based in statute ie the payasyougo requirement and limits on discretionary spending effectively expired at the end of fy2002 and congress and the president have not agreed on whether to renew them although it is true that more attention is focused on tax expenditures than in the past they are still seen by many as hidden expenditures disadvantage of tax expenditures is that since they are not act ed upon in the normal budgetary process they are able to grow in revenue size and are not subject to periodic review the joint committee on taxation estimated that the revenue cost over the five fiscal years of 2007 2011 will be 89 billion for those who use the additional standard deductions available to the elderly and blind
