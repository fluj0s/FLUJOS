rose sharply in the wake of several hurricanes in the gulf coast area including hurricane katrina currently federal law specifically addresses price gouging however bills have been passed in the 110th

does not constitute price gouging generally provisions in price goug ing statutes are triggered only when prices increase following statutorily designated event even absent specific price gouging law federal antitrust laws might apply to pricegouging behavior3 the federal trade commission ftc monitors gas prices and investigates possible antitrust viol ations in the petroleum industry4 in addition the energy policy act of 2005 required the ftc to investigate whether the price of gasoline is being artificially manipulated by reducing refinery capacity or by any other form of market manipulation or price gouging practices5 this report begins with discussion of state pricegouging laws including their triggers and applications and then moves to discussion of federal legislation aimed at prohibiting price gouging state pricegouging laws many states have enacted some type of prohibition or limitation on price increases during declared emergencies generally th laws prohibit the sale of goods and services in the designated emergency area at prices that exceed the prices ordinarily charged for comparable goods or services in the same market area at or immediately before the declaration of an emergency ho wever many statutes include an exemption if the increased prices are the result of in creased costs incurred for procuring the goods or services in question hurricaneaffected states price gouging became highly publicized concern in the aftermath of the 2005 hurricane season wh ich saw sharp price increases in gasoline and natural gas prices the potential

florida statute establishes prima facie case of unconscionable pricing if the amount being charged represents gross disp arity from the average price at which the product or service was sold in the usual course of business or available in the trade area during the 30 days immediately prior to declaration of state of emergency however unconscionable pricing does not exist if the increase is attributable to additional costs incurred by the seller or is the result of national or international market trends7 in alabama prima facie evidence of unconscionable pricing exists if any person during state of emergency declared pursuant to the powers granted to the governor charges price that exceeds by an amount equal to or in excess of 25 the average price at which the same or similar commodity or rental facility was obtainable in the affected area during the last 30 days immediately prior to the declared state of emergency however as in the florida statute there is unconscionable pricing if the price increase is attributable to reasonable costs incurred by the seller in connection with the rental or sale of the commodity8 the mississippi and louisiana statutes do not specify elements of prima facie case of price gouging but they are otherwise similar to the florida and alabama statutes mississippi and louisiana prohibit the selling of goods and services at prices which exceed the prices ordinarily charged for comparable goods and services in the same market area at or immediately before the time of the declaration of the state of emergency9 under each statute price gouging does not include price increases due to additional costs or expenses incu rred as result of the emergency10 other states many state pricegouging laws are triggered only by declaration of emergency in response to localized conditions thus in areas not directly affected by particular emergency or natu ral disaster state pricegouging laws are not likely to apply to any price increases subsequent to an emergency or disaster occurring elsewhere some pricegouging laws are less tethered to the occurrence of local natural disaster for example georgias price gouging statute can be triggered by the declaration of an energy emergency which is defined as condition of danger to the health safety welfare or economic wellbeing of the c itizens of this state arising out of present or threatened shortage of usable energy resources with geog raphical restrictions11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22236crs4 12 10 mrsa 1105 13 mcl 4459031z 14 for more information on the applicability of the

necessities defined to include fuel12 michigans consumer protection act simply prohibits charging the consumer price that is grossly in excess of the price at which similar property or services are sold13 federal price gouging legislation as mentioned above currently there is federal law that deals specifically with price gouging however federal antitrust laws may apply to behavior generally seen in price gouging14 the federal trade commission ftc monitors gas prices and investigates possible antitrust violations in the petroleum i ndustry15 in addition the energy policy act of 2005 required the ftc to investigate whether the price of gasoline is being artificially manipulated by reducing refinery capacity or by any other form of market manipulation or price gouging practices16 in may 2006 the ftc released its report finding generally that sellers behaved competitively and that the price increases were the result of increased costs alt hough there were limited instances of price gouging17 in the aftermath of hurricane katrina and th subsequent rise in gasoline prices number of bills were introduced in the 109th congress to create federal price gouging law the house passed hr 3893 the gaso line for americas security act of 2005 on october 7 2005 subsequently hr 5253 the federal energy price protection act of 2006 was passed by the house on may 3 2006 both bills were aimed at prohibiting price gouging and charged the ftc with enfor cement neither bill reached vote in the senate new pricegouging bills have since been passed in both the senate and the house of representatives in the 110th congress the house bill the federal price gouging prevention act hr 1252 passed the h ouse on may 23 2007 hr 1252 grants the president the authority to issue an energy

unreasonably19 hr 1252 lists number of factors to be considered in determining if an unconscionably excessive or unfair sale has taken place in violation of the provisions of the bill20 these factors include whether the price grossly exceeds the average price offered for sale by the seller during the 30 days prior to the energy emergency proclamation whether the price grossly exceeds the price at which the gasoline or other petroleum distillate was readily obtainable in the same area from competing sellers during the same period and whether the price reasonabl reflects additional costs not within the sellers control that were pa id incurred or reasonably antic ipated or reflect additional risks taken by the seller to produce distribute obtain or sell the product21 in addition hr 1252 would make it unlawful to report fa lse fuel pricing information to the ftc22 the ftc would be charged with enforcement of the act through its authority to penalize unfair or deceptive acts and practices under the federal trade commission act23 the bill also establishes criminal penalties for violations to be administered by the us department of justice24 state attorneys general would also be given limited enforcement authority25 the pricegouging provisions of the senate version of hr 6 found in title vi are substantially similar to hr 1252 under title vi of hr 6 it would be unlawful to sell or offer to sell crude oil gasoline or petroleum distillate at an unconscionably excessive price during an energy emergency as declared by the president26 the bill defines an unconscionably excessive price as one th at constitutes gross disparity from the average price of the commodity in the s uppliers normal course of business over the previous 30 days and also grossly exceeds the price at which the commodity was available from other suppliers in the same market27 the bill also states that price is unconscionably excessive if it represents an exercise of unfair leverage or unconscionable means on the part of the supp lier during declared emergency period28 however it would not be c onsidered unconscionable pricing if the price increase is attributable to increased wholesale or operational costs29 these provisions are very similar to the language found in hr 1252 so as with hr 1252 title vi of hr 6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22236crs6 30 id at 605 31 id at 607 32
