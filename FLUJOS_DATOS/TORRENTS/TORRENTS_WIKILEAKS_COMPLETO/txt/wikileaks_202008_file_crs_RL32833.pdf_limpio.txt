competitions and streamlined competitions vary concerning among other things meos and the conversion differential26 an meo and the conversion differential are required for standard competitions27 an meo is not required for and the conversion differential is not applied to streamlined competitions28 an argument for requiring an meo is that government employees should have an opportunity to prepare

agency has been actively involved in its implementation partic ularly since 2001 when competitive sourcing was identified as one of the components of the presidents management agenda increasing interest on the part of congress in competitive sourcing is demonstrated by the legislation that has been enact ed particularly during the 108th and 109th congresses legislation has touched upon variety of topi cs such as protest rights for federal employees competitive sourcing targets and the circular itself it remains to be seen whether this trend of competitive sourci ng legislation continues throughout the current congress and if so what kinds of issues members elect to address
