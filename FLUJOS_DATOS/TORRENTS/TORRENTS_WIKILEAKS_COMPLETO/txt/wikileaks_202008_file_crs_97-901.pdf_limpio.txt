measures sponsored by members of each party acted on by suspension of the rules in the house during the past decade the house of representatives has made frequent use of its procedure for acting

twothirds of members present and voting quorum being present to pass the measure1 the procedure is frequently used for meas ures not involving great complexity or controversy it is most commonly used for initial house action on measures in the form of motion to suspend the rules and pass bill or to suspend the rules and adopt joint concurrent or house resolution suspension of the rules is sometimes also used for action to resolve differences with the senate in the form of motion to suspend the rules and concur with sena amendments either with or without further amendment or occasionally to suspend the rules and adopt conference report this report examines all action by suspension of the rules whethe r for initial passage or final action it also includes all motions to
