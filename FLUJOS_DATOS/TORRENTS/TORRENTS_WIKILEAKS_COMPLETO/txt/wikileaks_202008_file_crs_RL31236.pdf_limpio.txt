during periods of adversity and war congress passed domestic source restrictions as part of the 1941 fifth supplemental department of defense dod appropriations act these provisions later became the berry amendment the berry amendment requires dod to give preference in procurement to domestically produced manufactured or home grown products notably food clothing fabrics and specialty metals the berry amendment title 10 united states code usc section 2533a requirement to buy certain articles from american sources except ions contains number of domestic source restrictions that prohibit dod from acquiring food clothing fabrics including ballistic fibers specialty metals stainless steel and hand or measuring tools that are not grown or produced in the united states some experts recommend changes in the berry amendment the gansler commission has studied the state of defense acquisition and made number of recommendations among them loosening some provisions like the berry amendment in february 2008 dod announced that the undersecretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics is considering change to title 10 that would broaden the exceptions provided under the berry amendment during socalled emergency operations such emergency operations may include military action taken against us adversaries military action in response to an at tack with weapons of mass destruction or military action resulting from national emergencies declared by the president dod has submitted legislative proposal for inclusion in the fy2009 national defense authorization act that would amend the berry amendment to permit the purchase of fresh fruits and vegetables from all sources the fy2008 national defense authorization act pl 110181 contains provision section 803 which requires the strategic materials protection board to perform an assessment of the viability of domestic producers of strategic materials the purpose of which is to assess which domestic producers are investing or plan to invest on sustained basis in the development of continued domestic production capability of strategic materials to meet national defense requirements some policymakers believe that policies like the berry amendment contradict free trade policies and that the presence and degree of such competition is the most effective tool for promoting efficiencies and improving quality on the other hand others believe that key us sectors need the protections afforded by the berry amendment the debate over the berry amendment raises several questions among them 1 if the us does not produce solely domestic item or if us manufacturers are at maximum production capabi lity should dod restrict procurement from foreign sources and 2 to what extent do us national security interests and industrial base concerns justify waiver of the specialty metal restri ction this report examines the original intent and purpose of the berry amendment legislative proposals to amend the application of domestic source restrictions as well as options for congress the report will be updated as events warrant

implement the berry amendment the final rule codifies the berry amendment into title 10 of the us code1 media reports indicate that the undersecretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics has considered several legislative proposals to broaden the exceptions provided under the berry amendment inside the pentagon reports john young dods senior acquisition executive has formally submitted proposals to be considered as part of dods submi ssion for the fy2009 national defense authorization bill one such proposal would grant dod authority to waive the requirements of the berry amendment during socalled emergency operations such emergency operations may include military action taken against us adversaries military action in response to an attack with weapons of ma ss destruction or military action resulting from national emergencies declared by the president another proposal would authorize military procurement officials to give contracting preference to indigenous groups for the purpose of expanding economic development in contingency operation 2 dod has also submitted legislative proposal that would amend the berry amendment to permit the purchase of fresh fruits and vegetables from all sources 3 the fy2008 national defense authorization act pl 110181 contains provision section 803 which requires the strategic materials protection board to perform an assessment of the viability of domestic producers of strategic materials the purpose of which is to assess which domestic producers are investing or plan to invest on sustained basis in the development of continued domestic production capability of strategic materials to meet national defense requirements such an assessment will be evaluated in any decision dod makes to grant future waivers for certain items in light of the new requirements dod may review and amend existing rules although it is too early to determine exactly what the impact will be it will largely depend on how dod seeks to interpret the new rules the fy2007 defense authorization act pl 109364 enacted new legislative provision which effectively moved the specialty metal provision out of the berry amendment and into separate section of title 10 4 the specialty metals provision provides protection for strategic materials critical to national security 1 for further information see the defense federal acqui

berets dod awarded the first contract to bancroft an arkansasbased company that had manufactured military headgear since world war i other contracts were awarded to several foreign manufacturing firms five of the foreign firms had production facilities in the peoples republic of china romania sri lanka and other low wage countries to purchase the black berets the defense logistics agency dla 14 granted two waivers of specific restrictions in the berry amendment the first waiver was granted to dod so that the department could purchase military uniforms from foreign sources dla granted this waiver when it determined that us firm could produce sufficient quantity of onepiece black berets by the armys deadline as result there were protests from some segments of domestic manufacturing military and veterans groups members of congress and the public the house small business committee held hearing on may 2 2001 to discuss the statutory authority to waive berry amendment restrictions as well as the concerns of the small business community regarding the contract award process dla granted the second waiver to allow bancroft to retain its contract and continue to produce the black berets for the army even though bancroft used materials from foreign sources bancroft the sole us manufacturer of the onepiece beret had procured materials from two overseas suppliers who in turn had procured material from other foreign sources bancrofts president reported that as early as 1976 dod had been notified that some beret materials were procured from foreign sources on october 4 2002 dod

defined purpose to ensure that us troops wo re military uniforms wholly produced within the united states and to ensure that us troops were fed with food products solely produced in the united states16 other industries such as tools and specialty metals were added later originally enacted on the eve of world war ii it overrode exceptions added to the buy american act of 1933 17 for products procured by the department of defense in 1941 house and senate members held spirited discussions18 over the passage of what has come to be known as the berry amendment alt hough the precise identity of the author of the amendment remains unknown19 several issues were raised during the debate even though the us was not at war congress was concerned that the nation be prepared for adversity and thus provided the impetus for such legislation some policymakers were also concerned that despite the enactment of the buy american act in 1933 one department of the federal government had reportedly purchased meat from argentina li kewise another department had reportedly contracted to purchase large quantity of wool about 50 of which came from foreign sources questions were raised over the disposal of some 500000000 bushels of surplus wheat with one policymaker noting that wheat products and wheat should be purchased from the production here in the united states when we have such surplus on hand and that our own farmers should be given preference 20 in an expression of that concern the original version of the house bill added provision which required the purchase of american agricultural products in fulfilling national defense needs the senate version initially deleted the provision but later reinstated it broadening the bill to include all agriculture the bill was enacted into law on april 5 1941 16 on april 5 1941 the berry amendment was first enacted as part of the fiscal year fy 1941 fifth supplemental national defense appropriations act pl 7729 10 usc 2241

december 13 2001 the fy2002 national defense authorization act codified and modified the berry amendment repealing sections 9005 and 8109 of the abovementioned bills the berry amendment is now

congressional record vol 87 part 15 77th congress 1st session pp 24602984 and pp 27112720 19 legislative reference specialists suggest but are not certain that the amendment may have been named after george leonard berry dtn who was appointed to serve the remainder of an unexpired us senate term 193738 due to the death of nathan buchman and was defeated for election in the democratic presidential primary of 1938 at age 24 senator berry had been elected president of the international printing pressmen and assistants union in 1907 position he held until his death in 1948 20 statement of james

controversy and the decision of the defense logistics agency to waive the berry amendment provisions and allow the procurement of berets from foreign sources highlighted the need to review the current law and look for ways to improve the effectiveness of the law hr 1352would also add requirement that the secretary of defense notify the house and senate committees on appropriations armed services

g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g501g561 the buy american act baa and the berry amendment are often confused and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably the baa enacted in 1933 is the principal domestic preference statute governing most procurement by the federal government while the berry amendment enacted on the eve of world war ii governs dod procurement only21 the baa seeks to protect domestic labor by giving preference to domestically produced manufactured or homegrown products in government purchases with certain exceptions the berry amendment overrides many of these exceptions primarily for food clothing and specialty metals the two major differences between the baa and the berry amendment are 1 the baa applies only to federal government contracts to be carried out within the us while the berry amendment which is for defense contracts only is not limited to contracts within the us and 2 the baa requires that substantially all of the costs of foreign components not exceed 50 of the cost of all components thus an item can be of 51 domestic content and still be in compliance with the baa while the berry amendment requires that items be 100 domestic in origin it should be noted that there are number of other domestic source provisions which generally govern specific types of procurement these provisions are not covered by the baa or the berry amendment these provisions will not be covered in this report but must be considered when determining whether or not specific domestic source provision affects particular type of procurement 22 21 the buy american act 41 usc 10a through 10d as amended enacted in 1933 is the major domestic source restriction governing procurement by all of the federal government it restricts us government procurement by giving preference to domestically produced manufactured or homegrown products for further discussion of the buy american act refer to crs report 97765 the buy american act requiring government procurements

some observers argue that the berry amendment restrictions may not always represent the best value to dod or the federal government nor is there always justifiable national security interest to preserve certain items currently under the berry amendment nevertheless others have asserted that us workers and businesses have an expectation that congress will consider their interests in determining procurement policies number of berry amendment restricted items may be in line with the original purpose and intent based on the end use products that are produced for example certain items like chemical warfare protective clothing composed of ballistic fibers made from textiles may warrant further study specialty metals may be critical and vital to the warfighting effort if they are used for hightech electronics and communications food restrictions on the other hand are not critical and may make it more difficult for dod to take advantage of commercial business practices in an increasingly globalized economy many food suppliers find it difficult to adhere to this restriction as it deviates from standard commercial business practices so some may decline to sell to dod many food suppliers who sell to dod claim they are often forced to adopt unique costly and inefficient business practices to do business with the defense sector 23 economic social and political factors come into play when examining the purpose and intent of the berry amendment if the us becomes dependent on purchasing equipment and supplies from foreign sources what prevents an adversary from cutting off us access to such items or refusing to build militarily critical items in times of crisis or conflict another argument for maintaining the berry amendment restrictions is that they often benefit small minorityowned and disadvantaged businesses which may depend on dod for their viability according to congressional testimony us textile and apparel industries combined have lost approximately 540000 jobs during the 1990s 24 some would argue that the berry amendment is still relevant today because of the tragic events of september 11 2001 there are also concerns over the possibility of future acts of terrorism and the safety and security of the nations food supply some specialty metals and steel products items covered under the berry amendment are produced by distressed us industries one such company bethlehem steel one of the largest us steel manufacturers filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in part because of the competition from cheaper foreignmade and possibly subsidized steel 25 additionally the procurement of certain items like ballistic fibers 23 according to leslie g sarasin of the american frozen food institute affi the berry amendment required dod to procure foods entirely of us origin ingredients often dod was forced to reject multiingredient commercially available food items processed in the us b ecause the domestic origin of all ingredients and com ponents of the product could not be demonstr ated this policy put dod at odds with common commercial practice in the food industry which typically follows us tariff law in determining questions of foreign origin and limited its access to the widest possible selection of products memorandum to the defense acquisition regulations council on affi comments on dods

military troops is restricted to domestic producers under the berry amendment generally proponents of the berry amendment have argued that these types of restrictions are necessary to maintain viable industrial base and that the berry amendment serves as some protection for critical industries by keeping them healthy and viable in times of peace and war however critics argue that the berry amendment can undercut free market competition and may produce other negative effects such as reducing business incentives to modernize causing inefficiency in some industries due to lack of competition and causing higher costs to dod because the military services may pay more for protected products than the market requires critics also contend that the berry amendment promotes us trade policies that might undermine international trade agreements26 for these reasons some believe that this is not the time to change the provisions of the berry amendment arguing that the us should maintain its current capacity at minimum to feed and clothe its military forces

officials have expressed contrasting views about the necessity for the berry amendment former secretary of defense richard cheney27 issued 1989 report to congress called the impact of buy american restrict ions affecting defense procurement the report suggested that an alternative to the berry amendment would be specifically targeted approach to provide dod with the ability to establish assured

according to vice admiral keith w lippert united states navy who is the director of the defense logistics agency the army has adequately equipped all of the us troops with the interceptor body armor in his testimony on march 30 2004 before the house armed services subcommittee on readiness he reported that as we prepared for opera tion iraqi freedom we built on ssons learned fr om previous conflicts our preparations were good in some areas but needed to improve in others ive discussed our joint planning with the services in advance of the operation in some cases actual demand for items exceeded projections for example the small arms protective insertsthe sapi plates youve all heard aboutthe estimated fy2003 requirements were seventeen million dollars for very good reason the protection of our american war fighterthe army increased their requirement for interceptor body armor today all troops in iraq are equipped with interceptor body armor to meet the increased requirement funded requisitions began coming to us in january 2003 by november 2003 we actually bought three hundred seventy million dollars of the sapi plates using exigency contracts awarded within thirty days with an average delivery beginning within eightythree days the army audit agency conducted special inspection of body armor and found that we were timely in making awards and that quality products were delivered on time however sapi producti on right now is constrained by the availability of raw materials mainly the ceramic tiles contained in the plates at present known worldwide production of qualified ballistic packages is limited to twentyfive thousand sapi sets or fifty thousand plates per month 27 secretary of defense march 1989 january 1993 28 for further discussion on

senate conferees stated their expectation that dod would comply with waiver tification requests from the house or senate and ensure that us manufacturer could provide the required item in sufficient quantity or quality before granting future waiver to the berry amendment an amended waiver requirement became law when the berry amendment was codified through the passage of the fy2002 national defense authorization act pl 107107 the 106th congress acted to tighten certain berry amendment provisions the fy1998 national defense authorization act38 directed the dod office of the inspector general to conduct an audit of the fy1998 procurement of military clothing by the army navy air force and marine corps to determine whether contracting officers complied with the berry amendment and the buy american act the first audit found that 59 percent of those contracts reviewed did not include the appropriate contract language or clause to implement the berry amendment resulting in some 43 violations valued at 14 million and concluded that many of the violations occurred because contracting officials were not fully knowledgeable of the requirements of the berry amendment the audit findings noted that dod procurement officials had agreed to issue policy guidance to contracting officers emphasizing the importance of complying with the berry amendment second audit was later conducted the second audit found that approximately 60 of all contract actions reviewed did not include the appropriate contract clauses to implement the buy american act nor the berry amendment 39 g17g157g145g142g155g561g24g146g142g160g156g561 some proponents of the berry amendment believe that the us military should not be dependent on foreign sources for critical textile products and that dependency on foreign sources for military items could lead to problems with supply demand delays and potentially adversarial relationship with suppliers during times of war or military mobilization furthermore some believe that the berry amendment should be expanded to include other important industries and that new federal agencies like the department of homeland security should be covered by the provisions of the berry amendment however others ie some domestic and foreign companies have criticized the berry amendment stating that it undercuts free market competition may promote discriminatory practices robs businesses of incentives to modernize causes inefficiency in some industries due to lack of competition and results in higher costs to dod be cause the military services pay more for protected products than the market requires some critics of the berry amendment also argue that the us will lose its technological edge in the absence of competition and alienate foreign trading partners thereby provoking retaliations and loss of foreign sales they assert that 38 pl 10585 enacted november 18 1997 39 us department of defense audit of the procurement of military

us to negotiate and persuade its allies to sell or not sell to developing countries they contend that the berry amendment promotes us trade policies that undermine the international trade agreements furthermore restrictions on food mean that in most cases it is illegal for dod to purchase an item or food if it is foreign item or if it has any foreign ingredient or processing on the other hand critics have also expressed concern over the increased levels of imported ready to wear goods and the prevalent sweat shop conditions of foreign markets gao report has questioned whether the berry amendment is sufficient protection for the defense industrial base and whether alternatives and solutions exist to keep critical industries healthy and viable in times of peace and war the report was in response to request from the house armed services committee directing gao to dete rmine whether dla is properly implementing applicable statutory and regulatory guidance for best value purchases and to solicit dla views on the domestic clothing and textile supplier base gao officials acknowledged that the berry amendment was positive factor in helping dod to maintain domestic supplier for some of dods unique military needs however officials pointed out that the overall domestic clothing and textile industry was in decline due to declining employment and production levels as well as the implementation of various free trade agreements that may affect different levels of the domestic supply chain as result dla has initiated study to examine both clothing and textile industries 40

eliminate some selected restrictions such as the restrictions on food eliminating the restrictions on purchasing food items with less than 100 domestic content would allow us food suppliers to use more commercial business practices that are more cost effective this move would arguably promote more competition and interest in selling food to dod for example some in dod believe that elimination

this restriction makes it more difficult to do business with dod the pentagon believes that th food provisions of the buy american act would continue to provide us food suppliers significant advantage over foreign suppliers likewise congress could eliminate or modify the clothing restriction allowing dod to find the best item for the most competitive price41 dod has reportedly known for 25 years that it does not produce solely domestic beret42 one alternative would be for restricted items to be classified according to prioritized system with hightech and low tech classifications which each could have different waiver requirements some military uniform components such as the beret could be classified as lowtech and therefore could be procured without waiver this option would be opposed

hr 1588 the fy2004 national defense authorization act section 829 titled requirement relating to purchases by department of defense subject to buy american act would have broadened the definition of what makes an item domestic in origin in section 829 an item was defined as domestic and covered under the buy american act if it was at least 65 domestic in origin adoption of this provision would have provided dod the authority to procure items that may be combination of both domestic and foreign in origin this provision alone would represent significant departure from the 100 domestic requirement of the berry amendment and more closely parallel the provisions of the baa 43 however this provision was dropped in the final version of the bill 41 however the american manufacturing
