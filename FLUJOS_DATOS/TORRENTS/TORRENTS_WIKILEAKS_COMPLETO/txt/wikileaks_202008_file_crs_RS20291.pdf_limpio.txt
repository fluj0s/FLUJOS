composed of 95 national science counc ils or academies including the us national academy of sciences icsu was formerly calle d the international council of scientific unions the official goal of wcs was to analyze where the natural sciences stand today and where they are heading what their social impact has been and what society expects from them1 it sought to establish guide lines to make science responsive to developmental challenges and to write new social contract for science an unofficial and probably more realistic goal was to foster better networking and

left unresolved was the issue of code of conduct for technolog transfer among the more successful followup activities was creation of an intergovernment committee on science and technology for development whose projects were admin istered by the development program through technical agencies such as th food and agricultural organization and through the world bank unesco and the private

httphelixnaturecomwcs5opinion025bhtml 18dickson july 4 1999 op cit outcome the preconference declaration and framework for action reflected divisions between developed and developing nations they embodied some divisive principles and guidelines reflecting third world positions that were for the most part moderated or modified before or during the conference news reports indicate that among the major unofficial benefits of the confer ence were networking among scientists from developed and developing countries and giving scientis ts from the developing countries direct access to key policymakers and h eads of funding agencies from developed countries as well as some insight into the unfamiliar worked of international diplomacy12 however delegates from the devel oping countries reportedly complained that the lack of official preparatory meetings that usually are held before large conferences prevented them from developing c ohesive alliances to support their goals and therefore their demands were diluted13 the conference unanimously endorsed two nonbinding documents the final versions of the aforementioned declaration on science and the us of scientific knowledge statement of policies14 and the science agenda framework for action that suggested guidelines for implementation15 the declaration espoused new social contract between science and society that endorses social support for science funding while encouraging scientists to accep t responsibilities to use all the sciences including social science and engineering to improve quality of life and sustainable development it noted that some scientific advances have also led to environmental degradation and technological disast ers16 and that the scientific co mmunity should engage in discussion with the public over such i ssues as food safety genetically modified foodstuffs and biomedical problems17 also the document emphasized that st development and national resear ch systems were indispensabl to economic development in the developing countries before the conference some sought to ve scientists adopt hippocraticlike oath to conduct ethical science the declaration modified this to pr opose that ethics and social responsibility be part of scientific training18 the documents endorsed efforts to raise the contributions of women to science to create an international network of

percent of their gross national product on research and developmen t as endorsed by the 1979 uncstd20 however it did endorse national regional and interna tional public and private funding to enable developing countries to build needed research and educational infrastructure also the delegates endorsed the idea of recent debt relief initiative by the g8 creditor countries as an appropriate mechanism for developing countries to increase f unding for science and education the framework proposed that donor countries and agencies should pool resources and strengthen national research systems it also said highquality science education should be brought to remote locations via internetbased systems there was controversy at the conference about balancing protection for ipr while accommodating the views of some developing c ountries that ipr represents monopolistic exploitation of information21 some countries declared thei r ownership and share in the profits of research that uses biological resources and genetic materials within their national boundariesin conflict with th interests of some international companies22 dealing with agribusiness and pharmaceuticals others sought ipr rewards for indigenous knowledge that predated but was used in the scientific revolution the declaration compromised on this point by saying that traditional know ledge systems should be brought closer to modern scientific knowle dgein areas such as the conserva tion of biological diversity the management of natura l resources the understanding of na tural hazards and the mitigation of their impact23 it avoided discussing the patentin g of genetic materi als but endorsed the protection of ipr while recognizing the importance of access to data for scientific progress and the need for mutually supportive measures to protect ipr and dissemination of scientific knowledge the framework said that the world intellectual property organization should constantly address the question of knowledge monopolies and that the world trade organization during new nego tiations of the trade related intellectual property trips agreement should incorpor ate into this agreement tools aimed at financing the advancement of science in th south with the full involvement of the scientific community 24 it also called on governments to develop legal frameworks to accommodate the specific requirements of developing countries and traditional knowledge sources and products to ensure their recognition and ad equate protection on the basis of the informed consent of th customary or traditional owners of this knowledge25 t h framework endorsed research netw orks regional st parks technology incubators and assistance to sm all businesses before the conference developing countries

the framework more moderately said that unesco may catalyse more symmetric and closer interaction of science and tec hnology personnel across the world and the establishment of worldclass education and research infrastructure in the developing countries27 before the conference the president of the us national academy of sciences proposed to create an interacademy center modeled on the us national research council to assemble interna tional expert panels to advi the and the world bank on strelated issues this expands upon the collaboration in the interacademy panel on international issues an informal informa tion exchange network of 80 national science academies that will meet in may 200028 the british science museumbritish association for the advancement of science pr oposed to establish an international center for the communication of science for journalis ts broadcasters and exhibition organizers from developing countries29 the conference did not endor these specific proposals but it endorsed programs to train journalists and others to increase public awareness and supported strengthening international scientific advisory processes in cooperation with agencies and international scientific organizations the framework document said icsu and unesco should followup by developing initiatives for cooperation with the organiza tions and bilateral donor s but that national governments and regional organizations also were responsible for action if there were us followup it would probably be likely to occur via bilateral aid and through international organizations to which this nati on belongs the united states withdrew from unesco in 198430 but participates in selected unesco programs deemed in the us national interest there is debate over whether the united states should rejoin unesco31 in addition the united states currently owes the more than 1 billion for its assessed contributions to the regula r budget and peacekeeping accounts congress has linked funding for these arrears to reform s it expects the to carry out legislation s 886 was passed in the senate to authorize funding to pay dues32 however congress has limited the total us funds availa ble for contributions to all international organizations making us return to unesco unlikely in the immediate future since us contribution to the unesco regular budget would have to come from the same limited state department appropriations account for in ternational organizations
