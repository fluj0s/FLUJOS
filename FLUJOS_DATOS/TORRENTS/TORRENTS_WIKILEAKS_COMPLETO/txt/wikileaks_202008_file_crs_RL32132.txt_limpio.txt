summary demographic challenges posed by the growing elderly population and demands for greater public commitment to home and communitybased care by persons with disabilities of all ages have drawn the attention of federal and state policymakers for some time spending on longterm care in both the public and private sectors is significant in 2001 spending for longterm care services for persons of all ages represented 122 of all personal health care spending almost 152 billion of 124 trillion federal and state governments accounted for almost twothirds of this spending by far the primary payor for longterm care is the federalstate medicaid program which paid for almost half of all longterm care spending in 2001 many states have devoted significant efforts to respond to the desire for home and communitybased care for persons with disabilities and their families nevertheless the financing of nursing home care chiefly by medicaid still dominates most states spending for longterm care today to assist congress in understanding the issues that states face in providing longterm care services crs undertook study of 10 states in 2002 this report which will not be updated presents background and analysis about longterm care in oregon oregon is recognized leader in home and communitybased care and has more than 20 years of experience in moving longterm care clients from institutional settings to home and communitybased settings in 2002 82 of oregons medicaid longterm care clients were served in the community additionally oregon was the only state in the nation whose spending for institutional care was less than half of the states total medicaid longterm care spending in 2000 with only 372 spent on institutional care compared to the national average of approximately 70 in 1981 clear preference for home and communitybased services was established by the state legislature in senate bill 955 this legislation streamlined the administrative structure and established clear vision for longterm care system that embodies the values of independence dignity privacy and choice it also mandated that any costsavings from reductions in institutional spending be reinvested into system that promotes home and communitybased care the various functions of oregons longterm care system are administered by single division seniors and people with disabilities housed within single state

oregon without their invaluable experience and insight this report would not be possible we would particularly like to acknowledge officials from oregons department of human services seniors and people with disabilities we also would like to thank the numerous advocates and service providers who offered valuable perspectives on the longterm care service delivery system in oregon the authors gratefully acknowledge the excellent assistance of charlotte b foote and angela harris in the production of this report preface demographic challenges posed by the growing elderly population and demands for greater public commitment to home and communitybased care by persons with disabilities of all ages have drawn the attention of federal and state policymakers for some time spending on longterm care by both the public and private sectors is significant in 2001 spending for longterm care services for persons of all ages represented 122 of all personal health care spending almost 152 billion of 124 trillion federal and state governments accounted for almost twothirds of this spending by far the primary payor for longterm care is the federalstate medicaid program which paid for almost half of all us longterm care spending in 2001 in fy2001 federal and state medicaid spending for longterm care was about 75 billion representing over onethird of all medicaid spending over 70 of medicaid longterm care spending was for institutions nursing homes and intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded icfsmr many believe that the current federal financing system paid through medicaid is biased toward institutional care state governments face significant challenges in refocusing their longterm care systems given the structure of current federal financing in this regard many states have devoted significant efforts to expand home and community based services for persons with disabilities and their families nevertheless financing of nursing home care primarily through the medicaid program still dominates most states spending in longterm care today while advocates believe that the federal government should play larger role in providing support for home and communitybased care congress has not yet decided on whether or how to change current federal policy one possibility is that congress may continue an incremental approach to longterm care without major federal involvement leaving to state governments the responsibility for developing strategies that support home and communitybased care within existing federal funding constraints and program rules to assist congress in its consideration of options for any future federal policy and to assist policymakers in understanding issues that states face in the development of longterm care services the congressional research service crs undertook study of 10 states in 2002 the research was undertaken to review state policies on longterm care as well as trends in both institutional and home and communitybased care for persons with disabilities the elderly persons with mental retardation and other adults with disabilities the research included review of state documents and data on longterm care as well as national data sources on spending interviews were held with state officials responsible for longterm care wide range of stakeholders and in some cases members or staff of state legislatures the 10 states included in the study are arizona florida illinois indiana louisiana maine oklahoma oregon pennsylvania and texas states were chosen according to number of variables including geographic distribution demographic trends and approaches to financing administration and delivery of longterm care services this report presents background and analysis about longterm care in oregon and is one of series of crs state reports on longterm care crs review of 10 states home and communitybased services states seek to change the face of longterm care oregon introduction federal legislative perspective states choosing to modify their programs for the social security amendments of 1965 which longterm care face created the medicaid program required states to significant challenges provide skilled nursing facility services under their financing of nursing home state medicaid plans and gave nursing home care the care has dominated longterm same level of priority as hospital and physician services care spending for decades the federal financing section 1902 state plan for medical assistance structure that created must provide for inclusion of some institutional and incentives to support some noninstitutional care and services and effective july 1 1967 provide for inclusion of at least institutional care reaches 1 inpatient hospital services 2 outpatient back to 1965 number of hospital services 3 other laboratory and xray converging factors have services 4 skilled nursing home services other than supported reliance on nursing services in an institution for tuberculosis or mental home spending prior to diseases for individuals 21 years of age or older 5 physicians services pl 8997 july 30 1965 enactment of medicaid homes for the aged and other public institutions were financed by combination of direct payments made by individuals with their social security old age assistance oaa benefits and vendor payments made by states with federal matching payments on behalf of individuals the kerrmills medical assistance to the aged maa program enacted in 1960 predecessor to medicaid allowed states to provide medical services including skilled nursing home services to persons who were not eligible for oaa cash payments thereby expanding the eligible population1 in 1965 when kerrmills was transformed into the federalstate medicaid program congress created an entitlement to skilled nursing facility care under the expanded program the social security amendments of 1965 required that states provide skilled nursing facility services and gave nursing home care the same level of priority as hospital and physician services amendments in 1967 allowed states to provide care in intermediate care facilities icfs for persons who did not need 1 crs report 83181 nursing home legislation issues and policies by maureen baltay archived and available from authors upon request crs2 skilled nursing home care but needed more than room and board in 1987 congress eliminated the distinction between skilled nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities effective in 1990 as result of these various amendments people eligible under the states medicaid plan are entitled to nursing home facility care that is if person meets the states income and asset requirements as well as the states functional eligibility requirements for entry into nursing home he or she is entitled to the benefit these early legislative developments were the basis for the modern day nursing home industry significant growth in the number of nursing homes occurred during the 1960s from 1960 to 1970 the number of homes more than doubled from 9582 to almost 23000 and the number of beds more than tripled from 331000 to more than one million2 today there are about 17000 since its inception medicaid has been the predominant nursing homes with 18 payor for nursing home care in 1970 over 1 billion was million beds3 spent on nursing home care through medicaid and medicare federal and state medicaid payments during the latter part of accounted for almost all of this spending 87 the 1960s and the 1970s medicaid spending for nursing home care grew by 50 in the 3year period beginning in 1967 nursing home care attracted great deal of congressional in fy2001 medicaid spent 531 billion on institutional oversight as result of care for nursing homes and care in intermediate care concern about increasing facilities for the mentally retarded federal expenditures and instances of fraud and abuse that were becoming evident between 1969 and 1976 the subcommittee on long term care of the senate special committee on aging held 30 hearings on problems in the nursing home industry4 home care services received some congressional attention in the authorizing statute home health care services were one of the optional services that states could provide under the 1965 law three years later in 1968 congress amended the law to require states to provide home health care services to persons entitled to skilled nursing facility care as part of their state medicaid plans effective in 1970 during the 1970s the department of health education and welfare now health and human services hhs devoted attention to alternatives to nursing home care through variety of federal research and demonstration efforts these efforts were undertaken not only to find ways to offset the high costs of nursing facility care but also to respond to the desires of persons with disabilities to remain in their homes and 2 us congress senate special committee on aging

congress senate special committee on aging nursing home care in the united states failure of public policy washington 1974 and supporting papers published in succeeding years crs3 in community settings rather than in institutions however it was not until 1981 that congress took significant legislative action to expand home and communitybased services through medicaid when it authorized the medicaid section 1915c home and communitybased waiver program under that authority known then as the section 2176 waiver program the secretary of hhs may waive certain medicaid state plan requirements to allow states to cover wide range of home and communitybased services to persons who otherwise meet the states eligibility requirements for institutional care the waiver provision was designed to alter the fact that the medicaid program had emphasized institutional care rather than care in home and communitybased settings services under the section 1915c waiver include case management personal care homemaker home health aide adult day care habilitation environmental modifications among many others5 these services are covered as an option of states and under the law persons are not entitled to these services as they are to nursing facility care moreover states are allowed to set cost caps and limits on the numbers and types of persons to be served under their waiver programs notwithstanding wide use of the section 1915c waiver authority by states over the last two decades total spending for medicaid home and communitybased services waivers is significantly less than institutional care about 144 billion in 2001 compared to 531 billion for nursing facility care services and care for persons with mental retardation in intermediate care facilities icfsmr despite this disparity in spending in many states the section 1915c waiver program is the primary source of financial support for wide range of home and communitybased services and funding has been increasing steadily federal and state medicaid support for the waiver programs increased by over 807 from fy1990 to fy2001 in constant 2001 dollars the home and communitybased waiver program has been significant source of support to care for persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities as states have closed large state institutions for these persons over the last two decades nationally in fy2001 almost 75 of section 1915c waiver funding was devoted to providing services to these individuals states administer their longterm care programs against this backdrop of federal legislative initiatives first the entitlement to nursing home care and requirement to provide home health services to persons entitled to nursing home care and second the option to provide wide range of home and communitybased services through waiver of federal law within statedefined eligibility requirements service availability and limits on numbers of persons served 5 states may waive the following medicaid requirements 1 statewideness states may cover services in only portion of the state rather than in all geographic jurisdictions 2 comparability of services states may cover stateselected groups of persons rather than all persons otherwise eligible and 3 financial eligibility requirements states may use more liberal income requirements for persons needing home and communitybased waiver services than would otherwise apply to persons living in the community for further information see crs report rl31163 longterm care profile of medicaid 1915c home and communitybased services waivers by carol oshaughnessy and rachel kelly crs4 crs review of ten states report on oregon in the late 1970s and early 1980s medicaid expenditures for longterm care in oregons nursing homes were skyrocketing from 1974 to 1979 the number of medicaid clients being served in nursing facilities increased by more than 30 while the population aged 75 and older was increasing by only 146 the rate of inflation for institutional longterm care was more than 100 annually7 although the oregon department of human services dhs was created in 1971 to unify fragmented service delivery system in the state the offices responsible for longterm care continued to have separate budgets and administrative leadership in order to address these concerns oregons state legislature decided to drastically reshape its medicaid longterm care program in 1981 the state legislature combined the states unit on aging and its medicaid longterm care program this new division within dhs was charged with containing the costs of longterm care while at the same time promoting the option of home and communitybased care over nursing facility care over the last 20 years state officials have strived to create coordinated system of longterm care where nursing homes are the placement of last resort the number of medicaid clients receiving home and community based services has been steadily rising in 2002 82 of medicaid longterm care clients were receiving home and communitybased care compared with only 40 of clients in 1985868 this dramatic increase is due in part to the diverse home and community based care options provided by the state these options include range of supported housing arrangements such as assisted living facilities residential care facilities adult foster care as well as inhome care where clients may select their own caregivers in 2001 the state legislature directed the states principal longterm care agency seniors and disabled services division to administer programs for persons with developmental disabilities this new agency seniors and people with disabilities plans to increase the availability of home and communitybased care for persons with developmental disabilities by expanding one of the states medicaid section 1915c home and communitybased waivers state officials acknowledged that many of the barriers that have inhibited other states attempts to develop comprehensive home and communitybased service options were not felt as acutely in oregon initial opposition from the nursing home industry was overcome by legislative and advocacy support citizens and

have documented many of the innovative policies the state has instituted in the development of its longterm care system number of reports have concluded with similar findings among other things oregons success in moving clients to home and communitybased settings can be attributed to the legislative mandate to reinvest any costsavings from reductions in institutional care into the development of system that promotes home and communitybased care the centralization of administrative responsibility in providing long term care services the use of public funds for services that are appealing to consumers such as assisted living facilities adult foster homes and inhome services where clients may select their caregivers the level of involvement of communitybased area agencies on aging established by title iii of the older americans act in the local administration of longterm care programs and their promotion of home and communitybased services through consumerfriendly websites and telephone hotline services and state legislation that allows unlicenced caregivers to be trained by nurses to provide certain medical services to longterm care clients in spite of oregons achievements in reorienting its longterm care system officials recognize that with the aging baby boom population and increasing costs of longterm care they may need to rethink the design of their current system to meet the challenges ahead this report provides an analysis of oregons longterm care system and is one in series of 10 crs reports on state longterm care systems crs6 summary overview9 overview oregon recognized leader in home and communitybased care has over 20 years of experience in shifting state resources from institutional longterm care to home and communitybased care clear preference for promoting home and communitybased services over institutional care was established by the state legislature in 1981 oregons guiding principles in longterm care are to embody the human values of independence dignity privacy and choice demographic trends an aging population poses challenges for the state its population age 85 and older the group in greatest need for longterm care services grew by 48 from 19902000 ranking 18th highest in the nation persons aged 85 and over with two or more limitations in activities in daily living adls are estimated to grow by 38 by 2010 oregons population age 65 and older is expected to increase to 242 of the states population by 2025 compared to 185 in the total united states population administration of longterm care programs unlike most other states the various functions of oregons long term care system are administered by single division seniors and people with disabilities spd and housed within single state agency the department of human services this centralized administration shares common vision to eliminate any bias towards institutional care area agencies on aging aaas have been given strong leadership role in oregons longterm care system aaas can choose to administer longterm care programs for the elderly and younger people with disabilities trends in institutional care over the last two decades the state has developed number of methods to control nursing home utilization these include certificate of need program which requires nursing facilities to 9 information based on oregon data and documents national data and interviews with state officials this report does not discuss programs for persons with mental illness it also generally excludes discussion of programs for infants and children with disabilities other than those serving persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities crs7 obtain permission from spd before new facilities are built or old facilities are expanded preadmission screening program for both private and medicaid clients extensive use of the medicaid section 1915c home and communitybased waivers and statefunded program oregon project independence that encourages the use of home and communitybased services as result of oregons strategies to control nursing home utilization state officials indicate that the disability levels of nursing home residents have increased dramatically this is attributed to greater use of home and communitybased services that delay entry into nursing facilities since the state first implemented its home and communitybased services waiver in 1981 the utilization of nursing homes for medicaid clients has steadily declined between 1996 and 2001 there was 172 decrease in the number of nursing home residents and 10 decline in the nursing facility occupancy rate trends in home and communitybased care in 2002 approximately 82 of oregons medicaid longterm care clients were served in the community up from 53 in 1990 oregon administers wide range of home and communitybased services though single medicaid 1915c home and community based waiver for seniors and adults with disabilities services include adult foster care assisted living facilities residential care facilities and inhome services which allow residents to remain in their homes and select their caregiver the state has made extensive use of the section 1915c medicaid waiver program to provide home and communitybased services to persons with developmental disabilities as of june 2001 there were only 50 clients with developmental disabilities being served in the states only intermediate care facility for persons with mental retardation icfsmr oregon has developed unique statefunded home and community based service program oregon project independence opi which provides services to persons who cannot afford the full cost of home and communitybased care and are not enrolled in medicaid the program is designed to delay entry into the states medicaid program longterm care spending in fy2000 oregon spent over 712 million on medicaid longterm care unlike most other states oregon spent approximately two thirds of these dollars on home and community based services and only onethird on institutional services from 1990 to 2001 medicaid spending for home and community based services increased by almost 560 in constant dollars whereas spending for institutional care increased by only 105 crs8 in 2001 only 1 of medicaid longterm care spending went to intermediate care facilities for persons with developmental disabilities compared with almost 14 for the us as whole unlike many other states where nursing home expenditures represent significant portion of both medicaid spending as well as medicaid longterm care spending in oregon spending for nursing home care is significantly less representing about 20 of medicaid spending and about onethird of medicaid longterm care spending in fy2000 issues in financing and delivery of longterm care in oregon many of the staffing shortages experienced by other states are ameliorated by the states nurse delegation program and the client employed provider program nurse delegation allows licensed registered nurses to delegate certain nursing tasks to unlicenced caregivers through the states client employed provider cep program individuals may select caregiver with formal longterm care training the caregiver is then trained to administer the clients care plan in spite of the success of this program state officials are concerned about potential staffing shortages of frontline longterm care personnel in the future waiting lists for services for persons with developmental disabilities have been persistent problem in oregon recent litigation resulted in settlement agreement which requires the state to increase funding for home and communitybased services for persons with developmental disabilities by cumulative total of 350 million by 2007 recent state budget cuts have greatly impacted oregons longterm care system longterm care spending was reduced by nearly 30 for the current state fiscal year as of april 2003 over 4792 persons were longer eligible to receive medicaid longterm care services over 16 of total program participants with potentially more cuts needed in the future in addition to reducing the number of people eligible for medicaid the state also eliminated inhome supports for 3800 seniors who were not eligible for medicaid reduced reimbursement rates to medicaid longterm care providers by 15 to 30 and eliminated the states medically needy program for 8757 individuals oregon administrators recognize that with the aging population and increasing costs of longterm care they may need to rethink the design of their current longterm care system they hope to incorporate concept of bounded choice where an individuals wishes are considered within the boundaries of service capacity and fiscal constraints crs9 demographic

and eugene an area that covers less than onethird of the state from the pacific seaboard to about 300 miles inland much of the rural eastern area of the state is sparsely populated in 2000 128 of oregons residents were over the age of 65 only slightly above the national average of 124 from 19902000 oregons total elderly population grew by 12 but its population age 85 and older those in greatest need for longterm care services grew by 48 the proportion of oregons population aged 85 and older is the 18th largest in the nation from 1990 to 2000 the state experienced 26 increase in the

according to state officials large part of the success of oregons longterm care system stems from its administrative structure oregons system is one of the few in the country to consolidate all of the various administrative and service functions into single state agency the goal of state officials over the last 20 years partially in response to several state legislative mandates has been the creation of seamless system for seniors and people with disabilities that favors care in community settings rather than in nursing homes or other institutions in 1981 on the final day of one of the longest legislative sessions in oregons history the state legislature passed senate bill 955 drastically reshaping oregons longterm care system the bill consolidated the states unit on aging and its medicaid longterm care program creating the senior services division which later became the seniors and disabled services division and is now seniors and people with disabilities the new division was charged with containing the costs of longterm care while at the same time creating longterm care system that supported the preference of people with disabilities for home and communitybased services vision was articulated in the legislation for longterm care system that embodies the human values of independence dignity privacy and choice10 in testimony to the us senate special committee on aging in 1998 roger auerbach the director of the seniors and disabled services division stated that the 10 oregon state legislature senate bill 955 1981 crs12 crisis oregon faced was partially the product of the fragmentation and bureaucracy created by piecemeal legislative responses without clear vision of how system should be built the success we have to date is really proportionate to the clarity of our vision that vision which is now very clear is one of consumercentered individualized program delivered by coordinated accessible system11 the most recent reorganization spearheaded by the legislature in 2001 consolidated all state longterm care functions into the single division of seniors and people with disabilities spd one of seven divisions within the department of human services it is unique among longterm care systems in the united states in that it incorporates the states medicaid agency the state unit on aging the state unit on developmental disabilities and the longterm care regulatory agency under single administrative structure and budget figure 2 portrays the primary functions performed by spd and local agencies that collectively make up oregons longterm care system those functions are financial and functional determination of eligibility licensing and protective services financial reimbursement management of services for elderly and disabled persons and the management of services for persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities each of these functions is described in detail in the following sections 11 roger auerbach reforming the delivery system testimony before the us senate special committee on aging mar 3 1998 crs13 figure 2 oregon longterm care system source chart prepared by the congressional research service crs based on oregons state documents crs14 management of services for seniors and other persons with disabilities at the state level supervision of longterm care services for the elderly and persons with disabilities resides within the division of seniors and people with disabilities spd spd either contracts with area agencies on aging aaas to provide these services or uses state employees housed within the county offices of the department of human services dhs to administer medicaid and other long term care programs these offices serve as single points of entry for variety of services available in state local administration oregons longterm care service delivery system is built on diverse network of community organizations and state offices to provide care at the local level the law creating the current longterm care system supported strong role for the states area agencies on aging aaas and allows for significant local control spd contracts with aaas that wish to administer longterm care programs in the state in areas where the aaa chooses not to provide services primarily in the rural areas of eastern oregon state employees within the county human services office administer longterm care services and programs the result is that local service providers and administrators can choose the most appropriate administrative structure for their localities there are three types of service delivery models in oregon type type b1 and type b2 each type of delivery system is described below type in this service delivery model the aaa administers programs and services funded by the older americans act and the statefunded oregon project independence opi program for seniors aged 60 and over in type area the state operates local multi service office housed within the county human services office to administer medicaid for longterm care clients state employees develop care plans provide ongoing case management and license and monitor longterm care facilities for seniors and adults with physical disabilities there are 19 type areas in oregon type b1 in this service delivery model the aaa administers programs and services funded by the older americans act the state funded opi program for persons 60 and older and the states medicaid longterm care program for seniors 65 and over it does not provide medicaid services to people with physical disabilities who are under the age of 65 or to individuals with developmental disabilities in type b1 area the state operates local disability service office housed within the county human services office to administer medicaid and other state programs for longterm care clients not served by the aaa there are seven type b1 areas in oregon type b2 this service delivery model administers all of the same programs that type b1 agencies may administer but also serves adults aged 18 to 64 with physical disabilities people with developmental disabilities are served in the disability service office there are eight type b2 areas in oregon crs15 for the last several decades oregons department of human services has attempted to integrate its service delivery systems throughout the state oftentimes clients with complex needs were forced to visit multiple social service offices and provide the same information to multiple case workers in order to make it easier for clients to navigate the social service system in oregon the department has developed wrong door approach to service provision client should be able to walk into any area agency on aging or county dhs office to determine initial eligibility for variety of programs such as medicaid food stamps tanf and statefunded programs such as opi oregon has attempted to utilize the structure of the area agencies on aging to serve as an information center for variety of social service programs in the state management of services for persons with developmental disabilities in 2001 the state legislature mandated that spd administer programs for persons with developmental disabilities at the local level county dhs offices employ staff to provide case management services other services are subcontracted to local providers which typically specialize in serving individuals with developmental disabilities licensing spd is responsible for licensing longterm care facilities and ensuring that quality care is delivered in both nursing homes and home and communitybased settings oregons licensing process includes inspection reporting on inspection outcomes or complaint investigations and sanctioning deficient facilities in spite of these regulatory responsibilities officials in the office of licensing and quality of care housed within spd have attempted to move away from strictly punitive approach and adopt model that offers technical assistance and problem solving to encourage continuous quality improvement protective services spd is responsible for adult protective services for seniors and people with disabilities in home and community settings and licensed facilities state laws provide for mandatory reporting of elder abuse local area agency on aging and state office personnel complete investigations and provide needed protection spd is also responsible for abuse prevention and statewide educational activities to strengthen awareness and partnerships for community interventions case management case managers are critical to implementing oregons preference for home and communitybased care over nursing home care case managers take on variety of roles in the states longterm care system in addition to managing clients care plans performing preadmission screenings and determining client eligibility for medicaid case managers also monitor nursing facilities and communitybased care facilities because home and communitybased care requires more rigorous oversight by case managers to ensure the best placement of clients spd regulates the number of individuals case manager can serve depending on the type of care he or she is receiving in nursing facilities the staffing ratio is one case worker per 130 clients in adult foster care the staffing ratio is one case worker per 79 clients in residential care facilities and assisted living facilities the staffing ratio is one case worker per 100 clients and for inhome services the staffing ratio is one case worker per 69 crs16 clients depending on the type of service area where client resides case managers are employed by either the local area agencies on aging the disability service office or the multiservice office financial and functional eligibility determinations information about financial eligibility for medicaid and other state programs is gathered at the local level by caseworkers in the area agencies on aging the disability service office or the multiservice office although initial decisions on financial eligibility are made locally state officials within spd make the final eligibility determination functional eligibility is also determined at the local level in order to assist case managers in making eligibility determinations spd has developed number of automated tools to streamline the process the client assessment and planning system caps is computer system that assists caseworkers in determining eligibility and assigning service priority levels service priority level is number between 1 and 11 that identifies an individuals longterm care needs based on limitations in activities of daily living adls caseworker will make number of assessments about clients need for assistance input information into the computer system and caps will automatically return decision about eligibility and if appropriate assign service priority level to be considered functionally eligible for medicaid services client must be assigned service priority level table 4 once the assessment is complete case managers work with the client to determine the most appropriate setting incorporating variety of factors such as informal supports and client wishes service plan is developed and periodically changed to meet the needs of the client caps also provides caseworkers with assistance in developing service plans that are appropriate for each priority level changes in functional eligibility requirements due to budget reductions after statewide ballot initiative to increase taxes was defeated by voters in january 2003 seniors and people with disabilities had to reduce its long term care spending by nearly 30 for the current state fiscal year spd decided to cut funding for individuals who were assigned service priority levels of 12 through 17 table 5 as of april 2003 over 4792 persons had lost medicaid longterm care services over 16 of total program participants with potentially more cuts needed in the future of the residents who lost medicaid services 3834 were receiving inhome services 765 were residing in communitybased assisted housing arrangements and 193 were residing in nursing facilities spd worked with the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms to make changes to their current waiver to provide limited transitional services for those who longer qualify for medicaid

care services for the elderly and persons with disabilities trends in institutional care since the state first implemented its home and communitybased services waiver on december 21 1981 the utilization of nursing homes for medicaid clients has steadily declined between 1996 and 2001 there was 172 decrease in the number of nursing home residents12 according to the dhs performance measurement report in june of 2001 only 221 of all seniors receiving medicaid longterm care services and 9 of all adults aged 1864 with disabilities were served in nursing facilities13 in 2001 there were 151 nursing facilities operating in oregon serving approximately 9444 persons14 the number of beds per 1000 elderly persons is considerably less than the national average in 2000 there were approximately 31 beds per 1000 persons aged 65 and older and 235 beds per 1000 elderly persons aged 85 and older as compared to 53 and 435 respectively for the united states table 6 at the beginning of oregons efforts to expand home and community based services in 1981 the number of nursing home beds per 1000 persons aged 65 and older in oregon was roughly equal to the national average15 the occupancy rate for oregons nursing homes in 2001 was 728 somewhat lower than the national average of 808 table 6 over the last two decades the state has developed number of methods to control nursing home utilization these include certificate of need program which requires nursing facilities to obtain permission from spd before new facilities are built or old facilities are expanded preadmission screening program for both private and medicaid clients and extensive use of the medicaid section 1915c home and communitybased waiver as result of these strategies to control nursing home utilization state officials indicate that the characteristics of nursing home residents have changed over the last 2 decades disability levels of patients have increased dramatically this is attributed in part to greater use of home and communitybased services that delays entry into nursing facilities 12 steven r gregory and mary jo gibson across the states 2002 profiles in longterm care oregon 2002 aarp

implementation of the medicaid 1915c waiver program for seniors and adults with physical disabilities in 1981 oregon became the first state in the nation to implement section 1915c waiver program on statewide basis this waiver program resulted in decreased reliance on nursing homes in part because state officials decided at the programs inception to offer residents equal access to home and communitybased care with caps on the number of people who could be served by the waiver and waiting lists for services because area agencies on aging or state employees of spd determine eligibility for both home and communitybased services and nursing facility services they are able to inform clients of all available longterm care options according to state officials case managers are encouraged to arrange care plans so that individuals who do not wish to enter nursing facility are able to find suitable alternatives at home or in the community preadmission screening in 1989 oregon adopted prenursing home admission screening program oregon requires all prospective nursing home residents to be screened before entering nursing facility patients level of impairment is evaluated and home and communitybased service options are discussed with the client and family members partially as result of this screening process the rate of hospital discharges directly into nursing homes is significantly lower than the national average16 16 unpublished documents from the oregon health care association 2002 crs20 certificate of need in the 1970s oregon instituted certificate of need program to control and downsize the number of nursing facilities in the state in order to build new nursing facility or expand an existing facility provider must receive dhs approval for medicaid beds the state reviews an application from provider on casebycase basis using the following criteria nursing facility bed occupancy in the service area availability of home and communitybased services in the area and economic and financial feasibility this procedure is intended to complement spds goal of promoting home and communitybased services over institutional care by controlling the number of nursing home beds that enter the market trends in home and communitybased care according to state reports between 1985 and 2000 the number of medicaid clients in need of longterm care served in home and communitybased settings increased by 22417 in 2002 approximately 815 of the states medicaid clients received home and communitybased services as opposed to only 185 in nursing facilities oregon supports wide range of home and communitybased services for the elderly and persons with physical disabilities which are primarily provided through medicaid section 1915c waiver and statefunded program oregon project independence for persons who are not receiving medicaid while many states have multiple waivers targeted to specific eligibility groups oregon has single waiver to fund all home and communitybased medicaid services for seniors and adults with physical disabilities the state has developed variety of innovative polices that encourage home and communitybased care under its waiver oregon was one of the first states in the nation to use its waiver to support services in assisted living facilities it is one of the only states to develop large adult foster care system and its use of unlicenced caregivers through its client employed provider program has dramatically increased the number of individuals that can be served in their homes medicaid 1915c waiver for seniors and persons with physical disabilities oregon operates single medicaid waiver program for the elderly and adults with physical disabilities in order to qualify for medicaid services persons must have income that does not exceed 300 of the supplemental security income ssi level 1656 per month in 2003 and must meet ssis resource limit of 2000 for an individual18 for some individuals who do not meet these requirements the state operates miller trust that permits additional income and resources to be 17 seniors and people with disabilities the oregon model dec 2001 at

approved in 1981 this waiver has been the primary alternative to nursing home care for adults with physical disabilities in 2001 the estimated average cost per client under the waiver was 5558 per year approximately 42242 persons are expected to receive longterm care services under this waiver for state fiscal years sfy 2001 to 2003 the waiver provides wide range of home and communitybased services including respite care adult day health specialized medical equipment environmental accessibility adaptations transportation home delivered meals specialized living services and inhome services for individuals who are not served in their own homes the waiver provides longterm care in community settings including adult foster care residential facility care and assisted living facility care in 2002 815 of oregons medicaid longterm care clients received home or communitybased services under this waiver see table 7 of these clients 466 were served in their homes 17 were served in adult foster homes 12 were served in assisted living facilities and 6 were served in residential care facilities client employed provider program the majority of oregons inhome services are provided through the client employed provider cep program the cep program allows medicaid clients to hire and supervise their own care providers clients may select their own caregiver such as friends or relatives or they can be assisted in their search for provider by the local aaa or county dhs office although ceps are selfemployed the state pays unemployment insurance and the social security fica payments on behalf of the cep state officials indicate that this program which allows unlicenced caregivers to provide longterm care services has greatly expanded the states ability to provide home and communitybased services nurse delegation and contract registered nursing services in 1987 the state legislature amended its nurse practice act to allow licensed registered nurses to delegate certain medical tasks to unlicenced caregivers such as client employed providers or workers in adult foster homes as result of this legislation nurses may train caregivers in certain home and communitybased settings to perform almost all nursing tasks except for certain types of injections once an assessment is made by the nurse to ensure that client is in stable condition care plan is developed handson training is provided to the caregiver and nursing tasks are delegated in writing the nurse delegate must periodically assess clients health and review the care plan in 1994 the state developed system of contract registered nursing services which expanded the states ability to use nurse delegates for its medicaid home and communitybased waiver program there are currently 150 nurses under contract with spd providing nurse delegation services for medicaid longterm care clients 19 for more information on miller trusts and medicaid eligibility refer to crs report rl31413 medicaid

need of longterm care who want to live at home state officials indicated that many people in need of home and communitybased care do not feel comfortable depleting almost all of their liquid assets that may be needed for household expenses and emergencies one of the ways that oregon has addressed this concern is through statefunded program oregon project independence opi opi offers home and communitybased services to persons with income up to 200 of the poverty level with resource or asset test funded entirely by state revenues opi provides longterm care services for oregonians over the

mental retardation and developmental disabilities overview services to persons with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities in the united states have changed dramatically over the last half of the 20th century as result of number of converging factors these include the advocacy efforts of families and organized constituency groups various changes to the social security law that provided payments to individuals through ssi and ssdi and to service providers through the medicaid program and significant litigation brought on behalf of persons with developmental disabilities20 oregons system of services for persons with developmental disabilities has been influenced by number of significant factors these include the initiation of the section 1915c medicaid home and community based waiver services option in 1981 the plan for universal access to services for people with developmental disabilities initiated by the oregon state legislature in 1999 the 2000 settlement agreement of staley v kitzhaber which requires the state to increase funding for developmental disabilities services by cumulative total of 350 million by 2007 and the incorporation of the mental health and developmental disability services division into the division of seniors and people with disabilities in 2001 there are an estimated 15500 persons of all ages that meet oregons definition of developmentally disabled21 of these approximately 8400 are adults and 7100 are children in fy2000 total spending for services for persons with developmental disabilities was 3547 million table 13 spending for home and community based services represented 90 of total expenditures this is dramatic shift from 1990 spending levels when only 41 of spending was devoted to communitybased

begun during the latter part of the 19th century and continuing through the first part of the 20th century between 1920 and 1967 institutions quadrupled in size and resident totals peaked at almost 200000 individuals nationwide in 165 freestanding stateoperated mental retardation institutional facilities23 today some states are still faced with the legacy of large stateoperated institutions in many states and in oregon most stateoperated institutions have been closed or downsized development that has often been prompted by litigation in 1908 oregon opened fairview its first statefunded institution to care for individuals with developmental disabilities and mental retardation by the early 1960s thousands of persons received care in three staterun institutions in salem pendleton and the dalles today after decadeslong process of moving persons with developmental disabilities into communitybased group homes and residential settings there is only one remaining stateoperated institution in oregon the eastern oregon training center in pendleton with 50 residents in 2001 see appendix 2 for list of the institutions that have been closed persons living in large institutions

reduce the number and size of intermediate care facilities for persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities icfsmr as in many states the medicaid section 1915c waiver program has been the chief source of revenue for home and communitybased services for persons with developmental disabilities in 1981 oregon applied for and received waiver that would serve as an alternative to one of the two staterun institutions by 2001 the fairview training center in salem had been closed and only 50 individuals remained in the eastern oregon training center unlike the waiver program for the elderly and physically disabled where the state has waiting lists for services persons with developmental disabilities often face lengthy waiting lists due to limited resources since the focus of the 1981 waiver was to remove individuals from institutions those who were not residing in one of the two state icfsmr often spent years waiting to receive communitybased services in 2000 parents of individuals with developmental disabilities filed suit against the state to challenge the existence of the current waiting lists in staley v kitzhaber the plaintiffs argued that oregon violated federal medicaid law and the americans with disabilities act ada for failing to provide individuals with developmental disabilities the option of home and communitybased longterm care services with reasonable promptness25 the state and the plaintiffs settled the lawsuit in september 2000 the parties agreed that the settlement would apply not only to the plaintiffs named in the suit but also to all other similarlysituated individuals with developmental disabilities under the federal medicaid program thereby treating the lawsuit as class action26 as part of the agreement oregon agreed to implement its state plan for universal access to services for people with developmental disabilities over 6year period between 2001 and 2007 the plan provides for improved access to supportive services such as personal care inhome care respite care and job coaching so long as cost of services does not exceed 20000 annually per client by 2007 after the plan has been fully implemented supportive services must be provided within 90 days after the individual is determined eligible for services comprehensive services or services costing more than 20000 per year will be offered to

approved in 1981 the waiver was designed as an alternative to intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded icfsmr with the goal of reducing the number of individuals in staterun institutions wide range of services are provided under the waiver including respite care day habilitation prevocational services supported employment adult foster care adult group homes supported living services specialized medical equipment and supplies environmental accessibility adaptations transportation family training inhome support services crisis diversion services and extended state plan services

medicaid spending in fy1990 spending has also declined unlike most other states oregon spends dramatically from fy1990 to more on home and communitybased fy2000 in 1990 almost 80 of services through

the services community according to state officials these trends are due to number of factors implemented at varying times during the 1980s and 1990s these include legislative mandate that called for preference in providing communitybased care over nursing home care implementation of the states preadmission screening program to divert patients from nursing homes implementation of oregon project independence for persons who do not meet medicaid financial eligibility requirements significant use of medicaids section 1915c home and communitybased waiver services for persons with mental retardation and closure of large state institutions for the developmentally disabled note that between fy2000 and fy2001 spending for institutional care almost doubled however this is not representative of actual spending trends in oregon figure 4 and table 12 according to state officials this increase is largely due to oregons use of medicaid upper payment limits under medicaid provisions states can be reimbursed by the federal government at the upper payment limit for nursing home services while the providers in the state are reimbursed at lower rate states can use excess funds that result from the gap between the medicare upper 29 this section discusses total medicaid spending both federal and state 30 total medicaid spending using national association of state budget

reimbursement rate paid to providers in oregon the difference between the upper payment limit and the states reimbursement rate to nursing homes was transferred back to dhs in 2001 and used to fund increases in the reimbursement rates to nursing facilities and communitybased care facilities because of these transfers of state and federal funds the 28 increase in institutional spending between

medicaid statute social services block grant title xx of the social security act crs38 issues in longterm care in oregon oregon officials and stakeholders identified issues in the states longterm care system in series of reports over the years the following discussion highlights selected issues identified in reports by researchers task forces and advocacy groups as well as issues that surfaced in crs interviews with state officials providers and consumers institutional bias in federal funding and oregons response recurring theme in discussions of longterm care with state officials is the view that the federal financing system is biased towards institutional care this is largely due to the fact that nursing facility care is an entitlement under medicaid for persons meeting its eligibility criteria financing of institutional care is federal mandate home and communitybased care is not although states may choose to provide home and communitybased services under various medicaid options state officials indicate that state funding constraints and the provider system that was created as result of the institutional entitlement make it difficult to reorient the system although oregon has been successful in providing the majority of its longterm care clients with home and communitybased services many officials believe that the federal system should equally support consumers choice to stay at home or in the community for most states the impetus for heavy reliance on institutional care is embedded in the structure of the federal medicaid system resulting in vast funding disparities between institutional care and home and communitybased care over the last 20 years oregon has relied on number of strategies to ameliorate the institutional bias embedded in that system for example rather than relying on providers to refer hospital patients directly into nursing homes oregon requires most residents to be screened before entering nursing home patients level of impairment is evaluated and home and communitybased service options are discussed with the client and family members partially as result of this screening process the rate of hospital discharges directly into nursing homes is significantly lower than the national average another method to counter institutional bias is to control or downsize institutional capacity oregon controls its institutional capacity by requiring the approval of medicaid beds through the certificate of need process described earlier and through limitation on reimbursements controlling the supply of state institutions for the developmentally disabled differs somewhat from that for nursing homes the state has closed all but one intermediate care facility for persons with developmental disabilities over the past several decades and as of 2001 fewer than 1 of persons with developmental disabilities were served in institutions the state could do so because these facilities were operated by state government virtually all nursing homes in the state are privately owned and therefore controlling or downsizing institutional capacity is not as direct as in the case of stateoperated facilities state officials indicated that federal entitlement to nursing home care should be changed so that nursing homes are an exception rather than the rule in oregon crs39 home and communitybased care is considered first and then if services are judged to be inappropriate or unavailable the alternative is an institutional placement budget cuts recent state budget cuts have greatly impacted oregons long term care system after statewide ballot initiative to increase taxes was defeated by voters in january 2003 the state has been forced to make up its revenue shortfall with drastic cuts in number of social service programs seniors and people with disabilities spd had to reduce its longterm care spending by nearly 30 for the 2003 state fiscal year sfy spd decided to cut funding for individuals whose impairment levels fell within service priority levels 1217 table 5 as of april 2003 over 4792 persons had lost medicaid longterm care services over 16 of total program participants with potentially more cuts needed in the future by choosing to restrict medicaid enrollment through functional eligibility criteria as opposed to caps on 1915c waiver spending for example oregon was able to ensure that institutional services as well as home and community based services were effected by these budget reductions of the residents who lost medicaid services 3834 were receiving inhome services 765 were residing in communitybased assisted housing arrangements and 193 were residing in nursing facilities spd worked with the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms to make changes to the states current waiver program to provide limited transitional services for those who longer qualify for medicaid in addition to reducing the number of people eligible for medicaid the state also eliminated inhome supports for 3800 seniors who were not eligible for medicaid reduced reimbursement rates to medicaid longterm care providers by 15 to 30 and eliminated the states medically needy program for 8757 individuals medicaid eligibility requirements and access to services number of issues identified by state officials relate to medicaid eligibility for home and communitybased services persons needing longterm care services paid for by medicaid must meet countable income and resource limits established by the state within federal requirements states may allow persons with income up to 300 of the federal ssi level to become eligible for section 1915c home and community based waiver services this level in 2003 is 1656 per month and is the level used by oregon for its waiver programs the resource level used by oregon for the waiver programs is the same as that for nursing home care that is in order to qualify for medicaid person may have resources that do not exceed 2000 for an individual and 3000 for couple32 while these requirements limit the number of persons who may become eligible for medicaid they also act as barrier to many persons in need of longterm care who live at home for example state officials indicated that persons in need of home and communitybased care who live in their own homes do not feel comfortable 32 certain items are excluded such as an individuals home up to 2000 of household goods and personal effects life insurance policies with face value of 1500 or less an automobile with value up to 4500 and burial funds up to 1500 among other things crs40 depleting almost all of their liquid assets that may be needed for household expenses and emergencies oregon through its statefunded oregon project independence program has addressed some of these medicaid financial eligibility issues the oregon project independence program allows persons with income up to 200 of the federal poverty level up to 17720 per year in 2002 to become eligible for statefunded home and communitybased services with resource or asset test individuals pay sliding scale fee for each service based on income this allows persons needing longterm care to receive services and gradually become eligible for medicaid rather than having to wait until all countable resources are depleted to the 2000 medicaid level waiting lists for persons with developmental disabilities waiting lists for services for persons with development disabilities have drawn attention across many states and in oregon despite the sizable amount of funding devoted to home and communitybased services for persons with developmental disabilities in oregon waiting lists for services have been persistent problem according to state reports as of june 13 2002 4773 individuals were waiting to receive home and communitybased services of those 750 had been on the waiting list for less than 2 years 763 had been on the waiting list between 2 and 4 years and 3260 had been waiting for services for more than 4 years33 as result of the staley lawsuit approximately 5000 persons with developmental disabilities are to be removed from the waiting list and receive services by 2007 longterm care staffing across the country states are faced with the challenge of finding sufficient numbers of qualified staff to provide longterm care services many of the staffing shortages experienced in other states however are ameliorated in oregon by the states client employed provider cep program and nurse delegation program in 2001 approximately 20000 individuals needing long term care were served in their home by client employed providers state officials indicate that this program which allows clients to select unlicenced caregivers to provide longterm care services has greatly expanded the states ability to serve individuals in their homes the state has also addressed issues of staffing shortages through its nurse delegation program this program allows licensed registered nurses to delegate certain medical tasks of nursing to unlicenced caregivers state officials and providers maintain that the use of nurse delegation has been essential to the expansion of home and communitybased care services in oregon in spite of the success of these two initiatives state officials expressed concern about finding adequate numbers of direct care workers defined as home health aides nurse aides personal attendants and personal care aides particularly to serve persons with developmental disabilities in residential settings centralization of responsibility many states confront issues of fragmentation in the administration of longterm care programs oregons system 33 oregon department of human services seniors and people with disabilities at httpoddswebmhdhrstateoruspubscpmswaitsumhtm crs41 however is one of the few in the country to consolidate all of the various functions of its longterm care system into single state agency many state officials credit the success of oregons longterm care system to the centralization of responsibility within single administrative structure and budget the goal of state officials over the last 20 years partially in response to several state legislative mandates has been the creation of seamless system for seniors and people with disabilities that favors care in community settings rather than in nursing homes or other institutions bounded choice state administrators recognize that with the aging population and increasing costs of longterm care they may need to rethink the design of their current system in the coming years administrators hope to incorporate concept of bounded choice into the system where an individuals preferences for services are considered within the boundaries of service capacity and fiscal constraints the governors task force on the future of services to seniors and people with disabilities made number of recommendations for incorporating concept of bounded choice in oregons longterm care system the concept raises some difficult questions in light of the states ongoing commitment to promoting system that values consumer choice the task force hopes to pursue changes in federal regulations and the states waiver programs that would allow service packages to be designed within certain financial constraints other issues other issues raised by advocates providers and state officials are consumer choice in the fall of 2001 oregon initiated medicaid pilot project independent choices to offer consumers the option of expanded control over their longterm care services in this program spd authorizes clients to receive lump monthly payments in their bank accounts participants are then responsible for meeting their longterm care needs within that monthly allotment consumerdirected care of this kind often referred to as cash and counseling programs is not currently available on larger scale in oregon although state officials expressed their ongoing commitment to expand consumer choice within their long term care system estate planning and avoidance of estate recovery state officials reported that although there may be small number of people sheltering assets in order to qualify for medicaid longterm care services sooner than they otherwise would the number is growing an increasingly popular way of sheltering assets in oregon is to shelter assets in trusts ie pooled trusts annuities and other financial instruments that are deemed not available to the medicaid applicant to pay for longterm care or transferring assets to community spouses and other individuals particular concern was expressed about the use of special needs trusts among younger individuals with disabilities state officials also provided anecdotal crs42 evidence of increasing avoidance of medicaid estate recovery requirements provider costs and liability insurance in oregon as in many states nursing home providers were unanimous in their concern about the increasing costs of liability insurance and the absence of state caps on punitive damages this issue was raised by many of the provider groups that were interviewed for this study integration of medicare and medicaid advocates and state officials expressed an interest in eliminating the administrative inefficiencies associated with using multiple payers and delivery systems in poorly coordinated system between medicare and medicaid one option might be to pool medicare and medicaid financing to promote financial and service integration and revising program rules to promote administrative integration this advocates asserted could help reduce incentives to use institutional care improve the quality of care and streamline administration and oversight assisted living as an alternative to nursing home care some providers and advocates in oregon expressed concern about an upward swing in the disability levels of clients in communitybased settings in recent years anecdotal evidence suggests that this upward swing is particularly apparent in assisted living facilities in oregon caring for persons with acute disabilities in potentially less regulated home and communitybased settings raises concerns for some longterm care
