primary legislative vehicle through which congress reviews the us foreign aid budget and influences executive branch foreign policy making generally it contains the largest share about twothirds of total us international affairs spending president bush asked congress to appropriate 1889 billion for fy2004 foreign operations the budget proposal was 27 billion or 167 higher than regular nonsupplemental foreign operations appropriations for fy2003 if enacted the presidents recommendation would have resulted in one of the largest increases of regular foreign operations funding in at least two decades congress subsequently approved in midapril an additional 75 billion fy2003 supplemental foreign aid spending in pl 10811 for iraq reconstruction assistance to coalition partners and other activities supporting the global war on terrorism including the supplemental foreign operations appropriations totaled 2367 billion in fy2003 the fy2004 budget blueprint continued to make funding in support of the war on terrorism as the highest priority with about 47 billion recommended the submission also sought funding for four new aid initiatives which together accounted for most of the 27 billion increase over regular fy2003 levels combined the millennium challenge account new foreign aid concept the state departments global aids initiative and two new contingency funds totaled 205 billion other foreign operations programs were left with more modest 4 increase in total the request included 12 billion for hivaids about 350 million more than enacted for fy2003 and 71 billion for military and securityrelated economic aid up nearly 650 million or 10 from regular fy2003 appropriations core bilateral development assistance funding however would have fallen by 8 although recipients of these accounts would be expected to benefit significantly from the new millennium challenge account mca and global aids initiative on july 23 the house passed hr 2800 appropriating 1712 billion the senate passed the legislation on october 30 providing 184 billion foreign operations was merged into hr 2673 the consolidated appropriations act 2004 bill that passed the house on december 8 and the senate on january 22 2004 the enacted measure provides 1748 billion total that includes 059 acrossthe board rescission this is about 14 billion or 74 less than the president requested the enacted measure increases resources for international hivaids by about 400 million and cuts the request for the mca by 300 million the fy2004 foreign operations debate has

legislation includes reconciled version of foreign operations funding for fy2004 as approved earlier by the house and senate as hr 2800 the house approved 242176 the conference agreement on december 8 president bush signed the measure on january 23 pl 108199 the conference agreement on hr 2673 provides 1748 billion for foreign operations figure that includes 059 acrosstheboard rescission and additional amounts for the millennium challenge account specified in division h of the bill this represents 14 billion or 74 reduction from the presidents request but 13 billion or 79 higher than approved in regular foreign operations spending for fy2003 the actual reduction to the executives budget fy2004 proposal however is unlikely to be as significant as this comparison suggests by utilizing funds provided in the iraq reconstruction supplemental pl 108106 and authority included in hr 2673 to transfer iraq reconstruction money for requested regular foreign operations programs the president could make available as much as 575 million to fund his original fy2004 proposal without drawing on the 1748 billion provided in hr 2673 if the administration chooses to utilize these resources from the iraq reconstruction supplemental the difference between the fy2004 request and the conference agreement would be about 850 million or 45 cut despite the overall reduction the conference agreement increases spending for international hivaids malaria and tuberculosis programs to 1646 billion when this amount is combined with appropriations in the pending laborhhseducation appropriation division of hr 2673 the total for global hivaids and other infectious diseases is 24 billion or roughly 400 million above the presidents request conferees further agreed to 400 million contribution to the global fund for aids malaria and tuberculosis that together with an additional 150 million for the fund in division would bring the total level to 550 million rather than the administrations 200 million proposal the conference agreement further authorizes and appropriates funds for the millennium challenge account mca one of the top presidential aid initiatives division d of hr 2673 provides 650 million for the mca while division h includes an additional 350 million for total mca appropriation of 1 billion on another major policy matter the conferees dropped senate language that would have crs2 effectively reversed the presidents mexico city abortionrelated restrictions placed on international family planning programs during the bush administration the conference agreement further appropriates 34 million for the population fund unfpa but under the same conditions kempkasten amendment that has led to the withholding of us contributions to the unfpa the past two years because of the organizations program in china introduction the annual foreign operations appropriations bill is the primary legislative vehicle through which congress reviews and votes on the us foreign assistance budget and influences major aspects of executive branch foreign policy making generally1 it contains the largest share about twothirds of total international affairs spending by the united states see figure 1 the legislation funds all us bilateral development assistance programs managed mostly by the us agency for international development usaid together with several smaller independent foreign aid agencies such as the peace corps and the interamerican and african development foundations most humanitarian aid activities are funded within foreign operations including usaids disaster program and the state departments refugee relief support foreign operations includes separate accounts for aid programs in the former soviet union also referred to as the independent states account and centraleastern europe activities that are jointly managed by usaid and the state department security assistance economic and military aid for israel and egypt is also part of the foreign operations spending measure as are other security aid programs administered largely by the state department in conjunction with usaid and the pentagon us contributions to the world bank and other regional multilateral development banks managed by the treasury department and voluntary payments to international organizations handled by the state department are also funded in the foreign operations bill finally the legislation includes appropriations for three export promotion agencies the overseas private investment corporation opic the exportimport bank and the trade and development agency 1 although the foreign operations appropriations bill is often characterized as the foreign aid spending measure it does not include funding for all foreign aid programs food aid an international humanitarian aid program administered under the pl 480 program is appropriated in the agriculture appropriations bill foreign operations also include funds for the exportimport bank an activity that is regarded as trade promotion program rather than foreign aid in recent years funding for food aid and the eximbank have been about the same so that foreign operations and the official foreign aid budget are nearly identical throughout this report the terms foreign operations and foreign aid are used interchangeably crs3 figure 1 foreign policy budget fy2004 enacted regular appropriation bills s billions total 269 billion food aid agriculture 1235 state deptcommerce 8178 46 304 650 foreign operations 17477 for nearly two decades the foreign operations appropriations bill has been the principal legislative vehicle for congressional oversight of foreign affairs and for congressional involvement in foreign policy making congress has not enacted comprehensive foreign aid authorization bill since 1985 leaving most foreign assistance programs without regular authorizations originating from the legislative oversight committees as result foreign operations spending measures developed by the appropriations committees increasingly have expanded their scope beyond spending issues and played major role in shaping authorizing and guiding both executive and congressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives it has been largely through foreign operations appropriations that the united states has modified aid policy and resource allocation priorities since the end of the cold war the legislation has also been the channel through which the president has utilized foreign aid as tool in the global war on terrorism since the attacks of september 11 2001 the appropriations measure has also been key instrument used by congress to apply restrictions and conditions on administration management of foreign assistance actions that have frequently resulted in executivelegislative clashes over presidential prerogatives in foreign policy making crs4 status table 1 status of foreign operations appropriations fy2004 subcomm conf report

appropriations act 2004 president bush submitted his fy2004 federal budget request to congress on february 3 2003 including funding proposals for foreign operations appropriations programs subsequently on march 25 the white house requested fy2003 emergency supplemental funds for costs of military operations in iraq relief and reconstruction of iraq ongoing us costs in afghanistan additional aid to coalition partners and nations cooperating in the global war on terrorism and homeland security house and senate appropriations committees held several hearings on both the fy2004 and fy2003 supplemental requests and approved the supplemental pl 10811 on april 12 subsequently the administration requested on september 17 another iraq military operations and reconstruction supplemental for fy2004 hr 3289 which congress cleared on november 3 pl 108106 for the regular fy2004 foreign operations bill the house foreign operations subcommittee marked up draft legislation on july 11 while the full house panel approved the legislation on july 16 and reported the measure on july 21 the house passed hr 2800 on july 23 37050 the senate committee reported its companion bill s 1426 on july 17 and passed the measure as hr 2800 on october 30 on november 17 foreign operations conference committee met and reached agreement on most but not all issues in disagreement conferees adjourned pending the resolution of the outstanding matters most of which related to international family planning funding and policy issues after resolving these remaining issues however instead of filing separate conference report on hr 2800 the house and senate appropriation committees decided to incorporate the foreign operations bill into hr 2673 the consolidated appropriations act fy2004 hr 2673 included seven appropriation bills that had not received final action as separate measures the house approved the conference report on the consolidated appropriations bill on december 8 followed by the senate on january 22 2004 the president signed the bill on january 23 crs5 foreign operations funding trends as shown in figure 2 below foreign operations funding levels expressed in real terms taking into account the effects of inflation have fluctuated widely over the past 27 years2 after peaking at over 33 billion in fy1985 constant fy2004 dollars foreign operations appropriations began period of decline to 139 billion in fy1997 with only brief period of higher amounts in the early 1990s due to special supplementals for panama and nicaragua 1990 countries affected by the gulf war 1991 and the former soviet states 1993 figure 2 foreign operations funding trends arguing that declining international affairs resources seriously undermined us foreign policy interests and limited the ability of american officials to influence overseas events clinton administration officials and other outside groups vigorously 2 some of these swings however are not the result of policy decisions but due to technical budget accounting changes involving how congress scores various programs for example the large increase in fy1981 did not represent higher funding levels but rather the fact that export credit programs began to be counted as appropriations rather than as off budget items part of the substantial rise in spending in fy1985 came as result of the requirement to appropriate the full amount of military aid loans rather than only the partial appropriation required in the past beginning in fy1992 congress changed how all federal credit programs are scored in appropriation bills which further altered the scoring of foreign aid loans funded in foreign operations all of these factors make it very difficult to present precise and consistent data trend line in foreign operations funding levels nevertheless the data shown in figure 2 can be regarded as illustrative of general trends in congressional decisions regarding foreign operations appropriations over the past 25 years crs6 campaigned to reverse the decadelong decline in the foreign policy budget foreign aid spending increased slightly in fy1998 but beginning the following year and continuing to the present foreign operations appropriations have trended upward due in large part to the approval of resources for special and in some cases unanticipated foreign policy contingencies and new initiatives although funding for regular continuing foreign aid programs also rose modestly during this period supplemental spending for special activities such as central american hurricane relief fy1999 kosovo emergency assistance fy1999 wye rivermiddle east peace accord support fy2000 counternarcotics initiative in colombia and the andean region fy2000 and fy2002 aid to the front line states in the war on terrorism and iraqwar related assistance fy2003 was chiefly responsible for the growth in foreign aid appropriations the average annual funding level during the fy1999fy2002 period of 1729 billion represents level 24 higher than the low point in foreign operations appropriation in fy1997 although foreign operations appropriations had been rising for five consecutive years amounts approved in fy2003 and fy2004 have reached unprecedented levels over the past 40 years regular appropriations approved in these two years have roughly been on par with amounts of the previous few years but substantial supplementals of 75 billion and 212 billion respectively for assistance to the front line states in the war on terrorism and afghanistan and iraq reconstruction have pushed spending upward the regular foreign operations bill signed by the president on january 23 2004 combined with an earlier iraq supplemental approved in november 2003 pl 108106 bring current year appropriations to 387 billion the highest level in real terms since the early 1960s supplemental resources for foreign operations programs which in fy2004 exceed the regular funding amount have become significant channel of funding for us international activities due to the nature of rapidly changing overseas events and the emergence of unanticipated contingencies to which it is in the us national interest to respond it is not surprising that foreign aid and defense resources from time to time are the major reason for considering and approving supplemental spending outside the regular appropriation cycle supplementals have provided resources for such major foreign policy events as the camp david accords fy1979 central america conflicts fy1983 africa famine and middle east economic downturn fy1985 panama and nicaragua government transitions fy1990 the gulf war fy1991 and bosnia relief and reconstruction fy1996 table 2 foreign operations appropriations fy1995 to fy2004

each of the past six years relief for central american victims of hurricane mitch kosovo refugees and victims of the embassy bombings in kenya and tanzania in fy1999 totaled 16 billion and was followed in fy2000 by 11 billion supplemental largely to fund the presidents new counternarcotics initiative in colombia as part of 40 billion emergency supplemental to fight terrorism enacted in september 2001 president bush and congress allocated 14 billion for foreign aid activities in fy2001 and fy2002 another 115 billion supplemental cleared congress in fy2002 to augment afghan

until fy2003 these additional resources have accounted for between 7 and 11 of total foreign operations spending the 75 billion iraq war supplemental for fy2003 however went well beyond these standards representing nearly one third of the fy2003 foreign operations budget and surpassed as noted above only by fy2004 supplemental appropriations as share of the entire 224 trillion us budget for fy2003 foreign operations represented 106 share significantly higher than the traditional level of around 075 this was due largely to enactment of the 75 billion supplemental for iraq reconstruction aid to coalition partners and assistance to other crs8 frontline states in the war on terrorism the total fy2004 foreign operations appropriation level including the iraq and afghanistan reconstruction supplemental is projected to further increase foreign aid as percent of us federal spending to 166 as portion of discretionary budget authority that part of the budget provided in annual appropriation acts other than appropriated entitlements foreign operations consumed 28 in fy2003 level that will rise significantly to about 445 in fy2004 by comparison at the previous high point of foreign operations spending in fy1985 foreign aid funds represented 2 of the total us budget and 46 of discretionary budget authority data notes unless otherwise indicated this report expresses dollar amounts in terms of discretionary budget authority the foreign operations appropriations bill includes one mandatory program that is not included in figures and tables usaids foreign service retirement fund the retirement fund is scheduled to receive 439 million for fy2004 in addition funding levels and trends discussed in this report exclude us contributions to the international monetary fund imf proposals that are enacted periodically about every five years in foreign operations bills congress approved 179 billion for the imf in fy1999 the first appropriation since fy1993 including these large infrequent and uniquely scored imf appropriations tends to distort general analysis of foreign operations funding trends although congress provides new budget authority through appropriations for the full amount of us participation the transaction is considered an exchange of assets between the united states and the imf and results in outlays from the us treasury in short the appropriations are offset by the creation of us counterpart claim on the imf that is liquid and interest bearing for more see crs report 96279 us budgetary treatment of the imf foreign operations the fy2004 budget resolution and sec 302b allocations usually appropriations committees begin markups of their spending bills only after congress has adopted budget resolution and funds have been distributed to the appropriations panels under what is referred to as the section 302a allocation process reference to the pertinent authority in the congressional budget act following this house and senate appropriations committees separately decide how to allot the total amount available among their 13 subcommittees staying within the functional guidelines set in the budget resolution this second step is referred to as the section 302b allocation foreign operations funds fall within the international affairs budget function function 150 representing in most years about 65 of the function total smaller amounts of function 150 are included in four other appropriation bills crs9 how much international affairs money to allocate to each of the five subcommittees and how to distribute the funds among the numerous programs are decisions exclusively reserved for the appropriations committees nevertheless overall ceilings set in the budget resolution can have significant implications for the budget limitations within which the house and senate foreign operations subcommittees will operate when they meet to mark up their annual appropriation bills on april 11 2003 the house and senate agreed to budget framework for fy2004 hconres 95 that included 7847 billion in discretionary budget authority the discretionary budget authority target for the international affairs function was 2865 billion the same as the presidents request as reestimated by cbo this means that the house and senate appropriations committees received sufficient resources to fully fund the administrations foreign policy budget proposal including the foreign operations request the committees however could choose to allocate the 2865 billion among the five subcommittees with jurisdiction over the international affairs programs differently than what the president proposed or to alter the overall amount for foreign policy activities depending on other competing priorities the final allocations can be quite different from those assumed in the budget resolution for number of weeks following passage of hconres 95 appropriation committee leaders debated how to distribute the discretionary funds under their jurisdiction and especially how to absorb what they identified as roughly 5 to 7 billion gap in spending requirements and amounts available departing from traditional practices where house and senate committees work separately on subcommittee allocations committee leaders negotiated across both houses with their leadership and with the white house to establish common framework within which to base their initial allocations on june 11 house and senate appropriations committee chairmen announced an agreed package which would freeup sufficient resources to address the funding gap and remain within the overall fy2004 discretionary budget cap of 7847 billion as approved by all parties including the president the appropriations committees reduced defense spending by 3 billion and moved 22 billion in fy2004 advance appropriations to fy2003 the house appropriations committee which also released its allocation for all 13 subcommittees on june 11 made further alternations beyond the basic framework the committees distribution added funding beyond the presidents request for several subcommittees including homeland security up 1 billion vahud up 600 million and commerce justice and state up 229 million in addition to the 3 billion reduction for defense the house committee further cut foreign operations by 1769 billion to 1712 billion this 94 cut from the presidents request was the largest percentage reduction for any of the 13 subcommittees the senate appropriations committee on june 19 agreed to its allocations differing from house levels in several areas including foreign operations the senate panel provided 1809 billion for foreign assistance an amount that was crs10 subsequently raised to 18446 billion on october 29 in order to accommodate additional funds for international hivaids the senate amount was about 450 million or 23 below the presidents request but 13 billion more than the house although senate levels were easier to accommodate conferees meeting to resolve funding and other differences between the two bills received relatively low revised allocation of 172 billion the actual reduction to the executives budget proposal however is unlikely to be as significant as comparison between the request 189 billion and the final allocation congress included in the iraq reconstruction supplemental pl 108106 roughly 700 million in additional funds for pakistan jordan and afghanistan that will allow the president to fully fund the fy2004 proposals for these countries using resources from both the supplemental and the regular foreign operations measure as such less money will need to be drawn for these country aid programs from the foreign operations bill than originally anticipated moreover during final negotiations over the conference agreement of hr 2673 the consolidated appropriations act 2004 to which foreign operations became attached conferees added 350 million for the millennium challenge account an amount that is in addition to the 172 billion allocation consequently taking into account funding in the supplemental plus the addon for the mca the cut to the presidents overall request may be closer to 1 billion or 5 nevertheless cut of this size for foreign operations required substantial trade offs among administration priorities as well as foreign aid programs of high interest to congress with most of the foreign operations increases slated for new initiatives including the millennium challenge account and the global aids program cuts were necessary for some of these new proposals and for continuing activities during several months of debate the white house repeatedly emphasized that the budget package should not reduce funding for his top spending priorities the white house had been most critical of proposed reductions for the millennium challenge account and successfully convinced housesenate conferees to restore some of the 50 cut initially recommended by the conference agreement on hr 2800 foreign operations appropriations request for fy2004 and congressional consideration request overview on february 3 2003 president bush asked congress to appropriate 1889 billion for fy2004 foreign operations the budget proposal was 27 billion or 167 higher than regular foreign operations appropriations for fy2003 as enacted in pl 1087 if enacted the presidents recommendation would have resulted in one of the largest increases of regular nonsupplemental foreign operations funding in several decades congress subsequently approved in midapril an additional 75 billion fy2003 supplemental foreign aid spending in pl 10811 for iraq reconstruction assistance to coalition partners and other activities supporting the global war on terrorism including the supplemental brought foreign operations appropriations in fy2003 to 2367 billion crs11 the fy2004 budget blueprint continued to highlight foreign aid in support of the war on terrorism as the highest priority but notable characteristic of the submission was the request for funding four new foreign aid initiatives which together accounted for most of the 27 billion increase over regular fy2003 levels combined the millennium challenge account new structure for delivering foreign aid the state departments global aids initiative and two new contingency funds famine and complex crises totaled 205 billion other foreign operations programs were left with more modest 4 increase table 3 foreign operations new initiatives fy2004 fy2003 fy2004 fy2004 enacted request fy2003 foreign

training programs and address the needs of postconflict iraq and other surrounding countries nearly half of all foreign operations appropriations the past two years has gone for terrorism or iraq warrelated purposes the fy2004 budget continued the priority of fighting terrorism with 47 billion or 25 of foreign operations resources assisting the frontline states unlike year ago when the presidents fy2003 budget was viewed by many as an inadequate request especially for afghanistan the fy2004 proposal included substantial aid packages for number of the frontline states although the levels for most countries would not increase much beyond what was provided from regular fy2003 foreign aid funding the request largely sustained amounts that had grown substantially during the past two years antiterrorism training and technical assistance programs also would rise by 45 above fy2003 levels the fy2004 submission did not however include followon funding for iraq relief and reconstruction congress approved 25 billion in fy2003 supplemental crs12 resources an amount many viewed as down payment of longterm needs in iraq with great uncertainty surrounding the costs of iraq reconstruction how much of the financial burden the united states will shoulder and the process by the reconstruction operations will be managed the administration did not amend its pending fy2004 request to include additional amounts instead the white house proposed in september 2003 215 billion supplemental spending package for iraq reconstruction and additional aid for afghanistan see discussion below regarding iraq and afghanistan reconstruction funding issues new initiative the millennium challenge account the largest of the new initiatives was the millennium challenge account mca program designed to radically transform the way the united states provides economic assistance to small number of best performing developing nations the request for fy2004 was 13 billion with promise that the mca will grow to 5 billion by fy2006 and remain at least at that level in the future some mca supporters argued that the fy2004 level was too low saying that the president pledged to implement the initiative in equal installments over three years and that an appropriation of 167 billion was what they had anticipated the administration said that the added mca funding would be in addition to and not substitute for existing us economic aid but development advocates were concerned that given the tight budget environment tradeoffs between regular economic programs and the mca might be required see separate page under funding and policy issues for more discussion of the mca new initiative the global aids initiative in his january 2003 state of the union address president bush pledged to substantially increase us financial assistance for preventing and treating hivaids especially in the most heavily inflicted countries in africa and the caribbean the president promised 15 billion over 5 years 10 billion of which would be money above and beyond current funding the global aids initiative which will be housed in the state department represented portion of that pledge 450 million in fy2004 that when combined with other resources managed by usaid and the department of health and human services hhs would raise total international hivaids resources in fy2004 to about 19 billion some observers noted however that this fell well short of the anticipated 3 billion per year implied in the presidents speech and would represent only 500 million in new money to fight aids above the fy2003 level some further questioned whether the state department should be coordinator of international hivaids programs as envisioned in the initiative rather than usaid or hhs see separate page under funding and policy issues for more discussion of the global aids initiative new initiative the famine fund this new contingency fund with 200 million requested for fy2004 would allow the administration to provide under more flexible authorities emergency food and other disaster relief support as needs arise executive officials argued that greater flexibility would permit them to respond rapidly to the human consequences of natural disasters and conflict without having to divert resources from other economic aid accounts critics noted however that the existing international disaster assistance account and pl 480 food aid program plus legislative authorities that allow for temporary borrowing of funds from other aid accounts perform the same functions as the proposed famine fund and questioned whether it is necessary crs13 new initiative the us emergency fund for complex crises the administration proposed to establish within the executive office of the president 100 million contingency fund allowing the united states to respond quickly to unforseen complex foreign crises the resources would not be used to address victims of natural disasters but rather would support peace and humanitarian intervention in conflict situations including acts of ethnic cleansing mass killing or genocide in the past congress has been reluctant to approve this type of contingency fund over which it can apply little oversight the administration had asked lawmakers to launch the complex crisis fund with 150 million as part of the fy2003 iraq war supplemental congress however chose to defer consideration of establishing such fund until the fy2004 appropriation cycle and instead allocated the requested resources among various accounts for iraq reconstruction and aid to regional states affected by the war other key elements of the fy2003 request beyond these specific and prominent issues the foreign operations proposal for fy2004 sought to substantially increase aid activities in few areas while cutting resources for several programs significant appropriation increases when compared with regular fy2003 appropriations excluding the iraq war supplemental included security assistance economic support fund and foreign military financing these two core security aid accounts that aim to support countries strategically important to the us would have grown by combined 648 million or 10 above regular fy2003 levels much of the addon was targeted for 250 million security aid package for turkey and 145 million new middle east partnership initiative peace corps funding would have risen by 64 million or 22 in an effort to place 10000 volunteers by the end of fy2004 and to keep on track the presidents longer term plan of having 14000 americans serving in the peace corps by fy2007 contributions to the world bank and other international financial institutions would have grown by 259 million or 17 covering all scheduled us payments to the multilateral development banks plus clearing 196 million of us arrears owed to these institutions the request further included an 18 increase for the world banks international development association and the african development fund as resultsbased incentive contribution that had been promised last year if the banks implemented certain reforms debt reduction which received funding in fy2003 except by transfer of 40 million from another aid account would have grown to 395 million under the administrations budget submission there were three components to the request 300 million to cancel bilateral debt owed by the democratic republic of the congo under the heavily indebted poor country hipc initiative 75 million as contribution to the hipc trust fund to make up for unanticipated crs14 shortfalls in implementing the program and 20 million for the tropical forestry conservation debt relief activity international narcotics control would have grown by 89 million or 45 largely to expand significantly programs in pakistan and mexico the administration further sought 731 million for the andean counterdrug initiative aci an increase from the 700 million regular appropriation for fy2003 the aci proposal would have generally restored amounts that were cut from the fy2003 request for colombia ecuador brazil venezuela and panama the largest reduction proposed in the presidents foreign operations budget targeted assistance to former soviet states and eastern europe collectively aid to these countries would have declined by 179 million or 24 from fy2003 levels the request reflected reorientation in the former soviet aid account to focus more on central asian states linked to the war on terrorism and to begin the process of graduation for russia and ukraine aid to these two nations would have fallen by 40 from fy2003 allocations the request further would have cut armenias aid by nearly half from 89 million to 49 million for eastern europe aid levels would have fallen for nearly every recipient with some of the largest reductions scheduled for serbia montenegro and macedonia funding for the exportimport bank would also have declined under the presidents budget from 565 million to 43 million in fy2004 as reestimated by cbo but because of substantial carryforward resources that were not spent in prior years eximbank officials said that bank lending could total 146 billion in fy2004 which was at least 2 billion higher than the anticipated level for fy2003 assessing the administrations request for bilateral development and health assistance was more complicated and led to varying interpretations with implementation of the presidents new global aids initiative in fy2004 development and health resources including funds from usaids core accounts for development assistance and child survivalhealth and the state departments global aids initiative would have increased by 205 million or 64 over regular fy2003 levels depending on the purposes for which millennium challenge account funds are spent further additions to development and health programs would also be expected from mca allocations but excluding the new global aids initiative and mca from the equation overall funding for usaids two core accounts would have declined in fy2004 by combined 245 million or 76 the implication of this reduction was that with the exception of hivaids nearly all other development programs including those for agriculture basic education family planning malaria and tuberculosis and democracy programs would have been at or slightly below amounts allocated for fy2003 some critics charged that this violated the executives pledge that mca funding would be in addition to and not in place of continuing economic aid programs others expressed concern that the growth in hivaids resources came at the expense of other key health activities for which resources would decline crs15 table 4 summary of foreign operations

they have been for many years however in the aftermath of the september 11 terrorist attacks foreign aid allocations have changed in several significant ways the request and subsequently the allocations for fy2004 largely continued the patterns of aid distribution of the past two years since september 11 the administration has used economic and military assistance increasingly as tool in efforts to maintain cohesive international coalition to conduct the war on terrorism and to assist nations which have both supported us forces and face serious terrorism threats themselves pakistan for example key coalition partner on the border with afghanistan had been ineligible for us aid other than humanitarian assistance due to sanctions imposed after india and pakistan conducted nuclear tests in may 1998 and pakistan experienced military coup in 1999 since lifting aid sanctions in october 2001 the united states has transferred over 19 billion to pakistan jordan turkey indonesia the philippines and india also are among the top aid recipients as part of the network of frontline states in the war on terrorism crs16 the other major cluster of top recipients are those in the andean region where the administration maintains large counternarcotics initiative that combines assistance to interdict and disrupt drug production together with alternative development programs for areas that rely economically on the narcotics trade several countries in the balkans and the former soviet union serbia and montenegro kosovo russia ukraine armenia and georgia would continue to be among

excluding supplemental foreign operations spending approved for fy2003 as one of its top priority the house committee approved 127 billion for international hivaids 30 million above the presidents request and 390 million higher than fy2003 levels the hivaids total included 400 million for the global fund compared with the presidents request of 100 million combined with parallel funding approved in the house laborhhs spending measure the house bill provided in both bills 19 billion for hivaids 20 million less than the administrations proposal out of this 500 million would be available as us contribution to the global fund for which the president proposes 200 million the bill also restored cuts to bilateral tuberculosis and malaria proposed by the president increasing spending for nonhivaids infectious diseases from 104 million to 156 million for overall core bilateral development programs including hivaids and other nonhealth activities the house measure was about 140 million higher than the presidents request and 350 million above regular fy2003 amounts the house bill however reduced nonhealth programs by nearly 30 million from the administrations request and 63 million from fy2003 amounts this would have resulted in small cuts for activities such as agriculture economic growth environment and democracy promotion the house measure however placed high priority on trade capacity building activities increasing funding to 195 million 35 million higher than in fy2003 spending on basic education would have also risen under the house measure with 259 million specified out of the bilateral development aid funds in fy2003 usaid allocated 217 million for basic education and requested 212 million for fy2004 across all foreign operations accounts the house bill directed total of 350 million for basic education on other major issues the house measure reduced the presidents 13 billion request for the new millennium challenge account to 800 million set family planning resources at 425 million as requested provided 25 million for the population fund unfpa but with conditions that could reduce or eliminate the contribution fully funded at the requested levels amounts for israel egypt and jordan provided 731 million for the andean counterdrug initiative as proposed but reduced by 43 million funding for regular counternarcotics programs set

less than fy2003 crs18 increased the presidents request for east european assistance by 17 million with the additional funds set for bosnia serbia and montenegro included current contributions for several multilateral development banks including the world banks international development association ida and the global environment fund but excluded arrearage payments and incentive contributions for ida and the african development bank sought by the administration excluded funds for two new presidential contingency funds for famine and emergency complex crises the house bill however increased international disaster assistance to 3155 million directing that 80 million be used for famine relief prevention and mitigation deleted 300 million sought for extending debt relief to the democratic republic of congo the legislation however fully funds the requests for hipc debt relief and for tropical forest conservation during house floor debate on july 16 lawmakers adopted several amendments to hr 2800 including proposal by congressman kolbe to clarify the role of the new state department hivaids coordinator with the intent to grant the coordinator adequate authority to coordinate us government efforts to combat aids globally while allowing the traditional agencies that have managed such programs for many years usaid and the centers for disease control and prevention to continue their work without excessive micromanagement by the coordinator an amendment by congressman hefley that reduced funding for the international military education and training imet program by 600000 the intent of the proposal was to cut imet assistance to indonesia because of lack of progress in the investigation of an august 2002 ambush that left two americans and an indonesian from an international school dead some believe the indonesian military may have been involved while cutting the imet account by the amount requested for indonesia the amendment itself did not limit the state departments ability to fund an imet program for indonesia in fy2004 proposal by congresswoman bigger to authorize us participation in the 13th replenishment of the international development association ida the world banks concessional lending facility congress approved funding for ida13 including 850 million in hr 2800 but the money could not be transferred without congressional authorization an amendment by congressman alcee hastings stating sense of congress that the president should use all diplomatic tools available crs19 to ensure that north korea does not engage in the proliferation of nuclear weapons central theme of house debate both on the floor and in committee were efforts to increase assistance proposed in the bill for africa especially to increase funding for hivaids malaria and tuberculosis from the roughly 2 billion level contained in foreign operations and labor hhs and education appropriation bills to something closer to the 3 billion amount congress previously authorized in pl 10825 although numerous amendments were offered and debated none were adopted among specific proposals considered to increase aid to africa and programs combating hivaids were congresswomen lowey amendment at full committee markup to add 1 billion in emergency funds an amount that would not count against the bills spending cap for additional hivaids programs much of which would be delivered in africa failed 2833 committee amendment proposed by congresswomen kilpatrick to transfer 500 million from the millennium challenge account to hivaids lost 2728 amendment supporters argued that the mca could not utilize all funds appropriated in hr 2800 in the first year and that africa would benefit more from hivaids programs than from mca resources for which few african countries might qualify similar amendment to transfer 300 million from the mca to hivaids lost during house floor debate 192228 an amendment by congressman jackson in committee markup to shift 200 million from the mca to hivaids and provide 588 million in emergency funding for more african economic assistance congo debt relief and higher amount for the african development fund failed on voice vote similar proposal by congressman jackson was ruled out of order during house debate house floor amendment by congressman mcgovern to shift 75 million from the andean regional initiative to hivaids programs lost on vote of 195226 senate consideration on october 30 the senate approved an 1838 billion spending bill for fy2004 foreign aid programs the senate appropriations committee had approved an original bill s 1426 on july 17 but passed the house bill hr 2800 with numerous amendments the amount was 500 million or 27 below the presidents request but 22 billion higher than regular excluding supplemental foreign operations spending approved for fy2003 because of higher 302b allocation s 1426 was nearly 13 billion more than the house bill as one of its top priorities the senate provided 147 billion for international hivaids about 230 million above the presidents request and 590 million higher than fy2003 levels the hivaids total included as much as 250 million for the crs20 global fund compared with the presidents request of 100 million the president also requested 100 million for the global fund in the laborhhs appropriation measure unlike the house bill the senate included hivaids funds in both the child survivalhealth csh and global aids initiative accounts the global aids initiative account was new request for fy2004 funding programs managed by new state department coordinator the house bill kept nearly all hivaids funds in the csh account consistent with past practice the senatepassed bill also restored cuts to bilateral tuberculosis and malaria proposed by the president increasing spending for nonhivaids infectious diseases from 104 million to 185 million the issue of funding for hivaids became one of the primary issues of debate during senate floor consideration the senate approved an amendment by senator dewine increasing total resources by 287 million the senate however rejected proposals by senator durbin to add 200 million more for hivaids and by senator bingaman to boost spending by 200 million with corresponding reduction of 200 million for the millennium challenge account for overall core bilateral development programs including hivaids other nonhealth activities and unicef contributions the senate measure was about 550 million higher than the presidents request and 415 million above the house bill besides increasing health programs the senate bill also added to the request for other development activities providing about 80 million more than requested and over 100 million more than the house basic education programs received 220 million under hr 2800 as approved in the senate while environmental activities 485 million and microenterprise 180 million were other areas emphasized in the senate bill that are above the presidents request on other major issues the senate bill reduced the presidents 13 billion request for the new millennium challenge account to 1 billion the senate further attached legislation authorizing the mca drawing text from s 925 which had been debated amended but not passed by the senate in mid july set family planning resources at 445 million 20 million higher than the request included text that would effectively overturn the presidents mexico city abortionrelated restrictions provided 35 million for the population fund unfpa but with conditions that could reduce or eliminate the contribution fully funded at the requested levels amounts for israel egypt and jordan reduced to 660 million funding for the andean counterdrug initiative but provided full funding for regular counternarcotics programs set peace corps funding at 310 million 15 million higher than fy2003 levels but 49 million under the administrations budget provided 596 million for the former soviet union 20 million above the request and roughly the same as for fy2003 the crs21 additional funds would offset proposed reductions for russia and armenia increased the presidents request for east european assistance by 10 million provided the total request including arrears payments and an incentive contribution for the world banks international development association ida most other multilateral development bank contributions were set at or near the presidents request appropriated 100 million for one of the two new presidential contingency accounts the famine fund but deletes funding for the emergency complex crises fund provided 100 million of 300 million sought for extending debt relief to the democratic republic of congo s 1426 allocated funds sought for congo debt relief for other pressing needs in africa the legislation however fully funded the requests for hipc debt relief and for tropical forest conservation conference agreement on november 17 conference committee on the foreign operations bill met and reached agreement on most but not all issues in disputes conferees adjourned pending the resolution of the outstanding matters most of which related to international family planning funding and policy issues subsequently appropriation committee leaders merged the foreign operations measure into the conference agreement on hr 2673 the consolidated appropriations act 2004 the text of the foreign operations bill can be found in division d of hr 2673 while an additional appropriation for one foreign operations account the millennium challenge corporation can be found as section 134 of division h on december 8 the house passed hr 2673 with the senate following on january 22 2004 the president signed the consolidated appropriation on january 23 pl 108199 the conference agreement on hr 2673 provides 1748 billion for foreign operations figure that includes 059 acrosstheboard rescission and additional amounts for the millennium challenge account specified in division h of the bill this represents 14 billion or an 75 reduction from the presidents request but 13 billion or 79 higher than approved in regular foreign operations spending for fy2003 the actual reduction to the executives budget fy2004 proposal however is unlikely to be as significant as this comparison suggests congress included in the iraq reconstruction supplemental pl 108106 300 million for pakistan and jordan amounts that were not requested plus higher funding than proposed for afghanistan further the conference agreement on hr 2673 includes authority for the president to transfer 130 million from iraq reconstruction funds in pl 108106 for economic aid for turkey 100 million and the middle east partnership initiative 30 million consequently by utilizing these additional funds and transfer authorities for requested regular foreign operations programs the president could crs22 use about 550 million to fund his original fy2004 proposal without drawing on the 1748 billion provided in hr 2673 if the administration chooses to utilize these resources the difference between the fy2004 request and the conference agreement would be about 850 million or 45 cut note that figures mentioned below for specific programs are the actual amount appropriated in hr 2673 and do not reflect the 059 rescission that will be applied to each item despite the overall reduction the conference agreement increases spending for international hivaids malaria and tuberculosis programs to 1646 billion when this amount is combined with appropriations in the pending laborhhseducation appropriation division of hr 2673 the total for global hivaids malaria and tuberculosis is 24 billion or roughly 400 million above the presidents request conferees further agreed to 400 million contribution to the global fund for aids malaria and tuberculosis that together with 150 million in division would bring the total level to 550 million rather than the administrations 200 million proposal the conference agreement further authorizes and appropriate funds for the millennium challenge account mca one of the top presidential aid initiatives division d of hr 2673 provides 650 million for the mca while division h includes an additional 350 million for total mca appropriation of 1 billion the president had proposed 13 billion for the mca program that is planned to grow to 5 billion by fy2006 on another major policy matter the conferees dropped senate language that would have effectively reversed the presidents mexico city abortionrelated restrictions placed on international family planning programs during the bush administration the conference agreement further appropriates 34 million for the population fund unfpa but under the same conditions kempkasten amendment that has led to the withholding of us contributions to the unfpa the past two years because of the organizations program in china the senate bill had recommended changes in the kempkasten conditions the white house had said the president would veto the bill if either of the senate provisions on international family planning had remained in the final bill the conference agreement also provides for 432 million for bilateral family planning assistance compromise between the 425 million proposed by the president and passed by the house and 445 million recommended by the senate in other decisions made by conferees the final foreign operations bill includes 32 billion for usaids core aid accounts of child survivalhealth and development assistance 380 million higher than the request 255 million for international disaster and famine aid rejecting the proposal to establish separate famine fund account 3265 million across all accounts for basic education programs an increase over the presidents approximate request of 3035 million crs23 731 million for the andean counter drug initiative as requested full funding for the presidents requests for aid to israel egypt and jordan 405 million for afghanistan an amount that could be lowered from the 600 million earmarked in both house and senate bills because of additions made in the iraqafghanistan reconstruction supplemental 325 million for the peace corps including 15 million transfer from the hivaids account 95 million for debt reduction including full funding for topping up the hipc initiative and for the tropical forest debt program but funds for bilateral debt forgiveness for the democratic republic of congo 913 million for the world banks international development association ida an amount that will fully fund the first us contribution to the new ida replenishment but which will provide funds to cover past payment arrears 27 million and only partially fund with 63 million the presidents 100 million incentive contribution for ida management reforms iraq war supplemental for fy2003 and foreign operations funding on march 25 2003 the president requested nearly 75 billion fy2003 supplemental that included 76 billion for nearterm iraq reconstruction and relief additional aid to coalition partners and other states cooperating in the global war on terrorism and related usaid administrative expenses by comparison the supplemental request totaled little less than half of the 162 billion appropriated previously by congress for fy2003 foreign operations activities the proposal as detailed below in table 6 was roughly divided into two components iraq relief and reconstruction about 285 billion and aid to coalition partners and other nations engaged in the war on terrorism about 47 billion3 reconstruction efforts normally it would be presumed that transfers for reconstruction and post conflict aid would be made to usaid the state department and other traditional foreign assistance management agencies but with plans for the defense department to oversee the governing of iraq immediately after the end of hostilities the proposal 3 omb documents estimated the total amount for iraq reconstruction was 35 billion figure that included nearly 500 million from dod funding for the repair of oil facilities crs24 stimulated immediate controversy number of critics including members of congress argued that aid programs should remain under the policy direction of the state department and under the authorities of broad and longstanding body of foreign aid laws they pointed out that during other recent reconstruction initiatives in bosnia and kosovo resources and policy decisions flowed through the secretary of state others argued that groups which would play significant role in postwar rehabilitation efforts nongovernmental organizations ngos foreign donors and international organizations would be reluctant to take direction and funding from the us military this they contended would hamper relief activities furthermore the placement of reconstruction funding in presidential account appeared to grant the white house significant discretion in responding to changing and unanticipated demands unencumbered by specific programmatic allocations the administration said only that 543 million would cover humanitarian expenses 17 billion would be set aside for reconstruction needs and up to 200 million would be available to reimburse foreign aid accounts from which funds were drawn prior to the conflict as with other parts of the supplemental dealing with defense and homeland security resources the white house wanted to maintain maximum flexibility over the distribution of the appropriations so that it could respond to changing circumstances and unanticipated contingencies executive officials who acknowledged that some or all of the funding would be transferred to dod argued that the military would be best situated following the conflict to immediately launch the reconstruction efforts moreover the administration noted that the defense office in charge of reconstruction operations would most likely redirect most of the resources to the state department and usaid who would then be responsible for managing rehabilitation projects officials further argued that it was too early to identify specific reconstruction activities and that it was possible to only provide the most general outlines of how the money would be spent until assessment teams could report on the extent of needs throughout the country congressional action on iraq reconstruction as cleared by congress hr 1559 appropriated 2475 billion for the relief and reconstruction fund slightly higher than requested the president was able to apportion fund resources directly to five federal agencies the departments of defense state health and human services treasury and usaid subsequently the funds were allocated to the coalition provisional authority headed by ambassador paul bremer who reports to the secretary of defense in previous congressional debate the house and senate had each expressed their expectations that these funds would be channeled to the secretary of state and in most instances further directed to usaid the report accompanying s 762 specifically noted that the funds were not expected to be transferred to the secretary of defense nevertheless the white house continued to argue for greater flexibility and authority to place reconstruction resources under dod auspices and ultimately conference committee members agreed crs25 table 6 iraq reconstruction international aid and related activities in millions of dollars activity request house senate enacted iraq relief and reconstruction iraq

accounts that had been drawn upon in order to preposition food and medicine stocks in the region and for other preconflict humanitarian purposes the conference agreement directed full and prompt reimbursement of usaid and state department accounts from the iraq fund the supplemental provided 1438 million for international disaster assistance 1125 million of which would restore funds diverted previously for iraq the remaining balance augmented usaid disaster relief resources to respond to foreign contingencies that may arise through the end of fy2003 similarly congress increased the state departments refugee reserve account from the 50 million requested to 80 million in order to address needs in the persian gulf region as well as other global requirements international assistance the administrations supplemental appropriation proposal which was only slightly modified by congress provided about 47 billion in additional aid to 23 countries and regional programs that are contributing to the war in iraq and cooperating in the global fight against terrorism see the table below for complete list of proposed recipients among the largest and most complex aid packages were jordan 700 million in economic grants and 406 million in military transfers this was on top of jordans regular 452 aid package from the us israel 1 billion in supplemental military aid on top of the 27 billion regular fy2003 assistance and 9 billion in economic loans guaranteed by the us government over the next three years israel would pay all costs fees that may total several hundred millions of dollars associated with these economic stabilization loans conditions on how the funds would be spent similar to those that were applied in the early 1990s when israel drew on 10 billion usbacked loan package would be employed turkey 1 billion for economic grants which could be applied to fees associated with 85 billion in direct loans or loan guarantees afghanistan 325 million in economic grants antiterrorism demining and military transfers this would be in addition to roughly 350 million already scheduled for afghanistan this year egypt 300 million for economic grants portion of which could be used to gain access to up to 2 billion in loan guarantees depending on the terms of the loan if egypt chose to receive the full 2 billion about 120 million or more of the 300 million would be applied to the costs faced by the united states of guaranteeing the loans the administration further proposed to reprogram 3796 million in previously appropriated commodity import program aid to egypt as cash transfer the supplemental would come on top of 19 billion in regular us aid to egypt crs30 pakistan 200 million in military grants and law enforcement assistance pakistan currently receives 305 million in fy2003 the administration further requested 150 million to initiate us emergency fund for complex emergencies contingency account that would allow the president to address quickly unforseen needs of coalition partners the fund which would be managed by the white house had originally been proposed for an fy2004 startup of 100 million congressional action on international assistance hr 1559 as approved included 452 billion in additional aid to countries and regional programs about 180 million less than requested nearly all of this reduction however came from congress decision not to fund the presidents 150 million emergency account for complex crises in most other cases the administration was able to allocate these foreign aid resources as it had intended congress earmarked funding at the requested levels for israel egypt jordan and pakistan while adding resources for afghanistan and the philippines turkey may receive not to exceed 1 billion in aid that is conditioned on requirement for the secretary of state to certify that turkey is cooperating with the united states in operation iraqi freedom including facilitating the movement of humanitarian aid into iraq and has not unilaterally deployed forces in northern iraq the restriction on turkeys aid package the size of which could grow to 85 billion if the loan option is implemented combined text in house and senatepassed bills earlier the house had defeated two amendments that would have eliminated aid to turkey or reduced it by 207 million for israeli loan guarantees the enacted supplemental included the full 9 billion proposal but added conditions not included in the administrations proposal loans may be issued in 3 billion allotments in each of fy2003 to fy2005 provision that would allow the president to reduce disbursements in the second and third years if israel violated any of the loan conditions one such condition added by congress prohibited loan resources from supporting any activity in geographic areas that were not administered by israel prior to june 5 1967 this is similar to condition attached to the 1992 10 billion loan guaranty package for israel some of which was not disbursed because of continued israeli settlement activity in the west bank area crs31 table 7 proposed recipients of supplemental foreign aid s millions anti narcotics economic loans military

supplemental the administration has modified its plans to allocate funds for these recipients see footnote i in table 6 above for the allocated amounts crs32 while most of the presidents request for international assistance was supported in the enacted emergency supplemental the administration had to reduce economic assistance in one instance congress cut economic support fund appropriations by 20 million but because of earmarks and additions for afghanistan and the philippines and 10 million to investigate possible iraqi leadership war crimes executive officials had 100 million less than requested in economic assistance for countries not protected by legislative directives nonearmarked programs included 50 million for the palestinians 25 million for djibouti and 200 million for the middle east partnership initiative the administration chose to fully allocate amounts for the palestinians and djibouti but cut resources for the middle east partnership initiative including muslim outreach to 100 million half of the level requested the state department also chose to modify its distribution of military aid grants to several central europe states most significantly the executive branch decided to add funds not requested for albania macedonia and ukraine and increase amounts above the requested levels for estonia latvia lithuania and bulgaria as offsets the state department cut funds for hungary and eliminated the 5 million request for slovenia these alterations appear to reflect administration views on the extent to which selected countries supported or did not support us operations in iraq see footnote i in table 6 above for specific amounts allocated to each recipient dod authorities to provide military aid under sections relating to defense department funds and authorities the supplemental proposed two items that drew particular congressional attention the key issue was whether they infringed on congressional oversight and the state departments traditional role in directing foreign aid policy and resource allocations they were both similar to proposals made last year in the fy2002 supplemental that focused on the war on terrorism and were closely scrutinized by congress the first would provide 14 billion for the defense department notwithstanding any provision of law to pay jordan pakistan and other nations that have provided logistical and militaryrelated support to us military operations in iraq or in the global war on terrorism in the past defense officials argue competing demands on regular military aid resources have delayed reimbursement to key friends that provide services to american forces congress approved funding in the fy2002 supplemental for this purpose but included 15day prior notification requirement that is not part of the fy2003 supplemental draft legislation the more controversial authority concerned dods request for 150 million to support indigenous forces assisting us military operations including those aimed at the global war on terrorism decisions to draw on these funds would be made by the secretary of defense with the concurrence of the secretary of state the defense department defines indigenous forces as irregular forces and resistance movements and notes that such forces generally conduct military and paramilitary operations in enemyheld or hostile territory and conduct direct offensive low crs33 intensity cover or clandestine operations4 although it was unclear from the budget justification and bill text exactly what groups and under what scenarios the administration would utilize these resources senior administration official suggested that the intent was to have resources available for groups in iraq deputy secretary of state richard armitage testified on march 27 that because of the uncertainty of the wars duration it might be necessary to transfer additional arms and equipment to kurdish and other forces and that the 150 million would provide hedge in case of more prolonged conflict in last years supplemental appropriation debate dod asked for 30 million to support indigenous forces funds that would be exclusively under the control of the secretary of defense congress rejected the proposal however at that time the house appropriations committee observed in deleting the request that the secretary of states primary responsibility over us military assistance programs is well established and that the administration had the necessary authorities under existing foreign aid laws to undertake the requested activities5 congressional action on dod authorities hr 1559 as enacted provided the 14 billion for nations supporting us military operations in the global war on terrorism but did not authorize the 150 million for aid to indigenous forces selected major issues in the fy2004 foreign operations debate while the foreign operations appropriations bill can include virtually any foreign policy issue of interest to congress the annual debate usually focuses on several major policy and spending issues for fy2004 substantial debate has focused on the following foreign aid to combat terrorism since the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks and the initiation of military operations in afghanistan combating global terrorism has become one of the top priorities of american foreign assistance indeed secretary of state powell has said at several 2003 congressional hearings that fighting terrorism is the most important objective of the fy2004 foreign operations request while there is disagreement regarding the extent to which foreign aid can directly contribute to reducing the threat of terrorism most agree that economic and security assistance aimed at reducing poverty promoting jobs and educational opportunities and helping stabilize conflictprone nations can indirectly address some of the factors that terrorists use in recruiting disenfranchised individuals for their cause as illustrated in the table below the united states has provided more than 59 billion to 26 socalled frontline states in the global war on terrorism in 4 us office of management and budget fy2003 request for supplemental appropriations march 25 2003 5 hrept 107480 may 22 2002 crs34 immediate postseptember 11 and fy2002 appropriations while fy2003 regular and supplemental spending bills have provided 74 billion the administration proposed 47 billion for the frontline states in fy2004 plus 12 billion in additional reconstruction funds for afghanistan enacted in pl 108106 for total of 59 billion none of these figures include postconflict reconstruction assistance for iraq which totals about 21 billion enacted in fy2003 and fy2004 supplementals while increased levels of foreign aid are only one sign of the importance the united states assigns to the support provided by these frontline states the amounts allocated since september 11 are in sharp contrast to the 34 billion provided to these 26 countries prior to the attacks in regular fy2001 appropriations additional economic and military assistance has been particularly evident in few countries including jordan pakistan afghanistan turkey the philippines kyrgyzstan tajikistan uzbekistan oman yemen and djibouti foreign aid can be programmed in number of ways that contribute to the war on terrorism assistance can be transferred as has occurred in pakistan and afghanistan to bolster efforts of coalitionpartner government to counter domestic dissent and armed attacks by extremist groups and to promote better health care education and employment opportunities to its people security assistance can finance the provision of military equipment and training to nations facing threats from their own internallybased terrorist movements while there has been congressional support for additional foreign aid resources aimed at countering terrorism some warn that the united states needs to be cautious about the risks of creating close aid relationship with governments that may have questionable human rights records are not accountable to their people and are possibly corrupt some members have been especially critical of administration efforts to include in aid proposals for frontline states legislative language that would waive all existing restrictions and prohibitions on the transfers instead these critics argue the administration should specifically identify any obstacles to proceeding with country aid program and seek congressional waiver for those particular problems for example in late 2001 when the administration wanted to provide pakistan with 600 million in fastdisbursing economic aid instead of providing blanket waiver of legislative obstacles congress approved in pl 10757 specific waivers of aid prohibitions that applied to countries that engaged in missile proliferation whose leaders came to power through military coup and which were behind in debt payments to the united states crs35 table 8 us assistance to

countries have participated in ata projects ata funding is included within the foreign operations account of nonproliferation anti terrorism demining and related programs nadr resources for the 38

642 million for fy2003 increased funding for fy2003 is intended to finance three ata program strategies expanding existing usbased training activities initiating new incountry programs in participant nations and adding program flexibility to respond rapidly to changing global circumstances for fy2004 the state department sought 1064 million for ata programs up nearly twothirds from existing levels

bombings of american embassies in east africa the state department launched the tip an activity intended to restrict the ability of terrorists to cross international borders launch attacks and escape tip strengthens border security systems in particularly vulnerable countries by installing border monitoring technology training border security and immigration officials in its use and expanding access to international criminal information to participating nations like ata funds for tip are part of the nadr account in the foreign operations spending bill since september 11 the state department has expanded from 34 to 60 the number of countries where it believes tip would immediately contribute to the global counterterrorism campaign the 4 million tip budget doubled for fy2001 following september 11 and grew to 14 million in fy2002 after falling back to 5 million for fy2003 the request for fy2004 was 11 million the administration crs37 planned to expand operations in up to ten new countries with the additional resources counterterrorism engagement with allies following the september 11 attacks the united states began to conduct senior official policy workshops and multilateral conferences in order to better respond to terrorist incidents involving weapons of mass destruction overseas with 3 million from emergency fy2002 supplemental spending the state department conducted workshops in 18 countries as well as several regional conferences the 25 million budget request for fy2004 would finance ten scheduled workshops including three in greece in advance of the 2004 olympic games terrorist financing in december 2001 an interagency review group identified 19 countries where significant terrorist financing threat existed and with 3 million allocated from the emergency response fund launched training and technical assistance program the state department allocated 10 million out of the fy2002 supplemental appropriation to expand the program while the treasury department is utilizing approximately half of its 10 million fy2003 technical assistance program for these purposes in fy2004 treasury proposed 5 million for combating terrorist financing activities usaid physical security usaid maintains about 97 overseas facilities where much of its workforce including both americans and foreign nationals is located many missions are based in places where there is high threat of terrorist activity and especially since the 1998 embassy bombings in kenya and tanzania agency officials have been concerned about insuring adequate security in countries where usaid is or is scheduled to be colocated with the us embassy the state departments foreign buildings operations office had been responsible for financing usaid secure facilities these funds are appropriated in the departments of commerce justice and state appropriations nevertheless there have been serious construction delays for usaid colocated facilities especially in uganda due to competing state department building priorities and conflicting congressional directives in an effort to overcome these problems usaid requested for fy2003 new foreign operations account the capital investment fund that would support enhanced information technology 13 million and facility construction 82 million specifically at colocated sites where security enhancements are needed usaid planned to use the money in fy2003 for construction projects in kenya guinea cambodia and georgia congress however reduced funding for this account to 43 million with 30 million assumed for kenya and 10 million for new facility in afghanistan with reductions made to the fy2003 request usaid proposed 1463 million capital investment fund request for fy2004 of the total 20 million would support information technology needs while the balance would finance construction of seven colocated facilities where the state department is already building new embassies in addition to guinea cambodia and georgia which went unfunded in fy2003 usaid requested resources for colocated missions in zimbabwe armenia mali and uganda for construction of colocated missions at embassies where crs38 building will begin in fy2004 or later resources for usaid facilities would be drawn from state department appropriations under the capital surcharge proposal security upgrades for the 64 overseas missions situated some distance from american embassies have been provided out of usaid operating expenses foreign operations account that has been under funding stress in recent years due to agency relocation costs in washington dc replacement of failed financial management systems and dwindling nonappropriated trust funds used to finance some incountry costs as result security upgrades for some usaid missions have been deferred due to funding shortfalls for fy2003 usaid estimated that it will spend 71 million for security needs out of its operations account compared to 675 million in fy2002 usaid requested the same amount 71 million for fy2004 as it had available for fy2003 aid restrictions for terrorist states annual foreign operations spending bills routinely include general provisions prohibiting us assistance to countries engaged in terrorist activities or providing certain types of support to terrorist groups included in the fy2003 funding measure were two sec 527 prohibited bilateral us assistance to any country that the president determined grants sanctuary from prosecution to any individual or group which has committed an act of international terrorism or otherwise supports international terrorism the president could waive the restrictions for national security or humanitarian reasons sec 543 prohibited us aid to government which provides lethal military equipment to country that the secretary of state determined is headed by terrorist supporting government the president could waive the requirement if it is important to us national interests despite these restrictions however certain types of humanitarian foreign assistance could be provided notwithstanding other provisions of law which would override the terrorism restrictions disaster and refugee relief child survival and hivaids programs emergency food and medicine and demining operations are among the categories of us assistance that could potentially be provided to country that would otherwise be ineligible congressional action for specific counterterrorism programs the foreign operations conference agreement provides amounts as shown in table 9

agreement includes full funding for new usaid buildings in cambodia uganda guinea and mali as requested but resources for other facilities in armenia georgia and zimbabwe appear to be less certain more generally the conference agreement similar to earlier actions by the house and senate largely but not totally supports bilateral security and military aid requests for the frontline states congress makes small reductions in the two foreign operations accounts from which most assistance for the 26 frontline states is drawn the foreign military financing fmf and the economic support fund esf accounts as shown in table 8 above country allocations based on the enacted fy2004 appropriation largely follow amounts requested by the administration the major exception is turkey where the proposed 256 million aid package is reduced to 145 million pl 108119 gives the president authority to transfer an additional 100 million in economic aid for turkey but the money must be drawn from the iraq reconstruction program many believe it is unlikely the administration will implement such transfer previous house action on the fy2004 foreign operations bill hr 2800 would have posed more difficult decisions for the administration in funding some of the frontline states the house reduced the esf recommendation by 275 million 108 but the impact on certain countries including some frontline states would have been more significant about 70 of the esf appropriation was earmarked at or above levels requested for countries of special congressional interest including the frontline nations of afghanistan egypt and jordan on the other side of the equation the legislation reduced by 100 million amounts available for middle east partnership initiative mepi of the remaining esf funds at the housepassed level the administration would have needed to cut nonearmarked countries collectively by about 21 among these nonearmarked esf recipients were the frontline states of pakistan 200 million requested turkey 200 million indonesia 60 million the philippines 20 million and india 20 million which would most likely have had to absorb some of the esf reductions similar situation existed in the senate bill although with an esf cut of only 120 million 5 the impact on frontline states would have been less significant crs40 still aid to nonearmarked recipients would have fallen collectively by about 18 below requested amounts and include the same frontline nations cited above the senate measure had also acknowledged the contributions made by several countries in the war in iraq including albania salvador macedonia mongolia east timor and uganda and encouraged the administration to increase military assistance to these nations millennium challenge account in speech on march 14 2002 at the interamerican development bank president bush outlined proposal for the united states to increase foreign economic assistance beginning in fy2004 so that by fy2006 american aid would be 5 billion higher than three years earlier the funds would be placed in new millennium challenge account mca and be available to developing nations that are pursing political and economic reforms in three areas ruling justly promoting good governance fighting corruption respecting human rights and adhering to the rule of law investing in people providing adequate health care education and other opportunities promoting an educated and healthy population fostering enterprise and entrepreneurship promoting open markets and sustainable budgets if fully implemented the initiative would represent one of the largest increases in foreign aid spending in half century outpaced only by the marshall plan following world war ii and the latin americafocused alliance for progress in the early 1960s the concept is based on the premise that economic development succeeds best where it is linked to free market economic and democratic principles and policies conditioning assistance on policy performance and accountability by recipient nations is not new to us aid programs since the late 1980s at least portions of american development assistance have been allocated to some degree on performancebased system what is different about the mca is the size of the commitment the competitive process that will reward countries for what they have already achieved not just what is promised for the future the pledge to segregate the funds from us strategic foreign policy objectives that often strongly influence where us aid is spent and to the decision to solicit program proposals developed solely by qualifying countries if congress fully funds the presidents mca request and assuming that fy2003 will be the baseline from which to compare growth in foreign aid spending during implementation of the mca 5 billion increase by fy2006 combined with other announced foreign aid initiatives would result in 193 billion foreign aid budget in real terms constant fy2003 dollars taking into the account the estimated effects of inflation us economic assistance in fy2006 would be 182 billion the highest amount since fy1979 and the signing of the camp david middle east peace accords and fy1985 an unusual year in which the united states responded to special middle east economic stabilization and african famine requirements the nominal increase crs41 between fy2003 and fy2006 would be about 47 while in real terms fy2006 funding would be nearly 38 more these figures are less than administration claims of 50 increase in funding due to the mca figure that is apparently calculated using the 10 billion aid level in fy2000 as the base year because of the size of the us economy and continued growth projected over the next several years the mca increases will have minimal impact on the amount of us aid as percent of gdp according to current projections assistance would rise from the 2002 level of 012 of gdp to 015 during the first year of the mca participation will be limited to the 74 poorest nations that are eligible to borrow from the world banks international development association and have per capita incomes below 1435 the list will expand to include all lowermiddle income countries by fy2006 with per capita incomes below 2975 participants will be selected largely based on 16 performance indicators related to the three categories of good governance economic freedom and investing in people countries that score above the median on half of the indicators in each of the three areas will qualify emphasizing the importance of fighting corruption however should country fall below the median on the corruption indicator based on the world bank institutes control of corruption measure it will be automatically disqualified from consideration to manage the mca the administration has proposed the creation of millennium challenge corporation mcc new independent government entity separate from the departments of state and the treasury and from the us agency for international development usaid the white house envisions staff of about 100 drawn from various government agencies and nongovernmental organizations led by ceo confirmed by the senate review board chaired by the secretary of state and composed of the secretary of the treasury and the director of omb would oversee operations of the mcc the decision to house the mca in new organization was one of the most debated issues during early congressional deliberations of the presidents foreign aid initiative the administration argued that because the mca represents new concept in aid delivery it should have fresh organizational structure unencumbered by bureaucratic authorities and regulations that would interfere in effective management critics however contended that if the mca is placed outside the formal us government foreign aid structure it would lead to further fragmentation of policy development and consistency some believed that usaid the principal us aid agency should manage the mca while others say that the mca should reside in the state department where more us foreign policy entities have been integrated in recent years at least some argued the usaid administrator should be member of the mcc board possibly in place of the omb director for fy2004 the administration sought 13 billion for the mcas first year and remained committed to 5 billion budget by fy2006 some believed however that the fy2004 request was less than promised in 2002 at the time administration officials implied that funding might be phased in over three years in equal increments resulting in 167 billion program in fy2004 334 billion level in fy2005 and 5 billion in fy2006 in the presidents budget submission this crs42 year however budget officials said the pace at which resources would rise was never specifically set and that only the 5 billion target for fy2006 is firm commitment congressional action appropriations hr 2800 as passed by the house provided 800 million for the millennium challenge account in fy2004 while the senate included 1 billion both were below the 13 billion request the senate further incorporated into hr 2800 authorizing legislation that had been debated amended but not passed by the senate on july 9 and 10 see below for details on the authorizing text as originally included in s 925 needing to find additional resources for international hivaids funding and for other priorities housesenate conferees tentatively agreed on november 17 to provide 650 million for the mca in fy2004 half the level requested appropriation committee leaders said that because the program was new and would require some months to begin operations larger amounts were not necessary in the first year of the mca the white house however strongly objected to the reduced appropriation and convinced lawmakers to add back 350 million as part of package of additional spending needs that were offset by rescission of prior year defense appropriations and an acrosstheboard cut for nondefense fy2004 programs the conference agreement on hr 2673 the consolidated appropriations act 2004 into which foreign operations has been incorporated includes total of 1 billion for the mca 650 million of which is made available in division d of the bill foreign operations and 350 million in division h miscellaneous appropriations and offsets the house passed hr 2673 on december 8 but the senate most likely will not consider the conference agreement until congress returns on january 20 2004 for the second session congressional action authorization in legislation related to the foreign operations appropriations bill the senate and house debated separate bills to authorize the millennium challenge account when these efforts stalled however the authorizing text was added to the senatepassed foreign operations measure and ultimately incorporated into the conference agreement on hr 2673 earlier on may 29 2003 the senate foreign relations committee reported s 1160 legislation providing 1 billion for the mca in fy2004 23 billion in fy2005 and 5 billion in fy2006 on vote of 118 the committee further approved an amendment by senators biden and hagel that would establish the mca inside the state department under the direction of the secretary of state the legislation abandoned the separate corporation proposal put forward by the administration secretary of state powell wrote the committee saying he would advise the president to veto the legislation if this provision to locate the mca in the state department remained in the bill senator lugar who opposed the bidenhagel amendment proposed an alternative structure in new legislation s 1240 as introduced on june 11 would create millennium challenge corporation headed by ceo who would report to the secretary of state senator lugar intended that such an arrangement would provide the corporation with the same degree of independence and status as usaid but establish chain of command that would permit the secretary of state to exercise broad authority over the mca s 1240 created board of directors made up of the crs43 secretary of state chairman the secretary of the treasury the usaid administrator the us trade representative and the mcc ceo the full senate adopted the general approach proposed by senator lugar when it voted on july 9 to incorporate modified text of mca authorizing legislation into s 925 the foreign affairs authorization fiscal year 2004 the revised composition of the board of the directors proposed in s 1240 was included the approved text further strengthened the explicit relationship between the corporation and the secretary of state by adding that the ceo shall report to and be under the direct authority and foreign policy guidance of the secretary the administration did not express objection to the revised legislation s 925 as amended also would have permitted lowmiddle income nations to participate in the mca program only if appropriations in fy2006 and beyond exceeded 5 billion annually in such years these relatively wealthier countries could compete for only 20 of the total appropriation in many other areas however the legislation adopted the broad concepts recommended by the executive on june 12 the house international relations committee reported an mca authorizing measure hr 2441 containing at the time significant differences with the senate and the administration the legislation authorized 13 billion for fy2004 as requested 3 billion for fy2005 and 5 billion for fy2006 unlike the original senate measure hr 2441 created new millennium challenge corporation sought by the president but altered the composition of the board of directors and the authority of the mccs chief executive officer the board as designed under hr 2441 included the secretary of state as chairman and the secretary of the treasury as proposed but deleted the director of omb and added the usaid administrator the us trade representative and the ceo of the mcc the bill also included four additional members to be appointed by the president from list submitted by the majority and minority leaders of the house and senate the board would have further included as nonvoting exofficio members the ceo of opic and the directors of the trade and development agency peace corps and omb additionally hr 2441 designated the ceo of the corporation as the individual responsible for determining eligible countries rather than the board of directors as recommended by the administration the house bill allowed low middle income countries to participate in the mca beginning in fy2006 regardless of the amount of money appropriated but limited the allocation to these relatively wealthier countries to 20 of mca assistance similar to the senate the house incorporated slightly modified version of hr 2441 as division in hr 1950 an omnibus foreign policy authorization bill the house passed hr 1950 now called the millennium challenge account peace corps expansion and foreign relations authorization act of 2003 on july 16 as noted above the senate added its mca authorizing legislation as amended in s 925 to the foreign operations appropriations measure hr 2800 during debate in late october subsequently hr 2800 was incorporated into hr 2673 the consolidated appropriations act 2004 in which conferees resolved house and senate differences in the earlier versions of mca authorizing legislation on key issues conferees agreed to crs44 create millennium challenge corporation headed by ceo who would report to the board of directions rather than the secretary of state senate or the president house include on the board the secretary of state chairman the secretary of the treasury the us trade representative the usaid administrator the mcc ceo and four others from lists submitted by congressional leaders and nominated by the president allow lowmiddle income countries to participate in mca programs beginning in fy2006 as proposed but caps the total amount funds that can be allocated to these countries at 25 of the mca appropriation the house had proposed 20 cap while the senate had recommended 20 ceiling but only when mca appropriations exceeded 5 billion authorize such sums as may be necessary for fy2004 and fy2005 with mention of fy2006 house and senate bills had included specific amounts for the first two years and an fy2006 authorization of 5 billion table 10 below summarizes these and other key mca issues under debate in authorizing legislation because the mca authorization was not enacted until january 23 2004 pl 108199 and the bills requirement for consultation with congress and public disclosure of eligibility criteria and methodology it appears that mca operations will begin much later than originally anticipated the conference agreement requires period of at least 90 days between naming candidate countries those that meet basic income and other criteria and eligible countries those that are judged to be the best performers and selected to receive mca assistance during this period the eligibility criteria performance indicators and overall methodology of the selection process must be notified to congress and published in the federal register public hearings may be held and public comments will be received as result it appears likely that mca eligible countries will not be named before may 1 2004 at the earliest the selection of program proposals and initial implementation of projects would be expected several months beyond that date crs45 table 10 comparison of

had reported hr 2441 which was incorporated with modifications to hr 1950 and passed by the house on july 16 crs48 development assistance global health priorities and hivaids continuing source of disagreement between the executive branch and congress is how to allocate the roughly 338 billion core budget for usaid development assistance and global health programs among the top congressional development aid funding priorities in recent years have been programs supporting child survival basic education and efforts to combat hivaids and other infectious diseases the administration has also backed these programs but officials object to congressional efforts to increase funding for children and health activities when it comes at the expense of other development sectors most recently during the fy2003 and fy2004 budget cycles some members of congress have argued that it has been the executive branch that has added funds for administration priorities by cutting resources for other development activities in years when congress has increased appropriations for its priorities but not included corresponding boost in the overall development aid budget resources for other aid sectors such as economic growth and the environment have been substantially reduced this was more problematic during the midtolate 1990s when worldwide development aid funding fell significantly in more recent years and especially for fy2003 and fy2004 congress increased overall development assistance so that both congressional and executive program priorities could be funded without significant reductions for nonearmarked activities nevertheless administration officials continue to argue that such practices undermine their flexibility to adjust resource allocations to changing global circumstances in 2001 the bush administration set out revised usaid core goals for sustainable development programs focused around three spheres of emphasis or strategic pillars that include global health economic growth and agriculture and conflict prevention and developmental relief the administration further introduced new initiative the global development alliance gda in an effort to expand publicprivate partnerships in development program implementation under the initiative usaid identifies good development opportunities being conducted by private foundations nongovernmental organizations universities and forprofit organizations and provides parallel financing to leverage resources already committed to these activities usaid officials envisioned that the agency would become much more of coordinating and integrating institution to expand and enhance development efforts of these nongovernmental development partners although it started out as much more ambitious project usaid requested 160 million for fy2002 the gda has received relatively modest funding allocations 20 million in fy2002 and 149 million in fy2003 the fy2004 request sought 15 million underscoring the importance of the debate over funding allocations of development aid resources has been an elevation by the administration of the value of foreign economic assistance as an instrument of us foreign policy since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 president bush announced plans to launch two major foreign aid initiatives the millennium challenge account and the global aids initiative that if approved by congress would significantly boost crs49 funding for development assistance programs moreover the presidents september 2002 national security strategy established global development for the first time as the third pillar of us national security along with defense and diplomacy for fy2004 the president sought substantial increase in overall development assistance although the programs are configured differently than they have been in the past raising questions in some observers minds about the administrations commitment to broadbased worldwide development for core development assistance programs that match the current structure of usaids strategic pillars and foreign operations appropriation accounts for development assistance and child survival and health program fund the administration proposed 284 billion as shown in table 11 this represented 245 million or 8 reduction from amounts for fy2003 with the exception of hivaids democracy programs and to far less extent agriculture and economic growth activities all other development sectors would have received less funding in fy2004 than appropriated for fy2003 table 11 development assistance funding

appropriations bills b usaids strategic pillar for global health corresponds to the child survival and health program fund account in title ii of annual foreign operations appropriations bills two new initiatives proposed for fy2004 that would be managed outside of usaid core development programs however pushed overall us development assistance well above fy2003 levels with the additions of the global aids initiative and the millennium challenge account for which 450 million and 13 billion respectively were requested total development aid in fy2004 would grow to 46 billion or 49 higher than fy2003 amounts crs50 while development assistance supporters applauded the increases sought for the new initiatives they remained concerned over the reductions proposed for usaids core development accounts the latter are worldwide activities that serve multiple development needs in over 55 countries that range from nations with sound commitment to economic and democratic reforms to countries emerging from conflict to failed states that confront humanitarian crises the hivaids and mca proposals on the other hand are more narrowly focused the global aids initiative implementing prevention treatment and care projects are to focus largely on 14 priority countries in africa and the caribbean the millennium challenge account will likely support programs in the first year in perhaps as few as 810 best performingcountries that have demonstrated progress in the areas of governance economic freedom and social investments in people the administration further had said that mca funding would be in addition not substitute for continuing core development activities critics charged that the fy2004 budget request violated that pledge by cutting amounts for core programs what some observers found most problematic about the fy2004 development assistance request was that increases for selected areas especially those for hivaids to some extent resulted from reductions in other development programs see table 12 among health programs each subsector was cut except for hivaids funding for other infectious diseases including tuberculosis and malaria would have fallen by onethird under the presidents budget request child survival activities would be cut by 11 reproductive health would drop by 5 and vulnerable child programs would be reduced from 27 million to 10 million the administration recommended similar reductions in its fy2003 budget request last year but congress restored most of the funds that would have been lost under the presidents recommendation for example usaid had sought 110 million for non hivaids infectious diseases out of the child survival and health program fund account for fy2003 an amount that rose to 1545 million due to subsequent congressional additions in the foreign operations appropriation aside from global health programs usaid proposed mix of budget increases and cuts for other core development sectors those scheduled for higher spending included agriculture programs would increase by 4 to 268 million economic growth activities including trade and investment programs would rise less than 1 democracy and local governance would grow by 20 although large increases for afghanistan and pakistan would leave similar programs in africa and latin america below fy2003 levels funding for other core development areas would decline environmental activities would drop by 6 to 286 million basic education high congressional priority for number of years would fall by 2 to 212 million and resources for higher education would be cut by 17 human rights and conflict prevention programs would be reduced collectively by over onethird crs51 resources for some or all of these sectors however could rise and in some cases significantly when mca programs are selected the 13 billion sought by the president in fy2004 will be allocated among selected few best performing low income countries supporting the highest

crs52 international hivaids by far the largest growth area for development assistance was for hivaids prevention treatment and care programs table 13 resources requested under the foreign operations bill for hivaids in fy2004 totaled 124 billion 41 increase over 877 million appropriated for fy2003 moreover the administration sought another 680 million for international hivaids from nonforeign operations accounts most importantly for the centers for disease control and prevention funded under the laborhhseducation appropriation bill the total request across all appropriation measures for fy2004 was 192 billion the administration frequently used total of 2 billion in its estimates of fy2004 funds requested for international hivaids programs these executive estimates included usaid resources for tuberculosis and malaria that are not calculated in the 192 billion level shown in table 13 controversial issue was the presidents proposal for 200 million contribution to the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria 100 million each from foreign operations and laborhhseducation appropriation measures for fy2003 congress increased the us contribution to 350 million and subsequently authorized up to 1 billion for fy2004 in pl 10825 the united states leadership against hivaids tuberculosis and malaria act of 2003 congressional action house debate on july 23 the house approved 343 billion for core bilateral development programs an amount about 140 million higher than the presidents request and 350 million above regular fy2003 amounts the bill hr 2800 while adding over 320 million to fy2003 totals for the child survival and health account reduced nonhealth programs by nearly 30 million from the administrations request and 63 million from fy2003 amounts at these levels this have would resulted in small cuts for activities such as agriculture economic growth environment and democracy promotion for one of the highest administration and congressional foreign aid priorities the house provided 127 billion for international hivaids 30 million above the presidents request and 395 million higher than fy2003 combined with parallel funding approved in the house

nonhivaids infectious diseases from 104 million to 156 million hr 2800 within the development assistance account placed high priority on trade capacity building activities increasing funding to 194

sparked continuous controversy during foreign operations debates for nearly two decades for fy2004 the administration requested 425 million for bilateral population assistance the same as proposed last year but below the 4465 million appropriated by congress for fy2003 although funding considerations have at times been heatedly debated by congress the most contentious family planning issues addressed in nearly every annual congressional consideration of foreign operations bills have focused on two matters whether the united states should contribute to the population fund unfpa if the organization maintains program in china where allegations of coercive family planning have been widespread for many years and whether abortionrelated restrictions should be applied to bilateral usaid population aid grants commonly known as the mexico city policy crs59 unfpa funding the most contentious issue usually concerns the abortion restriction question but most recent attention has focused on unfpa and white house decision in july 2002 to block the 34 million us contribution to the organization during the reagan and bush administrations the united states did not contribute to unfpa because of concerns over practices of forced abortion and involuntary sterilization in china where unfpa maintains programs in 1985 congress passed the socalled kempkasten amendment which has been made part of every foreign operations appropriation since barring us funds to any organization that supports or participates in the management of program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in 1993 president clinton determined that unfpa despite its presence in china was not involved in the management of coercive program in most years since 1993 congress has appropriated about 25 million for unfpa but added directive that required that the amount be reduced by however much unfpa spent in china consequently the us contribution has fluctuated between 215 million and 25 million for fy2002 president bush requested 25 million for unfpa as part of larger package concerning various international family planning issues congress provided in the fy2002 foreign operations bill not more than 34 million for unfpa while members of the appropriations committees say it was their intent to provide the full 34 million the language allowed the president to allocate however much he chose up to 34 million ceiling according to february 27 2002 testimony by arthur dewey assistant secretary of state for population refugees and migration before the senate foreign relations committee the white house placed hold on unfpa funds in january 2002 because new evidence suggested that coercive practices were continuing in chinese counties where unfpa concentrates its programs september 2001 investigation team sponsored by the population research institute concluded that consistent pattern of coercion continued in model unfpa counties including forced abortions and involuntary sterilizations refuting these findings unfpacommissioned review team found in october 2001 absolutely evidence that the population fund supports coercive family planning practices in china or violates the human rights of chinese people in any way see house international relations committee hearing coercive population control in china new evidence of forced abortion and forced sterilization october 17 2001 see also testimony of josephine guy and nicholaas biegman before the senate foreign relations committee february 27 2002 although most observers agree that coercive family planning practices continue in china differences remain over the extent to which if any unfpa supports involuntary activities and whether unfpa should operate at all in country where such conditions exist given the conflicting reports the state department sent its own investigative team to china for twoweek review of unfpa programs on may 13 2002 the team which was led by former ambassador william brown and included bonnie glick former state department official and dr theodore tong public health professor at the university of arizona made three findings and recommendations in its report dated may 31 crs60 findings there is evidence that unfpa knowingly supported or participated in the management of program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in china china maintains coercive elements in its population programs and chinese leaders view population control as high priority and remain concerned over implications of loosening controls for socioeconomic change recommendations the united states should release not more than 34 million of previously appropriated funds to unfpa until china ends all forms of coercion in law and practice us government funds should be allocated to population programs in china and appropriate resources possibly from the united states should be allocated to monitor and evaluate chinese population control programs despite the teams recommendation to release the 34 million secretary of state powell decided on july 22 2002 to withhold funds to unfpa and to recommend that they be redirected to other international family planning and reproductive health activities the authority to make this decision had been delegated previously by the president to the secretary of state the state departments analysis of the secretarys determination found that even though unfpa did not knowingly support or participate in coercive practice that alone would not preclude the application of kempkasten instead finding that the recipient of us funds in this case unfpa simply supports or participates in such program whether knowingly or unknowingly would trigger the restriction the team found that the chinese government imposes fines and penalties on families that have children exceeding the number approved by the government practice that in some cases coerces women to have abortions they would not otherwise undergo the state department analysis concluded that unfpas involvement in chinas family planning program allows the chinese government to implement more effectively its program of coercive abortion the full text of the state departments analysis is online at the state departments web site at httpwwwstategovgprmrlsother12128htm the state departments assessment team report is also online at httpwwwstategovgprmrlsrpt 200212122htm critics of the administrations decision opposed it not only because of the negative impact it may have on access to voluntary family planning programs by persons in around 140 countries where unfpa operates but also because of the possible application of the determination for other international organizations that operate in china and to which the us contributes for fy2003 the president proposed funding for unfpa although 25 million was requested in reserve for the account from which unfpa receives its funding presumably this could have been made available to unfpa if it was found crs61 not to be in violation of kempkasten following several legislative attempts to reverse the administrations denial of unfpa in both fy2002 supplemental appropriations and regular fy2003 foreign operations measures congress approved in pl 1087 the consolidated appropriations act for fy2003 provision allocating 34 million to unfpa the same as in fy2002 so long as several conditions were met the most significant requirement was that the president must certify that unfpa is longer involved in the management of coercive family planning program since the july 2002 determination the administration has transferred to usaid 34 million from fy2002 appropriations and 25 million from fy2003 that would have otherwise been provided to unfpa in order to fund usaid bilateral family planning programs for which unfpa has involvement the state departments justification of its september 25 2003 letter to congress regarding the fy2003 resources noted that the factual circumstances do not support making determination that unfpa longer supports or participates in the management of program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization section 572 of the fy2003 foreign operations appropriations required the president to issue such statement before restoring us funding to unfpa like for fy2003 the fy2004 foreign operations request did not propose funding for unfpa but placed 25 million in reserve for unidentified voluntary contributions to international organizations mexico city policy the debate over international family planning policy and abortion began nearly three decades ago in 1973 when congress added provision to the foreign assistance act of 1961 prohibiting the use of us appropriated funds for abortionrelated activities and coercive family planning programs during the mid1980s in what has become known as the mexico city policy because it was first announced at the 1984 mexico city population conference the reagan administration and later the george h w bush administration restricted funds for foreign nongovernmental organizations ngos that were involved in performing or promoting abortions in countries where they worked even if such activities were undertaken with nonus funds several groups including international planned parenthood federationlondon ippflondon became ineligible for us financial support in some subsequent years congress narrowly approved measures to overturn this prohibition but white house vetoes kept the policy in place president clinton in 1993 reversed the position of his two predecessors allowing the united states to resume funding for all family planning organizations so long as us money was used by those involved in abortion related work between 1996 and 2000 the house and senate took opposing positions on the mexico city issue actions that repeatedly held up enactment of the final foreign operations spending measures the house position articulated by representative chris smith nj and others supported reinstatement of the mexico city policy restricting us aid funds to foreign organizations involved in performing abortions or in lobbying to change abortion laws or policies in foreign countries the senate on the other hand rejected in most cases house provisions dealing with mexico city policy favoring position that left these decisions in the hands of the crs62 administration unable to reach an agreement satisfactory to both sides congress adopted interim arrangements during this period that did not resolve the broad population program controversy but permitted the stalled foreign operations measure to move forward the annual compromise removed houseadded mexico city restrictions but reduced population assistance to 385 million and in several years metered the availability of the funds at rate of onetwelfth of the 385 million per month in fy2000 when the issue became linked with the separate foreign policy matter of paying us arrears owed to the united nations reluctant president clinton agreed to modified version of abortion restrictions marking the first time that mexico city conditions had been included in legislation signed by the president enacted in the foreign operations act for fy2000 hr 3422 incorporated into hr 3194 the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 pl 106113 because the president could waive the restrictions for 15 million in grants to organizations that refused to certify there was major impact on usaid family planning programs in fy2000 other than the reduction of 125 million in population assistance that the legislation required if the white house exercised the waiver authority when congress again came to an impasse in fy2001 lawmakers agreed to allow the new president to set policy under the fy2001 foreign operations measure none of the 425 million appropriation could be obligated until after february 15 2001 subsequently on january 22 2001 two days after taking office president bush issued memorandum to the usaid administrator rescinding the 1993 memorandum from president clinton and directing the administrator to reinstate in full all of the requirements of the mexico city policy in effect on january 19 1993 the president further said that it was his conviction that taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortions or to advocate or actively promote abortion either here or abroad separate statement from the presidents press secretary stated that president bush was committed to maintaining the 425 million funding level for population assistance because he knows that one of the best ways to prevent abortion is by providing quality voluntary family planning services the press secretary further emphasized that it was the intent that any restrictions do not limit organizations from treating injuries or illnesses caused by legal or illegal abortions for example post abortion care on february 15 2001 the day on which fy2001 population aid funds became available for obligation usaid issued specific policy language and contract clauses to implement the presidents directive the guidelines are nearly identical to those used in the 1980s and early 1990s when the mexico city policy applied critics of the certification requirement oppose it on several grounds they believe that family planning organizations may cut back on services because they are unsure of the full implications of the restrictions and do not want to risk losing eligibility for usaid funding this they contend will lead to higher numbers of unwanted pregnancies and possibly more abortions opponents also believe the new conditions undermine relations between the us government and foreign ngos and multilateral groups creating situation in which the united states challenges their crs63 decisions on how to spend their own money they further argue that us policy imposes socalled gag order on the ability of foreign ngos and multilateral groups to promote changes to abortion laws and regulations in developing nations this would be unconstitutional if applied to american groups working in the united states critics note supporters of the certification requirement argue that even though permanent law bans usaid funds from being used to perform or promote abortions money is fungible organizations receiving americantaxpayer funding can simply use usaid resources for permitted activities while diverting money raised from other sources to perform abortions or lobby to change abortion laws and regulations the certification process they contend closes the fungibility loophole since reinstatement of the mexico city policy in early 2001 several bills have been introduced to reverse the policy but except for language included in the senate fy2004 foreign operations appropriations bill see below none has passed either the house or senate and measure has been enacted into law congressional action on july 23 the house approved in hr 2800 425 million for bilateral family planning programs as requested for unfpa contributions the house bill provided 25 million available only under certain conditions none of the funds can be used in china funds must be maintained by unfpa in separate account and may not commingle amounts unfpa does not perform abortions unfpa does not provide any resources for the chinese state plannedbirth commission or its regional affiliates and us contributions will be reduced by whatever amount if any unfpa spends in china in addition the terms of the kempkasten amendment continued to apply the terms of which resulted in cutoff of us contributions in fy2002 on july 17 the senate appropriations committee approved its fy2004 foreign operations s 1426 including several significant changes regarding international family planning funding and policy that were opposed by the administration the senate on october 30 subsequently passed the legislation approving the house bill hr 2800 without making changes to the committeereported text concerning international family planning issues for bilateral family planning activities the senate bill provided 445 million 20 million above the presidents request in section 691 the bill effectively reversed the administrations mexico city policy specifically the provision stated that foreign ngos shall not be declared ineligible for us funds solely on the basis of health or medical services they provide including counseling and referral services with nonus government funds this exemption would apply so long as the services do not violate the law of the country in which they are performed and that they would not violate us laws if provided in the united states section 691 further crs64 provided that nonus government funds used by foreign ngos for advocacy and lobbying activities would be subject to conditions that also apply to us ngos since it is largely held that american ngos would not be subject to these restrictions under the constitutional protection of free speech it was possible that this latter exemption would have lifted current prohibitions that apply to overseas ngos in the white house statement of administration policy for s 1426 the executive said that the president would veto the bill if it included this provision for unfpa the senate bill provided 35 million in fy2004 but made these funds together with those appropriated for fy2002 and fy2003 subject to kemp kasten limitations and current restrictions that apply in fy2003 the conference agreement on hr 2673 the consolidated appropriations act 2004 pl 108199 within which foreign operations is included as division d earmarks 432 million for bilateral family planning assistance 7 million higher than the request deletes the senate provision reversing the mexico city policy and modifies house and senatepassed text regarding unfpa for unfpa the legislation earmarks 34 million subject however to the kempkasten conditions that resulted in the withholding of funds the past two years more specifically the bill specifies that none of the funds can be used in china funds must be maintained by unfpa in separate account and may not be commingled with other sums and unfpa does not perform abortions the conference agreement further directs how the previously withheld money will be disbursed thereby resolving longstanding dispute over whether to commit these resources to other development programs or place them in reserve account in case unfpa again becomes eligible for us support hr 2673 specifies that the 34 million withheld in fy2002 shall be used for family planning programs in twelve countries including congo ethiopia uganda haiti and russia the 25 million in fy2003 funds that was earmarked but not transferred to unfpa will now be made available for new initiative within the child survival and health account assisting young women mothers and children who are victims of trafficking in persons in authorizing legislation related to portions of the foreign operations appropriation bill the house voted on july 15 216211 to delete committee approved amendment added to hr 1950 that sought to restore us funding to unfpa on may 8 the international relations committee had approved provision offered by congressman crowley that authorized 50 million for us contribution to unfpa for each of fy2004 and fy2005 the crowley amendment further would have altered existing law for determining unfpa eligibility by requiring that the president find that unfpa does not directly support or participate in coercive or involuntary activities this would appear to make it more difficult for the president to block funding for unfpa than under conditions that apply for this year not only would the crowley amendment have added the word directly but also defined the circumstances under which unfpa would be found ineligible as knowingly and crs65 intentionally working with purpose to continue advance or expand the practice of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization or playing primary and essential role in coercive or involuntary aspect of countrys family planning program in another authorizing bill s 925 the foreign relations authorization for fy2004 the senate added on july 9 an amendment by senator boxer that like s 1426 would effectively reject the presidents mexico city policy senate opponents had tried to table the boxer amendment an effort that failed on vote of 4353 the administration strongly opposes the boxer amendment and says the president would veto the bill if it remains in the legislation the senate has not resumed consideration of s 925 afghanistan reconstruction6 congress considered simultaneous requests in 2003 for additional reconstruction aid for afghanistan in the regular fy2004 foreign operations budget proposal submitted in february 2003 the administration asked for 550 million for economic and military support for kabul more recently as part of the presidents 87 billion fy2004 supplemental request most of which would support us military operations in iraq and afghanistan and iraq reconstruction the white house proposed 799 million additional aid for afghanistan the administration further planned to re program 390 million prior year dod state department and usaid appropriations for afghan reconstruction the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense and reconstruction of iraq and afghanistan pl 108106 appropriated 1164 billion to afghanistan the consolidated appropriations act 2004 hr 2673 pl 108199 within which fy2004 foreign operations regular spending was incorporated provides 405 million for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to afghanistan this brings the total fy2004 aid package for afghanistan to nearly 16 billion the conditions in afghanistan represent challenging mix of ongoing security concerns infrastructure destruction and humanitarian needs likely requiring robust and sustained intervention while the hunt for qaeda forces within afghanistan continues transitional and reconstruction assistance are well underway an examination of the progress of reconstruction efforts and aid priorities since december 2001 reveals the complexity of the tasks at hand and the important roles to be played by the united states and the international community the case of afghanistan may present special category of international crisis response in which the united states and others pursue the war on terrorism in country while simultaneously providing humanitarian and reconstruction assistance so far the international community has continued to provide large amounts of aid and resources for the reconstruction effort longterm commitment will likely be necessary to ensure that stable democratic afghanistan emerges and will not fall prey to the twin evils of drugs and terrorism the outcomes of the international donors conference in january 2002 and other donor conferences since then indicate strong willingness on the part of the international community to assist in the 6 this section was prepared by rhoda margesson crs66 restoration of afghanistan however reconstruction costs are estimated by some to be more than 1530 billion over the next decade current operating environment key developments since september 11 2001 and the collapse of the taliban focus on three main pillars first the development of plans for security including the presence of an international security assistance force isaf the establishment and training of an afghan national army and police force the demobilization of private militias and the formation of provincial reconstruction teams second establishing the political framework through the bonn conference and afghanistan interim administration aia the loya jirga and islamic transitional government of afghanistan itga and renewed diplomatic ties with the international community and third the creation of strategy for reconstruction beginning with the tokyo reconstruction conference in january 2002 the current operating environment continues to highlight the importance of these three themes and the work that remains to be done to assure afghanistans recovery the most serious challenge facing afghanistan today is the lack of security former commanders maintain control over their own areas and continue fighting with their rivals making difficult the extension of control by the national government the provision of humanitarian assistance and progress on reconstruction the isaf created by the bonn agreement has reached its agreed strength of about 5500 nato assumed command of the 30nation force in august 2003 because of ongoing threats to afghanistans internal security there have been calls for isaf expansion and deployment to other cities in october 2003 the security council formally backed an expansion of isaf outside of kabul by adopting resolution 1510 us forces with participation from french and british forces are continuing to train new afghan national army that it is hoped will ultimately allow the kabul government to maintain security on its own and enable foreign forces to depart afghanistan the targeted size of the army is 70000 but it is expected to take several years to achieve full strength with the continued fighting and insecurity the japan and unled process of demobilization and integration of combatants has also been slow ensuring secure environment for reconstruction gained greater attention with an initiative by the pentagon to expand the role of the us military in afghanistan in december 2002 dod announced that it would be setting up provincial reconstruction teams prts composed of us combat and civil affairs officers to provide security for reconstruction workers and to extend the influence of the kabul government plans call for eight to ten prts six of these prts are already in operation including one run by britain one by new zealand and one by germany and observers say ngos are gravitating to areas where they are present due to improved security this marks departure from the previous policy of relying solely on security through the development of an afghan national army or expansion of the isaf and engages us forces beyond military action to oust the taliban and qaeda crs67 still factional fighting and increased criminal activity have undermined relief and reconstruction operations in some cases where operations were directly targeted this has led to the temporary suspension of missions or withdrawal of aid agencies from certain areas the united nations has begun database to record national security incidents and to provide more effective timely information and situation assessments to the aid community the strength and influence of the central government is viewed as key factor that will determine the success of the intervention and assistance on the part of the international community humanitarian and reconstruction programs face the challenge of maintaining their foothold despite the complex humanitarian requirements such as population returns and resettlement food security shelter and winter assistance and reconstruction problems such as rebuilding the infrastructure economy and agricultural base addressing landmines and environmental damage and reestablishing health education and community centers afghanistan is beginning to prepare for presidential elections to take place in 2004 followed by parliamentary elections one year later loya jirga began in mid december 2003 to consider draft permanent constitution that was publicly unveiled on november 3 after constitution is adopted us afghan and international attention will turn to the holding of elections apart from the security problems the current operating environment presents number of other urgent challenges the collapsed infrastructure rugged terrain and extreme weather are significant factors with regard to access food aid logistics reconstruction and must be understood in the context of the continuing vast numbers of refugees and idps the differences among the regions in which they are located and the political and security situation throughout the country there is need for stronger links between humanitarian and reconstruction projects so that afghans can begin to move beyond initial reintegration to more permanent resettlement unhcr continues to assist refugees and idps although some have raised concerns that the infrastructure may not yet be able to support this many returnees the united states has international help in carrying out the reconstruction of afghanistan the united states is training the new army and about 9000 us troops continue to combat talibanal qaeda remnants the us treasury department is advising the government on its budget and other financial affairs among contributions by other countries italy is providing advice on judicial reform and germany is helping establish national police force the united states japan and saudi arabia are financing the rebuilding of the kabulqandaharherat major roadway there have been some reports that afghanistan officials have complained about the slow pace at which pledged funds were being paid in similar vein in the past the united states has been critical of other donors for not meeting their fair share of the cost of recovery and for not doing enough on multilateral level on the one hand determining the fair share of the costs of reconstruction for any one country or group of countries varies from conflict to conflict and depends in part on the resources being spent on conflicts elsewhere on the other hand the way in which funds are distributed be it multilaterally through agencies or bilaterally with funds supporting international organizations and ngos directly has direct crs68 impact on implementation others are concerned that international donors might shift their focus to iraq reconstruction and lose interest or run too low on resources to continue to participate in afghan reconstruction if progress on security road construction and reconstruction efforts are made in advance of the planned 2004 elections it could increase the chances of the success of moderates in those elections additional funding could also have an impact on decisions by the international community possibly resulting in larger contributions it could also help efforts of the afghan government to expand isaf which is now limited only to kabul increased funding could also have negative implications there are concerns that it could add to the already high levels of corruption some experts are concerned about absorption capacity and whether additional funds can be allocated quickly and effectively if progress is not achieved the increase could be seen as largely symbolic and ineffective others have raised the possibility that the united states will be seen giving too much support to the karzai government in advance of the 2004 elections tokyo pledging conference the international conference on reconstruction assistance to afghanistan held in tokyo in january 2002 gave the afghan interim authority aia chance to demonstrate its commitment to the next phase of afghanistans recovery and provided the international donor community an opportunity to come together and formally demonstrate support for this initiative the sixtyone countries and twentyone international organizations represented pledged 18 billion for 2002 the us government pledged 297 million drawn from existing sources either from the 40 billion emergency terrorism response supplemental pl 10738 that was passed shortly after the september 11 2001 attacks or from regular fy2002 appropriations the total pledged at tokyo was 45 billion with some states making pledges over multiple years and commitments to be carried out in different time frames some countries offered support in kind but placed monetary value on that subsequent us aid transfers fy2002 and fy2003 since the tokyo pledging conference through supplemental and regular appropriation bills congress has approved an additional 970 million in us assistance to afghanistan making kabul one of the largest recipients of american aid an emergency fy2002 supplemental measure pl 107206 added 258 million for afghanistan to amounts previously allocated bringing the total amount of us assistance in fy2002 to 686 million well in excess of funding pledged at the tokyo conference in fy2003 congress passed in regular pl 1087 and supplemental pl 10811 appropriation acts over 700 million of which 647 million came under foreign operations programs in each of these actions congress increased levels beyond those requested by the administration the 40 million addon in pl 10811 allowed usaid to accelerate the kabulqandaharherat road construction project that is jointly financed with japan and saudi arabia in related legislation the afghanistan freedom support act of 2002 pl 107 327 s 2712 passed by congress on november 15 2002 and signed by the president on december 4 2002 authorizes an additional 33 billion for afghanistan

security assistance force with an authorization of an additional 1 billion over two years fy2004 regular afghanistan aid request for fy2004 regular appropriations the administration requested 550 million for afghanistan although the fy2004 proposal was less than for fy2002 and fy2003 when funding for humanitarian programs in fy2004 food refugees disaster relief are added the total sum is nearer the aid amounts of previous years humanitarian funds are usually not allocated on country basis until the fiscal year begins fy2004 supplemental request subsequently as part of an 87 billion fy2004 supplemental proposal mainly to fund continuing military operations and reconstruction programs in iraq the administrations requested in september 2003 12 billion in additional afghanistan assistance of the total 799 million would be for new appropriations and 390 million would come from previously appropriated dod state department and usaid funds the new funding more than doubled us assistance to afghanistan in fy2003 the proposal came at time of growing criticism over delays in aid delivery deteriorating security conditions and concern that us and international attention was shifted to iraq key features of the 799 million in new appropriation included targeting projects that would have the most immediate impact on the lives of the afghan population such as 402 million for security with funding included to train and support police border patrol the military and counternarcotics forces disarmament and demobilization programs and courthouse construction in kabul 129 million to reinforce the authority of the government of afghanistan with budget support for high priority projects technical experts placed in afghan ministries and voter registration and election support 105 million for completion of the kabulkandaharherat major highway program jointly financed by the united states japan and saudi arabia and 163 million for social programs and critical infrastructure including education health and local projects an additional 390 million was planned to come from reallocated prioryear funds but the administration did not specified how they would be used the white house also asked that the 300 million limit on military drawdowns from dod stocks enacted in the afghanistan freedom support act of 2002 pl 107327 be increased to 600 million congressional action fy2004 regular afghanistan appropriation in midjuly 2003 the house approved not less than 600 million for afghan reconstruction in fy2004 in crs70 the foreign operations funding measure hr 2800 this level was 50 million higher than the administrations request although the presidents proposal did not reflect funds drawn from the refugee and disaster relief foreign operations accounts which could count towards the 600 million house target the house appropriations committee further urged the state department coordinator of assistance to afghanistan and usaid to allocate at least 10 million 5 million from funds in hr 2800 to support afghan women to include the construction of 17 womens centers that provide legal and protective services computer and literacy classes and vocational courses the senate measure s 1426 as amended and passed as hr 2800 also provided 600 million the senate appropriations committee highlighted several aspects of us reconstruction efforts for continued support training for the afghan national army and national police combating narcotics production bolstering democratic institutions protecting and strengthening opportunities for afghan women in the economy and politics of the country including support for womenled afghan ngos supporting the afghan human rights commission and the judicial reform commission targeting aid on afghan communities and families who were victims of military operations and removing mines ordnance and munitions in afghanistan subsequently foreign operations spending was incorporated as division d into

submitted to congress on september 17 2003 203 billion request in additional iraq reconstruction and security funding the resources were part of an 87 billion package covering us military costs and smaller amounts for accelerating rehabilitation efforts in afghanistan this new supplemental followed earlier approval in april of roughly 3 billion for the purposes of relief and reconstruction in iraq in the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act 2003 pl 10811 hr 1559 of the total provided in pl 7 this section was prepared by curt tarnoff and rhoda margesson crs73 10811 248 billion was placed in special iraq relief and reconstruction fund supporting efforts in wide range of sectors including water and sanitation food electricity education and rule of law the fy2003 supplemental also provided 4893 million through the department of defense budget for repair of oil facilities fy2004 supplemental proposal the fy2004 supplemental was intended to fund the most pressing immediate needs in iraq with the aim of having noticeable impact on the two greatest reconstruction concerns that have been raised since the occupation of iraq began security and infrastructure more than 5 billion would be targeted at improving the security capabilities of the iraqi people and government including training and equipment for border customs police and fire personnel and to develop new iraqi army and civil defense corps enhanced efforts to reform the judicial system would also be made most of the remaining supplemental reconstruction request would go toward rapid improvements in infrastructure including electricity oil infrastructure water and sewerage transportation telecommunications housing roads bridges and hospitals and health clinics these according to administration officials represented the most urgent needs over the next 12 months but by means addressed total reconstruction requirements in 2004 other concerns in such areas of government reform agriculture

overview among the key policy objectives laid out by the bush administration in conjunction with the war in iraq were the restoration of basic human services and the economic and political reconstruction of the country while immediate overall responsibility for the war and management of us military activity in postwar iraq belongs to the commander of us central command the coalition provisional authority cpa is responsible for the administration of iraq and implementing assistance efforts there the authority is headed by l paul bremer appointed by the president on may 6 he reports to defense secretary rumsfeld the cpa is staffed by officials from agencies throughout the us government as well as personnel from other coalition member nations coalition coordinating council provides liaison with ngos donor countries and agencies and directs humanitarian affairs crs75 the cpa has initiated process intended to lead to iraqi selfrule it has appointed 25member iraqi governing council and provided it with specific powers and duties including the choosing of cabinet to serve as ministers under the supervision of cpa advisors and the responsibility to set in motion formulation of national constitution it has encouraged establishment of councils in villages and cities throughout the country to run local affairs and identify community needs with cpa funding and encouragement institutions of civil and economic society have been reconstituted schools including universities hospitals and health clinics are functioning the oilforfood program continues to provide basic foodstuffs new police and security forces are being trained programs to renovate and repair electric power water oil production roads and bridges airports and the seaport were launched jobs programs have been instituted to help stimulate the economy and lessen unemployment although much has been accomplished since the us occupation began in april the occupation authority in the view of many has failed to successfully reestablish order and security restore infrastructure and introduce political and economic reform including iraqi selfgovernance in timely manner these problems are interlinked the successful conduct of much reconstruction work is contingent on an environment of order and stability and the lack of visible progress in restoring basic infrastructure and institutions of security opens the door to political discontent and opposition the 203 billion supplemental request sought to address those infrastructure and security concerns that have made insufficient progress and on which other us objectives in iraq hinge until mid2003 the administration had suggested that the cost of reconstruction up to the end of 2003 could largely be met by iraqi and already previously appropriated us resources national budget for iraq covering the rest of the year announced by the cpa on july 7 estimated expenditures of 61 billion and the creation of central bank currency reserve of 21 billion for total budget of 82 billion new oil revenue taxes and profits from state owned enterprises would make up 39 billion of these costs according to the cpas analysis the remaining deficit of 43 billion would be covered by recently frozen and seized assets 25 billion the development fund for iraq 12 billion and 3 billion in already appropriated us assistance iraq was projected to have 11 billion remaining for reconstruction by end of december 2003 the administration request suggested that reassessment of iraqs immediate reconstruction needs demanded greater outlays of revenue than projected in july it also suggested that presumed sources of additional revenue in 2004 chiefly oil export production and international donor contributions might not be as large as originally anticipated in any case the result was supplemental reconstruction request nearly 20 larger than the size of the entire national budget for iraq projected on an annualized basis in early july reconstruction concerns and critical assessment total reconstruction costs as noted above the supplemental request was intended to meet only the most important immediate needs in iraq in the 2004 fiscal year until october 2003 the cost of iraq reconstruction was based on crs76 speculation and educated guesswork however as part of the leadin to an international donors conference held in madrid on october 24 the world bank and the development program released needs assessment they conducted of 14 iraqi economic and social sectors8 the bankundp assessments put the cost of reconstruction for the 14 sectors at 36 billion over four years figure that does not include 194 billion estimated by the cpa for security oil and other critical sectors not covered by the bank assessments9 total bankcpa projected reconstruction costs through 2007 amount to 55 billion 175 billion in 2004 alone if iraqi oil revenues are not sufficient to meet the projected needs which appears likely in the near term by most accounts and other international donors do not pledge significant contributions the united states may face increased financial demands if it seeks to meet projected iraqi needs iraqi oil revenues and financing reconstruction until mid2003 the administration had expected most costs of reconstruction to be borne by iraq through receipts from its oil exports while the decrepit state of oil production infrastructure and recurrent sabotage to pipelines and facilities have forced experts to downgrade expectations of potential exports and receipts any sustained increase in production will assist the reconstruction effort current rates of production are nearing 2 million barrelsday but iraqis do not expect to reach 25 million barrels until spring and 3 million until the end of 2004 administration estimates of the prewar level range between 25 and 3 million barrels ambassador bremer indicated at senate hearing on september 22 that he expected iraq to produce sufficient oil in 2005 to take care of its basic needs and provide additional funds for capital investment10 undersecretary of state larson projected 12 billion in revenue in 2004 and 19 billion in 200511 an association of leading banks and financiers the institute of international finance predicted that oil revenue will be insufficient to cover the iraqi operational budget in 2004 leaving nothing for reconstruction12 roughly 503 million had been allocated by september 2003 from the fy2003 emergency wartime supplemental for repair of oil facilities and restoration of production and distribution systems the administration request for these purposes under the fy2004 supplemental was 21 billion additional sums for iraqi security forces were in part intended to create an iraqi force that would prevent pipeline and other oil facility sabotage 8 for the full text of the report online see the world bank website at

financial times october 3 2003 crs77 loans vs grants for reconstruction closely related to the issue of iraqi oil revenues as means of financing reconstruction projects was the question of whether assistance could be extended on loan rather than grant basis some argued that given the substantial amount of oil revenues that iraq will generate at some point in the future baghdad would have the means to service debt incurred for the purpose of rebuilding its infrastructure loans either extended bilaterally or through some sort of trust fund possibly managed by the world bank would be repaid at some point thereby reducing reconstruction costs to the united states they said the administration which proposed that the entire 203 billion supplemental be offered as grants argued repeatedly during congressional hearings against adding to iraqs already substantial debt obligations witnesses asserted that iraq owed roughly 200 billion in prewar debts reparations and other claims g7 leaders agreed informally at the june 2003 summit to suspend through 2004 the requirement for iraq to service any existing debt giving time to construct some sort of multilateral debt restructuring arrangement13 further security council resolution 1483 stated that iraqi oil exports or proceeds could not be attached by creditors through 2007 unless authorized by the council beyond the matter of whether iraq should incur more debt obligations in the near term was the question over who could legally assume responsibility for new sovereign debt although it would be possible that the world bank could manage an iraq reconstruction trust fund that would receive contributions from international donors if the bank were to use these resources for project lending it would almost certainly require as it has in the past that some sort of sovereign iraq authority assume the debt obligation until such time that legal authority is transferred to iraqi hands the coalition provisional authority is the temporary government of iraq and would be the one signing for the loans most legal scholars take the position that an occupying power has authority to incur new debts on behalf of the displaced sovereign14 some contend however that there is an exception in which new government would be responsible for the debt if it can be shown that the loans were required for the welfare of the occupied territory and the terms were fair and reasonable15 this issue was closely examined by lawmakers the senate adopted 5147 an amendment by senators bayh and nelson on october 16 converting 10 billion of reconstruction grants to loans which could be later restored as grants if foreign 13 see for example testimony of secretary of defense rumsfeld before the senate appropriations committee on september

on the senate floor tabled in both venues that would have created an authority to use iraqi oil to secure reconstruction financing and convert us grants to loans senator hutchison and others submitted an amendment that did not come up for floor debate directing 10 billion of the total reconstruction supplemental to trust fund to be established within the world bank out of which loans and loan guarantees would be made on the house side representative wamp proposed but later withdrew an amendment during committee markup that would have withheld onehalf of iraq funds until after the election of new iraqi leader at which time the remaining money would be available in the form of loan representative obey offered an amendment defeated 2536 that among other things would have transferred about 7 billion of reconstruction funds to world bankadministered loan facility further amendment by representative obey regarding shift of grants to loans was defeated in the house 200226 house and senate conferees agreed to provide all iraq reconstruction aid as grants rather than loans contracting concerns an administration decision applied to the early reconstruction contracts to waive the normal competitive bidding requirements and request bids from specific companies which were seen to have preexisting qualifications received considerable attention by the business community the closed bidding and lack of transparency disturbed number of legislators and some members of congress asked the gao to determine whether contracting agencies are following appropriate procedures some observers noted that in addition to many american firms number of international organizations and nonus companies were excluded from the selections made by usaid and other agencies and even british companies were not considered despite that countrys role in the war us officials pointed out that only few select firms possessed the particular skills that would qualify them for the job specifications for iraq reconstruction and that time and security clearances were also critical factors foreign entities potentially excluded by buy america provisions of law and other us firms could participate as subcontractors to the selected american firms subcontractors are likely to compose half or more of the total cost of each contract the supplementals impact on other donors at the time it appeared possible that congressional action on the supplemental could influence the contributions of international donors at the october donors conference and administration officials encouraged congress to complete debate on the spending bill prior that date some argued that large pledge of us aid prior to the conference might stimulate other donors to contribute more diminution of the administration plan they argued could have the opposite effect opponents of making us aid for reconstruction in the form of loans also contended that other donors might follow the american lead and offer loans rather than grants adding further to iraqs debt problems in addition the supplemental targeted sectors infrastructure and security that other donors were less likely to support crs79 themselves in similar nationbuilding exercises elsewhere donors have tended to funnel contributions to the social sectors such as education and health and grassroots democratization and economic development all areas relatively untouched by the supplemental perhaps more important factor in other donor calculations was the extent to which they would have say in the use of funds donors had been reluctant to provide assistance because they were wary of being perceived as supporting unilateral us policy in response to this concern donors discussed at september 6 meeting in brussels the concept of creating iraq reconstruction trust funds managed by the or world bank which would accept and distribute contributions control over how the money was spent according to undersecretary of state alan larson who represented the us at the september 6 meetings would be handled by some sort of multilateral management board that might include officials from international organizations major donors and iraqis representing interim ministries16 management of iraq reconstruction funds by us agencies administrative control over iraq reconstruction funds became significant issue during congressional debate on the 2475 billion appropriation in pl 10811 at that time most had expected that transfers for reconstruction and postconflict aid would be made to usaid the state department and other traditional foreign assistance management agencies but with plans for the defense department to oversee the governing of iraq immediately after the end of hostilities the white house wanted to maintain maximum flexibility over the distribution of resources so the president could transfer some or all of the funding to dod the proposal stimulated immediate controversy with number of critics including members of congress arguing that aid programs should remain under the policy direction of the state department and under the authorities of broad and longstanding body of foreign aid laws although initial house and senate decisions would have blocked administration efforts to place control of reconstruction funds with the pentagon ultimately congress agreed to allow the white house to allocate the resources among five agencies including dod funds for the iraq relief and reconstruction fund appropriated in pl 10811 have been managed by l paul bremer head of the coalition provisional authority cpa and the us civilian administrator in iraq who reports to the secretary of defense the administration proposed that the entire 203 billion be placed in the iraq relief and reconstruction fund as was the case with the previous supplemental and to continue ambassador bremer and the cpas role as administrators of the fund under dod guidance after submitting the supplemental however the white house announced the establishment of new iraq stabilization groupheaded by national security advisor condoleezza rice the group was intended to help speed up reconstruction efforts by identifying and resolving problems that had in some cases been the source of decisionmaking disputes in washington some analysts believed 16 iraq reconstruction an international responsibility larson says press briefing by under secretary of state for economic business and agricultural affairs alan larson september 4 2003 httpusinfostategovtopicalpolterrortexts03090434htm crs80 that the move was also intended to allow the state department greater voice in reconstruction policy at the same time the state department staff serving under the cpa in iraq was expected to grow from 55 to about 110 nevertheless ambassador bremer would continue to report to the secretary of defense17 during congressional debate the senate tabled 5642 an amendment by senators leahy and daschle that would have placed the cpa under the direct authority and foreign policy guidance of the secretary of state the house bill however added provision barring the coordination of defense or reconstruction activities in iraq or afghanistan by us government officer who was not subject to confirmation by the senate the house committee wanted to ensure that whoever was in charge of coordination be available to testify at congressional oversight hearings senator leahy proposed similar amendment for senate consideration these proposals appeared to block the initiative of placing national security council advisor rice who is not subject to confirmation and who does not testify before congress in charge of coordinating reconstruction the white house however contended that the new iraq stabilization group did not affect control of reconstruction efforts and that the job remains under control of the defense department18 in any case the house provision requiring that the coordination of reconstruction activities be headed by confirmed us official was deleted in conference negotiations reconstruction priorities and costs the administration said that the request included only the most pressing immediate needs for iraq in fy2004 however the relative importance of certain items detailed in the request re engineering of postal service business practices and construction of seven residential communities for example was challenged by congress further the costs associated with reconstruction requests were subject to skepticism with some congressional staff reportedly suggesting that the price tag was intentionally inflated so that the administration would not have to return to congress to ask for more funds in 200419 several senate amendments were offered but not adopted that would have reduced funding for what the sponsors regarded as lowpriority needs and redirected the resources for domestic or other military programs in iraq the house bill proposed 1655 billion cut in iraq reconstruction funding reducing or eliminating resources for wide range of activities that the house found to be unexecutable low priority or likely to receive funding from other international donors number of these house recommendations for cuts were adopted in the conference agreement see table 17 above for details of sector and project reductions recommended by congress 17

foreign operations appropriations measures although the house did not address iraq reconstruction funding matters in hr 2800 sec 572 of the legislation required that iraq reconstruction contracts awarded with appropriated funds be subject to full and open competition conferees meeting on hr 2673 the consolidated appropriations act 2004 within which foreign operations has been incorporated as division d decided however to drop the house contract provision in sec 572 believing the issue had been adequately addressed in the fy2004 supplemental measure see below fy2004 iraq reconstruction supplemental as illustrated in table 17 above the senatepassed measure s 1689 followed the general funding requests proposed by the president while the house bill hr 3289 reduced the 203 billion recommendation by 165 billion both bills further added sections requiring more detailed reporting to congress on reconstruction activities and placed limits on but not prohibiting noncompetitive contracting procedures the house measure also prohibited reconstruction efforts to be coordinated by anyone not confirmed by the senate apparently in reaction to the white house announcement establishing the iraq stabilization group headed by national security advisor rice house and senate negotiators agreed to total iraq reconstruction at levels similar to housepassed amounts reducing funds for number of activities deemed too expensive or of low priority the conference agreement was approved in the house on october 29 perhaps the most challenging issue for conference committee consideration was whether to provide the entire reconstruction package as grant as proposed by the president and hr 3289 or extend 10 billion in the form as loan as the senate bill recommends the 10 billion loan in s 1689 could later be converted to grant if international creditors agree to cancel 90 of iraqs debt under threat of presidential veto house and senate conferees agreed to provide the
