forces must be able to meet among other measures this report will be updated as events warrant nuclear power plants have long been recognized as potential targets of terrorist attacks and critics have long questioned the adequacy of the measures required of nuclear plant operators to defend against such attacks following the september 11 2001 attacks on the pentagon and the world trade center the nuclear regulatory commission nrc began toptobottom review of its security requirements on february 25 2002 the agency issued interim compensatory security measures to deal with the generalized highlevel threat environment that continued to exist and on january 7 2003 it issued regulatory orders that tightened nuclear plant access on april 29 2003 nrc issued three orders to restrict security officer work hours establish new security force training and qualification requirements and increase the design basis threat dbt that nuclear security forces must be able to defend against in the energy policy act of 2005 epact congress imposed statutory requirement on the nrc to initiate rulemaking for revising the design basis threat1 the dbt classified document describes general characteristics of adversaries that nuclear 1 pl 10958 title vi subtitle d nuclear security secs 651657 sec 651 adds atomic energy act sec 170e design basis threat rulemaking crs2 plants and nuclear fuel cycle facilities must defend against including radiologic sabotage and theft of strategic special nuclear material epact required nrc to consider 12 factors in revising the dbt including but not limited to an assessment of various terrorist threats sizable explosive devices and modern weapons attacks by persons with sophisticated knowledge of facility operations and attacks on spent fuel shipments nrc approved its final rule to amend the dbt 10 cfr part 731 on january 29 20072 plant physical security under the regulations in place prior to the september 11 attacks 10 cfr 73 physical protection of plants and materials all nrc licensed commercial nuclear power plants must have series of physical barriers and trained security force the plant sites are divided into three zones an ownercontrolled buffer region protected area and vital area access to the protected area is restricted to portion of plant employees and monitored visitors with stringent access barriers the vital area is further restricted with additional barriers and access requirements the security force must comply with nrc requirements on prehiring investigations and training3 nrc published proposed rule on october 26 2006 to impose additional reactor httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21131 security requirements4 it would also codify in regulation various nrc security orders issued since the 911 attacks and implement security provisions included in epact design basis threat the design basis threat is used by nrc licensees as the basis for implementing defensive strategies of specific nuclear plant site through security plans safeguards contingency plans and guard training and qualification plans one of nrcs april 2003 regulatory orders changed the dbt to represent the largest reasonable threat against which regulated private guard force should be expected to defend under existing law according to the nrc announcement nrcs final rule for revising the dbt took effect april 18 2007 as directed by the energy policy act the final rule has the principal objective of making the security requirements imposed by the april 29 2003 dbt orders generically applicable although specific details of the revised dbt were not released to the public in general the final rule clarifies that physical protection systems are required to protect against diversion and theft of fissile material expands the assumed capabilities of adversaries to operate as one or more teams and attack from multiple entry points assumes that adversaries are willing to kill or be killed and are knowledgeable about specific target selection expands the scope of vehicles that licensees must defend against to include water vehicles and land vehicles beyond fourwheeldrive type 2 federal register march 19 2007 vol 72 52

vol 71 207 nuclear regulatory commission power reactor security requirements proposed rule crs3 revises the threat posed by an insider to be more flexible in scope and adds new mode of attack from adversaries coordinating vehicle bomb assault with another external assault in 2006 the government accountability office gao reviewed the upgrades in nuclear plant security and found generally logical and welldefined process gao found nrc staff trained in threat assessment who monitor information provided by intelligence agencies and screen the information to evaluate particular terrorist capabilities for inclusion in the dbt however the nrc produced revised dbt that generally but not always corresponded to the threat assessment staffs original recommendations5 the dbt final rule excluded aircraft attacks which raised considerable controversy in approving the rule nrc rejected petition from the union of concerned scientists to require that nuclear plants be surrounded by aircraft barriers made of steel beams and cables the socalled beamhenge concept critics of the rule charged that deliberate aircraft crashes were highly plausible mode of attack given the events of 911 however nrc contended that power plants were already required to mitigate the effects of aircraft crashes and that active protection against airborne threats is addressed by other httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21131 federal organizations including the military6 additional nrc action on aircraft threats is discussed below forceonforce exercises epact codified an nrc requirement that each nuclear power plant conduct security exercises every three years to test its ability to defend against the design basis threat in these forceonforce exercises monitored by nrc an adversary force from outside the plant attempts to penetrate the plants vital area and damage or destroy key safety components participants in the tightly controlled exercises carry weapons modified to fire only blanks and laser bursts to simulate bullets and they wear laser sensors to indicate hits other weapons and explosives as well as destruction or breaching of physical security barriers may also be simulated while one squad of the plants guard force is participating in forceonforce exercise another squad is also on duty to maintain normal plant security plant defenders know that mock attack will take place sometime during specific period of several hours but they do not know what the attack scenario will be multiple attack scenarios are conducted over several days of exercises full implementation of the forceonforce program began in late 2004 standard procedures and other requirements have been developed for using the forceonforce exercises to evaluate plant security and as basis for taking regulatory enforcement action many tradeoffs are necessary to make the exercises as realistic and consistent as possible without endangering participants or regular plant operations and security 5 gao nuclear power plants efforts made to upgrade security but the nuclear regulatory commissions design basis threat process should be improved gao06388 report to the chairman subcommittee on national security emerging threats and international relations committee on government reform house of representatives march 2006 6 nrc office of public affairs nrc approves final rule amending security requirements news release 07012 january 29 2007 crs4 nrc required the nuclear industry to develop and train composite adversary force comprising security officers from many plants to simulate terrorist attacks in the forceonforce exercises however in september 2004 testimony gao criticized the industrys selection of security company that guards about half of us nuclear plants wackenhut to also provide the adversary force in addition to raising questions about the forces independence gao noted that wackenhut had been accused of cheating on previous forceonforce exercises by the department of energy7 epact requires nrc to mitigate any potential conflict of interest that could influence the results of forceonforce exercise as the commission determines to be necessary and appropriate emergency response after the 1979 accident at the three mile island nuclear plant near harrisburg pa congress required that all nuclear power plants be covered by emergency plans nrc requires that within an approximately 10mile emergency planning zone epz around each plant the operator must maintain warning sirens and regularly conduct evacuation exercises monitored by nrc and the federal emergency management agency fema in light of the increased possibility of terrorist attacks that if successful could result in release of radioactive material critics have renewed calls for expanding the epz to include larger population centers httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21131 the release of radioactive iodine during nuclear incident is particular concern because iodine tends to concentrate in the thyroid gland of persons exposed to it emergency plans in many states include distribution of iodine pills to the population within the epz taking nonradioactive iodine before exposure would prevent absorption of radioactive iodine but would afford protection against other radioactive elements in 2002 nrc began providing iodine pills to states requesting them for populations within the 10mile epz nuclear plant vulnerability the major concerns in operating nuclear power plant are controlling the nuclear chain reaction and assuring that the reactor core does not lose its coolant and melt down from the heat produced by the radioactive fission products within the fuel rods us plants are designed and built to prevent dispersal of radioactivity in the event of an accident by surrounding the reactor in steelreinforced concrete containment structure which represents an intrinsic safety feature two major accidents have taken place in power reactors at three mile island tmi in 1979 and at chernobyl in the soviet union in 1986 although both accidents resulted from combination of operator error and design flaws tmis containment structure effectively prevented major release of radioactivity from fuel meltdown caused by the loss of coolant in the chernobyl accident the reactors protective barriers were breached when an outofcontrol nuclear reaction led to fierce graphite fire that caused significant part of the radioactive core to be blown into the atmosphere 7 government accountability office nuclear regulatory commission preliminary observations on efforts to improve security at nuclear power plants statement of jim wells director natural resources and environment government accountability office to the subcommittee on national security emerging threats and international relations house committee on government reform september 14 2004 p 14 crs5 vulnerability from air attack nuclear power plants were designed to withstand hurricanes earthquakes and other extreme events but deliberate attacks by large airliners loaded with fuel such as those that crashed into the world trade center and pentagon were not analyzed when design requirements for todays reactors were determined8 taped interview shown september 10 2002 on arab tv station jazeera which contains statement that qaeda initially planned to include nuclear plant in its 2001 attack sites intensified concern about aircraft crashes in light of the possibility that an air attack might penetrate the containment building of nuclear plant some interest groups have suggested that such an event could be followed by meltdown and widespread radiation exposure nuclear industry spokespersons have countered by pointing out that relatively small lowlying nuclear power plants are difficult targets for attack and have argued that penetration of the containment is unlikely and that even if such penetration occurred it probably would not reach the reactor vessel they suggest that sustained fire such as that which melted the steel support structures in the world trade center buildings would be impossible unless an attacking plane penetrated the containment completely including its fuelbearing wings according to former nrc chairman nils diaz nrc studies confirm that the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21131 likelihood of both damaging the reactor core and releasing radioactivity that could affect public health and safety is low9 although nrcs final rule on the design basis threat discussed above excludes aircraft attacks nrc announced on april 24 2007 that it would issue proposed rule requiring license applicants for new reactors to assess potential design improvements that would improve protection against impact by large commercial aircraft the proposed rule would affect new reactor designs not previously certified by nrc10 westinghouse submitted changes in the design of its ap1000 reactor to nrc on may 29 2007 proposing to line the inside and outside of the reactors concrete containment structure with steel plates to increase resistance to aircraft penetration11 spent fuel storage when longer capable of sustaining nuclear chain reaction spent nuclear fuel is removed from the reactor and stored in pool of water in the reactor building and at some sites later transferred to dry casks on the plant grounds because both types of storage are located outside the reactor containment structure particular concern has been raised about the vulnerability of spent fuel to attack by aircraft or other means if terrorists could breach spent fuel pools concrete walls and drain the cooling water the spent fuels zirconium cladding could overheat and catch fire 8 meserve richard nrc chairman research strengthening the foundation of the nuclear industry speech to nuclear safety research conference october 29 2002 9 letter from nrc chairman nils j diaz to secretary of homeland security tom ridge september 8 2004 10 nrc office of public affairs nrc proposes adding plane crash security assessments to new reactor design certification requirements news release 07053 april 24 2007 11 maclachlan ann westinghouse changes ap1000 design to improve plane crash resistance nucleonics week june 21 2007 crs6 the national academy of sciences nas released report in april 2005 that found that successful terrorist attacks on spent fuel pools though difficult are possible and that if an attack leads to propagating zirconium cladding fire it could result in the release of large amounts of radioactive material nas recommended that the hottest spent fuel be interspersed with cooler spent fuel to reduce the likelihood of fire and that waterspray systems be installed to cool spent fuel if pool water were lost the report also called for nrc to conduct more analysis of the issue and consider earlier movement of spent fuel from pools into dry storage12 the fy2006 energy and water development appropriations act pl 109103 hrept 109275 provided 21 million for nrc to carry out the sitespecific analyses recommended by nas nrc has long contended that the potential effects of terrorist attacks are too speculative to include in environmental studies for proposed spent fuel storage and other nuclear facilities however the us court of appeals for the 9th circuit ruled in june 2006 that terrorist attacks must be included in the environmental study of dry storage facility at californias diablo canyon nuclear plant nrc reissued the diablo canyon study may 29 2007 to comply with the court ruling but it did not include terrorism in other recent environmental studies13 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21131 regulatory and legislative proposals critics of nrcs security measures have demanded both shortterm regulatory changes and legislative reforms fundamental concern was the nature of the dbt which critics contended should be increased to include number of separate coordinated attacks critics also pointed out that licensees are required to employ only minimum of five security personnel on duty per plant which they argue is not enough for the job14 nuclear spokespersons responded that the actual security force for the nations 65 nuclear plant sites numbers more than 5000 an average of about 75 per site covering multiple shifts nuclear plant security forces are also supposed to be aided by local law enforcement officers if an attack occurs because of the growing emphasis on security nrc established the office of nuclear security and incident response on april 7 2002 the office centralizes security oversight of all nrcregulated facilities coordinates with law enforcement and intelligence agencies and handles emergency planning activities forceonforce exercises are an example of the offices responsibilities 12 national academy of sciences board on radioactive waste management safety and security of commercial spent nuclear fuel storage public report online version released april 6 2005
