city of new york 118 s ct 2091 1998an enrolled bill to the president preparing and signing enrolled bills may take significant time especially at the end of congress when many such bills must be prepared presentation the constitution provides that every bill which shall have passed the house of representatives nd the senate shall before it become law be presented to the president of the united states16 enrolled bills are delivered to the white house by the clerk of the house or secretary of the senate as determined by the chamber in which the measure originated and stamped to certify the date and time of their arrival the clerk and secretary are also required to report the fact and date of presentation to the president to their respective chambers17 when the president has been away from washington dc for long periods of time congress has sometimes agreed to present enrolled measures to him on his return at other times bills have been sent to him if the president signs bill during the 10day period excluding sundays provided in the constitution for his review it becomes law if the president disapproves or vetoes bill he must return it to the originating chamber with message indicating his reasons for disapproval if the president does not sign or return bill during the 10 days the bill becomes law18 unless the congress has adjourned during the 10 days thereby making impossible the return of the bill pocket veto19 some doubt exists about the presidents power to pocket veto bill during intrasession and inters ession adjournments in 1974 the circuit court of appeals ruled that poc ket veto was improper during an intrasession adjournment in which house nd senate administrative officers had been authorized to receive presidential messages20 many claim that congress may also authorize its officers to receive messages including vetoes during any intrasession adjournment or after any intersession adjournment the courts have not ruled direc tly on this pocket vetorelated issue any attempt by congress to deprive the president of his right to be presented with measures before they become law may be constitutionally suspect the supreme court in 1983 ruled the legislative veto to be unconstitutional for this reason21 subsequently in 1998 the court declared that procedures t up in the line item veto act pl 10430 also violated the presentment clause of the constitution22
