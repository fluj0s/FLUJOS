pharmaceuticals and related products patent ownership appears to be impor tant in the promotion of innovation particularly in the pharmaceutical s ector patent title provides limitedtime monopoly over the use of discovery in exchange for the public dissemination of information contained in the patent application this pe rmits the inventor to receive return on the expenditure of resources but does not guarantee that the patent will generate commercial benefits the requireme nt for patent publication is expected to stimulate additional innovation to meet similar demands in the marketplace currently the bayhdole act and the hatchwaxman act include provisions that utilize patent ownership to facilitate the development and commercialization of new pharmaceuticals the hatchwaxman act also contains fda marketing approval policies that are designed to promote the creation of new drugs similar marketexclusivity provisions are c ontained in the orphan drug act the approach taken in the 109th congress by bills s 3 and s 975 allowed for the restoration of that portion of the pa tent term used during the fda approval process andor the extension of patent term to reward technological innovation in the area of bioterrorism c ountermeasures the proposed gislation also provided for additional fdaadministered marketing exclusivities for eligible and designated countermeasures another bill s 1873 permitted counter measure product to qualify as an orphan drug and increased ma rket exclusivity from 7 years to 10 years encouraging the development of ne w counterterrorism technologies and ensuring affordable access to new drugs and medical devices are both significant goals these aspirations may potentially conflict however introducing augmented patent and exclusivitybased incentives ma stimulate innovative firms to engage in the rd for new countermeasures as well as to shepherd these products through timeconsuming and costly marketing approval procedures commentators have expressed concern however over whether such heightened protections for innovators will be in proportion with the risks and co sts of developing new countermeasures striking balance between encouraging the development of new countermeasures and maintaining the traditional goals of our public health system is central concern of the current discussion with respect to homeland security this

have been introduced in the 110th congress the issue continues to re main under consideration patents appear to be impor tant in the promotion of innovation particularly in the pharmaceutical sector this report explores the role of patents in encouraging the development and commercia lization of new inventi ons and discusses the relationships between patent ownership and the generati on of biomedical products however the grant of patent on pharm aceutical does not permit marketing of the product without the approval of the food and drug administration fda thus this report also examines policies concerning the use of fda marketing exclusivity as an additional incentive to industry resear ch and development rd in this arena current law and suggested legislative change s are discussed to provide context for any further exploration of related issues during the 110th congress patents and innovation patent law is based upon th patent act of 1952 codifi ed in title 35 of the united

charls walker and mark continuedto be afforded patent rights an inventi on must be judged to consist of patentable subject matter possess utility and be novel and nonobvious the application must fully disclose and distinctly claim the invention for which protection is sought3 the grant of patent does not necessarily provide the owner with an affirmative right to market the patented invention pharmaceutical products are also subject to marketing approval by the food and drug administrati on federal laws typically require that pharmaceutical manufacturers demonstrate th at their products are safe and effective in order to bring these drugs to the marketplace uspto issuance of patent and fda marketing consent are distinct events that depend upon different criteria the patent system is grounded in article i section 8 clause 8 of the us constitution and is intended to stimulate new discoveries and their reduction to practice commonly known as innovation the constitution states that the congress shall have power to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries th award of patent permits the creator of an idea to exclude others tempor arily from use of that concept without compensation it also places the information associated with an invention within the public arena patent ownership is percei ved to be an incentive to innovation the basis for the technological advancement that contributes to economic growth it is through the commercialization and use of new products and processes that productivity gains are made and the scope and quality of goods and services are expanded award of patent is intended to stimula the investment necessary to develop an idea and bring it to the marketplace embodied in product or process pate nt title provides the recipient with limitedtime monopoly over the use of his discovery in exchange for the public dissemination of info rmation contained in the pa tent application this is intended to permit the invent or to receive return on the expenditure of resources leading to the discovery but does not guarantee that the patent will generate commercial benefits the requirement for publication of the patent is expected to stimulate additional innova tion and other creative means to meet similar and expanded demands in the marketplace innovation produces new knowledge one characteristic of this knowledge is that it is public good good that is not consumed when it is used this public good concept underlies the u s patent system as professor john shoven points out the use of an idea or discovery by one person does not in most cases reduce the availability of that information to others4

knowledge is not depleted ordinarily society maximizes its welfare through not charging for the use of free good5 however innovation typically is costly and resource intensive pate nts permit novel concepts or discoveries to become property when reduced to practice and therefore allow for control over their use they create incentives that maximize the difference between the value of the intellectual property that is created and us ed and the social cost of its creation6 studies demonstrate that the rate of return to society as whole generated by investments in research and devel opment rd leading to innovation is significantly larger than the benefits that can be captured by the person or organization financing the work some estimate that the social rate of return on rd spending is over twice that of th rate of return to the inventor7 ideas often are easily imitated as the knowledge associated with an i nnovati on is dispersed and adapted to other products nd processes that in turn stimulate growth in the economy that can happen in the absen ce of appropriability defined as factors excluding firm and market st ructure that govern an innovators ability to capture the profits generated by an innovation8 the appropriability of an invention depends on the level of competition in the industry and the type of information related to the innovation the more competition and th more basic the knowledge the less appropriable it is9 the difficulty in securing sufficient returns to spending on research and development has been asso ciated with underinvestment in those activities the patent process is designed to resolve the problem of appropriability if discoveries were universally available without means for the inventor to realize return on investments there would result much lower and indeed suboptimal level of innovation10 while research is ofte n important to innovation some commentators have noted that it can constitute less than quarter of the

develop an idea and generate marketable technology issuance of patent furnishes the i nventor with limite dtime monopo ly the benefits of which are mitigated by other factors particularly the requirements for information disclosure the length of the patent and the scope of rights conferred the process of obtaining patent places th concept on which it is based in the public domain in return for monopoly right to the application of the knowledge generated the inventor must publish the ideas covered in the patent as disclosure system the patent can and often does stimulate other firms or individuals to invent around existing patents to provide for pa rallel technical developments or meet similar market needs patents may also provide more socially desirable outcome than its chief legal alternative trade secret protection tr ade secrecy guards against the improper appropriation of valuable commercially useful information that is the subject of reasonable measures to preserve its secrecy11 taking the steps necessary to maintain secrecy such as implementing physical security imposes costs that may ultimately be unproductive for society12 also while the patent law obliges inventors to disclose their inventions to the public13 trade secret protection requires firms to conceal them the disclosure obligations of the patent system may better serve the objective of encouraging the diffusion of advanced technological knowledge the patent system thus has dual policy goals providing incentives for inventors to invent and encouraging inve ntors to disclose technical information14 disclosure requirements are factors in ach ieving balance between current and future innovation through the patent process as are limitations on sc ope novelty mandates and nonobviousness considerations15 patents give rise to an environment of competitiveness with multiple sources of innovation which is viewed by some experts as the basis for technological pr ogress this is important because as professors robert merges and richard ne lson found in their studies in situationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32917crs5 16 robert p merges and richard r nelson on the complex

organizations contro lled the development of technology technical advance appeared sluggish16 not everyone agrees that the patent system is particularly effective means to stimulate innovation some obs ervers believe that the patent system encourages industry concentration and presents barrier to entry in some markets17 others believe that the patent system too frequently attracts speculators who prefer to acquire and enforce patents rather than engage in socially productive activity18 still other commentators suggest that the pa tent system often converts pioneering inventors into technological suppressors who use their patents to block subsequent improvements and thereby imp ede technological progress19 some experts argue that patents do not work as well in reality as in theory because they do not confer perfect appropria bility in other words they allow the inventor to obtain larger portion of the returns on his investment but do not permit him to capture all the benef its patents can be circum vented and infringement cannot always be proven thus patents are not the only way nor necessarily the most efficient means for the inventor to protect the benefits generated by his efforts study by yale universitys richard levi n and his colleagues concluded that lead time learning curve advantag eg familiarity with the science and technology under consideration and salesservice ac tivities were typically more important in exploiting appropriab ility than were pa tents that was true for both pr oducts and processes however patents were found to be better at pr otecting pr oducts than processes the novel ideas associated with product ofte n can be determined through reverse engineering taking the item apart to assess how it was made that information then could be used by compe titors if not covered by patent because it is more difficult to identify the procedur related to process other means of appropriation are seen as preferable to patents with the attendant disclosure requirements20 role of patents in pharmaceuticalbiomedical rd the utility of patents to companies varies among industrial sectors patents are perceived as critical in the drug

his colleag ues demonstrated that patents were considered the most effective method to pr otect inventions in the drug industry when biotechnology is included23 the high cost of drug development and the concomitant uncertainty associated with clinical trials necessary for marketing approval lends significance to patents in the pharmaceutical arena studies by joseph dimasi of tufts university and others indicate that the capitalized cost of bringing new drug defined as new molecular entity rather than new formulation of an existing pharmaceutical product to the point of marketing approva l is 802 million 2000 dollars24 additional research done by federal trade commission analysts found the costs to be even higher between 839 million and 868 million 2000 dollars25 at the same time the total capitalized costs appear to be growing at an annual rate of 74 above general price inflation26 large portion of new drug costs in terms of money and time are associated with the size and breath of clinical tr ials necessary to obtain fda marketing approval according to study pported by the fe deral reserve of boston only 10 of potential drug candidates reach the human trial phase and only small portion of these actually reach the market27 in research presented at conference sponsored by the federal reserve bank of dallas duke universitys henry grabowski found that only 1 of drug co mpounds

drug introductions vary widely nd the median new drug does not bring in sufficient profits to cover the costs of bringing the product to the marketplace30 according to research by grabowski john vernon and dimasi only 34 of new drugs new chemical entities introduced ge nerated profits that equaled the industry average rd cost31 patents are particularly important in the pharmaceutical sector because of the relative ease of replicating the finish ed product imitation costs vary among industries for example while it is expe nsive complicated and time consuming to duplicate an airplane it is relatively simple to chemically analyze pill and reproduce it32 the degree to which industry percei ves patents as effective has been characterized as positively correlated with the increase in duplication costs and time associated with patents33 in certain industries patent s significantly raise the costs incurred by nonpatent holders wishing to us the idea or invent around the patent an estimated 40 in the pharmaceutical sector 30 for major new chemical products and 25 for typical chemical goods and are thus viewed as significant however in other industries patents have much smaller impact on the costs associated with imitation eg in the 715 range for electronics and may be considered less successful in protecting resource investments34 the significant costs of pharmaceutical rd coupled with the uncertainty of the clinical trial process lend consequence to patents in this area because the disparity between the investme nts of innovators and those of imitators is particularly large in pharmaceuticals almost as large as when software pirates simply copy the diskettes of an innovator35 while the capitalized cost of developing new drug to the point of market approval is ove r

considered the bayhdole act pl 96517 amendments to the patent and trademark act commonly referred to as the bayhdole act after its two main sponsors former senators birch bayh and robert dole evolved ou t of congressional interest in developing uniform federal patent policy to promote the utilization of i nventions made with the support of the federal research establishment38 such action was deemed necessary because at the time the legislation was under c onsideration only 5 of federallyowned patents were being used wh ile there were possibly seve ral reasons for such low level of utilization i ncluding market applications this was thought by many to be one consequence of the practice by most agencies of taking title to all inventions made with government f unding and only permitting the nonexclusive licensing of contractor inventions39 without title to inventions or at least exclusive licenses companies were deemed to be less likely to engage in and fund the additional rd necessary to bring an idea to the marketplace the bayhdole act by providing universities nonprofit instituti ons and small businesses w ith ownership of patents arising from federallyfunded rd

infringement provisions in the hatchwaxman act apply to pharmaceutical patents and differ from traditional procedures associated with other patented products and processes statutory exemption is created for certain claims of patent infringement based on acts reasonably relate d to seeking fda approval to market drug that has been patented by another firm the company making generic product is permitted to use data paid for and compiled by the original manufacturer to establish the drugs safety and efficacy the generic firm must only prove that their product is bioequivalent to the

term extension does not occur automatically the patent owner or its agent must file an application the uspto requesting term extension within 60 days of obtaining fda marketing approval the hatchwaxman act also established socalled marketing exclusivities administered by the fda the term marketing exclusivity refers to period of time during which the fda affords an approved drug

expressly stipulates that drug does not qualify as an nce if it consists of the salt or ester of previously approved active ingredient as these are considered only minor chemical changes to the active ingredient54 nce exclusivity prevents subsequent generic applicant from relyin g upon the data submitted by the innovative drug company during fiveyear period as result firms are precluded from filing generic applications for five years from th date of the approval of the nda for that active moiety55 the practical effect of nce exclusivity is to restrict potential generic manufacturer from bringing product to market for five years plus the length of the fda review of the generic application56 if for example the fda requires two years to approve particular generic appli cation the realworld impact of the nce exclusivity has been seven years of prot ection in this respect nce exclusivity operates differently from other forms of fdaadministered exclusivities which generally prevent the fda from approving applications rather than accepting them in the first instance57 alternatively pioneer drug company may obtain threeyear new clinical study exclusivity in exchange for submitting an

clinical study exclusivity for such change s as new dosage forms new indications or for switch from prescription to overthec ounter status for the drug the purpose of the threeyear new clinical study ex clusivity is to encourage improvements upon drugs that are already known the hatchwaxman act imposes four re quirements that an investigation must fulfill in order to qualify for new clinical study

preclinical study and not bioavailability or bioequivalence study third the study must have been conducted or sponsor ed by the applicant finally the study must be essential to the pproval of the

interesting and provides useful background informati on but not essential to approving the change in the drug does not provide fficient basis for an fda award of new clinical study exclusivity62 in contrast to nce exclusivity new clin ical study exclusivity does not prevent the fda from accepting generic application with respect to the drug if the new clinical study exclusivity continues to bar the issuance of marketing approval at the close of fda review the fda will issue tentative approval for the generic product that will become effective once the new clinical study exclusivity has run its course in addition new clinical study exclusivity only applies to the use of the product that was supported by the new clinical study63 if for example the new studies support new indication or dosage form of the pr eviously approved ingredient then the threeyear exclusivity applies only to that particular use or dosage form the fda is not barred from approving generic drug s for other indicati ons or dosage forms64 drug product may be subject both to nce exclusivity and new clinical study exclusivity during the life of that product commonly new drug will initially enjoy fiveyear

however unl ess the original spons or approves or the original sponsor is unable to provide suffi cient quantities of the drug to the market70 as originally enacted the orphan drug act defined an orphan drug as one for which there was reasonable expectation that the cost of developing will be recovered from sales in the ited states of such drug71 congress changed the definition to its present form in 198472 currently in order to qualify for orphan drug status the drug must treat rare dis ease or condition 1 affecting less than 200000 people in the united states or 2 aff ecting more than 200000 people in the united states but for which there is reasonable expectation that the sales of the drug would recover the costs73 this change allows drug sponsors to avoid showing unprofitability if the target population consisted of less than 200000 persons proposals for change legislation introduced during the 109th congress would have expanded upon existing mechanisms in the patent and food and drug laws to encourage the development of bioterrorism countermeasures these b ills would have allowed for the restoration of that portion of the pa tent term used during the fda approval process andor the extension of patent term to reward technological innovation in the area of bioterrorism c ountermeasures in addition the bills also provided for additional fdaadministered marketing

2004patent term fundamentals as noted previously several mechanisms exist for lengthening the basic 20year patent term among them are hatchwa xman act provisions compensating patent proprietors for delays in fda regulatory approval proceedings74 this term extension is potentially available for single patent relating to drug product or to medical device food additive or color additive s ubject to regulation under the federal food drug and cosmetic act75 under current law the period of extensi on is ordinarily set to onehalf of the clinical testing phase less any period during which the applicant did not act with due diligence plus the entirety of the fda approval phase76 the nature of the regulated product sets the precise da tes that commence the tes ting and approval phases that together comprise the regulatory review period for human drug antibiotic or human biological product the clinical testing phase begins on the date the investigational new drug ind applica tion is filed while the fda approval phase period starts on the date of filing of ither the new drug application nda or product license application pla77 for patent claiming medical device the clinical testing date commences on the effective date of the investigational device exemption ide or if ide was submitted on the date on which the applicant began the first clinical investigation i nvolving the device the fda approval phase commences on the date on which the app lication for product pproval or notice of completion of product development prot ocol under section 515 of the federal food drug and cosmetic act was initially submitted78 other sorts of regulated products such as veterinary biological products and food or color additives are addressed in an analogous manner the hatchwaxman act capped the max imum extension period to five years or total effective patent term after the extension of not more than fourteen years79 in addition the hatchwaxman act does not go so far as to provide patent term extension in the usual sense that is to say temporal extension of the original right to exclude others from practicing the patented invention during the period of term extension the rights provided by the patent are instead limited generally speaking to the specific use that the fda has approved for example in the case of an extended product patent the patents rights during the extension period are generally limited to any use approved for the product that subjected it to regulatory approval delays at the fda80 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32917crs16 81 35 usc

patent term restoration on bioterrorism countermeasures although they potentially allowed for longer periods of expansion of patent term than is currently available under the hatchwaxma n act it should be noted that the hatchwaxman act refers to the lengthening of patent life in compensation for delays in fda marketing approval as an extension of patent term81 however the legislation used the word restoration to refer to this concept while employing the word extension in the context of di stinct reward for t echnological innovation in the area of bioterrori sm countermeasures both s 3 the protecting america in the war on terror act of 2005 and s 975 the project bioshield ii act would have introduced new 35 usc 156a into the patent act of 1952 as with curre nt law these bills would have lengthened an eligible patent on bioterrorism c ountermeasure on dayperday basis for the time lost during the fda approval phase these bills would also extend patent term on dayperday basis during the entire peri od of the clinical testing phase however rather than merely for onehalf of that period as provided in the hatchwaxman act82 in contrast to the hatchwaxman act the proposed legislation placed cap upon the maximum period of in crease in patent term notably the hatchwaxman act sets the first day of the regulatory review period as the date that the drug sponsors commences clinical studies at the fda however both s 3 and s 975 considered the regulatory review period to commence on the later of either the date the clinical testing phase begins at the fda or the date upon which the uspto issues the pa tent sought to be extended83 in circumstances where the uspto issues the patent after the sponsor has commenced clinical studies at the fda the relevant regulatory re view period under current law may actually be longer than under the proposed legislation both s 3 and s 975 stipulated that th is patent term rest oration is mutually exclusive with respect to extension of patent term available under current law84 as result only single patent that claims countermeasure product may be lengthened by either the period establis hed by the extension of patent term provision of the existing hatchwaxman act or the new restorati on of patent terms relating to countermeasure products under proposed 35 usc 156a but not bothhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32917crs17 85 s 3 at 113c

period of term extens ion based upon such factors as the nature of the threat to be countered the difficulty and expense in developing the countermeasure and the impact of patent extension upon consumers and healthcare providers86 considerable discussion occurred with respect to whether the term extension provided by proposed 35 usc 158 would ve to be applied to patent claiming the countermeasure itself or instead to any one patent that the countermeasure innovator selects within its intellectual property portfolio the concept that countermeasure innovator could enjoy expa nded patent life with respect to an unrelated product was termed wild card term extension87 under this regime countermeasure innovator could potentially obtain term extension of patent relating to bestselling mainstream pharmaceutical thereby shielding it from generic competition for an additional period of six months to two years supporters of wild card patent term extension urge d that patentbased incentives on profitable products such as blockbuster drugs ar needed to encourage firms to develop potentially less profita ble countermeasures88 detractors have expressed concerns over the equities of requiring patients to finance the velopment of countermeasures through the purchase of medications to tr eat their particular illnesses or medical conditions89 s 975 appeared to employ

government under the bayhdole act the g overnment also has the authority to take private property for public use under eminent domain101 while most frequently applied to real estate the general

periods increased to reward innovation in this ar ena although different in the specific provisions these bills built upon incentives that have been used in the past encouraging the development of new counterterrorism technologies on one hand and ensuring affordable access to ne w drugs and medical devices on the other are both significant goals these aspirations may potentially conflict however
