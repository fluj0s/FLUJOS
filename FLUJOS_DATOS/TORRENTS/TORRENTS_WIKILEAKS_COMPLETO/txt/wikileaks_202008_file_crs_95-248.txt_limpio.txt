uscuban relations deteriorated sharply when fidel castro began to build repressive communist dictatorship and moved his country toward close relations with the soviet union the often tense and hostile nature of the us cuban relationship is illustrated by such events and actions as us covert operations to overthrow the castro regime in the illfated april 1962 bay of pigs invasion the october 1962 missile crisis in which the united states confronted the soviet union over its attempt to place offensive nuclear missiles in cuba cuban support for guerrilla insurgencies and military support for revolutionary governments in africa and the western hemisphere the 1980 exodus of around 125000 cubans to the united states in the socalled mariel boatlift the more recent 1994 exodus of more than 30000 cubans who were interdicted and housed at us facilities in guantanamo and panama and the february 1996 shootdown by cuban fighter jets of two us civilian planes flown by four crew members of the cuban american group brothers to the rescue since the early 1960s us policy has largely consisted of isolating the island nation through comprehensive economic embargo us sanctions were tightened in 1992 with congressional passage of the cuban democracy act cda and in august 1994 president clinton announced additional measures to augment economic pressure against cuba while the administration announced several measures in october 1995 to ease some us restrictions on travel and other activities with cuba the february 1996 cuban shootdown of the two us civilian planes prompted the administration to work with congress for swift passage of the cuban liberty and 1 prepared by mark p sullivan foreign affairs and national defense division this section draws substantially from

issue brief ib94005 updated regularly crs2 democratic solidarity act congressional initiative that imposed additional sanctions on cuba it should be noted that in addition to sanctions the clinton administration also emphasizes second track or aspect of us policy termed support for the cuban people which includes the provision of humanitarian assistance the cda provided for several measures including improvement in uscuban telephone links and expanded direct mail contacts the clinton administration has stressed the importance of sustaining both tracks of its policy toward cuba castros rise to power in 1956 castro and his small 26th of july movement2 returned to cuba from exile in mexico to actively oppose the dictatorship of fulgencio batista through guerrilla campaign the batista government at first refused to take the revolutionaries seriously but later reacted very strongly against castro and other antibatista groups this strong reaction elicited the increased hostility of wider sectors of the population and pressure from the united states government for batista to leave office in march 1958 as reaction to the repressive steps of the batista government the united states declared an embargo on the shipment of arms and ammunition to cuba batista fled the country on december 31 1958 the first revolutionary government in havanawhich was based upon broad front of antibatista groups and led by castros 26th of july movementwas quickly recognized by the united states on january 6 1959 series of trials and public executions of batista collaborators immediately took place over the next 7 months castro supporters gradually displaced members of other less radical groups in the highest government positions in may an agrarian reform program involving the expropriation of some foreign property was undertaken in june castro sponsored unsuccessful expeditions to nicaragua haiti and the dominican republic to overthrow their governments the cuban government moved toward close relations with the soviet union in 1960 an action which caused uscuba relations to deteriorate markedly in february the government signed trade agreement with the soviet union in which the soviets promised to buy significant quantities of cuban sugar over the next 4 years on may 7 1960 cuba and the soviet union reestablished full diplomatic relations relations broken by batista after his march 1952 coup in june us and british oil refineries in cuba refused to process crude oil sent by the soviet union and the cuban government retaliated by seizing the refineries in july president eisenhower suspended most of the unused portion of the 1960 cuban sugar quota for exports to the united states cuba responded by nationalizing the property of us citizens and companies by the end of august the castro government had seized all americanowned private property in cuba 2 the movement was named after the date of 1953 attack by an armed opposition group led by castro against the moncada army barracks in santiago cuba crs3 uscuba tensions escalate in 1961 and 1962 tensions in uscuba relations escalated the united states broke diplomatic relations with cuba on january 3 1961 in response to cuban demand to decrease within 48 hours the size of the us embassy staff in havana to 18 people the eisenhower administration however also declared that the termination of diplomatic relations did not constitute abrogation of treaty rights regarding the us naval station at guantanamo bay cuba agreed to lease the base to the united states in 1903 under 1934 treaty which remains in force today the us presence can only be terminated by mutual agreement or by abandonment by the united states according to the department of state uscuba relations continued to deteriorate under the kennedy administration in april 1961 the administration sponsored the illfated bay of pigs invasion by anti castro cuban exiles in december fidel castro publicly declared himself to be marxistleninist in february 1962 the kennedy administration imposed comprehensive trade embargo because of the castro regimes expropriation of us property because of cubas export of revolution and because of its increasing ties to the soviet union tensions between the united states and the soviet union also intensified in october 1962 when the united states confronted the soviet union over its attempts to place offensive nuclear missiles in cuba after the united states imposed naval blockade on cuba the crisis ended with soviet decision to withdraw the missiles in exchange for assurances from the united states that it would not invade cuba uscuban relations from the ford to the bush administration in the 1970s there was some movement toward normalization of relations following cubas deemphasis of exporting revolution under the ford administration the united states modified its regulations on cuba to permit us subsidiaries in foreign countries to trade with cuba with export licenses provided on casebycase basis the measure was taken following action by the organization of american states oas which allowed each member state to determine for itself the nature of its relations with cuba in 1964 the oas had voted to suspend trade relations with cuba because of its support for subversive activities in venezuela uscuba talks about the normalization of relations also began in 1975 but ended when cuba sent thousands of troops to angola to back the leftist faction in conflicts following that nations independence the carter administration renewed efforts to improve relations and the two countries established interests sections in each others capital in 1977 in the late 1970s however cubas military involvement in angola and ethiopia and its support for revolution in the caribbean and central america impeded improved relations with the united states moreover the mariel exodus of 1980 in which 120000 cubans flooded south florida also strained uscuba relations us officials were furious that criminals and mental patients socalled excludables were among the cuban exiles that castro encouraged to leave crs4 under the reagan administration uscuba relations remained tense because of cubas military involvement in africa and its increasing support for revolutionary movements and governments in the caribbean and central and south america in 1982 under the authority of the export administration act of 1979 the secretary of state added cuba to the list of countries supporting international terrorism an action which added further legislative restrictions to range of potential trade and economic benefits to cuba the usled intervention in grenada in october 1983 was setback to cubas expanding involvement in the caribbean in 1984 the united states and cuba reached an agreement for the return of cuban excludables from the mariel boatlift but cuba suspended the agreement in 1985 following the beginning of radio marti us voice of america voa radio programming designed to expand the flow of information to the cuban people in november 1987 when cuba announced that it was going to allow the return of excludables to resume riots broke out at us federal prison holding cuban inmates but the policy of repatriation continued under the bush administration the united states began operating tv marti transmitting television programming to cuba in the early morning hours although cuba has jammed the telecast since its inception in the late 1980s and early 1990s cuba ended its military involvement in angola and ethiopia and its support of insurgencies in central america in january 1992 castro announced that his government would longer support such activities instead cuban policy would focus on solving the nations domestic problems the breakup of the soviet union effectively ended cubas clientstate relationship with that nation and resulted in rapid deterioration of the cuban economy as this deterioration was taking place congress tightened sanctions on cuba in 1992 through passage of the cuban democracy act of 1992 cda contained in the fy1993 defense authorization measure pl 102484 title xvii the law prohibits us subsidiaries in third countries from trading with cuba and prohibits entry into the united states for any vessel to load or unload freight if it has engaged in trade with cuba within the last 180 days the bush administration had opposed the measure at first but ended up supporting it after bipartisan coalition in congress backed the measure and after presidential candidate clinton endorsed the bill the act also includes measures of support for the cuban people including provisions for improvement in phone service and direct mail delivery between cuba and the united states policy under the clinton administration3 under the clinton administration the united states has essentially continued the policy of isolating the island nation politically and economically the objective is to ensure that basic human rights are respected and democratic reforms enacted the principal tool of us policy remains wide range of economic sanctions including most prominently comprehensive trade embargo that was tightened with the 1992 congressional approval of the cda president clinton also tightened sanctions in 3 for information on us policy toward cuba and current legislative initiatives see cuba issues for congress crs issue brief ib94005 by mark p sullivan updated regularly crs5 august 1994 in the midst of an exodus of cubans fleeing to the united states cubas shootdown of two us civilian planes in february 1996 resulted in the administration working with congress for enactment of the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity act legislative initiative containing range of additional sanctions in addition to sanctions the clinton administration has stressed the importance of second track of us policy toward cuba support for the cuban people the cda for example also included measures of support such as direct uscuban telephone links and the licensing of private humanitarian assistance according to the administration the twotrack policy of isolating cuba but reaching out to the cuban people meets both us strategic and humanitarian interests in october 1995 president clinton announced initiatives designed to strengthen civil society in cuba including authorizing transactions for actives of human rights or nongovernmental organizations in addition to the cda us radio and television broadcasting to cubaradio and tv martialso fall under the rubric of support for the cuban people migration crisis in 1994 in august 1994 in the face of dramatic escalation in the number of cubans fleeing to the united states the clinton administration made two policy changes regarding cuba first on august 19 the president announced that cubans fleeing to the united states would be interdicted and sent to the us naval base at guantanamo bay4 until the change in policy most cubans that arrived in the united states were able to adjust to permanent resident status after one year at the discretion of the attorney general under the terms of the cuban adjustment act of 1966 second on august 20 president clinton announced four measures designed to limit the ability of the cuban government to accumulate foreign exchange and to enable the united states to expand the flow of information to the cuban people5 most significantly the president announced that cash remittances to cuba would longer be permitted previously us citizens could provide up to 300 quarterly to their relatives in cuba some reports estimate that these remittances have amounted to as much as 400500 million annually and were an important source of hard currency for the cuban economy the presidents three other measures were to restrict charter flights between havana and miami to those designed to accommodate legal migrants and travel consistent with the purposes of the cuban democracy act to use all appropriate means to increase and amplify us broadcasts to cuba and to continue to bring before the and other international organizations evidence of human rights abuses on september 9 1994 after more than week of negotiations on the migration crisis the united states and cuba signed an agreement that stemmed the flow of cubans fleeing to the united states by boat in the agreement the united states and cuba agreed to facilitate safe legal and orderly cuban migration to the united states consistent with the 1984 migration agreement

relatives of us citizens in change of policy the united states agreed to discontinue the practice of granting parole to all cuban migrants who reach the united states while cuba agreed to take measures to prevent unsafe departures from cuba in early may 1995 the clinton administration announced that it had reached another accord with cuba under which the united states would parole the more than 30000 cubans housed at guantanamo into the united states but would intercept future cuban migrants attempting to enter the united states by sea and would return them to cuba the two countries would cooperate jointly in the effort and according to the administration migrants taken to cuba will be informed by united states officials about procedures to apply for legal admission to the united states at the us interests section in havana both countries also pledged to ensure that action would be taken against those migrants returned to cuba as consequence of their attempt to immigrate illegally the new accord provoked protests in floridas cuban american community and some members of congress criticized the administrations new policy strongly by january 31 1996 the department of defense announced that the last of some 32000 cubans intercepted at sea and housed at guantanamo had left the us naval base most having been paroled into the united states easing of some restrictions in 1995 in early october 1995 president clinton announced several measures to ease some us restrictions on travel and other activities with cuba with the overall objective of promoting democracy and the free flow of ideas the new measures included authorizing us news media to open bureaus in cuba licensing us nongovernmental organizations to provide assistance to cuban nongovernmental organizations and authorizing general licenses for transactions relating to travel to cuba for cuban americans to visit close relatives once year in humanitarian cases since the august 1994 restrictions cuban americans wishing to travel for emergency reasons had to apply for specific license from the department of the treasury and an extensive backlog of cases had developed cubas downing of two us civilian aircraft tensions in uscuban relations escalated on february 24 1996 when cuban mig29 fighter jets shot down two cessna 337s in the florida straits flown by four members of the cuban american group brothers to the rescue the group was known primarily for its humanitarian missions of spotting cubans fleeing their island nation on rafts but recently had become active in flying over cuba and dropping leaflets while the four crew members shot down were killed two crew members from another plane with the group returned to miami and claimed that their comrades had been shot down over international waters secretary of state warren christopher called the attack on civilian plane blatant violation of international law and the united states called upon the security council to impose sanctions cuban spokesmen claimed that the incidents occurred within cuban airspace and that the pilots were warned on this and many previous occasions they claimed to have unequivocal proof in the form of debris from the wreckage radio recordings and information from juan pablo roque former pilot with the group that would demonstrate that the planes were in cuban airspace the clinton administration produced documents made by radar readings that the two cessnas were over international water when they were shot down crs7 cubas downing of the two us airplanes had an immediate and perhaps long lasting impact on us policy toward cuba president clinton condemned the downing and the administration worked to secure february 27 1996 security council statement strongly deploring cubas action the statement noted that international law requires that states must refrain from the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight and must not endanger the lives of persons on board and the safety of aircraft it also requested the international civil aviation organization icao to investigate the incident and reports its findings to the security council the icao completed its investigation in late june 1996 and concluded that the two planes were shot down over international waters additionally the president suspended all charter flights to cuba indefinitely imposed additional travel restrictions on cuban diplomats in the united states and limited visits by cuban officials to the united states helmsburton legislation most significantly cubas downing of the airplanes resulted in the president working with congress to secure passage of the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity act pl 104114 hr 927 congressional initiative imposing additional sanctions on cuba as signed into law march 12 1996 the socalled helmsburton legislation on cuba so dubbed for its primary sponsors contains three significant provisions first in title iii the law allows us nationals to sue for money damages in us federal court those persons that traffic in property confiscated by the cuban government it extends the right to sue to cuban americans who became us citizens after their properties were confiscated the president has authority to delay implementation for period of six months at time if he determines that such delay would be in the national interest and would expedite transition to democracy in cuba the title would first become effective august 1 1996 unless the president exercised his suspension authority the president is also authorized to suspend the right to file suits under title iii for sixmonth periods second title iv of the law denies admission to the united states to aliens involved in the confiscation of us property in cuba or in the trafficking of confiscated us property in cuba this includes corporate officers principals or shareholders with controlling interest of an entity involved in the confiscation of us property or trafficking of us property it also includes the spouse minor child or agent of aliens who would be excludable under the provision third provision in title i section 102h codifies all existing cuban embargo regulations presidential waiver is provided for any of these codified embargo provisions but the president is authorized to take steps to suspend the embargo and the right to file suits if he determines that transition government is in power and that such steps contribute to democracy in cuba this provision is significant because of the long lasting effect on us policy options toward cuba in effect the clinton administration and subsequent administrations will be circumscribed in any changes in us policy toward cuba in addition to the three provisions mentioned title i of the law has several other notable provisions section 103 of the law prohibits loans credits or other financing by any us national us agency or permanent resident alien for financing transac tions involving any property confiscated by the cuban government the claim to which crs8 is owned by us national section 106d withholds us assistance from russia by an amount equal to the sum of assistance and credits provided on or after the enactment of this provision in support of the russian intelligence facility at lourdes cuba however the provision includes presidential waiver if such assistance to russia is in the us national security interest and if the president certifies that russia is not sharing intelligence data collected at lourdes with officials or agents of the cuban government section 104 requires the united states to vote against cubas admission to the international financial institutions ifis until democratic government is in power it also reduces us payments to any ifi if it approves loan or other assistance to cuba over the opposition of the united states finally title ii of the law contains numerous conditions for determining when transition government and democratic government is in power in cuba conditions which would qualify cuba for various types of us assistance and would lead to suspension of us trade sanctions on cuba on july 16 1996 president clinton announced that he would allow title iii of the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity act to go into effect on august 1 1996 but at the same time he announced that he was suspending for sixmonth period until february 1 1997 the right of individuals to file suit against those persons trafficking in confiscated us property in cuba according to us officials liability for trafficking would go into effect on november 1 1996 and would put foreign companies in cuba on notice that they face prospects of future lawsuits and significant liability in the united states during the sixmonth period president clinton stated that his administration would work to build support from the international community on series of steps to promote democracy in cuba including the appointment of special envoy month later on august 16 1996 the president announced that he had appointed stuart eizenstat department of commerce undersecretary for international trade as special envoy to engage us allies over the next six months on concrete measures to advance democracy in cuba eizenstat said the united states was looking for agreement on measures to pressure castro to make political and economic reforms and respect human rights with regard to title iv of the legislation excluding aliens from the united states who have confiscated or trafficked in confiscated us property the state department sent letters in the summer of 1996 to several executives of sherritt international canadian mining company and grupos domos mexican telecommunications company the letters stated that they would be excluded from entrance into the united states effective in 45 days many us allies including canada japan mexico and european union eu nations have strongly criticized the enactment of the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity act they maintain that the bills provisions allowing foreign persons to be sued in us court constitute an extraterritorial application of us law that is contrary to international principles us officials maintain that the united states which reserves to protect its security interests is well within its obligations under nafta and the world trade organization wto while eu and other us allies welcomed the presidents action in postponing lawsuits under tile iii for sixmonth period concerns were still expressed about the possibility of future lawsuits and the visa restrictions in title iv of the legislation canada and the eu have continued plans for countermeasures in october 1996 eu members agreed to call for dispute crs9 settlement panel in the wto and the panel was created on november 20 1996 the panel is expected to return its findings by mid1997 expulsion of diplomats uscuban tensions escalated in midaugust 1996 when cuba expelled us diplomat in havana the diplomat robin meyer was the human rights officer for the us interests section in havana she had close contacts with cuban dissidents and human rights activists and cuba accused her of giving advice and support to the cuban dissidents including the distribution of anti government literature in response to cubas action on august 19 1996 the united states announced that it would expel

cuba the most prominent of which is comprehensive embargo prohibiting trade with cuba other sanctions prohibit us bilateral assistance to cuba prohibit us economic assistance to countries or international organizations and programs supporting cuba prohibit us arms sales or arms transfers to cuba prohibit cuban sugar imports and prohibit us exportimport bank activities in cuba in addition the cuban assets control regulations of the treasury departments office of foreign assets control ofac set forth detailed and comprehensive restrictions on the blocking of cuban assets in the united states and the transfer of assets to cuba these govern the prohibition on sending cash remittances to cuba and restrictions on travel to cuba the legislative and executive authorities implementing us sanctions on cuba have changed somewhat over time passage of the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity libertad act of 1996 pl 104114 22 usc 6021 et seq however limited the presidents discretion to lift the embargo when it stated that the economic embargo of cuba including the executive branch regulations that administer us policy would remain in effect until the president determined that transition government was in power in cuba and that incrementally lifting the embargo would contribute to stable foundation for democratically elected cuban government sec 102h of p l 104114 22 usc 6032h at the same time the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity act of 1996 also provides for us assistance to free and independent cuba title ii 22 usc 6061 6067 that law requires the president to development plan for infusing us assistance into cuba once either transition government or democratically elected government is in place such assistance would include food medicine and medical supplies and even military aid to help the cuban military forces adjust to operating as part of democratic state the law provides for posttransition establishment of uscuba council to address bilateral trade issues the law most importantly lays out the standards that must be met for the president to dismantle the entire sanctions regime the us holds for cuba today the discussion below briefly sets forth the history of authorities of these sanctions including their current status 6 prepared by dianne rennack foreign affairs and national defense division crs12 prohibiting us economic

sales act renamed the arms export control act the restriction on assisting cuba was continued however in section 620a of the foreign assistance act 22 usc 2370a section 620a3 also prohibited aid to any other country found to be aiding the government of cuba this latter restriction concerning third countries was repealed in 1977 section 620a1 as currently stated provides that assistance shall be furnished under this act to the present government of cuba the section goes on to authorize the president to establish and maintain total embargo upon all trade between the united states and cuba president kennedy exercised this authority on february 3 1962 when he proclaimed an embargo on trade between the united states and cuba7 section 620a2 of the foreign assistance act added by the foreign assistance act of 1963 in part forbids the provision of aid to cuba until the president determines that property taken from us citizens or commercial entities had been returned or that

prohibits all assistanceexcept for american schools and hospitals abroadto communist countries and currently identifies six countries as communist among them cuba the president is authorized to waive the restriction if he reports to congress that aid is vital to us national security the recipient country is not controlled by the international communist conspiracy or that aid would promote the countrys independence from international communism congress reaffirmed the presidents authority to waive this prohibition in 1985 by rewriting section 620f and adding paragraph that in part encourages the president to weigh whether the potential aid recipient is fostering the establishment of genuinely democratic system with respect for internationally recognized human rights the 1962 foreign assistance appropriations act similarly restricted appropriations for cuban assistance for that fiscal year as did the annual foreign assistance appropriations acts for each fiscal year through fy 1970 section 620t of the foreign assistance act of 1961 22 usc 2370t added by the foreign assistance act of 1967 on november 14 1967 prohibits aid to any country that has broken diplomatic relations
