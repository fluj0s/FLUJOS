trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division iraqs trade with the world data and analysis summary in the last 25 years iraqs economic involvement in the world market has fluctuated dramatically fluctuations brought about in part by damage to its oil infrastructure during the iraniraq war of the 1980s followed by multinational military response and years of multilateral economic sanctions as result of its 1990 invasion of kuwait economic stability in iraq has depended on exports of crude oil since the end of world war ii exports of oil accounted on average for 83 of iraqs annual exports from 19801990 and virtually all exports since 1996 when international economic sanctions were imposed in august 1990 iraqs oil sales dropped from 102 billion in 1990 to 305 million in 1991 from 1991 to 1995 the regime of saddam hussein declined to accept united nations proposals seeking to permit iraq to sell limited quantities of oil to meet the needs of its people without oil export revenues living conditions in the country deteriorated sharply in 1996 the iraqi government agreed to the establishment of united nations administered oilforfood program off that allowed the iraqi government to export limited amounts of oil and import food and humanitarian supplies under close supervision on may 22 2003 the security council adopted resolution 1483 lifting all civilian trade sanctions on iraq and providing for the termination of the off since iraqs chief export product is crude oil the countrys economic future at least in the short term depends on its ability to tap into its vast oil resources according to us department of energy statistics iraq has 115 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and possible reserves of as much as 220 billion barrels due to years of war combined with the excesses of the hussein regime its oil potential has been largely unexplored and only 17 of 80 discovered oil fields have been developed despite concerns over continued insurgent activity and the stability of the interim government that have scared away much foreign investment by major corporations the bush administration officials and others report that iraqs economy is doing well the us government is engaged in efforts to attract small and medium us businesses to work and invest in the country as subcontractors on us government contracts and in the private sector the

trade with the world data and analysis introduction iraqs involvement in world trade has varied dramatically in the last 25 years these fluctuations have been caused in part by the effects of the iraniraq war 19801988 and the influences of iraqs 1990 invasion of kuwait which led to multinational military response international economic sanctions were imposed on iraq following the invasion pursuant to united nations security council resolution 6611 from 1996 until the end of the regime of saddam hussein exports and imports were closely regulated through unauthorized oilforfood program off that permitted the iraqi government to sell limited quantities of oil in order meet the needs of its people for food and humanitarian supplies the off officially terminated its operations on november 21 2003 in keeping with security council resolution 1483 many in congress and the bush administration believe that reconstructing iraq including assisting in the restoration of its economic systems is compelling us national interest this belief was emphasized in the final report of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states informally known as the 911 commission which recommended that comprehensive us strategy to counter terrorism should include economic policies that encourage development more open societies and opportunities for people to improve the lives of their families and to enhance prospects for their childrens future2 the 911 commission also cautioned that if iraq becomes failed state it will go to the top of the list of places that are breeding grounds for terrorism at home3 international trade and economic development are essential to iraqs recovery from war from decades of repression and from the adverse effects of international sanctions in addition iraqs economic success at least in the short term is dependent on its ability to export crude oil which accounted for 83 of all exports from 19801989 and virtually all exports since 1996 however continuing insurgent attacks against oil facilities have kept postwar oil export flows below prewar levels extensive investment in the rehabilitation of iraqs oil facilities is also required before presanctions production levels are realized and new production can be developed 1 sres661 august 16 1990 2 national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states final report july 22 2004 p 378379 3 ibid p 367 crs2 this report provides first an analysis of iraqs trade with the world from the saddam husseins assumption of the presidency in 1979 to the present with emphasis on the postsaddam period iraqs exports especially its oil resources primary imports major trading partners trade during the sanctions period and alleged illicit trade during that period are discussed second the report discusses the progress of largely usdriven economic development initiatives in iraq and the continued process of normalizing iraqunited states trade relations third an appendix provides comprehensive tables on iraqs exports imports major trading partners and regional trade background since the beginning of saddam husseins regime in 1979 distinct patterns can be seen in iraqs international trade relationship with the world that seem to track its domestic history see figure 1 p 3 the first pattern corresponds to the beginning of the iraniraq war beginning in 1980 and ending in 1988 in 1979 just prior to the war oil production had reached an alltime high of 35 million barrels per day bpd decreased to 25 million bpd in 1980 and plummeted to less than 1 million bpd in 19834 imports during the same time period soared from about 85 billion in 1979 to about 19 billion in 1982 and 19835 some of the increase in that period may be due to imports of dualuse items with military and civilian uses commodities but such marked increase in imports might also have signaled that the government and iraqi industries were less able to produce food and goods domestically in wartime environment by 1984 imports decreased dramatically as the effects of the war caused iraqs economy to contract the cost of living rose sharply the dinar was devalued and the government and other organizations began to fall behind in payments to foreign contractors6 another period emerged after the end of the war in august 1988 when both exports and imports increased slightly until international economic sanctions were imposed directly after iraqs invasion of kuwait in august 1990 between 1990 and 1997 international trade virtually collapsed as both exports and imports hovered between 400600 million per year the third pattern in iraqs international trade begins after the implementation of the oilforfood program between december 1996 and 1998 oil exports were limited to certain levels and all exports were closely regulated by the united nations until the ending of international sanctions in 2003 similarly imports during this time period were limited to food humanitarian and medical necessities imports during this period ranged from 2 to 5 billion and exports from 6 to 17 billion 4 middle east oil and gas exxon background series december 1984 p 12 5 the

sanctions and the oilforfood program in august 1990 the security council adopted resolution 661 imposing comprehensive economic sanctions following iraqs invasion of kuwait from 1991 to 1995 iraq declined to accept proposals to allow iraq to sell limited quantities of oil to meet the needs of its people because the hussein regime believed that these proposals infringed on iraqs sovereignty and were limited in scope the security council made repeated efforts during the period to alleviate human suffering in iraq while pressing iraq to comply with all relevant security council resolutions without oil export revenues iraq could not import sufficient quantities of food and medical supplies and living conditions in the country reportedly deteriorated sharply7 on april 19 1995 the security council adopted resolution 986 which proposed that iraq be permitted to export 2 billion worth of oil every six months so that the iraqi government could use the proceeds of the oil sales to purchase food medicines and other humanitarian supplies to meet the needs of its people iraq and the security council signed memorandum of understanding on the implementation of the oilforfood program off on

prewar oil exporting period was phase thirteen which came into effect on december 5 2002 and was scheduled to run through june 3 200310 iraqs exports of crude oil during this period are shown in figure 3 p 9 on may 22 2003 the security council adopted resolution 1483 lifting all economic sanctions on iraq with the exception of arms and related military supplies the resolution provided for the termination of the off within six months and the transfer of all remaining transactions under the program to the coalition provisional authority cpa referred to in the resolution as the authority in keeping with resolution 1483 the off terminated its operations on november 21 2003 iraqs exports iraq entered the global trade marketplace in the mid1800s as an exporter of grains and cereals as early

3 shows that despite periodic increases in the oil export ceiling and the eventual rescission of the export ceiling in december 1999 iraqs oil exports often ran significantly below the permitted level of exports this was due in part to frequent disputes between iraqi and officials over efforts to end illicit surcharges placed on oil exports in addition iraq sometimes unilaterally interrupted the sale of oil to protest security council policy or to challenge the united states and its allies for example iraq suspended its oil sales for the month of april 2002 in protest of israels military

iraqs alltime peak oil production was 37 million barrels per day in 1979 just prior to the war with iran output dropped sharply as the war began but gradually recovered to similar level by 19891990 as result of severe damage to the oil industry infrastructure during the gulf war followed by economic sanctions crude oil production was reduced sharply to about 300000 bpd17 from 1990 to the end of 1996 sanctions prohibited exports of oil and oil production was limited to the amount needed to meet internal demand plus small amounts that may have been illegally exported18 condition of infrastructure prior to the implementation of the oilfor food program the oil infrastructure was partially repaired but often by cannibalization and shortterm substitution of parts and without access to external equipment or technology the security council after determining that the state of iraqs oil sector was lamentable allowed limited amount of investment in equipment and spare parts for basic maintenance of the oil infrastructure total of 3 billion from june 1998 to june 2001 however according to the calculations of oil industry experts investment in iraqs oil sector from 1990 on was about 060 per barrel in contrast to the worldwide average of 150 per barrel experts forecasted declines in oil production from 5 to 15 per year if the oil infrastructure was not improved19 the position of the united states and its allies during the sanctions regime however was that off funds should be used only for shortterm improvements rather than for making longterm repairs20 oil industry experts assessed iraqs prewar sustainable production capacity at higher than 2830 million bpd with net export potential of around 2325 million bpd including smuggled oil21 conservative estimates for restoring the oil sector to pre1990 levels by 2006 range between 5060 billion and as much as 20 billion may be required to reach oil production of 4 million bpd22 prior to the 2003 war the regime of saddam hussein had blueprint in place for doubling capacity to 6 million bpd with foreign oil companies playing key role23 in order to reach this potential however the regime acknowledged that iraqs oil sector would require investment at all levels including technical services capital equipment and 17 united nations security council letter dated 6 june 2001 from the secretarygeneral addressed to the

infrastructure24 iraqi authorities estimated that the 6 million bpd target would require an additional investment of at least 21 billion and would probably take 8 to 10 years to achieve after the lifting of international economic sanctions plans to reach the target included further development of producing oilfields as well as finding and developing additional fields in the western desert postsaddam situation even though iraqs oilfields were captured largely intact the oil industry has been hampered by postwar chaos and looting of its oil facilities damage and continued sabotage to infrastructure refineries and mainline transport facilities have slowed efforts to return exports to prewar levels from june 2003 to the end of february 2005 there were 211 documented attacks on iraqi oil pipelines25 many observers believe that us and iraqi protection of oil pipelines has been improving and us military commanders recently announced increased surveillance measures including the deployment of airborne snipers to prevent future acts of sabotage26 the iraqi government has also reportedly assumed direct control of 14000man security guard force originally hired by erinys south africabased contractor 27 the oil ministry is also reportedly exploring the use of advanced technology to protect pipelines by building socalled safe passages or fences with sensors and cameras around them28 nevertheless attacks by insurgents on oil pipelines continue which has resulted in iraqs inability to sustain its postwar production and export capacity on regular basis see figure 3 other difficulties in the oil supply infrastructure including deficiencies in electrical power and water supplies have further hindered production29 much of iraqs current oil production is also needed to meet domestic consumption requirements which averaged about 500000 bpd prewar although current requirements may be at least 100000 bpd less iraqi refineries inability to produce sufficient supply of needed fuels to meet domestic demand led the cpa to sponsor imports of gasoline and propane from other countries using us funds these imports have continued beyond the transition of power and are paid

imports may have been legitimate purchases of transportation vehicles oil machinery and spare parts for upgrading and repairing iraqs oil production facilities however it is also possible that some of

figures for the value of iraqs illicit trade study released in may 2002 by the general accounting office gao estimated that iraq earned 66 billion in illicit revenue from oil smuggling between 1997 and march 200141 the gao reported that iraq smuggled oil through neighboring states including syria turkey and jordan and imported illicit and unapproved commodities through numerous exit and entry points along its borders major illicit trade routes were said to include an oil pipeline to syria truck routes through entry points on the jordanian and turkish borders and shipping in the persian gulf prior to the war us officials were primarily concerned that iraq might be using these illicit revenues to purchase prohibited military and weaponsofmass destruction wmd technology the gao report also found however that the sanctions may have been partially effective in deterring iraq from obtaining most conventional weapons42 in february 2000 the clinton administration accused the iraqi government of using financial resources gained from illicit trade to build nine lavish palaces valued at about 2 billion43 the second bush administration concluded that international sanctions were not effective and accused iraq of using illicit revenue to finance active nuclear chemical and biological weapons programs44 postsaddam situation although illicit fuel smuggling by the iraqi government ended after the war individuals are now reportedly smuggling large amounts of fuel apparently stimulated by lower oil prices in iraq relative to world market prices some smugglers are reportedly drilling into pipes between the refinery and shipping terminals according to iraqi oil officials45 others are purchasing fuel in iraq filling up larger trucks and cars fitted with extra fuel tanks and driving across the border to 41 general accounting office weapons of mass destruction confronts significant challenges in implementing sanctions against iraq gao report number gao02625

cost46 the black market within iraq is also reportedly thriving because drivers are willing to pay higher prices for fuel on the street rather than waiting in long lines at filling stations47 the iraqi oil ministry has tried to stamp out the black market sales and fuel smuggling by monitoring practices at gas stations restricting filling of jerry cans to three stations and raising the pump price of fuel contained in jerry cans48 in addition iraqi authorities have largely given up on the domestic network of product pipelines favoring the use of private tanker trucks operated by sunni arab truckers to ferry the fuel from its oil refineries in baiji and basra this strategy has met with some success in part because the use of sunni arabs gives locals in the sunni triangle financial stake in fuel imports as well as apparently deterring insurgents49 these combined strategies have reportedly cut waiting times as filling stations down to 20 minutes or less50 some observers also indicate that the oil ministry is formulating plans to gradually liberalize the domestic products market in an additional attempt to stifle fuel smuggling however any plans to increase gasoline prices must await the formation of new transitional iraqi government51 major trading partners as is the case with most oilproducing countries many of iraqs leading prewar export trading partners were

trade turnover with iraq from 1997march 2003 amounted to 77 billion iraq was an important trading partner to russia because certain exports were sold to iraq that were not otherwise competitive in the global market including volga cars grain harvesters and power generation equipment russian analysts estimated that the industrial sector may lose as much as 25 billion if contracts signed with the regime of saddam hussein fall through52 in august 2002 russia and iraq signed fiveyear economic cooperation and trade agreement valued at 40 billion the trade package called for cooperation in several industry sectors including oil electricity and railroads53 russia and iraq have signed numerous oil and gas agreements since 1997 russian firms had not started work on these projects however even

an interest in bidding on oil contracts in iraq and are maintaining their contacts with the iraqi oil ministry to that end france iraq was an important market for french goods especially in the capital goods automotive and food processing sectors other prewar french exports to iraq included industrial telecommunications and electrical equipment the regime of saddam hussein considered france such an important trading partner that in march 2002 the iraqi embassy in paris opened new trade section dedicated to continued improvement of iraqs trade relationship with france56 over 90 french

contacted iraq to express interest in developing iraqi oil fields once sanctions were lifted60 some international observers were also concerned that the initial iraq reconstruction contracts favored us companies two american companies kellogg brown and root kbr and parsons were the primary companies initially selected for key reconstruction projects specifically related to oil development61 the selection of these companies and other us contractors for reconstruction contracts led to questions concerning the degree to which subsequent contracts would be open to competitive bidding process62 all of iraqs oil assets are now controlled by the interim government some analysts still express concern however that an iraqi government sensitive to us interests may favor american companies when issuing future contracts for oilfield development the governments creation of supreme council to establish comprehensive oil policy combined with the desire of the oil ministry to achieve the highest revenue possible may indicate that to the extent the iraqi government focused on longterm contracts at this time it is intent on keeping its options open with regard to future contract awards63 table

last month with somo for 40000 bpd from august to december 200369 postsaddam trade and investment prospects the current security situation combined with uncertainties surrounding iraqs stability following the transfer of power to transitional government has reportedly cooled the interest of some major foreign oil companies to tap iraqs undeveloped oil reserves at least in the short term according to john browne bps chief executive iraq is not on anyones radar screens right now70 although browne said that bp would obviously be interested in working in iraqs upstream eventually he said our own view is that you really do have to have to see government in power for some time who has made up their mind about what they want state oil company to do and what if any role the foreign oil companies should take71 despite the ceos comments bp reportedly joined with other major european oil firms royal dutchshell eni and repsol and several smaller firms in placing bids for smaller scale 10 million iraqi government contract to study oil reserves in the kirkuk and rumaila fields and develop detailed plan on how to best exploit them contract of this size would not normally be attractive

economic and trade policy many in congress and the bush administration believe that one of the hallmarks of success in postsaddam iraq will be the rejuvenation and redevelopment of iraqs economy in addition the 911 commission recommended that us efforts to counter terrorism should include economic policies that encourage development the commission mentioned iraq as specific example saying that if iraq becomes failed state it will go to the top of the list of places that are breeding grounds for terrorism at home76 many agree that rebuilding iraqs economy is compelling us national interest at this time the most significant threats to economic redevelopment are concerns about the internal security environment due to ongoing insurgency the viability of iraqs transitional government and the continuing progress of its transition to democracy some observers are also concerned that future permanent government of iraq may repeal some of the cpaestablished laws that favor business development such as laws that currently permit foreign investment and repatriation of capital the bush administration has begun the process of normalizing trade relations with iraq and on september 7

of iraqs infrastructure being pumped into the economy the eiu projections are based on modest increases in oil production and exports along with continuing stimulus from international aid money78 the iraq project and contracting office pco formerly the program management office under the coalition provisional authority estimates that between 250 and 300 iraqi firms are working on reconstruction contracts and that 87500 iraqi employees are affiliated with the pco79 the bush administration is also currently attempting to attract smaller and mediumsized us businesses to invest in iraq despite security and stability concerns although most major business opportunities still involve work on us funded reconstruction contracts efforts are also being made to facilitate us business contacts with iraqi government ministries and to assist businesses in exploring private sector investment and export possibilities80 some analysts note that despite the success of the election conducted on january 30 2005 the outcome may do little to end the disaffection of the sunni minority despite efforts to include them thus the insurgency is likely to continue to pose threat to the political and economic reconstruction of iraq81 despite security threats and continued economic hardship many iraqis remain optimistic about their future according to public opinion surveys poll taken from september 24 october 4 2005 showed that 65 expect their lives to get better in the near future82 the following anecdotal information is also an indicator that public perception of the economy is optimistic

it has deposited in the us federal reserve85 this could indicate that individuals are purchasing dinars with dollars they had put aside in the event of economic instability and that businesses and individuals from outside iraq are continuing to invest in the iraqi economy private sector business development funded by resident business capital and repatriation of funds from iraqis living

designation of gsp status is outlined in sections 502b2 and 502c of the trade act of 1974103 the president is directed to take into account the level of economic development of the country its commitment to liberal trade policy the extent to which it provides adequate protection of intellectual property rights and its observance of internationally recognized workers rights the law prohibits with certain exceptions the president from extending gsp treatment to other industrial countries communist countries countries that provide preferential treatment to the products of developed country and countries that nationalize or expropriate the property of us citizens or otherwise infringe on the property rights of us citizens the trade act of 1974 also restricts the presidents discretion in designating eligible products it lists categories of importsensitive products certain textile and apparel products watches electronic articles steel products footwear glass products and other items

varied dramatically during the regime of saddam hussein trading patterns have seemed to reflect the domestic situation in the country from the iraniraq war in the 1980s to the invasion of kuwait and the subsequent imposition of international economic sanctions currently iraqs economic future is dependent on its ability to draw on its vast oil resources these efforts are being hindered due to
