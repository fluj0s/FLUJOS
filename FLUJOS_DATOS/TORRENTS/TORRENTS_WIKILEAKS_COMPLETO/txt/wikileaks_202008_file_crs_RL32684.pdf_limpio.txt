divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32684changing senate rules or procedures the constitutional or nuclear option summary reports indicate possible attempts to curtail the use of filibusters in the senate perhaps in the 109th congress some have suggested that proponents of this idea may invoke something called the nuclear or constitutional option in senate floor procedure to try to end filibuster without the need for 60 votes or to amend the cloture rule rule xxii itself set definition exists for the term nuclear or constitutional in this context b ecause the point of using such an option is to achieve goal by means lying outside th senates normal rule s of procedure it would be impossible to list all the differe nt permutations ch maneuvers could encompass several likely scenarios that fall into this category are described in this report followed by discussion of the possible advantages and disadvantages of using such an approach opponents and some supporters of this kind of plan typically refer to it as the nuclear option because of the potentially significant result for senate operations that could follow from its use the senate relies heavily on unanimous consent to get its legislative work accomplished it may be more difficult to achieve unanimous consent in an environment where the minority feels it has lost some of its traditional rights supporters of the concept of major ity cloture argue that it is constitutional option because they will be making th eir argument based on constitutional prerogative or duty of the senate one method for changing senate proce dures might involve declaring extended debate on nominations dilatory and thus out of order another possibility is based on the argument that on the first day of new congress senate rules including rule xxii the cloture rule do not yet apply nd thus can be changed by majority vote under this argument debate could be stopped by major ity vote senator would move the adoption of new rule or set of rules the new rule or rules would be subject to majority vote supporters argue because the mechanic s of cloture as set out in rule xxii which requires superm ajority to invoke clot ure and end debate would not yet apply and the senate would be operating under genera l parliamentary law one variation would be claim th at on the opening day of congress simple majority could invoke cloture on the motion to take up resolution that proposed rules change or on the resolution itself again this scenario would rest on the proposition that rule xxii was not yet in fo rce and did not control action senators also could seek to have the 60vote threshold declared unconstitutional either for cloture in general or only as it applies to senate consideration of presidential nominations or perhaps subset of such nominations such as of federal judges this scenario might take place in at least two different ways the presiding officer might make ruling from the chair or senator could make point of order from the floor that the supermajority requirement for cloture is unconstitutional all these possible scenarios would require that one or more of the senates precedents be overturned or interpreted otherwise than in the past this report will be update d as events warranthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32684contents introduction 1 n m i n t i n s n d t h f i l i b u s t r 2 p s s i b l c u r

by the constitu tion the standing ru of the senate permanent standing orders of the senate adopted in prior congresses temporary standing orders of the senate adopted at the beginning of each congress and statutes it is also governed by precedents which are decisions made by the presiding officer of the senate or the body itself c oncerning how its rules operate in practice the precedents tend to elaborate the senate s understanding of its own rules the standing rules for example can be pr inted in 78 pages while the most recent collection of senate precedents is 1564 pages long precedents have tremendous weight in deciding parliame ntary questions in the senate and the presiding officer whether the vice president or majority party senator is expected to be guided by these precedents when ruling on pending question the standing rules of the senate woul d seem to be the obvious place to start if senator desired to change that chambe rs procedures if there is substantial opposition the standing rules of the senate can be chan ged by simple majority vote there is supermajority requirement for changing the rules if however there is opposition to the proposed rules change and if opponents seek to prevent final vote on the proposal by extended debate and amendment known as filibuster supermajority requirement does exist for i nvoking cloture or ending debate on rules change senate rule xxii which sets out the process for invoking cloture requires that twothirds of those present and voting 67 if all senators participate vote to invoke cloture on rules change this is difficult threshold to meet invoking cloture on all other measures or matters requires threefifths vote of all senators chosen and sworn 60 votes if vacancies exist cloture on proposal to change an existing standing order or to establish new standing order also require s this lower threshold it should be noted that the senate uses standing orders to m odify or set aside its standing rules without doing so directly sres 445 in the 108th congress for example inherently superceded portions of senate rule xxv and senate rule xxvi to establish committee on homeland security and gove rnmental affairs without directly amending the rules similar approach might be used to alter rule xxii without directly amending it the potential difficulty the elevated requi rement for invoking cloture poses for changing the standing rules has led so to look at making changes in senate practice through proceedings that alter existing precedents or establish new ones proceedings of this kind it is argued w ould both break old precedent and establish new senate precedents and could have th effect of changing senate practicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32684crs2 1 see crs report rl32843

the use of such tactics set definition exists for the term nuclear option indeed this term has been used to refer to many kinds of possible proceedings one set of possibilities how ever involves appea ling to constitutional requirements as an authority superior to that of the senates own rules and supporters of such an approach have acco rdingly preferred to describe such an approach as constitutional option1 nominations and the filibuster much of the discussion of the nuclear or constitutional option has involved presidential nominations particularly those for the federal judiciary fights over the confirmation of judicial nominees are not new phenomena but the intensity and frequency of the confrontations have increased in the last decade or so which has led some to question how the senate considers such nominations2 d u r i n g t h presidency of bill clinton and that of hi s successor george w bush groups in the senate have been able to block confir mation of nominations either because the nominee was never considered by the chambe r during the clinton presidency or by use of the filibuster to prevent final vote on some nominees during the bush presidency3 the levels of frustration became very intense in the 108th and 109th congresses and the majority party publicly denounced its inability to end filibusters to secure votes to confirm so federal judges4 to that end majority leader bill frist announced that he was prepared to try and ch ange the senates ru to make it easier for majority to overcome filibuster of judicial nominee first in the 108th congress he introduced resolution sr 138 that would have changed the procedure for invoking cloture the only way to end filibuster by imposing an ever decreasing threshold for successive votes to invoke cloture on nomination until it could be achieved by major ity vote of the full senate the resolution was reported out of the senate rules committee but not considered on the senate floor this

to the fact that if fili bustered twothirds vote of those senators present and voting would have been needed to invoke cloture on it5 on the first day of the 109th congress senator frist stated on the senate floor that he wanted to ensure that each judicial nomination received an up or down vote by the full senate and he noted that he might seek change of senate procedures to do this on may 18 the sena began consideration of controversial nominee for the federal bench and majority leader frist said he wanted to obtain an upordown vote on that nomination which had been pr eviously filibustered on may 20 cloture petition was filed with the vote t to occur on may 24 the media reported that the motion was not expected to receive the necessary 60 votes to cut off debate and that senator frist would employ version of the nuclear or constitutional option in order to reach an upordown vote on the nominee late on may 23 however bipartisan group of 14 senators announced an agreement that appeared to ensure final vote on the pending nomin ation and several othe rs and reduced the likelihood that the senate would change its rules or procedures through the use of constitutional or nuclear option6 on october 31 2005 president bush nomin ated federal appe llate court judge samuel alito to the supreme court w ithin hours of the announcement there was again talk of possible

washington gpo 1992 pp 800801 and 282334 9 opening day would not necessarily mean single calendar day in the past the senate has counted the opening day as legislative day not as calendar day legislative day lasts until the senate adjourns at the end of day of business if the senate recesses daily instead of adjourning the same legislative day continues matter how many calendar days pass so in theory the opening day of the senate could last any number of calendar days until the senate adjourned for the first time at the end of daily session possible courses of action exactly because the point of nuclear or constitutional option is to achieve changes in senate procedure by using m eans that lie outside the senates normal rules of procedure it would be impossible to list all the different permutations such maneuvers could encompass the following nevertheless repres ent several different approaches or scenarios that have been di scussed as possible methods to achieve this goal these are just sampling of the options available to senators they are not an exhaustive list dilatory debate one scenario would have the effect of creating within senate procedure new precedent that extended debate of nomina tion was dilatory and therefore out of order the following is one way such precedent could be set under this scenario nomination woul d be called up and bated on the senate floor after some time cloture motion to cut off debate would be filed if the cloture motion did not get 60 votes and faile d senator could then raise point of order that continued debate on the nomination would be dilatory and must end perhaps within specified time frame the presiding officer perhaps the vice president would then be expected to rule in support of the senators point of order an opposing senator would be expected to ppeal the ruling of the presiding officer although an appeal would be debatable it would likely be t by nondebatable motion to table the appeal of the ruling of the chair the senate could table the motion by simple majority vote thus establishing new precedent that extended debate on nomination can be ru led out of order as dilatory this scenario would appear to broade n the senates concept of what can be considered to be dilatory under current senate rules and precedents the concept of dilatory meaning intended to delay has not been applied to bate by senator or group of senators repeated motions to ascertain the presence of quorum for example have been considered dilatory by the senate and af ter the body has invoked cloture on measure or matter the chair has the authority to declare motions or amendments to be dilatory but deba has not been included in that8 opening day9 scenario one ma jority rules change the senate has long considered itself continuing body consistent with this premise the practice of the senate has been not to rea dopt rules in new congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32684crs5 10 in current american parliamentary practic the previous question is nondebatable motion to close consideration and bring pending matter to an immediate vote used extensively in the house of representatives if the motion is agreed to by majority vote it generally cuts off further debate and preven ts the offering of additional amendments or motions in its early history the senate us ed motion for the previous question as way to avoid consideration of controversial subject s it was not the same motion as understood today it was deleted from senate rules in 1806 neither version of the previous question is permitted under current senate rulesthere has been debate about whether th rules that govern the senate in one congress should continue in effect in the next congress supporters of this position argue that because only onethird of the membership of the senate changes at any one time and quorum of the senate is always in existence the body does not need to reconstitute itself at the beginning of each congress and thus the existing rules continue in effect from one congress to the next opponents of this position however point out that under these cond itions any change in rules must be considered under the existing rules which can make changing the rules extremely difficult they contend that this entrenchment of the rules unconstitutionally inhibits the senate from exercising its constitutional authority to determine its own rules those who would seek to amend senate rules to end filibuster by majority vote might use the first day of new cong ress to advance their proposal arguing that senate rules particularly the cloture rule rule xxii did not apply yet and thus that debate could be ende d by majority vote under this scenario senator would move the adoption of new rule or set of rules which could contain changes to rule xxii or any other rule the senator wanted to change debate on the new rule or rules could be limited subject to majority vote supporters argue because the mechanics of cloture as set out in rule xxii woul d not yet apply and the senate would be operating under general parlia mentary law senate acceptance of these conditions would allow decisions to be made by majority vote and could permit the use of parliamentary devices to nd debate such as calling for the previous question that would be decided by majority vote10 in order for this situation to prevail the presiding officer would have to rule that the previously existing rules did not govern consideration of motion to change the rules offered under these conditions and the senate would have to endorse that ruling most likely by tabling an appeal of the ruling which requires simple majority vote to succeed this was the situation on the opening day of the 85th congress on january 3 1957 when senator clinton anderson moved to consider new package of rules vice president richard nixon as presidin g officer said during debate that he believed that the senate c ould dopt new rule s under whatever procedures the majority of the senate approves vice pr esident nixon added that he did not believe the senate was bound by any previous rule which denies the membership of the senate the power to exercise its constitutional right to make its own rules vice president nixon made it clear that this was his personal opinion not ruling from the chair the senate however tabl ed senator anderson s motion senator anderson made similar attempt at the beginning of the 86th congress this timehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32684crs6 11 us congress senate committee on rules and

to committee not reaching any conclusion about changing rules on the first day11 in 1967 at the start of the 90th congress however nator george mcgovern proposed that the senate vote on motion to consider resolution lowering the threshold for invoking cloture he said that under the constitution the senate has the right to adopt new rules by majority vot senator everett dirksen then raised point of order that senator mcgoverns motion would circumvent existing senate rules the presiding officer vice presid ent hubert humphrey ruled that because senator dirksens point of or der raised constitutional issu the senate itself should rule on whether the point of order should be sustained under senate precedents the presiding officer may not rule on constitutional point of order and instead must submit the point of order to the full senate for vote12 humphrey also ruled that the point of order was subject to tabling motion which was not debatable senator mcgovern moved to table the point of order and by vote of 3761 the senate refused to table it the senate then voted 5937 to sustain the point of order13 in sum vice president hubert humphrey submitted the constitutional point of order to the senate and sena tor mcgovern moved to tabl it the senate failed to table or kill the point of order the senate then voted 5937 to sustain the point of order that senator mcgoverns motion w ould circumvent existing senate rules with that vote the senate declined to allow the original motion to change the rules made by senato r mcgovern to employ the nuclear or constitutional option in this scenario the senate would have to overturn these two precedents perhaps among others opening day scenario two majority cloture variation on the first proposition w ould rest on claim by proponents of changing senate rules that on the opening day of congress simple majority could invoke cloture on the motion to take up re solution that proposed rules change or on the resolution itself as in the first opening day scenario this action would be based on the premise that even if in cont rast to the previous option senate rules were regarded as continuing in effect the senate must at the st art of new congress in particular be able to exercise effectively its constitutional power over its own rules therefore supporters of this approach argue the senate must be able to reach vote on questions of adopting or amending these rules at the start of the 91st congress 19691971 this pproach was attempted and the presiding officer vice president hubert humphrey ruled that majority of thosehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32684crs7 14 ibid p 28 vice president hubert humphrey remarks in senate congressional record vol 115 jan 16 1969 pp 994995 15 committee on rules and

question before the senate when humphrey made this ruling was motion to consider resolution to change the threshold for invoking cloture from twothirds to threefifths of those present and voting in this case the senator who sought to change the rules by majority vote senator frank church asked th presiding officer to make the determination and the vice president then ruled the senate vot ed 5147 to invoke cloture and the chair ruled that the motion had succeeded by majority vote later the same day the vice presidents ruling was appealed and the senate voted 4553 to overrule it thus overturning the decision to permit majority cloture14 in 1975 at the start of the 94th congress proponents of the proposition that majority of senators coul d invoke cloture on rules change at the opening of congress had shortlived victory senator james pearson submitted resolution changing the threshold for invoking clotur from twothirds of those present and voting to threefifths of those present nd voting the senator offered lengthy motion which included as given that majority vote of the senate could invoke cloture on his proposal senator mike mansfi eld objected and raised point of order that senator pearsons motion violated the rules of the senate the presiding officer vice president nelson rockefeller declin ed to rule on the same ground cited by vicepresident humphrey in 1967 instead pu tting the question befo re the senate to decide by vote of 5142 the senate ag reed to motion to table the mansfield point of order thus implicitly agreeing to the majority cloture proposition because senator pearsons motion was so lengthy however the chair ruled that it could be divided into individual pieces for debate th is debate occupied the senate for several days preventing members from reaching final vote on the rules change which could have had the effect of settling whether majo rity could invoke cloture15 less than two weeks later the senate reconsidered the vote by which it tabled senator mansfields point of order and then voted 5343 to sustain it that same day as part of the compromise by whic h the senate reversed itself on the point of order senator robert c byrd offered ries of motions that ended with the senate adopting change to the cloture rule altering the required vote to the present standard of threefifths majority of those chosen and sworn except on propositions to change the standing rules16 thus the senate briefly ndorsed majority cloture but later reversed itself and reestablished the precedent th at the rules are continuous disagreements remain about whether the senate obliterated the precedent of majority cloture with its s ubsequent actions senator by rd has said he believes the vote erased the precedent17

1975 p a16 19 riddick senate procedure p 148who was involved in the debate as senator has said he believes the rule xxii experience was significant because for the first time in history the vice president and clear majority of the senate established that the senate may at the beginning of new congress and unencumbe red by the rules of previ ous senates adopt its own rules by majority vote as constitutional right the last minute votes attempting to undo that precedent in way undermine that right18 successful employment of this scenario would involve the senate overriding its later 1975 decision sustaining the point of or der against majority cloture and instead reaffirming its initial implicit decision of th at year in favor of majority cloture the constitution and cloture another set of options for altering the requirement for cloture would involve addressing the matter not on th opening day of new cong ress but in the course of the session the intent of this set of opti ons would be to have the 60vote threshold for cloture declared unconstitutional either for cloture in general or only as it applied to senate c onsideration of presidential nomin ations or perhaps subset of such nominations such as of federal judges under senate precedents the presiding officer does not rule on hypothetical situation so it is likely that for options of this kind to be used nomination would have to be before the senate and the nate would have to have failed to invoke cloture on the nomination at this point the scenario could play out in at least two different ways it has been suggested that the presiding officer probably the vice president or the president pro tempore could declare rule xxii unconstitutional set the supermajority threshold aside and rule that cloture c ould be invoked by simple majority this ruling itself would constitute break with senate precedents which as discussed above rely on the senate as whole to d ecide constitutional issues if the chair issued such ruling opponents would likely appeal and the appeal would ordinarily be debatable19 another senator however could move to table the appeal which is nondebatable motion if the senate voted to table the appeal of the ruling question which would be decided by simple majority the appeal would fail and the new precedent would appear to be conf irmed permitting clotur to be invoked by simple majority if the majority could get to that vote under second scenario following vot in which the senate failed to invoke cloture on pending measure or matter senator would from the chamber floor make constitutional point of order that the supermajority requirement for cloture is unconstitutional the presiding officer might then in keeping with precedent submit the constitutional question to the

gauntlet on filibusters procedural question submitted to the senate traditionally is debatable and the point of the exercise according to its supporters is to find way to limit debate however the presiding officer could break with precedent by ruling that the motion would not be debatable it is likely that senator would appeal the decision of the chair that the question would not be debata ble and this appeal proba bly would be met with counter motion to table the appeal if th tabling motion were successful the appeal would fall with the effect of sustaining the ruling of the chair pursuant to the ruling that the submitted point of order was not debatable the senate would then proceed to vote without debate on the constituti onal question which would be decided by simple majority vote employment of either of these versions of the constitutional option would require the chair to overturn previous precedent either by ruling on question that by precedent has been submitted to the sena or by ruling non debatable question that by precedent has been treated as debatable considerations any version of the nuclear option would carry with it risks and rewards the most obvious direct benefit would be for those judges who could be confirmed by majority vote if debate could be stopped by simple ma jority as well it would also strengthen the executive branchs hand in the selection of federal judges if the administration could be assu red of confirmation with th votes of 51 senators it also might make the administration less likely to use its recess appointment power to install judges on the fede ral bench an issue that rais ed serious concerns in the senate in 200420 potential implications for the senate opponents of using any of these parlia mentary maneuvers argue that the ability to confirm nominations even those with significant opposition by simple majority could make an administration less willing to negotiate with the senate and weaken the role of the senate in the nominati on and confirmation of presidential nominees furthermore they note that the senate confirmed 207 of president bushs judicial nominations and failed to confirm 10 in the 108th congress roughly 3 of federal judgeships were vacant at any time not creating significant impediment to the operations of the federa l courts they say 21 supporters of using nuclear or cons titutional option to change the cloture process argue that it could protect senate majoritys ability to act particularly when it came to an issue of such vital interest as ensuring sufficient number of federal judges

weakened with the repeated successful filibusters of certain federal judicial nominations22 because the senate has not utilized th nuclear or constitutional option before the consequences of doing so are unc lear the potential exists for significant repercussions in describing the sena most modern c ongressional scholars now refer to it as unanimous consent body by far the greatest share of the chambers business is conducted one way or another by agreement among all senators in part the reason is that senators have learne d to agree on how to proceed knowing that such procedural agreement does not necessarily predetermine the outcome of policy decisions the use of plan which would in tentionally use procedural tool to force final decision on policy option could make it dramatically more difficult to obtain unanimous consent for anything else that followed both sides of the debate seem to be c oncerned about the possible results in the opinion of one democra tic senator the use of the nuclear option would be dagger at the heart of what the senate is all about and democr ats would take very strong action23 republican senator told the hill that damage from the use of the nuclear or constitutional option could level the senate making it very difficult for work to get done the nuclear option on judges it rather clears the landscape the senator said24 the procedural maneuver also could change the nature of the senate in which it is difficult to override the rights of th minority it would raise fundamental and significant questions about how the institu tion would function the answers to which would become clear only as time passed if the power of the filibuster were broken for example would the senate become more like the house of representatives in which debate and deliberation can be terminated at the option of the majority or would it become chaotic environment in which temporary majority could change precedents any time it wanted to another concern would be consequences for other rules of the senate because it is so difficult to change the senates rules they have remained fairly stable and therefore the basic structure of senate pro cedure has remained fa irly constant if however change to the rules were accomplished by majority vote nothing would prevent other changes to the rules from being proposed which could then conceivably be accomplished with majority vote to end debate on them as well in addition even if constitutional or nuclear option were used opponents still might be able to delay final vote on whatever measure or matter was pending existing senate precedents would seem to allow an endless series of amendments to proposed rules change even if debate were allowed the nate routinely does this each year when it considers the annual budget resolution therefore it is unclear that the constitutional or nuclear option by itself c ould bring about vote on ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32684crs11 rule change further even if the use of this option resulted in lower cloture vote threshold other portions of the rule woul d presumably remain untouched in which case the postcloture process still would provide delaying po ssibilities for opponents additional questions arise if the senate used an opening day gambit would successful action in this form change the understanding of the nate as continuing body would this change mean that the nate would have to elect its officers and adopt its rules at the start of each congress alternative proposal one potential alternative would be to modi fy other senate practices instead of changing the cloture rule or to enforce existing senate rules more stringently number of possible approaches could be used to bring debate to close absent any formal change to rule xxii for example the twospeech rule does not apply to executive business in the same way it does to legisla tive business limiting senators to two speeches during the consideration of any nomination rega rdless of how many session days the nomination was pending would bring about vote on nomination without the need to invoke cloture or to consider amendments to the cloture rule another alternative might be to require senators who wish to filibuster measure or matter such as nomination to hold the floor and talk to maintain their filibuster in the modern senate such disp lays are rare instead the senate routinely permits senators to sugge st the absence of quorum as means to delay action without the need to debate the senate by precedent has ruled such quorum calls dilatory after cloture by precedent the senate could make such quorum calls dilatory at any time if substantive bus iness had intervened since quorum had been previously established the twotrack system allows other business to come before the senate even as the pending business remains unresolved as result time on the senate floor is more often used to conduct business on which there has already been agreement rather than to debate or amend measures or filibuster them removing contentious measure from active consideration allows the threat of filibuster to halt measure instead of requiring opposition senators to openly debate the measure and explain their concerns publicly the senate longer relie s on extended continuous ssion to put pressure on opposition senators such latenight or multiple day sessions were common until generation ago the disuse of traditionally effective strategy to end debate or to encourage policy compromise has led in th opinion of some to the consideration of illadvised rule changes when less drastic changes to senate tradition could achieve the desired result
