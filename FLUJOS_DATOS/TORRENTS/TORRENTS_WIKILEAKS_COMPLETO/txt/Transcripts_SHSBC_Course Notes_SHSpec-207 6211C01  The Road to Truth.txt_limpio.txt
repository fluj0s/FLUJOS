6211c01 shspec207 the road to truth it is very difficult to go around remembering all the time you get stuck pontius pilate asked what is truth truth is very near ultimate in its most severe interpretation lots of people have stated what truth is without realizing that they are putting an absolute where there is actually maybe truth is relative commodity the best approach to truth is contained in the mathematics used in connecting telephone switchboards they dont select out subscribers with arithmetical truth arithmetic is theoretical truth it is only theoretical because there is commodity connected with it it is truth of symbols errors only turn up when people say the symbols mean something in reality two apples minus two apples equals apples is magicians trick noapple is relative thing there is still something of an apple you can say well there are apples on the table after you take two apples off that is true as long as you accept time as truth which is adventurous the statement is only true for one particular time and place yet it passes as truth it is truth but relative one thetan since apples came into existence has utterly asised an apple so two apples minus two apples equals apples is only relative unless it presupposes some kind of magic we have become used to accepting such things as true the abstract 220 is true but it is true only because we have set it up that way the person who adventures out on the road to truth adventures with great desperateness it is an adventurous step philosopher who seeks to discover and teach truth is taking his life in his hands as well as the lives of many others therein lies his responsibility it is adventurous because it is the only track you have to go the whole way on there is short stop on the way to truth you have to walk to the end of the road otherwise all manner of difficulties and upsets will beset you there is such thing as relative philosophical truth that is safe if it doesnt approach the actual composition of the subject matter it addresses if you address the subject of the physical universe through the physical sciences you will find weird things in your path the savants of these sciences use the phrase exact science with great impudence considering the complete difference between what is given as truth in two different fields like chemistry and physics there is an article in the encyclopedia britannica at the turn of the century that wisely said that people wouldnt find out much about time and space until they studied in the field of the mind and got the conceptual basis that preceded time and space physics has gotten the world in trouble by building weapons that can be used by men who arent sane there are workable truths which gives the exact sciences bloated notion of themselves because they deal in workable truths in the field of the study of man people try to use as workable truth the notion that one can do anything about man because he is merely an animal this idea started as revolt against religions control of mens faith psychology is study that is peculiarly religious and was so until 1879 when wundt theorized that man has soul up to that point psychology had been religious study looking at the will reason etc somebody moved in on it in the spirit of revolt just as the advances of the exact sciences have here and there down the track blown up religion so the exact sciences have now entrenched themselves in total falsehood concerning the mind at the same time they have developed an unworkable psychology to back up the exact science of blowing up the planet that gives you some of the liabilities of embarking on the road to truth and not going towards truth gautama siddhartha discovered how to exteriorize without discovering the laws governing it or how to let someone else exteriorize at will how many hundred million people did he condemn to slavery by not walking all the way down that road because halftruths have been used and misused ever since knowing this it takes brave man to go in that direction he knows that the traps and upsets of existence are composed of halftruths and that all efforts to enlighten can be employed to enslave and entrap by the fact of twoway flow aesops fables originally had morals they were just amusing stories this is pertinent to what you are doing because in the microcosm of single person you have the macrocosm of the universe the universe proceeds from basic postulates you can go on from these basic postulates to spot the goals of gold and lead and the methods of livelihood of quartz and schist they arent alive but they follow behavior pattern all flies wash their faces in the same way it is wonderful the way some postulates stick moss or man you are looking at the same cumulative structure based on some intentions and dedications you could reanalyze the world of chemistry or physics on the basis of postulates and intentions one of the booby traps of studying science is the sort of statement typified by nobody knows what electricity is this is in fact just remark not even postulate but everyone takes it as truth so they go into agreement with it and therefore are debarred from discovering more truth people have been telling other people for long time that they cant find out about truth the idea of the unknowable has some use but only to let people see that you dont have to know all about something before you start to find out about it emmanuel kant used the concept of the unknowable differently he said that the unknowable would never be known by anybody well how did he find out about it even by philosophic examination it is preposterous if you cant experience it at all how can you know it exists to be notknown there are some roads that are agreed to be closed for instance there is an idea that it is bad to know about the human mind some things it is better not to know if you are alive you know something about the human mind what is really dangerous is to find out nothing more about it in the last few days the cobalt60 was close to spreading across the steppes of russia and the plains of the us because of what because it is so dangerous to begin to know anything about the human mind people recognize that it is dangerous to some degree but they recognize what is really dangerous if you know of the existence of something it is dangerous not to know all about it people concede that they dont know anything at all about it that is an idiotic premise in the field of the mind they are already aware of the existence of figure think calculate in other beings so they are already started on the road to knowledge of the human mind it is very dangerous to go further so the search for truth isnt the province of few everyone has started to know something about it but not to know more about it than they do will cause them to die that doesnt even seem startling it is so accepted if group decides to go all the way on the road to truth the more they know the less dangerous it is what is really dangerous is to suppose that people think and to know nothing more about it than that it is also very dangerous to be spotted as one who is walking towards truth unless you go the whole way it is booby trapped everyone is very suspicious of anything being known because people who have jumped up and said something was known have often lied if they pretended to know more then others they have committed overts if they found some partial truth and never got any further but instead spread bricabrac in all directions as the true wisdom they have committed the overt of consigning perhaps billions of people to slavery so there is substitute for walking the track lrh has never doubted that he would bring off this study though he has often wondered whether or not the time factor would upset things we needed few clear years if you have reputation for knowing you enter into mechanism called the missed withhold if you seem to have the gift of knowing about the mind people think you know the truth and to them the only truth that exists is themselves first dynamic truth this includes their own aberrations their ideas about rightness of conduct etc so you run into missed withholds scientist wants to get away from right and wrong because he is blind to the possibility that there could be an exact right conduct the idea of right conduct has been particular concern of eastern philosophers it has been ignored in the west all considerations of behavior and the ow mechanism are primarily based on ideas of right and wrong conduct in back of the ow mechanism is the idea that right conduct can exist this is the saving grace of any race of beings survival is the monitoring factor of rightness of conduct the behaviorist would try to tell you that right conduct is first dynamic matter that it is not survival but selfpreservation this misses the boat person commits overts not because of selfpreservation but because of survival that is his rightness of conduct the difference is that in fact one acts out of more than one dynamic right conduct is always group activity not an individual one matter how much person speaks of integrity to himself his ideas of his own rightness are based on the concepts of the group to which he belongs so we get third dynamic aberration of right conduct as underlying all ow and missed withholds the only thing senior to ow is the pure mechanics of existence as given in the early axioms those early axioms are very close to absolute truth thought absolutes are unattainable because the only absolute is static and that is nothing hence it is unattainable because it cannot be had the aberrations person engages in are his efforts to discover right conduct with the handicap that mores change from group to group and lifetime to lifetime so there is road to truth on the subject of right conduct if you realize that thetans aberrated condition results from 1 search for right conduct 2 an effort to adhere to codes of right conduct 3 the breaking of codes of right conduct then you are walking the road to truth moral statements are the entrance of arbitraries into conduct not truths this fact is unknown to legislators who always try to say that their laws are true but in making the laws they longer even consult the customs of the people but instead try to reverse the social order however laws which dont evolve from the customs of the people 1 operate as total tyranny 2 are totally unenforceable prohibition was good example of this fact this concerns you because you are in the business of determining truth from right conduct or nowimsupposedtos people think that right conduct is truth they think they have some data when they dont your period of peril is past there was time when taking you as unit of truth there was question whether or not your state of understanding of yourself could be materially improved by study and processing however it is now clear that if anyone will sit still and if the auditor does the right processing this will occur we started out with everyone stupid as hell on the subject including lrh originally now we have gotten to the point where someone can know all about where he has been what he has done and where the axioms look to him like clearlystated obvious things we are essentially in the business of individuals dont forget that matter what you are trying to do or handle whether it is world government or whatever it is you will never in your whole history handle more than sn individual if you fail to handle an individual then you will have to set up all sorts of groups and laws to do it the raison detre of most earth organizations is the fact that they could not handle an individual this brought about their construction not their demise this isnt true of all third dynamics only the aberrated ones here on earth this is actually an inverted third dynamic they couldnt handle the first dynamic so they developed an organization not to have to do it despite that scientology is the one activity on this planet that doesnt follow this rule there still tends to be an organization that gets pulled in and grows up around lrh at times this organization fails to deliver service due to shortage of time or material or personnel but on the whole we are handling the individual russia shoots individuals and loves the masses this is aberrated you can handle the individual if everything you do is individually tailored to serve his needs so he is not overlooked whenever you fail to handle an individual you set up an upset so you will set up an organization laws and all sorts of ow to do it we are probably the only organization today going in the direction of clear third dynamic we use ow only to park an individual until we can handle him there is truth in the mass of things and truth in moral codes truth isnt to be found there only agreements there is truth apart from the individual if there is any truth you are it if there is any truth to be known you will know it when someone almost caves in because you have confronted him and made him wonder what you do know ie when you have missed withhold on him your only mistake is not to reach him as truth you are at that moment confronting the road to truth and you have got to travel it because you have already started to there will be many pc that you will start to process many person that you will tell about scientology of whom you will say why did i get up this morning if someone says i heard that ron doesnt believe in god the wrong thing to do is to unload jump off the road you handle it all your disasters anyplace will stem from the instant you backed off turned around did something else and set up an organization to handle this jerk you will only fail when you dont try because if you make some stab at it he wont go away you will be surprised to find that you will pick him up somewhere down the track many times you will think you have failed when you havent the only mistake is to try to go backwards on the road to truth that is dangerous if you fail to stand up to someone who is mad at you because of his missed withholds or to the guy in the pe course who says it cant be true because ron doesnt believe in god that is when you fail catastrophes occur people get mad at you you cave in but that can be changed or handled if you fail to handle an individual you end up setting up an org to handle masses but not individuals individuals only stand up and yap in order to be handled there is truth to be found and there is road to truth you have that in you and every time you look at human being you see it in him rut you dont find truth in the mass of things and in moral codes since you understand what human nature is about the more you know and understand it the less these factors like having to handle banky individual will trouble you but every little fellow has started on the road to truth his only stupidity is not to keep going we are almost there the main road and the thorns are behind us we only retreat from our position to the degree that we dont realize that you cant start case you cant embark on clearing planet or an individual and do it diffidently without to some degree seeing it through to final conclusion your only disasters will stem from failure to follow that road all the way through
