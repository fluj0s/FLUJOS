such imports do not threaten the health and safety of the american public and do provide cost savings that certification requirement continued from prior law has effectively halted implementation of existing import provisions because secretary has been willing to provide the required certification the act changes the law in four basic ways it 1 directs the secretary to allow imports from canada only t he meds act had allowed imports from specific list of industrialized countries in cluding canada 2 includes shift in approach to the importation of prescription drugs by indi viduals by codifying the discretion in enforcement that the food and drug admin istration fda has exercised to allow the personal use imports of prescription drugs 3 eliminates the prohibition against manufacturers entering into agreements to prevent the sale or distribution of imported products and 4 includes m echanism based on evidence by which the secretary can terminate the import program following enactment of the medicare bill in december 2003 some members of congress have moved to amend the im portation of prescrip tion drugs provisions some states and localities have set up websites to facilitate individuals purchase of prescription drugs from canadian pharmacies fda has responded in letters to state officials fda has warned th at states could face tort liability suits and charges of assisting in criminal activity if citizens suffer injury from these drugs fda via the department of justice has gone to th courts to stop the canadian and us distributors of drugs

cfr part 203 addressed the practice of licensed practitioners to donate unused prescription drug samples to charitable institutions such as free clinics nursing homes and other charitable health care

institution must be inspected by licensed practitioner or register ed pharmacist and that drug sample receipt and distribution records must be kept by the in stitution for minimum of three years these

current legal prohibition against persons importing drugs or devices the secretary should focus enforcement on cases where the importing may pose significant threat to public health when the importation is clearly for personal use and the prescription drug or device does not appear to present an unreasonable risk to the individual the secretary should exercise disc retion to permit the

program differs from the certification the secretary must make to initiate the programthe second addresses drug imports from an other country here the law gives the secretary the option rath er than requirement to issue regulations allowing imports from countries other than canada if the secretary were to publish such regulations the law requires the secretary to also publish guidance specifying the conditions under which individuals would be able to import drugs for personal use construction section 804k nothing in th is section shall be construed to limit the secretarys authority relating to th importation of prescription drugs other than with respect to section 801d1 wh ich allows only the manufacturer to import prescription drug commencement of program section 804l the drug import program described above can begin only if the secretary first certifies to congress that its implementation would pose dditional risk to public hea lth and safety and would result in significant reduction in the cost of covered products prescription drugs to american consumers termination of program section 804l once an importation program is implemented the secretar can move to terminate it under specified conditions if the secretary certifies to congress be tween 12 and 18 months after the regulations are implemented that based on substantial evidence in the opinion of the secretary the benefits of the implementation of the import program do not outweigh any detriment drug imports under the section would cease 30 days after the certification is submitted9 however the secretarys certification may not be submitted unless after public hearing the secretary finds it is more likely than not that implementation will result in an increased risk to the public health identifies in qualitative and quantitative terms the nature and causes of the increased risk considers whether measures can be taken to avoid reduce or mitigate the increased risk and if those measures would require additional stat utory authority to report to congress describing needed legislation identifies in qualitative and quantitative terms the benefits that would result from the program including reductions in the cost of drugs to us consumers wh ich would allow them to obtain needed medications without foregoing other nece ssities of life and in specific terms compares the detriment with those benefits and determines that the benefits do not outweigh the detriment authorization of appropriations section 804m the new law authorizes to be appropriate d such sums as are necessary to

months after the enactment of this act study and report on trade in pharmaceuticals section 1123 requires the presidents designees to conduct study and report on issues related to trade and pharmaceuticals discussion of enact ed legislation import provisions it is doubtful whether the secretary will implement these import provisions given the act contains the provision that led both secretaries shalala and thompson to decline that provision requires that the secretary certify that imported drugs would be safe and at reduced cost before implementing import regulations although significant change s were considered the new law changes very few elements of the meds act of 2000 effectively until the secretary makes certification regarding safety and cost the law allows one other than the us manufacturer of the drug to gally import prescription drug10 therefore until an hhs secretary certifies to congress that the implementation of this section will pose additional risk to the publics health and safety and b will result in significant reduction in the cost of covered products to the american consumer11 drug imports are illegal unless im ported by the manufacturer of the drug neither pharmacist nor wholesaler may import prescription drugs the law does not allow an individual to import drug for personal use12 if the hhs secretary were to certify to c ongress the required safe ty and cost savings certification then all the mechanisms of ction 804 would go into effect in that case pursuant to regulations that the secretary must promulgate by law and according to regulations pharmacist or wholesaler could import prescripti on drugs from canada personaluse imports by an indivi dual from any other country would remain illegal unless the secretary chose to issue regulations allowing them and the laws restrictions on personal use imports would be waived so an individual could import 90da supply of prescription drug from canadahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32271crs7 studies and reports unrelated to whether the secretary certifies safety and cost savings the medicar act mandates two studies with reports to congress study and report on importation of drugs the law directs the hhs secretary within 12 months of enactment to study and report on the importation of prescription drugs into the united states pursuant to

to adopt the pharmaceutical market access act of 2003 hr 2427 wh ich contained broa der provisions such as permitting qualifying individuals ie consumers as well as pharmacists and wholesalers to import prescription drug products from 25 industrialized countries including canada this bill introduced by representative gutknecht differed strikingly from the thencurrent law and the subsequently enacted medicare legislation in that it would have eliminated the provision that requires the secretary to first certify that importation would pose additional risk to public health and safety and would lower the cost of prescription drugs for us consumers hr 2427 would also have required dr ug makers to incorporate various counterfeitresistant technologies in the packaging and shipping containers of all prescription drugs the bill would have created new section in the law called counterfeitresistant technolog ies it would have requi red that all prescription drugs not just those
