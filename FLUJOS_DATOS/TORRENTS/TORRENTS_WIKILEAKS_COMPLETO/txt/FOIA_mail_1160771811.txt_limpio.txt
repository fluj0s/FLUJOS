from keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk to mannpsuedu subject re gkss results date fri oct 13 163651 2006 cc tim osborn tosbornueaacuk mike tim and i have discussed this round and round and our response is attached what do you think best wishes keith at 1733 10102006 you wrote dear timkeith i hope all is well with both of you weve been doing number of sensitivity tests w regem using both the csm simulation and now more recently the gkss simulation data we got from you there are some methodological developments well describe soon related to what is the most reliable regularization method in regem ridge regression and truncated total least squares we are now leaning towards the latter because of potential nonconvergence problems in some cases w the former more on that soon more relevant however are the results as you can see from the attached plot regem works quite well w gkss using short calibration period 19001980 corresponding to years 900980 in the attached plot and both white and red pseudoproxy noise we used rho05 in the attached but similar result for other values the most interesting result is that while regem reconstructs the full nh series well throughout in the case of the csm simulation it does modestly underestimate the warmth of the earliest centuries in the gkss erik simulation it fits everything else including the lia cooling very well we feel that this is likely due to problem of correctly identifying the drift pattern using cfr methods the long and short of this is that we would like to be able to show this result in very short j climate response we need to finalize to comment on mann et 2005 j clim by zorita and von storch we would show you this response for comment of course and would add you as coauthors we have cleared with andrew weaver that this would be an acceptable course of action we are hoping you are in agreement with this please let us know asap we have to finalize our response within days thanks mike michael mann associate professor director earth system science center essc department of meteorology phone 814 8634075 503 walker building fax 814 8653663 the pennsylvania state university email mannpsuedu university park pa 168025013 1httpwwwmetpsuedudeptfacultymannhtm professor keith briffa climatic research unit university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk phone 441603593909 fax 441603507784 2httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa references 1 httpwwwmetpsuedudeptfacultymannhtm 2 httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa
