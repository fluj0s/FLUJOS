action request embassy berlin please see paragraph 4 2 s background and objective we want to advise german officials of information indicating that as of june 2009 two iranian intermediary firms offered test equipment manufactured by the german firms rohde schwarz and hottinger baldwin messtechnik hbm to irans primary developer of liquidfueled ballistic missiles the shahid hemmat industrial group shig while this equipment is not controlled by the missile technology control regime mtcr it could be used in ballistic missile testing applications moreover shig made specific requests for items manufactured by rohde schwarz and hbm and goods produced by the two firms were the targets of previous longrunning procurement efforts by shig and the iranian procurement network farazeh equipment distributor company fedco which may have been acting on behalf of shig refs in both cases german officials investigated the information we provided and sensitized the firms to their concerns note in the hbm case the company reported that it did receive request from evertop services fedco affiliate but that the request was rejected end note we want to share this new information with german officials and encourage them to continue their efforts to prevent shig or other iranian entities of proliferation concern from procuring sensitive items from rohde schwarz and hbm 3 action request request embassy berlin approach appropriate host government officials to deliver talking pointsnonpaper in paragraph 4 below and report response talking points also may be provided as nonpaper 4 s begin talking pointsnonpaper secretrel germany we would like to alert you to information of proliferation concern and request your assistance in investigating this activity between 2007 and 2009 we discussed with you on numerous occasions information indicating that iranian entities of proliferation concern were seeking equipment manufactured by the german firms rohde schwarz and hottinger baldwin messtechnik hbm specifically we advised you that the shahid hemmat industrial group shig irans primary developer of liquid fueled ballistic missiles and entities affiliated with the farazeh equipment distributor company fedco were engaged in efforts to procure rohde schwarz and hbm equipment we were pleased to subsequently hear that german officials had sensitized representatives of both firms to proliferation concerns related to shig and fedco and that hbm had rejected request from evertop services an entity affiliated with fedco we now want to share with you related information indicating that as of june 2009 shig was seeking test equipment via iranian intermediaries from both rohde schwarz and hbm specifically we understand that the tehranbased heydari ofogh sanat anvar company offered shig an esib model electromagnetic interference test receiver and spectrum analyzer manufactured by rohde schwarz we also understand that the iranian company hamim commercial offered shig pressure transducers and other equipment produced by hbm while this equipment is not controlled by the missile technology control regime mtcr it could be used in ballistic missile testing applications we do not know if the iranian intermediaries are already in possession of the rohde schwarz and hbm equipment but wanted to make you aware of the fact that irans missile program made specific requests for items manufactured by these german firms we also want to reiterate that shig often conducts its business through front companies and middlemen posing as end users given shigs interest in this equipment and the previous iranian efforts to acquire rohde schwarz and hbm equipment we wanted to share this latest information with you and urge you to continue your work to prevent these firms from acting even unwittingly as suppliers to shig and other iranian entities of proliferation concern we look forward to continuing our excellent cooperation on nonproliferation matters
