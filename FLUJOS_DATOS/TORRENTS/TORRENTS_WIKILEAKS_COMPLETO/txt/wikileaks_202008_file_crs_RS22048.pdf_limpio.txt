this report provides information on federal appropriations for everglades restoration nd discusses some issu related to the authorization and appr opriations for restoration projects it will be updated biannually introduction the florida everglades are unique network of subtropical wetlands that is now half its original size the federal government s had long history of involvement in the everglades beginning in the 1940s with the us army corps of engineers corps constructing flood control projects that shunt ed water away from the everglades many factors including these flood control proj ects and agricultural nd urban development have contributed the shrinking and altering of the wetlands ecosystem federal agencies began ecosystem restoration activities in the everglades more than 15 years ago but it was not until 2000 that the majority of rest oration activities becam coordinated under anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22048crs2 1 this figure represents the cost in oct 2004

completed once authorized the projects will be eligible to receive federal appropriations restoring the everglades is the largest investment in ecosystem restoration authorized by congress to date thus stak eholders in other rgescale restoration initiatives look to the everglades as model and test case some believe the types of activities funded and the level and conditions of funding for the

activities in the everglades ecosystem was provided for several years before cerps congressional approval funding cerp and noncerp activities for everglades restoration activities by the state of florida has exceeded federal funding every year since 1994 from fy1993 to fy2006 fede ral appropriations for rest oration activities in the everglades ecosystem were about 25 billi on dollars state

fy2006 state funding data was not available from fy1993 to fy 2000 average federal funding for restoration activities was about 159 million annually afte r the enactment of wrda 2000 both federal and state funding increased peaking in fy2002 at over 800 million from fy2001 to fy2006 average annual federa l funding was about 254 million an increase of approximately 100 million from earlier funding levels as previously noted cerp funding is s ubset of all everglades funding florida has primarily invested its cerp funds to acquire land and to plan and design restoration projects because the federal government is not responsible for land acquisition under cerp much of the federal f unding appropriated unde r cerp has been for planning and feasibility studies for restoration projects for example from fy2001 to fy2004 florida provided total of approximately 803 milli on for cerp activities while the federal government provided about 155 million although some argue that this disparity in funding violates the 5050 cost share the cost share agreement in wrda 2000 is interpreted by others to apply to the overall cerp effort not annually nor for each project this allows for

restoration plan raises concerns miami herald jan 14 2005 9 editorial two bushes and the everglades new york times nov 10 2004implementation issues related to funding key everglades funding issues during the 109th congress include the level of funding for restoration activities the authorization of new cerp projects and the role of the state and federal government in setting restoration pr iorities funding issues in the everglades are of interest to stakeholders representing largescale ecosystem restoration initiatives throughout the country the expense of othe r largescale restoration initiatives such as in the coastal louisiana estimated 14 billi on great lakes timated 20 billion and chesapeake bay estimated 15 billion is of ten compared to the cost of everglades restoration these comparisons however of ten do not distinguish among the differences in federal roles respons ibilities and cost shares for each of these efforts funding issue receiving broad attention is the level of commitme nt by the federal government in the everglades some observers measure commitment by the frequency and number of projects authorized under ce rp and the appropriations they receive because restoration project s have been authorized since wrda 2000 these observers are concerned that federal commitment to cerp implementation is waning others are waiting to gauge federal commitment by the provi sion of construction funding as the first projects break ground in the next few years some state and federal officials argue that federal funding will increase as cerp proj ects move beyond desig n into construction8 another issue is the role of the state in prioritizing restoration projects the current dominance of state funds has generated some c oncern that the state of florida is defining which everglades projects proceed9 some contend that state priorities may not be in the federal interest others argue that these concerns are unfounded because state funding is reflection of the states fina ncial responsibility for acquiring land early in the restoration process this concern was heightened when the state announced program acceler8 that aims to accelerate the st ates portion of funding desig n and construction of eight cerp projects most of the projects are for constructing reservoirs to collect excess water and maintain flood control others are for restoring bitat by fasttracking these projects the state contends that everglades restoration benefits will be realized s ooner and flood control and water cons ervation will functi on better these projects require congressional authorization be fore they can receive fe deral construction funding implementation of everglades restoration continues to evolve as some of the initial projects move into construction and s econd set of projects seek congressional authorization supporters of the everglades restoration effort and of other largescale restoration efforts in other part s of the country are watching to see if the federal financial commitment keeps pace with congressional aut horization the timeline outlined in cerp and the financial i nvestments by the state of florida
