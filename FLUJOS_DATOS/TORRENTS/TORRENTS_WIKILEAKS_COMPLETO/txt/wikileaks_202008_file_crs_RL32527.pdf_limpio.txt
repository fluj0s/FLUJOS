structure conceived in the 1950s when over theair broadcasting was the bestavailable technology for widely disseminating emergency alerts it is one of several federally managed warning systems the federal emergency management agency fema jointly administers eas with the federal communications commission fcc in cooperation with the national weather service nws an organization within the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the noaanws weather radio system has been upgraded to an allhazard warning capability measures to improve the noaa network and the new digital emergency alert system deas are ongoing the department of homeland security dhs working with the association of public television stations is implementing program that will disseminate national alert messages over digital broadcast airwaves using satellite and public tv broadcast towers this program referred to as the integrated public alert and warning system ipaws is part of the departments response to an executive order requiring the secretary of homeland security to meet specific requirements for an alert system as part of us policy legislation was passed at the end of the 109 th congress the warning alert and response network act or warn act as signed into law as title vi of pl 109347 to assure funding to public televison stations to install digital equipment to handle national alerts the law also required the establishment of committee to provide the fcc with recommendations regarding the transmittal of emergency alerts by commercial mobile service providers to their subscribers committee recommendations provided the structure for commercial mobile alert system cmas in addition to presidential alerts which clearly are federal responsibility the service would transmit emergency alerts generated by state local and other nonfederal authorities in the 110th congress s 1223 senator landrieu and its companion bill hr 2331 representative melancon would authorize funds to

alert system eas which relies primarily on broadcasting media and the noaa weather radio all hazards network the national weather service nws of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa1 sends alerts through noaa weather radio nwr now expanded to include warnings for all hazards several initiatives are underway within the federal government to improve expand and integrate existing warning systems the most important of thesein terms of using testing and developing leadingedge technologyis the integrated public alert and warning system ipaws publ icprivate partnership in which the department of homeland security dhs has leadership ro many communities meanwhile are installing local alert systems that send voice text messages and email many agree that the longterm goal for emergency alerts is to converge federal warning systems into an integrated network that can interface with localized warning systems and also call centers such as those used for 911 and 211 calls 2 in response to requirement in the warning alert and response network act or warn act as signed into law title vi of pl 109347 the federal communications commission fcc worked with commercial mobile service providers to create commercial mobile alert system cmas that would be able to relay alerts thr ough cell phones in addition to presidential alerts which clearly are federal responsibility the service would transmit emergency alerts generated by state local and other nonfederal authorities the national continuity programs directorate within the federal emergency management administration fema has accepted the responsibility of acting as gateway and aggregator of alerts for dissemination through cmas 3 the national continuity programs directorate is currently responsible for implementing ipaws as will be discussed in this report the emergenc alert system relies on many partners the role of the federal government has been to lead by reason of its prime responsibility to assure presidential alerts for national disasters alerts and warnings at the state and local level are disseminated through number of information channels the broadcasting of these alerts by television and radio stations is voluntary the national response framework nrf emphasizes the separate roles of state and local agencies and other nonfederal entities in disseminating alerts 4 there do not appear to be any efforts at the federal level to coordinate nrf planning for alerts and postdisaster information with state emergency communications committees seccs the differentiation between responsibilities to be assumed by federal agencies and those of statetriballocal authorities has in many cases led to problems with coordination and uneven effectiveness of eas utilization from state to state there have been expectations among state emergency managers state broadcaster associations and others who participate in eas program planning that the implementation of ipaws would provide the backbone for robust emergency alert capability at all levels the ipaws programs however has fallen behind schedule what appears to be retrenchment due to cutbacks in funding has led to nearexclusive focus on presidential alerts while programs at the state and local leveland to assist individuals 1 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa is an agency of the department of commerce 2 911 calls go to public safety answering points psaps 211 calls typically go to municipal call centers the role of call centers in providing warnings and information in

television and most cable television stations it origin ated as conelrad control of electromagnetic radiation in 1951 as part of americas response to the threat of nuclear attack in 1963 the system was opened to state and local participation through most of its existence the alert system was known as the emergency broadcast system the name was changed when the technology was upgraded and automated during the 1990s congress has placed responsibility for civil defense measures which include operation of the presentday eas at the national level with the director of the federal emergency management agency fema 7 now part of dhs the fcc has been designated by fema to manage broadcaster involvement in eas it currently pr ovides technical standards and support for eas rules for its operation and enforcement within the broadcasting and cable industries nonfederal eas operational plans are developed primarily at the state and local level the emergency response officials who typically initiate an ea s message for state or local emergency also work with fema the fcc requires states that have developed an eas plan to file the plans with the fcc not all states have fcccompliant eas plans that have been approved and reviewed by the fcc fema advisors often help to integrate eas usage into regional or state emergency response plans the decentralized process of eas coordination and implementation contributes to uneven planning for example procedures for initiating message and activating eas differ from state to state umbrella organizations that participate in eas planning and administration include the media security and reliability council an fcc advisory committee the primary entry point 8 advisory committee and associations such as the national association of broadcasters the national alliance of state broadcasters associations and individual state broadcasting associations states and localities organize emergency communications committees

current eas technology as specified by the fcc limit state or local eas message to more than two minutes emergency alert agreements with broadcasters therefore usually provide for both eas warning messages and followup broadcast programming g4g155g152g138g141g140g138g156g157g142g155g561g18g138g155g157g146g140g146g153g138g157g146g152g151g561 the participation of broadcast and cable stations in state and local emergency announcements is voluntary over 30 radio stations have been designated as national primary stations that are required to transmit presidentially initiated erts and messages the national primary stations form the backbone of the federallevel emergency alert system and are directly under the governance of fema in times of national emergency their broadcasts would be relayed by primary entry point pep stations to radio and television stations that rebroadcast the message to other broadcast and cable stations until all stations have been alerted this system of relaying eas messages is generally referred to as the daisy chain state and local emergency alerts enter the daisy chain through the peps which can include the national primary stations also referred to as presidential peps the fcc requires the states to initiate weekly or monthly tests it does not require testing at the national level there are therefore several levels of governance each of which uses different combinations of radio broadcast stations to initiate and transmit messages there is federal level for national alerts administered by fema using radio broadcast stations with equipment that conforms to fcc requirements there are state plans as described above and there can be local plans states in particular will use combinations of radio stations with different broadcast transmission coverage to match the configuration of their geographical areas one constant is that the fcc sets the requirements for equipment for all stations the fcc requires broadcast and cable stations to install fcccertified eas equipment as condition of licensing radio and television broadcast stations cable companies and wireless cable companies must participate cable companies serving communities of less than 5000 may be partially exempted from eas requirements for the broadcast of nonfederal emergency messages the fcc has ruled that the broadcasters not state or local authority have the final authority to transmit message 9 historically the level of cooperation from the broadcasting industry has been high for example because state and local governments are not required to upgrade to eascompatible equipmentand therefore may lack direct access to the technologybroadcasters often volunteer to manage the task of eas message initiation

november 10 2005 eas requirements have been expanded to include digital communications over directbroadcast televison and radio digital cable and directto home satellite television and radio companies using these media are required to install eas equipment to handle digital formats as part of the report and order the fcc asked for new round of comments on ways to improve and expand the current

uses coders and decoders to send data signals recognized as emergency messages in manual mode an eas alert is sent to broadcaster either over an eas encoder decoder or by other means such as telephone call where agreements have been put in place with broadcasters eas messages can be created and activated by state or local officials and transmitted automatically to the public without the intervention of broadcasting staff these automated messages are broadcast to the public using computergenerated voices all eas messages carry unique code which can be matched to codes embedded in transmitting equipment this authenticates the sender of the eas message to facilitate the transmittal of emergency messages messages are classified by types of events which also are coded these event codes speed the recognition and retransmittal process at broadcast stations for example tornado warning is tor evacuation immediate is evi civil emergency message is cem when message is received at the broadcast station it can be relayed to the public either as program interruption or for television as crawl at the bottom of the tv screen

g16g142g142g141g156g561 the fcc requires that eas messages be delivered in both audio and visual captions message boards other formats regular broadcasts about emergencies however do not have to comply with this requirement the community of disabled individuals therefore is often underserved when emergency information is disseminated ou tside the eas network although number of technologies exist to provide accessible formats for people with special needssuch as those with disabilities the elderly and those who do not understand englishmany of these solutions are not supported by the current eas system or are so expensive as to be inaccessible to most incorporating technologies that expand the reach of eas at reasonable cost is one of the challenges of delivering an effective warning system that is truly nationwide 11 g9g3g17g561g21g157g158g141g162g561 many aspects of the emergency alert system summarized in this report are discussed in detail in march 2007 report from the government accountability office gao12 the gao initiated study of the functioning of eas from the perspect ive of emergency preparedness in government operations based on its findings the gao has made recommendations to fema and the fcc for additional planning and greater involvement with stakeholders in particular the gao found that there were problems in the relay system that had not been identified in part because there is requirement for system test at the national level it also identified problems such as gaps in disaster planning and insufficient redundancy to ensure uninterrupted broadcasting nationwide dhs replied positively to the gaos report and recommendations and said that it would begin continued eb docket 04296 released november 10 2005 11 for discussion of the i ssue

digitized signal technology for eas is the sa as that used for the noaa weather radio nwr widely recognized as the backbone of public warning systems nwr broadcasts national weather service forecasts

standardized terminology and operating procedur in order to provide emergency alerts and information that reach the right people in timely manner in way that is meaningful and understood by all in 1999 fema and the depart ments of commerce and agriculture took the lead in multiagency working group to explore ways to create an allhazard warning network 24 their recommendations included using nwr as the backbone for national allhazard warning system and the establishment of permanent group to promote improvements in warning systems the following year the national scie nce and technology council at the white house sponsored report that explored the types of technologies and systems that are used or could be used for emergency alerts25 among its recommendations were the creation of publicprivate partnership that would bring all stakeholders together one or more working groups to address issues such as terminology technology locationspecific identifiers and costeffective warning systems system standardization and increasi ng the number of communications channels for warnings the report concluded that substantial improvements in early warning systems could be achieved through coordination and better use of existing technologies also in 2000 publicprivate multidisciplinary group was organized as the partnership for public warning ppw in 2002 the group received funding 26 to convene meetings and prepare comments regarding the homeland security advisory system hsas workshop findings were later expanded into recommendations in na tional strategy for integrated public
