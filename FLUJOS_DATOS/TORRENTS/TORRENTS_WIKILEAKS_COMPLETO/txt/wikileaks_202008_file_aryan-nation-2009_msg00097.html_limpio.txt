120902 0800from jewskillchristyahoocomsubject fw believeto jewskillchristyahoocom this will give you the chills good chills young man had been to wednesday night bible study the pastor had shared about listening to god and obeying the lords voice the young man couldnt help but wonder does god still speak to people after service he went out with some friends for coffee and pie and they discussed the message several different ones talked about how god had led them in different ways it was about ten oclock when the young man started driving home sitting in his car he just20began to pray godif you still speak to people speak to i will listen i will do my best to obey as he drove down the main street of his town he had the strangest thought to stop and buy gallon of milk he shook his head and said out loud god is that you he didnt get reply and started on toward home but again the thought buy gallon of milk the young man thought about samuel and how he didnt recognize the voice of god and how little samuel ran to eli okay god in case that is you i will buy the milk it didnt seem like too hard test of obedience he could always use the milk he stopped and purchased the gallon of milk and start ed off toward home 0 aas he passed seventh street he again felt the urge turn down that street this is crazy he thought and drove on past the intersection again he felt that he should turn down seventh street at the next intersection he turned back and headed down seventh brhalf jokingly he said out loud okay god i willhe drove several blocks when suddenly he felt like he should stop he pulled over to the curb and looked around he was in semicommercial area of town it wasnt the best but it wasnt the worst of neighborhoods either the businesses were closed and most of the houses looked dark like the people were already in bed again he sensed something go and give the milk to the people in the house across the street the young man looked at the house it was dark and it looked like the people were either gone or they were already asleep he started to open the door and then sat back in the car seat lord this is insane those people are asleep and if i wake them up they are going to be mad and i will look stupid again he felt like he should go and give the milk finally he opened the door okay god if this is you i will go to the door and i w ill give them the milk if you want to look like crazy person okay i want to be obedient i guess that will count for something but if they dont answer right away i am out of here he walked across the street and rang the bell he could hear some noise inside mans voice yelled out who is it what do you want then the door opened before the young man could get away the man was standing there in his jeans and tshirt he looked like he just got out of bed he had strange look on his face and he didnt seem too happy to have some stran ger standing on his doorstep what is it the young man thrust out the gallon of milk here i brought this to you the man took the milk and rushed down hallway then from down the hall came woman she took the milk and carried it toward the kitchen the man was following her holding baby the baby was crying the man had tears streaming down his face the man began speaking and half crying we were just praying we had some big bills this month and we ran out of mo ney we didnt have any milk for our baby i was just praying and asking god to show how to get some milk his wife in the kitchen yelled out i ask him to send an angel with some are you an angel the young man reached into his wallet and pulled out all the money he had on him and put in the mans hand he turned and walked back toward his car and the tears were streaming down his face he knew that god still answers prayers this is simple test if you believe that god i s alive and well send this to at least ten people and the person that sent it to you this is so true sometimes its the simplest things that god asks us to do that cause us if we are obedient to what hes asking to be able to hear his voice more clear than ever please listen and obey it will bless you and the world phil 413 this is an easy test you score 100 or zero its your choice if you arent ashamed to do th is please follow the directions jesus said if you are ashamed of i will be ashamed of you before my father not ashamedpass this on new
