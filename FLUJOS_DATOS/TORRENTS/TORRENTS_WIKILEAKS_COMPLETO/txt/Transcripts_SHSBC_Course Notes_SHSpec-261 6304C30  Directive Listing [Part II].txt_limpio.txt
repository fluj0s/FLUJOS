6304c30 shspec261 directive listing part ii finding the pattern of the gpm has been pure slaughter you have to hunt and punch around among various banks stirring everything up lrh was horrified in the past to find so many items he wondered if some were locks now it is all shaken out it is mysterious that the noun form declines into ity forms then the goal as an oppterm the goal declines through the same pattern all the way down through absolute and perfect into the ivities then you get to the end of the goal which doesnt decline mysteriously body weight and machinery get knocked around sometimes when doing directive listing it is the unrun items which slamming into the body increase the bodys mass this is one of the oldest findings in havingness processing like mockups being shoved into the body increasing the bodys weight partiallyrun gpm being in restimulation impinges on the body more than it did so you get more body weight mental mass and physical mass are the same stuff but mental mass is thinner gpm mass looks like steel shell or is sphere covered with black or grey cloud the mass on halfdischarged bank looks like grey cottonwool it has finite dimensions the mass alternates black banks and grey banks going back down the track black bank partly discharged turns greyish and murkybrown while there are still some items it shakes and shivers and tries to fall apart the best items are those that turn on little mass the first items off take off proportionally more charge than the later ones however leaving lower ris undischarged is dangerous because the lower items hold it all together and it will charge up again the top items are uncomfortable and upsetting but not that important the lowest oppterm is the keystone that keeps the bank in its channel because it is cross between the failed goal of the next gpm down and the one you are in that is how the goals stay in sequence what keeps the bank charged up is the goal when you reach the goal as an ri you cant just leave it you have to list what would oppose it but dont let the pc start to run what comes up as the item because it is the next bank and before going into it the pc has to come up to pt acknowledge it very thoroughly dont null the list go back to the top of the first bank you ran and find its goal find the opposite oppose and go on to pt it is always harder to go the other way going later rather than earlier but that is the way to do it the reason is that you are trying to clear the pc by obtaining for the pc the greatest possible auditing gains per unit of time it is mechanically true that the more items you get off the more banks you run the more charge you discharge the more the pc will cognite but we are running the pc under special conditions that you as scientologist recognize as special but that one else would see as out of the ordinary you are running thetan in body that just about ruins ninety percent of the things you could do you are auditing bank with frail human body interposed between the bank and the pc but you need the pcs body to hold onto the cans that is what has given lrh trouble in research the pc is put into danger in that you cant audit dead body end if the pc dropped his body half way through bank he would probably be sufficiently restimulated so that he would have trouble picking up new body he would keyout but he would feel betrayed because the hope factor was way up so auditing is monitored by the consideration of what gains you can achieve in spite of the fact that the pc has body between himself and the bank this is real problem the bank is capable of influencing the body that is why the emeter can be used the emeter is not connected up to the auditor but the auditor can accidentally start looking at or into his own bank to figure out the pc and kick in some restimulation the auditors bank and the pcs are on different wavelengths so they dont collide mest has wavelengths also someone whose wavelength is near to yours is someone you feel very close to soulmate you can influence each other more than average being both more pleasing and more irritating there is also the possibility of having known the other person before so there is thetan plus body plus bank the bank consists of free track that hasnt been drawn into the gpms all the goals all the gpms all the locks secondaries engrams and circuits then there is the thetan the body and the physical universe with all its ptps so in sense in auditing the pc you are auditing the whole physical universe and everything in it it is seldom necessary for the auditor to handle the pcs environment except when handling very neurotic or psychotic pc or pc with psychotic family if you were auditing thetan with body you could run him back to his earliest bank knock it out and then run off the later ones more easily the body gets in the way of this because when the thetan made his earliest bank he didnt have body and his adventures were more strenuous than body could take so you can make someone quite ill by chasing them down into early banks and badly handling them the body is useful adjunct though nuisance in some ways so you should safeguard it by staying with standard procedures whatever you come up with to run run it well with minimum of stress on the body what could you do to overstress the body you could fail to clear the bank you are working on and go off into other banks you could not run banks closer to pt before going earlier you could not try as far as possible to run bank from its extreme top to the bottom you could keep auditing the pc over and over finding nothing and not discharging the bank you could find wrong items and run wrong goals you could fail to follow the pattern but assume that your pc is different your pc simply wont rocket read well on some parts of the gpm it is just charge that prevents the right item from firing just as the pc has many goals and many banks he has many ris in one gpm instead of worrying about all the gpms there are to run you should be worrying about cleaning up the ris you have your hands on just as if you halfran half of the pcs banks so if you halfrun half the ris in bank the pc will sooner or later feel queasy the monitoring consideration is that you should audit what you have your hands on dont run r3 on pc audit the pc with r3 that goes for every auditing skill we have i never sec check pc i audit the pc with sec checking i dont find goals on pc i audit pc with goals finding if you keep that frame of reference you will win all the way with routine 3 it is almost possible to audit the pc with scarcely somatic if you use everything you are doing at the moment you are doing it to clear the pc of what you have your hands on it will go something like this the first ri takes 2 12 hours the next thirty ris take half an hour apiece the next thirty ris take twenty minutes apiece the next thirty take fifteen minutes apiece the next bank takes you 45 minutes to get your first rl half an hour each for the next halfdozen fifteen minutes each for the next thirty etc etc this happens because you are building on gradient scale the thetans confidence and leaving nothing behind you to worry about this state of affairs is attainable if you follow some rules say you have spent two sessions trying to get the top oppterm to fire youve still got the whole bottom of the gpm and various points to cut in where the pc can get rocket reads by auditing the lower parts of the gpm you could unburden the case and then progress forward you should be aware that you can always go down in bank matter how hard you try to list upward your first interest is to get charge off if you get charge off the pc can confront more now he can find that missing top oppterm youve got countless locks which will fire when you first enter bank any part of the goal anything will fire because you are looking at the whole mass and it is so crosscharged that anything will fire that makes the top oppterm the hardest to find after you have taken some charge off all these weird combinations dont fire the more bank the more things will fire and the more restimulated the pc will be in life details on directive listing procedure some pcs will have to be taught the language if they dont understand the words in the pattern eventually they will get the words
