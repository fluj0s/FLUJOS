preliminary injunction which following the appeal it made permanent decision which again panel of the ninth circuit affirmed humanitarian law project v united states department of justice 352 f3d 382 9th cir 2003 this second appellate decision was vacated in favor of an banc decision which announced that with respect to the appellants first amendment challenge to sections 302 and 303 of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 we affirm the district courts order dated october 2 2001 for the reasons set out in humanitarian law project v reno in light of congress recent amendment to the challenged statute the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 we affirm the judgment in part as set forth above vacate the judgment and injunction regarding the

about what aedpa prohibits with the use of the term personnel as it blurs the line between protected expression and unprotected conduct someone who advocates the cause of pkk could be seen as supplying them with personnel it even fits under the governments rubric of freeing up resources since having an independent advocate frees up members to engage in terrorist activities instead of advocacy but advocacy is pure speech protected by the first amendment in order to keep the statute from trenching on such advocacy the government urges that we read into it requirement that the activity prohibited be performed under the direction or control of the foreign terrorist organization while we may construe statute in such way as to avoid constitutional questions we are not authorized to rewrite the law so it will pass constitutional muster 205 f3d at 1137138 internal citations omitted 6 the term training fares little better again it is easy to imagine protected expression that falls within the bounds of this term for example plaintiff who wishes to instruct members of designated group on how to petition the united nations to give aid to their group could plausibly decide that such protected expression falls within the scope of the term training the government insists that the term is be st understood to forbid the imparting of skills to foreign terrorist organizations through training yet presumably th is definition would encompass teaching international law to continued

training means instruction or teaching designed to impart specific skill as opposed to general knowledge 18 usc 2339ab2 as explained by justice department witnesses the amendment would also add specific definition of training in response to the ninth circuits decision that this term too was unconstitutionally vague as an example the court opined that the term conceivably could include teaching members of foreign terrorist organizations to use international human rights laws to resolve conflicts in peaceful manner the amendment would alleviate such concerns by limiting the term training to instruction or teaching designed to impart specific skill as opposed to general knowledge 8 critics might argue that the attempted fix appears to turn on the dubious premise that effective advocacy eg peaceful conflict resolution through the use of human rights laws is not skill the same might be said of section 6603s new defi nition of expert advice or assistance plucked from the federal rules of evidence the term expert advice or assistance means advice or assistance derived from scientific technical or other specialized knowledge 18 usc 2339ab39 in the case of both terms however section 6603 may rely on its section 2339b first amendment disclaimer clause to answer the concern that the uncertain term might lead to prosecution of mere advocacy or other first amendment protected activitiesat least with regard to prosecutions under 2339b nothing in this section shall be construed or applied so as to abridge the exercise of rights guaranteed under the first amendment to the constitution of the united states 18 usc 2339bi 10 continued members of the designated organizations the result would be different if the term training were qualified to include only military training or training in terrorist activities 205 f3d at 1138 7 the court concludes that the term expert advice or assistance like the terms training and personnel is not sufficiently clear so as to allow persons of ordinary inte lligence reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited defendants have failed to adequately distinguish the provision of expert advice and assistance from the provision of training and personnel in way that allows the court to reconcile its prior finding that the terms training and personnel are impermissibly vague with finding that the term expert advice or assistance is not furthermore defendants contradictory arguments on the scope of the prohibition underscore the vagueness of the prohibition the expert advice or assistance plaintiffs seek to offer includes advocacy and associational activities protected by the first amendment which defendants concede are not prohibited under the usa patriot act despite this the usa patriot act places limitation on the type of expert advice and assistance which is prohibited and instead bans the provision of all expert advice and assistance regardless of its nature thus like the terms personnel and training expert advice or assistance could be construed to include unequivocally pure speech and advocacy protected by the first amendment or encompass first amendment protected activities humanitarian law

of evidence states if scientific technical or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine fact in issue witness qualified as an expert by knowledge skill experience training or education may testif thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise if 1 the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data 2 the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods and 3 the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case emphasis added 10 the decision to limit the disclaimer clause to section 2339b may have been influenced by the view that in some instances the uncertainty of the terms used to describe mat erial support or resources may be less troubling in section 2339a because of its more demanding knowledge requirement knowing or intending that the support or resources are to be used in preparation for or in carrying out violation of one or more expressly designated federal crimes continued

prohibition against providing personnel in section 2339b seems far more specific and to correspond more closely the courts concerns person may be prosecuted under this section in connection with the term personnel unless that person has knowingly provided attempted to provide or conspired to provide foreign terrorist organization with 1 or more individuals who may be or include himself to work under that terrorist organization s direction or control or to organize manage supervise or otherwise direct the operation of that organization individuals who act entirely independently of the

6603 addressed an ambiguity inherent in the earlier definition in its earlier form the definition of material support or resources in subsection 2339a included mixture of tangible things and other things that might more properly be considered benefits or services eg currency and training yet this defining mixture ended with the catchall phrase and other physical assets 18 usc 2339ab2000 ed section 6603 responded with an amendment to section 2339a stating that material support or resources covers services and other intangible property and that the specific types of property and services mentioned are simply examples 11 critics might contend that by eliminating the ambiguity in favor of the more sweeping construction property tangible or intangible or services including versus property or other physical assets the amendment is more likely to create than dissipate vagueness the first court to pass upon the constitutionality of section 6603s clarifying amendments gave them mixed grade section 6603 did cure the vagueness problems associated with use of the term personnel but the terms training and expert advice or assistance remain unconstitutionally vague notwithstanding the amendments in section 6603 the term service which section 6603 added to the definition of prohibited support or resources is itself unconstitutionally vague and the boilerplate fi rst amendment clause does nothing to supply greater clarity humanitarian law project v gonzales 380 fsupp2d 1134 1146 n20 cd cal 2005 the first amendment clause in the courts view is inadequate to cure potential vagueness issues because it does not clarify the prohibited conduct with sufficient definiteness for ordinary people id by the same token the court felt that for the average person with

of the foreign terrorist organization then constitutional problems exist 11 1 the term material support or resources means any property tangible or intangible or service including currency or monetary

little to clarify the mysteries of the term expert advice or assistance id at 1147 and even as amended by section 6603 the term training is not sufficiently clear so that persons of ordinary

section 2339b outlaws knowing violations narrowly construed this might serve as counterbalance for the suspect reach of the material support element the temporary amendment however added the caveat that to violate this paragraph person must have knowledge that the organization is designated terrorist organization as defined in subsection g6 that the organization has engaged or engages in terrorist activity as defined in section 212a3b of the immigration and nationality act or that the organization has engaged or engages in terrorism as defined in section 140d2 of the foreign relations authorization act fiscal years 1988 and 1989 18 usc 2339ba1 18 usc 2339ba1 justice department officials urged the adoption of the addition in order to avoid case law indicating that conviction would require either proof of knowledge of the specific facts that led to particular entity being designated terrorist organization or proof of knowledge that the assistance provided would be used for terrorist purposes 12 the change seems to foreclose those problems but it does little for any vagueness problems

section 2339b describes its overseas application more explicitly and more expansively than was once the case it permits federal prosecution of an act proscribed in section 2339b and committed entirely abroad by foreign national with greater connection to the united states required than that we have been able to bring the offender to this country for trial 18 usc 2339bd1d there is jurisdiction over an offense under subsection if d after the conduct required for the offense occurs an offender is brought into or found in the untied states even if the conduct required for the offense occurs outside the united states in its other modifications to jurisdiction section 6603 arguably did more than articulate more specifically the preexisting reach of section 2339b section 6603 removed the phrase within the 12 recently in the same decision in which it held the terms pers onnel and training to be unconstitutionally vague the ninth circuit also held that an individual to violate the material support statute either must have knowledge of an organizations designation as foreign terrorist organization or have knowledge of the unlawful activities that caused the organization to be so designated humanitarian law project 352 f3d at 400 unfortunately one could interpret the latter part of this requirement to mean that defendant must have knowledge of the facts contained in the generally classified internal state department documents which form the basis for the secretary of states decision to designate an organization as foreign terrorist organization additionally the united states district court for the middle district of florida earlier this year adopted an even stricter scienter standard concluding that the government must prove under the material support statutes that the defendant knew that his actions would further the illegal activities of an designated foreign terrorist organization see united states v alarian 308 fsupp2d 1322 mdfla 2004 senate

defective national defense materialinto the family of federal crimes of terrorism both crimes were already predicate offenses in section 2339a so it was unnecessary to introduce them into section
