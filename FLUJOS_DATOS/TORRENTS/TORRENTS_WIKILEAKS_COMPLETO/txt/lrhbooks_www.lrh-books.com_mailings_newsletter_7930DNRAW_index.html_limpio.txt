objective physical abnormalities discovered in patients by observant scientific physicians not subjective symptom complexes voted into existence and by prior agreement called diseases or chemical imbalances of the brain and telling someone that there is chemical imbalance in the brain can actually make things worse as person will then believe that there is something wrong with him that cant be helped dr baughman also stated that any abnormalities that have been found in the brain are due to the invariably braindamaging drugs all of their patients get put on and kept on none are due as they
