preventive po licies to confront the gang problem most agree that comprehensive regional approach to gangs is necessary to prevent further escalation of the problem the 110th congress has maintained an interest in crime and gang violence in central america and in the related activities of central american gangs in the united states1 congress has considered what level of us assistance is most appropriate to help central american countries combat gang activity and what types of programs are most effective in that effort in late j une 2008 congress provided increased country and regional

congress may consider as they continue to address aspects of us international antigang efforts defining gangs academics and other experts on gangs continue to debate the formal definition of the term

httpwwwusaidgovlocationslatin_ameri ca_caribbeandemocracygangshtmlsince most central american countries exhibit many of the risk factors that have been linked to high violent crime ra tes the regions current crime problems and related consequences are likely to tinue in the near future scholars have identified income inequality as the strongest predictor of violent crime rates central america along with southern africa and s outh america is one of the most unequal regions in the world7 unodc contends that cent ral american countries are particularly vulnerable to vi olent crime fueled by drug trafficking and corruption because they are geographically located be tween the worlds largest drug producing and drug consuming countries some 90 of the cocaine shipped from the andes to the united states flows through central america8 other traits that make some central american countries vulnerable to violent crime include highly urbanized populations growing youth populations hi gh unemployment rates widespread proliferation of firearms and legacy of prolonged civil conflicts low criminal justice capacity corruption and an absen ce of political will to fight crime in holistic manner have also hindered countries abilities to respond to violent crime9 scope of the gang problem in central america in recent years central american governments the media and many us officials have attributed large proportion of violent crime in the region to youth gangs or maras many of which have ties to the united states the major gangs operating in central america with ties to the united states are the 18th street gang also known as m18 and their main rival the mara salvatrucha ms13 the 18th street gang was formed by mexican youth in the rampart section of angeles in the 1960s who were not accepted into existing hispanic gangs it was the first hispanic gang to accept members from all races and to recruit members from other states ms13 was created during the 1980s by salvadorans in angeles who had fled the countrys civil conflict althoug h fbi officials have described ms13 as loosely structured street gang it is ex panding geographically throughout the region and becoming more organized and sophisticated10 estimates of the overall number of gang members in central america vary widely but the us southern command has placed that figure at around 70000 figure also cited by the united nations the gang problem is most severe in salvador honduras and gu atemala estimates of central american gang membership by country also vary considerably but unodc cites country membership totals of some 10500 in salvador 36000 in honduras and 14000httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34112crs4 11 testimony of general bantz j craddoc k commander us southern command before the

rica11 press reports and some current and fo rmer central american officials have blamed ms13 and other gangs for large percentage of violent crimes committed in those countries but some analysts asse rt that those claims may be exaggerated12 gang experts have argued that although gangs may be more visible than other criminal groups gang violence is only one part of broad spectrum of violence in central america13 in salvador for example officials have blamed gangs for 60 of all murders committe d annually but unodc contends that evidence to support that conclusion is lacking in guatem ala the regions of the country that have the highest murder rates tend to be those without significant gang presence but where organized criminal groups and narc otraffickers are particularly active14 although the actual percentage of homicides that can be attributed to gangs in central america remains contr oversial the gangs have been involved in broad array of other criminal activities those activities include kidnaping human trafficking drug auto and weapons smuggling gangs have also been involved in extortions of residents bus drivers and businessowners in major c ities throughout the region in san salvador for example gangs regularly demand that citizens pay war taxes failure to pay often results in harassm ent or violence by gang members there have been some reports of gang activity in mexico and along the us mexico border until hurricane stan h it in octobe r 2005 ms13 mbers were active in southern mexico where they often charged migrant smugglers to let their groups pass and sometimes worked in collabor ation with mexican drug cartels ms 13 members are reportedly bein g contracted on an adhoc basis by mexicos warring cartels to carry out revenge killings regional

and lack of educationa l and employment opportunities several organizations working directly with gang members have asserted that the combination of poverty social exclusi on and lack of educational and job opportunities for atrisk youth are perpetua ting the gang problem in honduras for example close to 30 of the population is youth ages 1524 those youth have very limited opportunities in country where so 65 of the population lives on less than 2 day and the unemployment ra was 25 in 2005 2007 world bank risk assessment for honduras states that the country has large numbers of unemployed youth who are not in school and unable to develop the skills required for attending university or obtaining skilled employment provide ready pool of gang recruits17 in the absence of familial and community support many marginalized youth have turned to gangs for social support source of livelihood and protection societal stigmas societal stigmas against gangs and gangdeportees from the united states have made the process of leaving gang extremely difficult recent state department report on youth gangs in salvador identifies religious conversion marriage enlistment in the milita ry or enrollment in substance abuse rehabilitation program as the few options available for those who seek to leave gang many organizations that work with former gang members particularly those with criminal records say that offender reen try is major problem in many countries exgang members report that employers are often unwilling to hire them tattooed former gang members especially returnin g deportees from the united states who are often native english speakers have d the most difficulty finding gainful employment in salv ador several hundred gang members have gone through complete tattoo removal l ong and expensive process wh ich many feel is necessary to better blend into salvadoran society18 role of the media many studies have observe d that sensationalist media coverage of the gang phenomenon in centra l america has contributed to sense of insecurity in the region and may have in advertently enhanced the reputation of the gangs portrayed for example 2006 usaid gangs assessment found that rival gangs in honduras often compete to see who can portray the most brutal andor delinquent activities in order to capture the most medi attention exaggerated media reports may have also contributed to th popular perception which has been backed by some politicians in guatemala honduras and salvador that youth gangs are responsible for the majority of violent cr

reforms initially proved to be way for central american leaders to show that they were cracking down on gangs recent studies have cast serious doubts on their effectiveness instead of focusing on law enforcement efforts aimed at capturing top gang leaders antigang initiatives in ma ny countries have emphasized rounding up any tattooed youth many of w hom were later released for lack of evidence against them for example salvadoran poli ce estimate that more than 10000 of some 14000 suspected gang members arrested in 2005 were later released for lack of evidence against them20 in response to these law enfo rcement strategies gangs are now changing their behavior to avoid tection many gang members are now hiding or removing their tattoos changing their dr ess and avoiding the use of hand signals making them harder to iden tify and arrest regional st udy partially funded by the united nations development pr ogram concluded that largely in response to recent law enforcement tactics gangs have deve loped into more sophisticated military and business organizations21 those findings are similar to the conclusions of 2006 regional study which asserted that the repressive policing techniques adopted by many central american governments ma have contributed to gangs becoming more organized and more violent22 us deportations to central america and the gang problem some analysts argue that us immig ration policy has exacerbated the gang problem in central america by the mid1990s the civil conflicts in central america had ended and the united states began deporting
