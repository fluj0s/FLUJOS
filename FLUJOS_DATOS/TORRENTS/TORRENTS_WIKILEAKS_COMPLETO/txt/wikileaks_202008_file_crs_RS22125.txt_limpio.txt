pose two clear compliance challenges to the treaty however some npt parties are adamant that the united states and other nuclear weapon states are not complying with their own obligations to pursue nuclear disarmament this report which will be updated as needed discusses different views and issues of npt compliance the may 2005 nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt review conference failed to produce any substantive agreements revealing fissures in the nonproliferation regime at time when the united states requires considerable support for its tailored approaches to countries and problems of proliferation concern in part the failure to make progress on the most pressing npt problems north korea iran and nuclear disarmament is rooted in longstanding differences in how npt compliance is viewed1 as they have in the past nuclear weapon states argued that the international regime needed to strengthen its ability to address the noncompliance of nonnuclear weapon states such as iran and north korea while nonnuclear weapon states argued that nuclear weapon states needed to better comply with their obligations to eventually disarm and to share the peaceful uses of the atom background the npt which entered into force in 1970 has often been described as grand bargain under the treaty nonnuclear weapon states agree to give up pursuit of nuclear weapons but not their pursuit of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy the main obligations of the nonnuclear weapon states are to foreswear nuclear weapons article ii submit to iaea safeguards inspections article iii and not supply certain nuclear 1 see crs report rl32857 the nuclear nonproliferation treaty review conference issues for congress and crs report rs21592 irans nuclear program recent developments congressional research service the library of congress crs2 related items unless they are under safeguards article iii2 the main obligations of the nuclear weapon states are not to transfer or help nonnuclear weapon states acquire nuclear weapons article i not to supply certain nuclearrelated items unless they are under safeguards article iii to facilitate the exchange of peaceful nuclear energy technology article iv and to pursue negotiations toward nuclear disarmament article vi the bifurcation of states into nuclear haves and havenots has led at times to opposing views on many aspects of treaty implementation for example some states would like to focus on whether the nuclear weapon states are complying with articles iv technical cooperation and vi nuclear disarmament of the treaty while other states would like to focus on whether the nonnuclear weapon states are complying with articles ii obligation not to develop or receive nuclear weapons and iii safeguards the npt itself is silent on how to assess compliance how to resolve compliance disputes and what procedures to follow in the event of noncompliance specifically there is verification of compliance with the obligations in articles i and ii not to transfer or receive nuclear weapons3 the treaty contains language on verification httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22125 other than to require states to accept nuclear safeguards article iii the director general of the international atomic energy agency iaea reports on safeguards implementation every year and sometimes on specific compliance issues at board of governors meetings4 for articles iv and vi the treaty offers definitions or ways of assessing whether states are living up to their obligations nuclear weapon states in the past have provided information about their nuclear cooperation efforts their contributions to the iaeas technical cooperation program and descriptions of their efforts toward nuclear disarmament at the 2000 npt review conference the parties agreed to what have become known as the 13 practical steps toward disarmament since 2000 the united states has withdrawn its support for some of those steps5 compliance vs verification all arms control treaties have obligations but not all have verification measures ie measures that help nations monitor activities and assess compliance with treaty obligations the biological weapons convention on the one hand obligates parties not to develop produce or stockpile biological agents or toxins but contains verification measures while the chemical weapons convention spells out verification measures in detail under the antiballistic missile treaty the united states and the soviet union 2 nuclear safeguards is system of inspections and reports for detecting and deterring diversion of nuclear material for use in nuclear weapons for nonnuclear weapon state parties to the npt this is formalized in fullscope safeguards agreements infcirc153 3 mason willrich

united states longer supports all 13 steps crs3 relied on national technical means eg satellite and overflight photography to verify compliance the intermediaterange nuclear forces inf treaty referred to both national technical means and onsite inspections and created verification commission to resolve disputes as noted above the npt requires comprehensive nuclear safeguards for nonnuclear weapon states the purpose of the safeguards is to verify the fulfillment of states obligations assumed under this treaty with view to preventing diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices6 safeguards briefly refer to system of inspections reports and accounting procedures designed to detect discrepancies between what state reports and what inspectors find7 there are publicly available guidelines for determining how serious safeguards violation might be there is automatic translation from safeguards violations into npt violations8 this may help explain why the iaea has found many discrepancies but has not yet formally found iran to be in noncompliance with its safeguards agreement article xii of the iaea statute contains procedures for reporting noncompliance httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22125 the inspectors shall report any noncompliance to the director general who shall thereupon transmit the report to the board of governors the board shall call upon the recipient state or states to remedy forthwith any noncompliance which it finds to have occurred the board shall report the noncompliance to all members and to the security council and general assembly of the united nations in the event of failure of the recipient state or states to take fully corrective action within reasonable time the board may take one or both of the following measures direct curtailment or suspension of assistance being provided by the agency or by member and call for the return of materials and equipment made available to the recipient member or group of members the agency may also in accordance with article xix suspend any non complying member from the exercise of the privileges and rights of membership9 key issue for many npt member states has been the lack of procedures for the security council to follow in the event of npt noncompliance in the case of north korea the iaea director general requested special inspection in february 1993 which north korea refused the iaea board of governors concluded on april 1 1993 that the north korea was in noncompliance and referred the matter to the security council on may 11 1993 the council called upon north korea to comply with the agreement the agreed framework ultimately was negotiated virtually suspending north koreas nuclear program for eight years when confronted by the united states with allegations of covert uranium enrichment program in october 2002 north korea announced it would withdraw from the npt in january 2003 on february 12 2003 the board of 6 treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons article iii1 7 discrepancies are measured in quantities significant quantity significant for nuclear weapons purposes is 8kg of plutonium239 and 25 kg of uranium235

security council the board called upon north korea to remedy urgently its noncompliance and fully cooperate with the agency the security council discussed the issue in april 2003 but did not take any action10 us ambassador jackie wolcott sanders offered this view of what the security council could do with respect to iran in march 2005 statement while the iaea must continue to have role in investigating irans past and ongoing nuclear activities and in monitoring its suspension pledge the security council has the authority to require and enforce suspension of irans enrichmentrelated and reprocessing activities in each of these areas the security council can support and reinforce the iaeas ability to pursue its investigations in iran until the agency can provide this board with all the necessary assurances it requires11 on september 24 2005 the iaea board of governors passed resolution gov200577 which concluded that iran was in noncompliance with its npt safeguards agreement the resolution is notable because it was not unanimous consensus is the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22125 norm and did not immediately refer the issue to the security council12 the iaea statute requires that once the board has made finding of noncompliance it must report it to the security council the resolution noted that the board would address the timing and content of the report required under article xiic of the statute reportedly several states wanted to keep the focus of efforts in vienna rather than in new york without the support of russia and china both of which have veto power at the security council referral to the security council could potentially be damaging rather than helpful according to the iaea statute if inspectors find state in noncompliance with its safeguards agreement they report that to the director general who informs the board of governors in the case of iran the dg did not declare iran to be in noncompliance with its safeguards agreement despite numerous discrepancies but concluded in september 2005 according to gov200567 that the agency is however still not in position to conclude that there are undeclared nuclear materials or activities in iran13 this opened the way for the board of governors to make noncompliance finding assessing compliance articles i ii in the nuclear nonproliferation report to congress section 601 report for 2004 the us secretary of state described iran as violating its safeguards 10 fact sheet on dprk nuclear safeguards international atomic energy agency see

derestricted september 24 2005 crs5 agreement with the iaea required under npt article iii andits npt article ii nonproliferation obligations14 this position infers that there is some way to find state in noncompliance with its article ii obligation not to acquire nuclear weapons however as noted above the npt is silent on how to assess article ii compliance other than through presumption that safeguards violation that is not corrected is evidence of states bad intentions us officials may have wanted to stress the seriousness of irans actions in the absence of the iaea calling iran into noncompliance but that rationale is probably moot after the september 24th resolution some press reports have created confusion on the scope of iaea responsibilities in verifying compliance with the npt in particular the director general mohamed elbaradei has been quoted several times that in the case of certain states he has evidence of nuclear weapons programs while those statements are undoubtedly true observers may erroneously conclude that the iaea must find evidence of nuclear weapons program before calling state into noncompliance the case of libya where officials turned over documents proving it sought nuclear weapons may be an exception rather than the rule15 despite hard evidence that libya sought nuclear weapons the iaea boards resolution on libyas noncompliance simply stated that libya had not httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22125 complied with its safeguards agreement the legal authority of the iaea at present is limited to the range of activities within negotiated safeguards agreements president bush proposed in february 2004 that the iaea form verification committee to ensure that the iaea is organized to take action when action is required in june 2005 the iaea established committee on safeguards and verification if the committee addresses as dg elbaradei has suggested areas such as information sharing emerging technologies enhancing the agencys independent analytical capabilities and ensuring that the agency has an adequate and uniform legal authority to conduct credible verification it is unlikely to branch out into monitoring weaponsrelated activities article iv in addition to stating the inalienable right of all parties to pursue peaceful uses of nuclear energy article iv says that all the parties to the treaty undertake to facilitate and have the right to participate in the fullest possible exchange of equipment materials and scientific and technological information for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy there are standards for measuring whether npt parties are meeting these article iv obligations for the fullest possible exchange during treaty negotiations the conventional wisdom was that the npt would provide favorable basis for the spread of peaceful nuclear technology and the united states recognized in article iv commitment to action by nuclear powersto contribute16 however that cooperation must also be in conformity with the articles i and ii obligations not to develop manufacture or transfer nuclear weapons technology some observers have questioned whether us nuclear cooperation with india proposed in july 2005 would 14 report to congress pursuant to section 601 of the nuclear nonproliferation act of 1978 as amended by the nuclear proliferation prevention act of 1994 for the year ending december

us arms control and disarmament agency documents on disarmament 1968 goldberg statement may 31 1968 p 416 crs6 contradict the principles the united states itself has set out for article iv cooperation that is compliance with articles i and ii of the treaty us officials have argued to make india an exception to nonproliferation norms in order to strengthen nonproliferation17 article vi similarly there are measures in the npt to verify compliance with the article vi obligation to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament and on treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control in 1967 us negotiators argued that it would not be feasible to incorporate specific obligations toward disarmament in the treaty itself the differences that have prevented agreement on these measures have not yet been resolved18 the 1995 and 2000 review conferences identified practical steps toward disarmament but there are still disagreements about the legal status of those steps and their implications for noncompliance assistant secretary of state stephen rademaker remarked in april 2005 that the 13 steps do not encapsulate the obligations of article vi in the npt the obligations of article vi are encapsulated in article vi19 the united states has reported on article vi implementation20 highlighting those steps it has taken to reduce the number of nuclear warheads in its deployed forces other states however complain of us httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22125 noncompliance because the united states continues to conduct research and development on new types of nuclear weapons and as yet has not accepted much deeper reductions
