nds on the nations resources and interest in their protection and allocation among multiple uses have increased the complexity of management the federal role in defining policy and institutional context shapes the combination of supported uses and protection measures certain themes are common to federal resource issues many conflicts center on balancing traditional versus alternativ uses and protection programs managing to produce nati onal or local benefits and supporting current or future resource consumption other challenges involve th effect of federal resource management on private lands fees for using federal resources and financ ing of management efforts interagency conflicts and overlaps and the coordina tion of federal state and local efforts also are comm on implementation problems for many reasons congress often confront s resource issues based on the natural resource in question lands and related resources oceans and coasts species and ecosystems or water federal land

value 2 for purposes of this report general definition of multiple use is the management of renewable resources so that they are used in th combination that best meet the needs of the american people general definition of sustainable yield is the achievement and maintenance in perpetuity of highlevel of regular output of renewable resources natural resources policy management institutions and issues natural resources the policy setting natural resource management remains significant issue for the federal government and the availability of particular natural resources such as energy resources can be matters of broad public concern1 natural resource availability represents both an opportunity and constraint for human activities local state and federal government po licies define the intertemporal distribution and use of the nations natural capital stock of soil minerals forests water fisheries etc growing demands and pressures for bot h resources and services from the nations resources plus heightened interest in how these resources are used have increased the complexity of their management nd administration resource management decisions have economic social and nvironmental implications which may be local national or international who decides how natural resources s hould be managed and how the decisions are made remain topics of debate the federal role in natural resource management continues to be contr oversial some stakeholders seek to maintain or enhance the federal role in resource management others support more local influence or international decisionma king in some cases often the resource issues debated in congress are focused on specific management tools and their effects eg changing grazing fees reforming mining laws restructuring the endangered species act rather than on broader goals and objectives of resource policies however debate on specific mana gement issues may encompass discussions of broad principles ch as the principles of multiple use and sustainable yield2 that underpin the management philosophies of some federal resource agencies and whether they rema in appropriate for the current demands constraints and values of resourceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33806crs2 historic resource management the united states is one of the few c ountries that possesses vast array of natural resources only canada russia and braz il have simila r endowments initially us policy focused on disposal of federal lands and use of resources to encourage settlement and development of the count ry several waves of conservation beginning in the 1870s began to shift this vision establishment of yellowstone as the first national park in 1872 and setting aside in 1891 of unreserved public timberlands as national forests for watershed protection were important early landmarks in developm ent of new policies through the 1950s government policie s and institutions largely favored regional resource users eg ra nchers miners loggers and irrigators for example the federal government often encouraged the settlement use and development of federal lands and resources at little cost to users in the 1960s more people began questioning the rationale behind federally supported re source use and the politics began to change due to two main fact ors the demand for recreation and amenity goods increased sharply and the envi ronmentalconservati on movement gained political momentum and increasingly sought judicial rulings in favor of greater protection these factors sh ifted policies away from thos that favored traditional resource users tension between traditi onal and alternative uses and protection programs remains prominent factor in the current debate over natural resource management management challenges bala ncing uses and sustainability certain themes are prevalent during cons ideration of many resource questions common themes include how to balance the tensions in multiuse management and protection programs whether resources should be managed to produce national or local benefits and how to balance current uses with future s upplies and opportunities conflicting views reflect diffe rent values needs and pe rceptions of the condition of resources and the sustainability of uses while specific management concerns are constantly in flux many of the concer ns fall under the same categories that have confronted policymakers for decades role of the federal governme nt in establishing policies interagency conflic ts and overlaps sources and levels of funding information and role of science and coordination of federal state and local efforts although these categories of issues are fa irly constant and broader questions of resource goals and manage ment objectives remain congress for many reasons typically confronts the resource issues ba sed on the natural resource in question lands and related resources oceans and coas ts species and ecosystems or water conflicting public values concerning federal and indian lands raise many questions and issues such as how much land the federal government should own how managers should balan ce conflicting uses eg grazing timber habitathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33806crs3 recreation whether congress should design ate specially protect ed areas and when and how agencies should collect and dist ribute fees for land and resource uses multiple use management is an approach to balancing use conflicts that can occur on federal lands federal land ownership and ma nagement continues to be controversial especially in some western states where the federal government owns half or more of the land congress continues to exa mine the multiuse land management through legislative proposals program oversight nd annual appropriations for the four major federal land management agencies ener gy production on federa l lands protection from wildfires range management and r ecreation have been at the forefront of congressional debates in rece nt congresses indian land issues include energy rightsofway across tribal lands especia lly the amount of compensation sought by indian tribes increasing use of coastal and marine res ources is driving proposals to alter the relationship between environmental protec tion and sustainable resource management recent reports note declines in marine resources and shortcomings in the fragmented and limited approaches to resource protection and management in federal and state waters further concern is the increasing pressures and conflicts that arise from economic activity associated with conti nued human population growth in coastal areas within coastal areas the most attr active and highestvalu ed properties often are the most hazardous exposed to the forces of wind and waves that accompany ocean storms hurricanes and tsunamis incr eased use of coastal and nearshore areas has promoted conflict with ocean energy development and production from outer continental shelf oil and gas platforms as well as wind farms current projections that sea levels will continue to rise will likely make co astal sites more hazardous in the future the numbers of animal and plant species facing possible extinction are rising and some of the ecosystems that they rely on are changing or degrading raising both speciesspecific and ecosystembased manage ment questions and challenges some stakeholders contend that species loss may have social and economic impacts and therefore assert that all species should be saved however others hold that the cost to society of protecting species with the im but not the certainty of saving them is substantial while the benefits are vague dwindling species are often indicators of habitat loss or altera tion habitat loss often results from development changes in land and water management practices competition from invasive species and other factors nearly all affected by economic political or social interests because of the tradeoffs inherent in species and ecosystem management decisions goals and objectives for species protec tion ecosystem restoration nd invasive species control remain controversial for example is recovery of all species listed under the endangered species act realistic goal similarly differences of opinion continue over the tradeoffs performance and expe nse of approaches being employed in restoration species protection and invasive species control fo r example can the multibillion dollar wetlands re storation proposals for coas tal louisiana restore the coastal ecosystem without requiring signif icant changes to the management of the mississippi river increasing pressures on the quality and quantity of availabl water supplies due to growing population environmenta l regulation instream species and ecosystem needs water source contamin ation agricultural water demand climatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33806crs4 variability and changing public interests have resulted in he ightened water use conflicts throughout the country particularly in the west the federal government has long history of involvement in water resource devel opment and management to facilitate water borne transportation expand irri gated agriculture reduce flood losses and more recently restore aquatic ecosystems although there is broad federal water policy congress makes decisions that define the federal role in the planning construction main tenance inspection and fi nancing of water resource projects congress makes these decisions w ithin the context of multiple and often conflicting objectives competing legal decisions and longestablished institutional mechanisms eg century old water rights contractual obligations etc hurricane katrina raised questions about the federal role in water resources in particular the disaster brought attention to the tradeoffs in benefits costs and risks of the current division of responsibilities among cal state and federal entities many resource debates are shaped by the availability of information on the resources consequently the role of sc ience is another common theme in resource discussions for example science is inst rumental in defining the uncertainty and potential extent and impact of climate change and weather on resource stocks and conditions similarly resources availa bility and abundance may represent both opportunities and hazards for ex ample drought and flooding natural resources management often is intertwined with issues in other policy areas for example relationships betw een natural resources management and environmental protection are evident in many issues such as groundwater contaminations effect on ru ral water supply crosscu tting issues are discussed in this report if the congressional cern revolves principally around resource conditions and supply simila rly debates on energy po licy encompass questions of access to energy resources and the impact of energy pr oduction on lands and resources while few energy resource issues are covered in this report information on energy policy broadly is contained in crs report rl31720 energy policy conceptual framewor k and continuing issues by robert bamberger many natural resource issues especially ones dealing w ith resource conditions and uses on private lands overlap with agricultural topics for information on

congress congress deals with natural resource issu on number of fronts key laws programs and issues are handled by several authorizing committees in the house and senate many issues invol ve several committees such as those involving wetlands protection and restoration in addition natural resource issues often are addressed during consideration of annua l appropriations bills for natural resource agencies programs and activities3 the 110th congress is likely to weigh whether federal funds for natural resources issues are adequate and focuse d on the appropriate resource priorities in many cases natural resource issues do not divide along clear party lines instead they may be split along ruralurban easternwestern coastal interior or upstreamdow nstream interests this section briefly discusses 31 select ed natural resource issues that the 110th congress may consider through oversight au thorizations or ppropriations the 31 issues have been grouped into five categories as follows federal and indian lands and resources natural hazards climate and earth science ocean and coastal affairs species management nd ecosystem protection water resources federal and indian lands and resources conceptual framework the federal govern ment manages about 650 million acres of land and resources about 29 of the 227 billion acres of land in the united states four agencies three in the department of the interior doi administer about 95 of federa l lands the forest service fs in the department of agriculture usda and the bureau of nd management blm fish and wildlife service fws and national park service nps the federal government through dois bureau of indian affairs bia so is responsible for the management of lands held in trust for indian tribes and individuals whether on and off reservations which cover an additional 56 million acres ownership of lands by the federal gove rnment has long ge nerated controversy and may continue to do so in the 110th congress key area of debate is how much land the federal government should own and hence whether some federal lands should be disposed to state or private ownership or whether additional land should be acquired for conservation open space nd other purposes for lands retained in federal ownership bates may involve whether to curtail or expand certain land designations or if current management procedures s hould be changed also the extent to which federal nds should be preserved made available for development or resource extraction or opened to recrea tional uses raises variety of resourceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33806crs6 policy matters especially with respect to preserving wildlife habitat designating wilderness areas grazing livestock harvesting timber and developing energy resources for instance congress may continue to consider whether to increase availability of onshore and offshore lands for energy and mineral development and if so under what if any restrictions mana gement of indian lands and resources also can be controversial and c ongress may be asked to addre ss land claims water rights fishing and energy and other development issues arctic oil arctic refuge anwr the future of the biological resources wilderness values and energy potential of northeastern aska has been debated in congress for more than 40 years question for the 110th congress is whether 1 to protect further the biological and wild erness resources of what is now the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr through statutory wilderness designation 2 to open portion of the refuge to devel opment of potentially the richest onshore oil source remaining in the united states and if so under what restrictions or 3 to maintain the current status of the area unless congress chooses to act the entire refuge will remain closed to devel opment under provisions of the 1980 alaska national interest lands conser vation act pl 96487 the 109th congress rejected inclusion of anwr development in omnibus energy legislation although the house approved separate bill to open the refuge to development an attempt to include anwr development in budget reconc iliation package was not successful federal land funding funding for federal lands continues to be contentious federal lands and natural resource programs compete against other federal priorities defense ducation etc as well as in ternally among the several land and resource management agencies pe rennial questions relate to the land and water conservation fund lwcf this account is credited with deposits of 900 million annually but funds can be spent onl when congress enacts appropriations congressional attention to this issue ma continue to center on 1 the amount to appropriate annually to each of the four eligible federa l land management agencies and to the state grant program 2 which lands should be acquired and 3 use of lwcf funds for purposes other than nd acquisition the primary context for debating these issues may be the annual inte rior appropriations legislation other policy questions for federal lands funding relate to setting fees for instance congress may oversee agency efforts to establish collect and distribute fees for recreation at federal lands and waters another key funding issue is compensa ting counties for the taxexempt status of federal lands appropriations for the primary compensation program payments in lieu of taxes pilt have not kept pace with the increasing authorized level the 110th congress may address pilt funding as part of annual interior appropriations legisl ation and proposals to provide permanent appropriations for pilt may again be introduced another compensation program the secure rural schools and community selfdeterminati on act pl 106393 was enacted to offset fs and blm payments that had declined due to lower timber sales this act expired at the end of fy2006 congress may consider legislation to reauthorize the program forests and fire management wildfires can kill firefighters burn homes threaten communities and destroy trees reducing fuels in the federal forests ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33806crs7 4 trust lands is general term covering trust lands strictly defined which are lands whose title is held by the federal government in trust for an indian tribe or individual and b restricted lands which are lands whose title is held by an indian tribe or individual but which cannot be sold or encumbered eg mort gaged without federal approval nontrust land is any land that is not trust landbeing undertaken to reduce the threats fro m fire although the threats are not limited to federal forests in december 2003 congress enacted the healthy forests restoration act p l 108148 to fac ilitate forest fuel re duction activities and for other purposes less directly re lated to wildfire protecti on legislation to expedite rehabilitation and recovery activities following significant forestaltering events such as major forest fires was bated but not enacted by the 109th congress the 110th congress is likely to consider oversight and authorization of fire programs the 110th congress also might address questi ons about the process as well as the level for federal firefighting fundi ng spending on fire suppression and preparation now account for nearly half of the fs budget and funds can be borrowed from any other fs account if suppression costs exceed appropriations repayment is contingent on subsequent ppropriations recent severe fire seasons have led to significant borrowing with imp lementation effects on other fs programs the bush administration has made several regulatory changes related to forest management public invol vement in fs planning and decision making environmental impacts of fs activities and fu reduction changes include categorical exclusions from analysis and documentation under the national environmental policy act nepa 42 usc 4321 4347 involving various activities including fuel reduction

16001616 et there continues to be substantial uncer tainty over manageme nt of the national forests and many of these regulations ve been challenged in court the 110th congress may conduct oversight of some of the regula tory changes and related litigation indian lands and resources american indian reservations trust and nontrust lands4 offreservation trust lands and alaska native corporation non

western states indian tribes assertion of water rights claims while based on reservation or trust lands may impinge heavily on nonindian wate r use many tribes are participating in water negotiations or adjudications with states local governments and other water users the 110th congress may be asked to consid er california montana and new mexico tribal water rights claims if settlements are reached fish and wildlife management on nonindian nds and waters involving for instance caribou in anwr see arctic oil arctic refuge anwr or salmon and other fish in the pacific ocean and the columbia klamath and trinity rivers also has given rise to fishing development and water rights controversies that c ongress has been asked to address numerous indian sacred s ites many perhaps most of which are not identified occur on federal lands to protect sacred sites indians have unsuccessfully sought legislation setting general restrictions on agencies management of federal lands for development recrea tion and other purposes and may again seek such legislation in the 110th congress onshore energy resources controversial ma nagement question is whether to increase availability of federal lands for energy and mineral development in the 110th congress oversight of the effectiv eness and enforcement of current laws regarding oil and gas producti on on federal lands is likely the us geological survey estimates that significant oil and gas resources exist below some onshore federal lands that are now offlimits to energy development particularly in the rocky mountain region industry and the bush admin istration contend that entry into some of these areas is necessary to ensure future domestic oil and natural gas supplies opponents maintain that there are environm ental costs associated with exploration and development and that the united stat could meet its energy needs through increased exploration elsewher and energy conservation the permitting process to drill also s come under scrutiny from industry and environmental groups the need to upda resource manage ment plans rmps5 is cited by blm as the major cause for permitting delays comprehensive energy legislation pl 10958 affects energy development on onshore federal lands with provisions to streamline the permitting process the law establishes the federal permit streamlining pilot project in seven blm field offices report due to congress in 2008 is to outline the results and advise whether national program ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33806crs9 appropriate additionally blm has implemented new management strategies intended to remove impediments and streamline the permitting process for developing onshore federal oil and gas resources during fy2006 blm processed 15 more applications for permit to drill apd and the number of permit applications rose by 29 over fy2005 environmental and outdoor groups assert that expediting the permitting process has b een detrimental to hunting fishing and protecting wildlife areas onshore mineral resources the 110th congress may consider whether to reform the general mining law of 1872 the law grants free access to individuals and corporations to prospect for mineral s in public domain lands and allows them upon making discovery to stake or locate claim on that deposit claim gives the holder the right to develop the minerals that may be patented to convey full title to the claimant however patent is not necessary to develop the minerals since fy2005 congress has imposed annual morato riums on mining claim patents continuing policy issue is whether this law should be reformed and if so how to balance mineral development with competing land uses the right to enter federal lands and fr eely prospect for and develop minerals is the feature of the claimpatent system th at draws the most vigorous support from the mining industry critics cons ider the claimpatent system giveaway of publicly owned resources because of the small amounts paid to maintain claim and to obtain patent also mineral pr oduction generally occurs wit hout paying royalties to the federal government unlike the oil and ga s leasing program on public lands key area of debate is whether to reform the general mining law of 1872 to include some form of royalty the lack of direct statutory authority for environmental protection under the 1872 law also has spurred reform proposals supporters of the current law contend that other laws provide ade quate environmental protection critics ssert that these general environmental require ments are inadequate to assure reclamation of mined areas and that the only effective approach to protecting lands from the adverse impacts of mining under the current system is to withdraw them from development under the mining law furt her critics charge that federal land managers lack regulatory authority over patented mining claims and that clear legal authority to assure adequate reclamation of mining sites is needed an additional policy issue is whether to respond to the mining industrys in terest in removing what they view as delays in issuing permits to develop minerals on federal lands park management and recreation the nps mission to provide for the public enjoyment of parklands while pr otecting park resources has fostered continuing management challenges the 110th congress may oversee implementation of re vised park manageme nt policies issued in 2006 congress also likely will address the adequacy of funds for the national park system for instance for general operations facilities maintenance and security nps continues to define and quantify its maintenance needs but the extent of progress toward eliminating the agencys multibillion dollar backlog of deferred maintenance remains unclear congress also funds and oversees nps effort s to enhance security for national icon parks and units along us borders furt her each congress typically considers many park

financial assistance to nati onal heritage areas nhas which are designated by congress but are not federally owned in vi ew of the large number 37 of existing nhas and considerable interest to study and designate additional areas congress may again consider whether to enact legi slation that would to provide consistent program criteria for nha designa tion management and funding recreation in park units as well as on bl m fs and other lands is focal point of debate over the management of federal lands primary topics of discussion include access for recreation generally and the effect of recreation especially motorized recreation on natural resources visitor ex perience and local economies specific nps conflicts center on snowmobiles in three yellowstone area parks air tour overflights and natural quiet at gr and canyon national park gcnp and implementation of the colorado river management plan for gcnp to allocate river access for commercial and noncomme rcial boaters while tr ail designation is often popular quantity quality and funding for tr ails may continue to pose management challenges for the nps and other federal agencies recreation issues also arise in other areas such as reservoirs and wa terways managed by the army corps of engineers and bureau of reclamation po tential subjects of congressional oversight include balancing recreational water needs and other purposes financing maintenance of recreational facilities and establishing fees for recreation at federal lands and waters rangelands management of federal rangela nds particularly by the blm and fs presents an array of policy matters fo r congress the federal grazing fee for private livestock grazing on federal lands has been controversial for decades instances of grazing on federal land without permit or payment of fees and agency actions to fine and jail owners and impound and sell tr espassing cattle also have been contentious federal rangeland cond ition is recurring interest for congress with differences over the effect of graz ing on rangelands and the location and amount of grazing overall and in specific allotments many view invasive and noxious weeds as an expanding threat to the health nd productivity of rangelands see invasive species restricting or eliminating grazing on some federal land because of environmental and recr eational concerns may again be considered these efforts are opposed by those who support ranching on the affected lands for lifestyle environmental and economic reasons some proposals have sought to compensate grazing permittees who voluntarily relinqui sh their permits while others would provide compensation when agency decisions reduce or eliminate permitted grazing another policy issue involves whether to c ontinue the automatic renewal of expiring grazing permits and leases with one w authorizing tempor ary renewal without environmental studies for those permits and leases expiring through fy2008 further congress may conduct oversight of changes blm made in 2006 to its grazing regulations in addition there is continued interest in blms management of wild horses and burros and efforts to remove them from the range to achieve appropriate management levels the doption and sales programs nd the slaughter of healthy animals have been of particular focus proposals may again be introduced to overturn the blms

protections that emphasize preserving areas in their natural state wilderness areas included in the system ge nerally cannot have permanent roads and structures and use of machines and mech anized travel generally are prohibited designating new wilderness areas thus can be controversial because it favors preservation values over uses requiring road s and motorized equipment units of the wilderness system can only be designated by congress many bills to designate wilderness areas typically are introduced in each congress more than 30 were introduced in the 109th congress and 5 were enacted the wilderness potential of many areas has been examined by blm under the federal land policy and mana gement act flpma these areas wilderness study areas wsas are all managed to preserve their wilderness characteristics regardless of whether blm recommend th em to be wilderness until congress designates them as wilderness or releases them for other uses wsas have raised legal questions including whether flpm allows the blm to conduct additional wilderness inventories or to create new wsas and whether legislation is needed to allow multiple use management of wsas not designated as wilderness in addition some blm lands do not include the headwate rs of water sources flowing through the land which may raise water rights and other issues as part of congressional consideration of designating blm wilderness areas management of the national forest roadless areas rema ins controversial the clinton administration promulgated nationwide rules to protect inventoried roadless areas in the national forest system by precluding most roads and timber harvesting critics have called these roadless rules facto wilderness management while supporters note that more roads and timber cutting were allowed under the rules than for areas in the national wilderness preservation system the validity of the clinton rules was litigated and implementation enjoined the bush administration finalized new rules that eliminated the nationwide approach returned management of roadless areas to the normal planning process for each forest unit and gave state governors the option to petition for protecting roadless areas in their states the bush rules made moot the litigation over the previous rules however separate litigation successfully challenged the bush rules leading to reinstatement of the clinton rules the bush administration has continued to implement the state petition process under the administrative procedure act the 110th congress may conduct oversight of agency rulemaking and rela ted litigati on and may consider gislation addressing roadless areas management natural hazards climate and earth science conceptual framework the costs of natural disasters in the united states are rising and the 110th congress may examine policies that mitigate risk to lessen or avert the financial social and physical impacts of disasters how the federal government addresses disasters may be complicated by potential impacts from changing climate in vulnerable regions of the united states for example lowlying coastal regions may be faced with rising s ea levels as well as the possibility of more intense or more frequent severe storms federal activities that enhance the nations ability to mitigate or protect against losses to communities and degradation of

national oceanic and atmospheric ad ministration noaa in the department of commerce provides weather forecasts conducts applied research and issues warnings that serve to protect against na tural hazards such as tsunamis other federal agencies also generate geospatia l data that contribut to new and updated hazard maps that help identify potential risks congress may consider whether authorization is needed to centralize geospatial data to enhance the nations capability to reduce the impacts of natural disaster s congress also may consider how changing climate affects the ability of th federal government to develop manage and protect the nation s natural resources climate and natural resources there is general scientific agreement that the climate is changing and that some pa rts of the country such as alaska may experience faster rates of change and more severe impacts the magnitude of climate change the rate of change the geographi c distribution of its impacts and whether particular impacts are beneficial or harmful remain key areas of uncertainty and research the 110th congress may examine how the federal government considers climate change in its decisions on how to develop manage and protect the nations resources changing climate may influence wide range of natural resource management issues higher temperatures and in some regions dryer conditions will have implications for some federal forests particularly their resistance to pest infestation and susceptibility to fire forest productivity also may be enhanced in some regions changing growing seasons and an intensif ying hydrologic cycle may affect the condition of federal rangel ands increasing or decreasing their productivity and nutritional quality and altering their susceptibility to invasive and noxious species for example rising sea levels could exacerbate challenges for coastal resource management sea level rise coupled with the potential for increased frequency and intensity of severe storms may complicate existing multiuse conflicts in coastal regions between human activities and protection of natural resources warming sea temperatures could for example lead to increased coral bleaching exacerbation of drought and flood threats changes in snowpack and snowmelt timing and other changes in water supply and availability may have multiple impacts both positive and negative on the sustainable use of the nations water re sources and operations of federal infrastructure similarly these changes to the hydrologic cycle sea level rise as well as other climaterelated factors may influence the performance of large scale ecosystem restoration ch as the 11 billion federalst ate effort to restore the florida everglades natural disaster mitigation an ongoing issue for congress is whether to modify the current federal role in natu ral disaster mitigati on federal activities programs and regulations that pertain to natural disaster mitigation and that enhance community sustainability include federal disaster assistance programs whose structure and administration are informed by mitigation principles both pre and postdisaster mitigation grant progra ms

of both the physical and social systems and interaction between them implementing policies to mitigate risk can avert or lessen the impact of natural hazards recent amendments to the robert t stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act may influence the role of mitigation in natural disaster management the 110th congress may evaluate the scope and effect of the amendments on mitigation mitigation of na tural hazards can include 1 structural measures such as construction of dams or making the structure more resistant or resilient to specific hazards such as wind or earthquakes through reinforcement retrofitting or modification and 2 non structural options such as land use regulation zoning laws nd building codes the 110th congress also may evaluate the effectiveness of two multiagency pr ograms the nationa l earthquake hazards reduction program and th national windstorm im pact reduction program the 110th congress also may address th rough legislation and oversight hurricane katrina recovery efforts c ongressional debates ove r policy choices are likely to be shaped by assessments of the longterm viability of investments in coastal louisiana as well as benefits and costs of mitigation activities such as levee construction and we tlands restoration mapping data mana gement and na tural hazards new and updated hazard maps can be generate d rapidly since the advent of electronic instruments that generate digital mapping da ta and the geographic information system gis which can manage and manipulate spatial geographic data these computergenerated maps can assist decisionma kers scientists engineers and emergency managers in identifying potential natural hazard risks such as of flooding seismic damages or landslides they can assist emergency managers in evacuating populations and governments and policy make rs in making informed decisions about future development and land use federal agencies are subject to governmentwide standards for spatial geographic data management including digital storage access and mapmaking the 110th congress might consider whether to authorize spatial data clearinghouse to centralize federal mapping data to facilitate access the clinton administration proposed national spatial data infrastructure the bush administration supports the geospatial onestop to make all federal geospatial data accessible on centralized website however the ad ministration has not requested dedicated funding for the initiative and appropr iations have not been provided fema operates largescale digita l mapping program the flood map modernization initiative the nationa l flood insurance program gave fema responsibility for identifying potential fl ood hazard risks and creating maps to enhance the awareness of such risks in emergency planning to inform land use and development and to determine national flood insurance requirements new flood maps and those requiring revision as fl ood risks change currently are produced digitally these maps are more accurate in defining flood risks and more precise in locating risks and potentially affected struct ures recent major floods in coastal and riverine areas of the northern gulf coas t states of louisiana and mississippi have increased demand for flood map updates so that affected communities can be assessed for flood insurance requirements the 110th congress may consider whether fema has the necessary resources and authorities to meet these demands andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33806crs14 whether the fmmi is keeping pace in iden tifying new flood risk and providing for updates elsewhere weather atmospheric research and environmental observations much of us weather and climate resear ch is performed by noaa question for congress is how to ensure continuity of noaas observations services and research some members support an or ganic act for noaa as way to organize vital oceanic and atmospheric research programs and protect funding for such programs human resources and facilities at the agency some noaa officials believe that such an act would limit the agencys flexibility to change its organizational structure to meet its changing mission noaas research supports ope rational activities such as weather forecasts and warnings noaas climate services advise us transportation and agricultural sectors on longterm weather outooks and

coastal and marine resources is increasing and congress may consider proposals that lter the relationship between resource use and protection two reports issued in 2004 by the pew oceans commission and the us commission on ocean policy noted declines in marine resources and shortcomings in the fragmented and limited approaches to resource protection and management in federa l and state waters both repor ts called for bold responses from congress and the administration the 109th congress considered legislation related to specific ocean and coastal issues and comprehensive bills encompassing broad array of management policy and institutional crosscutting concerns the combination of more information bout ocean and coastal issues new recommendations on how these issues might be addressed and expired authorities for appropriations to fund ocean programs may cause the 110th congress to give attention to these topics coastal resources the countrys coastal coun ties are only 17 of the land area but they are home to about 50 of the countrys population and jobs these people and jobs are most heavily concentrat ed along the highly desirable shoreline portion of most coastal counties where development can displace or disrupt beach systems wetlands estuaries and other highly productive natural systems many sustainability and multiuse pub lic policy issues in shore line areas involve conflicts between human activities and protection of natural systems these conflicts may increase in number and intensity as people nd jobs continue to concentrate in these portions of coastal counties hazardous natural forces strong winds large waves and flooding for example ar also most intense in these same shoreline areashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33806crs15 numerous hurricane landfalls in recent ears especially hurricane katrina in 2005 have brought the public polic challenges of expanding coastal development into sharper focus the coastal zone management program is the central federal effort for coordinating coastal development with natural resource management and policies the authorization for the programs appropr iations expired at the end of fy1999 and the 110th congress like earlier ones may consider reauthorization legislation and possibly changes that would address emerging issues this prog ram provides federal grants to assist states and territories in administering federally approved plans for development and protection statutory and regulatory guidance gives the 35 eligible states and territories considerable latitude as to which topics they emphasize the program also gives participants leverage over federal actions in or affecting the coastal zone by requiring those actions to be consistent with approved plans congress also may consider legislation for specific coastal and shoreline areas such as coastal louisiana and the great lakes and for specific resour ces such as coastal barrier beaches wetlands and estuaries many federal programs that apply more broadly have significant co astal components such as resource protection programs for seashore units of the national park sy stem and refuge units in the national wildlife refuge system and disaster tigation response programs such as the national flood insurance program fishery and marine mammal policy the two ocean policy reports discussed in the conceptual framework fo r this section expressed concern over us management and use of fish and mari ne mammals these reports recommended measures to address declining fish stoc ks to protect mari ne mammal populations and to improve the sustainability and competitiveness of the us commercial fishing industry the magnusonstevens fish ery conservation nd management act msfcma authorizes federal management of fishing in waters of the us exclusive economic zone beyond state ju risdiction to 200 miles offshore and was reauthorized in the closing hours of the 109th congress pl 109479 during the 110th congress action may focus on ove rsight of magnusonstevens act implementation as well as measures to protect and restore fishery habitat the marine mammal protection act mmpa prohibits taking of marine mammals unless permitte d under several programs aut horizations of appropriations for the mmpa have expired the 110th congress may consid er legislation to reauthorize and amend the mmpa incor porating some of th recommendations of the two ocean policy reports topics of debate for amending the mmpa could include modifying management of comme rcial fishing interactions robust wild stocks and captive marine ma mmals actions fostering international cooperation on managing marine ma mmal populations also may be considered discussions of regulatory changes may encompass subsistence use of marine mammals by native americans effects of underwater noise of human origin and incidental takes of marine mammals marine habitat protect ion and management there is growing recognition of the complex relationships among ocean uses marine environmental quality and marine resources as the variety and magnitude of human activities expand in the ocean estuaries and adj acent coastal areas environmental quality in some areas has declined and habitat has been altered related policy issues arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33806crs16 sometimes broad in scope because causes and impacts are numerous and diverse may occur over broad spatial nd temporal scales and ofte n involve local state and federal authorities for example impacts may involve relatively narrow issues such as potential impacts of active military sonar on marine mammals or broader concerns such as oil spill impacts on marine ecosystems the 110th congress may address variety of marine habitat protection and management issues issues of continuing interest include invasive species oil spills marine dead zones chemical weapons dis posal and cruise ship pollution invasive species concerns may focus on ballast wa ter management with continued oversight of national invasive species act implementati on several bills related to ballast water management received attention in the 109th congress but were not enacted another key issue is whether existing us laws adequately address cruise ship pollution the 110th congress also may consider control and monitoring of wastewater discharges from large passenger vessels although oil spill incidents and volume have decreased despite increased oil consumption congress may review the adequacy of response actions to oil spills there has been increasing support for the use of marine protected areas mpas to protect and manage ocean resources however mpas may restrict uses such as commercial and recreational fishing that provide economic and social benefits to local communities and the national economy the 110th congress may conduct oversight rela ted to the use of mpas and the adequacy of related federal law finally environmental activities of the coast guard such as enforcement also may be topic of congressional oversight ocean energy resources the combination of high oil prices technological advancement and tax incentiv is driving interest in increasing development of offshore energy resour ces offshore energy resources being considered include oil and gas on the oute r continental shelf ocs and proposals for wind energy along the midatlantic northeast and texas coasts the 110th congress may examine the balance between developing energy resources and other offshore uses such as commercial fish ing recreational boating and tourism offshore energy development raises questions about its effects on marine and air traffic navigation military and civilian radar and the nvironment congress also may consider federal regu latory and permitting respons ibilities for new

convention on the law of the sea remain pending before th senate committee on foreign relations the convention which established legal re gime governing activities on over and under the worlds oceans has entered into force with more than 150 states parties the united states is not party since receiving the tr eaty from the president in october 1994 thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33806crs18 committee held hearings in october 2003 and in february 2004 recommended that the senate give its advice nd consent to us adherence however the treaty was not considered by the full senate and was returned to the committee prerequisite for possible senate ac tion either to appr ove disapprove or not act on the treaty in the 110th congress is further committee consideration and its favorable recommendation for senate advice and consent to us adherence an issue is whether those who oppose us par ticipation in this convention might seek to prevent consideration the bush adminis tration supports us adherence as did the us commission on ocean policy and does the joint ocean commission initiative among assertions presented in support of us adherence participation would protect us interests during ongoi ng deliberations by the commission on the limits of the continental shelf which was created by the convention and enable the united states to submit its own limits and participation would enhance us efforts to amend the convention some opponent s to us adherence assert that participation in the conventi on would be contrary to us national security interests especially as the united states carries out its counterterro rism programs such as the proliferation security initiative opponents to adheren ce also maintain that concerns related to the parts of the convention that dealt with deep seabed resources beyond national jurisdiction and raised in 1982 by the reagan administration were not corrected by the 1994 agreement they are so concerned over the extent to which adherence would infringe on us sovereignty species management and ecosystem protection conceptual framework wildlife and their habitats are addressed by laws that generally aim to manage protect and restore species populations and the ecosystems upon which they depend for exam ple there are laws to protect species that face extinction by aiding their recovery and protecting habitat and certain agricultural conservation laws to conserve water quality and wildlife habitat the implementation of these laws sometimes generate s controversy because the needs of species and ecosystems sometime s conflict or are thought to conflict with other social and economic interests and uses these conflicts lead to calls to reassess programs and thei r implementation these laws address issues at both nati onal and local scales federal programs with nationallevel objectives generally have significant federal role in setting goals and objectives in contrast some programs with local or regional perspectives are developed and implemented w ith greater input from state and local governments and stakeholders balancing national and regional interests and multiple uses of the nations resources and ecosystem often pose challenges to implementing and governing wildlife and ecosystem programs and congress seeks to bridge competing interests the 110th congress may address these issu through oversight of the implementation progress nd funding of various wild life and ecosystem programs and laws regional issues regarding enda ngered and threatened species invasive species and ecosystem restoration initiatives as well as national issues such as wetlands protection and agri cultural conservation also may be considered ecosystem restoration in the last 25 years the united states has devoted substantial effort to and spent billions of dollars on restoring some large ecosystems such as the florida everglades the ches apeake bay and the san francisco bay andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33806crs19 sacramento and san joaquin rivers delta california baydelta many of these efforts have multiple objectives and benef its such as improving water supply and conveyance and managing natural resources and watersheds the 110th congress may address restorati onrelated policy issues at these and other locations policy issues range from the allocation of natural resources eg agricultural and municipal water to governance and funding of rest oration initiatives to the science supporting restoration the 110th congress may consider authorizing additional activities for ongoing ecosystem restoration efforts in the u pper mississippi river system puget sound great lakes also discussed in trans boundary water resources and coastal louisiana also discussed in wetlands pr otection and restoration for example the 110th congress may consider authorizing regional strategy for restoring the great lakes one proposal was releas ed in december 2005 calling for 20 billion investment in restoration over the next five years the 110th congress also may consider water resources development act see agency management and water resources policy which may contain provisions that authorize restoration activities in coastal louisiana and other regional ecosystems oversight of ecosystem restoration also may occur in the context of broader resource issues such as the potential impact of climate change on restoration activities endangered species the endangered species act of 1973 has been one of the more contentious environmental laws this may stem from its strict substantive provisions which can affect th use of both federal and nonfederal lands and resources under species of plants and animals can be listed as endangered or threatened according to assessments of their ri sk of extinction once species are listed powerful legal tools are available to aid their recovery and to protect their habitat also may be controversial because dwindling species usually are harbingers of resource scarcity or degr adation the most common reason to list species is habitat loss authorization for spending under expired on october 1 1992 the prohibitions and requirements of remain in force even in the absence of authorization and funds have been appropriated to implement the administrative provisions of in each subsequent fiscal year the 109th congress considered several proposals to amend policy questions expected to continue into the 110th congress include changes to the ro of science in decisionmaking changes to the definition extent and proce ss for designating critical habitat further protections for private property owners interests and incentives for increased landowner protection of listed species international species protection and conservation the united states is involved in conserving foreign species and natural areas through various laws and international treaties such as nd the convention on international trade in endangered species cites cites is an international agreement that aims to ensure that the trade in plants and animals does not threaten their survival the protects foreign endangered species by limiting or banning their import into the united states and implements cites overall has more comprehensive approach to foreign species protection than cites for example protects species based on several criteria that may threaten their survival whereas cites protects species based solely on the threat of trade to survival httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33806crs20 7 aid might include for example assistance in restoring water flow by removal of tamarisk trees improving forage by controlling toxic pl ants and protecting native fishes by removing snakehead fish in the chesapeake baythe 110th congress may conduct oversight on the implementation of as it relates to the listing and protection of foreign threatened and endangered species the fourteenth meeting of the conference of the parties under cites is set for june 2007 and congress may hold hearings to addre ss potential issues of discussion at the conference international protection manageme nt and sustainability issues for congressional oversight may include the implementation of the tropical forest conservation act illegal logging activities and the conservation of international fisheries the united states also assists in the conservation of some highvisibility foreign species eg tigers and elephants by providing funds for conserving their populations and habitat through the multin ational species conservation fund the united states further promotes the conser vation of tropical forests in developing countries most notably through debtfo rnature transactions under the tropical forest conservation act invasive species nonnative species introduced accidentally or intentionally can cause both ecologi cal and economic damage the 110th congress may weigh whether new legislative author ities and additional funding are needed to address issues of nonnative species nd their increasing economic and ecological impacts major unanswered question is who should be responsible for ensuring economic integrity and ecolo gical stability in response to the actual or potential impacts of nonnative species in addition to the possible aid to natural resources previously damaged by nonnative species7 legislation could help or harm many economic interests including domestic and in ternational trade and tourism industries dependent on bringing in nonnative speci and those dependent on keeping them out additional policy consid erations include the balance between prevention and response overlapping jurisdiction of congressional committees and coordination of the many agencies and levels of gove rnment dealing with invasive species the congressional response to problem s posed by harmful nonnative species generally has been to address specific non native species such as brown tree snakes on guam and impure seed stocks few notable efforts have begun to address specific pathways eg ship ballast water through the nonindigenous aquatic nuisance prevention and control act but current law addresses the general concern over nonnative species and the wide variety of paths by which they enter this country in the 109th congress while hearings we re held on several invasive species matters committee action focused on ballast water and invasive carp species private land conservation natural resource ma nagement and policy challenges related to private lands that attract congressional attention are many and varied some center on the effects of private land uses on natural resources especially on agricultural lands in rural areas agricultural pr oduction occ upies about 41 of the land in the coterminous ited states according to the national agricultural statistics service in the depa rtment of agriculture usda production techniques can contribute to resource probl ems such as soil erosion pesticide andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33806crs21 nutrient runoff air pollution and loss of wildlife habitat usda administers voluntary programs which provide technical assistance costshared funds education and research to help farmers address thes problems some programs pay producers to retire lands from production that have high resource values such as wetlands while other programs help producers grow crops in ways that protect resources or environmental conditions usda has initiated program to more precisely measure the resource and environmental accomplishm ents of conservation programs many of these conservation programs ex pire at the end of fy2007 the 110th congress may consider whether and in what form to reauthorize them during the farm bill another resource challenge is associated with residential nd other development in rural areas that are within commuting distance of cities this development can contribute to declines in habitat nd environmental quality although this development is largely managed by local and state governments congress can act to limit guide or foster growth through prog rams that help fund construction of roads sewer and water infrastructure and public facilities congress also can influence landowner choices by providi ng federal funds to ac quire easements on land to maintain its habitat far mland or other desired uses and through tax policies that reward individuals who take specified land or resource conserving actions growth also could be addressed in m easures that designate sites for particular uses or forms of protection or that provide guidan ce for federal project s and facilities resource management and use conflicts can occur when private and public ownership abut at these locations nd use and resource protection goals may be incompatible leading to conflicts over such topics as weed and predator control and habitat for species at the same time pr ivate landowners ofte n contend that public land management is inconsis tent with their goals and managers are unresponsive to their concerns congress has discussed so of these topics largely on caseby case basis but may look for systematic policy responses when addressing larger areas such as watersheds landscapes or ecosystems wetlands protection and restoration the coterminous united states now has about 108 million acres of wetlands less than half of the estimated 220 million acres that were present when the europeans arrived according to 2006 fish and wildlife service survey these reducti ons were encouraged by federal policies in place through the late 1970s because wetla nds were viewed as having little use or value these policies encouraged conversi on to other uses primarily agricultural production during the past 25 years fede ral policies have b een revised and now seek to retain and restore wetlands for their many resource values starting with george h w bush presidents have articul ated goal of either nonetloss or net gain of wetlands the current bush administration announced wetland protection as priority during the current term with goal of restoring or improving 3 million acres the 110th congress may continue past effort s to encourage wetlands protection however the emphasis may change from recent congresses which focused on conflicts between the rights of landowners and protection efforts almost 75 of all wetlands are on private lands the 110th congress may hold oversight hearings on topics including the implementation of the permit program under 404 of the clean water act by the army corps of engi neers federal acquisition and easement programs and the role of wetlands in largescale restorations in the floridahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33806crs22 everglades and elsewhere perennial issues involve changes in wetland acreage including where wetlands are being lost or gained how differe nt types of wetlands are affected by protection efforts and the effectiveness of various protection approaches and programs ecosystem re storation in coastal louisiana which involves restoring existing wetlands and cr eating new ones has attracted increased interest since hurricane katrina in 2005 wetlands are believed to play important roles in buffering developed coastal areas from some storm surges wild birds and bird flu avian influenza is virus that primarily infects birds both domestic and wild certain strain s of avian flu break the avian barrier and have been known to infect other animals and humans avian flu viruses are common among wild bird populations which act as reservoir for the disease while rarely fatal in wild birds avian flu is highly contagious in domestic poultry prompting strict biosecurity measures on farms strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza h5n1 has spread throughout asia since 2003 infecting mostly poultry some wild birds and limited number of humans through cl ose domestic poultrytohuman contact the mortality rate among the more th an 250 people infected so far has ex ceeded 50 fears that the virus could mutate to allow efficient humantohuman transmission and cause human pandemic have prompted global political and public health response the virus reached europe in 2005 and the middle east and africa in early 2006 veterinary and medical health official s believed the highly pathogenic strain might enter north america in the summer of 2006 with the arrival of asymptomatic wild breeding birds which had spent the wi nter of 20052006 in southern asia or the tropical pacific because wild birds are relatively resistant and reports of deaths among wild birds due to avian flu are very rare testing is essential to any detection effort as result of the threat several federal agencies including the fish and wildlife service and the us geological survey in doi and state tribal and local governments increased surveillance among wild birds for the highly pathogenic h5n1 virus in 2006 though the surveys occasionally detected different low pathogenicity strain of h5n1 among thes bird populations the highly pathogenic strain has not yet been detected the low pathogenicity strain does not pose the same threat as highly pathogenic h5n1 the c ontinued testing of wild birds is expected to be major effort in coming years oversight of agency priorities and activities as well as funding levels for the federal program might be issues during the 110th congress water resources conceptual framework the federal government has had long history of involvement in surface water resource issu from assisting with navigation and defense activities in the early days of th republic to later assisting states and localities with development projects for irrigation flood control and hydropower while the federal government has traditionally deferred to the states on issues of surface water allocation and use ie how much water may be used and where numerous federal statutes and federally constructed and owned facilities affect allocation decisions and overall manage ment of the nations surface waters groundwater management has b een left primarily to stat although federal statutes apply to its use for drinking water supplies and seek to protect its quality httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33806crs23 the 110th congress is faced with numerous decisions about the nations water resources ranging from sitesp ecific project authorizations to changes in the federal role in water resources management congress plays major role in water resources through its authorizations of and appr opriations for regional and sitespecific activities congress makes these decisions within the context of multiple and often conflicting objectives competing legal decisions and longestablished institutional mechanisms eg centuryold water rights contractual obligations etc federal water resources planning management and development activities are spread among several congressional committees and among many federal departments agencies and bureaus because of growing tensi ons related to water allocation and use changes in river management concerns bout flood risk and the viability of existing and new water projects the 110th congress is likely to face many water resources issues bills that were acted on but not enacted in the 109th congress water resources development act wrda wate r reuse program and projectspecific legislation bills related to legal settlement on san joa quin river ca restoration and more may receive attention during the 110th congress agency management and water resources policy federal water resource construction activities shrank during the last decades of the 20th century fiscal constraints changes in national priorities and local needs few remaining prime construction locations and environmental and species impacts of construction all contributed to this shift although these forces are still active there are proposals for greater federal financial nd technical assistance to address growing pressures on developed water supp lies and to manage regional water resources to meet demands of multiple water uses the 110th congress may consider authoriz ing hundreds of sitespecific army corps of engineers corps projects through wrda prominent policy issues in the wrda debate are independent review requirements for corps studies and
