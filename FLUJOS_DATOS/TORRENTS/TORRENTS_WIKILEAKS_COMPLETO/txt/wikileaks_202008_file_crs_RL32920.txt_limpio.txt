management memorandum feb 5 2004 crs6 environmental protection agency21 homeland security presidential directive 7 hpsd7 affirmed epa as the lead federal agency for coordinating the protection of the nations critical infrastructure for the water sector to carry out its water sector responsibilities epa has established water security division within the office of ground water and drinking water this division works with drinking water and wastewater utilities states tribes and other stakeholders to improve the security of these utilities and improve their ability to respond to security threats and breaches among its responsibilities and activities the water security division provides security and antiterrorismrelated technical assistance and training to the water sector epas water security division generally does not perform the training itself it delivers training at locations across the country through stakeholder organizations and other federal partners22 epa has sponsored training on variety of security topics including courses to help community water systems prepare vulnerability assessments and emergency response plans as required by the bioterrorism act pl 10718823 epa has entered into an interagency agreement with the office of domestic preparedness odp within dhs under which odp has provided emergency response training for medium and large drinking water utilities first responders and local elected officials24 to assist smaller drinking water utilities not covered by the bioterrorism act epa has provided funding to the national rural water association to deliver security training epa continues to support vulnerability assessment training for wastewater utilities for example during 2005 vulnerability assessment and emergency response training is being offered through the water environment federation to roughly 600 medium and small wastewater utilities epa also is providing money to training centers that provide technical assistance to very small wastewater utilities and is funding gt to provide emergency response tabletop exercise training to large wastewater utilities other securityrelated training activities sponsored by the water 21 information provided by linda jo schierow and mary tiemann specialists in environmental policy resources science and industry division 22 organizations that provide security training include professional associations such as the american water works association awwa the water environment federation wef and the national rural water association nrwa congress has provided some grant funds to these organizations through epa to support their water security training activities 23 title iv of the bioterrorism act 42 usc 300i amended the safe drinking water act to require each community water system serving more than 3300 individuals to conduct an assessment of the systems vulnerability to terrorist attacks or other intentional acts to disrupt the provision of safe and reliable drinking water supply these drinking water systems must submit copy of the assessment to epa the act also requires these systems to prepare emergency response plans incorporating the results of the vulnerability assessments later than six months after completing the assessments all utilities covered by the act were to have completed vulnerability assessments by june 30 2004 the last statutory deadline for systems to complete emergency response plans was december 31 2004 24 because most water and wastewater utilities are municipally owned epa has made an effort to involve locally elected officials in first responder training courses crs7 security division have included trainthetrainer workshops and training on emergency responses to threats of intentional contamination of water supplies during this year the water security division plans to continue providing tools and technical assistance to help utilities address identified risks as well as training on emergency response and best security practices homeland security presidential directives require federal agencies to provide full and prompt cooperation resources and support consistent with their responsibilities under law to dhs in the event of terrorist threat or attack epa has responsibilities under the comprehensive emergency response compensation and liability act cercla or superfund for responding to substantial releases of hazardous chemicals when they affect inland ie nonmarine environments the epa office of superfund remediation and technology innovations environmental response team responds to thousands of such releases annually the environmental response training program shares epas expertise in recognizing evaluating and controlling releases of hazardous chemicals through four courses for federal employees and contractors and for first responders at the state and local levels of government new course in air monitoring for emergency responders is soon to be offered the other three courses predate the terrorist acts of 2001 but they have been modified somewhat to incorporate information relevant to terrorism all four courses are offered at various locations within the 10 epa regions department of health and human services25 counterterrorism training programs supported by the department of health and human services hhs are aimed at variety of public health and healthcare providers individuals who provide ancillary health services such as laboratory testing and researchers who study health effects from or countermeasures to biological chemical and radiological agents training programs have variety of intended purposes including assuring the ability to recognize and treat victims of terrorist events protecting workers and others from infection or contamination while care is rendered protecting and assuring the continuity of operation of critical healthcare assets maintaining electronic and other lines of communication during catastrophic events assuring competent laboratory services and assuring the protection of certain assets such as radioactive materials or biological organisms against misuse each of the hhs agencies listed below has responsibility for funding and administering specific training programs and assets rather than listing many specific courses and publications the following sections will instead focus on each agencys role in supporting an infrastructure to develop and deliver training in some cases federal state and local agencies have funded course development and delivery through academic institutions in other cases agencies have expanded their training sites including laboratories bolstered their information technology infrastructure for distance learning and enhanced their training workforce some hhs training programs particularly those in the office of the secretary and the centers for disease control and prevention cdc utilize dhs training assets such as the fema emi and fletc in addition

commissioned corps of the us public health service usphs and the medical reserve corps the usphs commissioned corps is uniformed but not armed service of the us government headed by the surgeon general and comprised of approximately 6000 officers representing number of health professions26 corps officers are typically placed in various hhs agencies or in state health departments but can be deployed to respond to emergencies the medical reserve corps is communitybased network of emergency response volunteers whose training and other readiness activities are partly financed with federal

urban areas and serve key economic financial and governmental centers of the nation they move over 14 million passengers daily and in one month they transport more passengers than us airlines move in year since these systems are operated in an open environment they are highrisk highconsequence targets for terrorists rail transit subways travel under key government buildings business centers and

counterterrorism training courses are available to transit system administrators operators managers and emergency responders issues the primary stakeholders in responding to terrorist attacks and thus the recipients of counterterrorism training are federal state and local governments private and public medical systems and critical infrastructure administrators in the evolution of counterterrorism training number of issues have arisen among which are possible duplication of training programs allocation of dhs training funding prioritizing attendance potential redundancy and consolidation of dhs training programs these issues and possible oversight approaches available to congress are discussed below crs takes position with respect to any of the possible approaches listed duplication of counterterrorism training because of the rapid evolution of counterterrorism training programs offered by different federal departments and agencies there may be duplication of certain types of training provided to federal state and local government personnel emergency responders and critical infrastructure facility personnel for example dhs hhs and epa all offer training related to responding to hazardous material incidents it is possible that training provided by dhs dod doj dot epa and hhs to first responders is not coordinated and that federal effort should be made to ensure these federal entities provide coordinated nonduplicative training possible oversight approaches could include status quo congress might decide that federal counterterrorism training programs for federal state and local emergency responders do not warrant congressional oversight at this time arguably this option could leave congress with limited systematic information about the extent of any duplication and the potential need for interagency coordination of training government accountability office gao evaluation of programs congress could ask gao to undertake an evaluation of all federal counterterrorism training programs gao could be asked to review individual courses training curricula training audiences and training facilities after conducting review of these courses gao might be able to identify any duplication of training and possible 42 ibid 43 ibid crs13 alternatives for consolidating or coordinating this training this option would require congress to work with gao to set mutually acceptable scope and time for the evaluation interagency task force congress might direct through statutory and conference language the federal departments and agencies that provide counter terrorism training to establish an interagency task force to review their counter terrorism programs because of the lead role dhs provides in counterterrorism training congress could consider directing dhs to chair the task force once the training has been reviewed the task force could be directed to coordinate and consolidate the training as necessary this option however could result in turf disputes and federal departments and agencies attempting to protect training programs and the funding associated with them allocation of counterterrorism training funding and prioritizing attendance state and local governments receive counterterrorism training funding through the dhs homeland security grant program hsgp44 two sub grants within hsgp the state homeland security grant program shsgp and the urban area security initiative uasi provide funds to be used for counterterrorism and homeland security training of first responders state and local government personnel and emergency managers the allocation method for fy2006 dhs grants differs from that of earlier years in fy2003 and fy2004 congress required dhs to allocate 07545 of total appropriations for shsgp and letpp46 to each state with the remainder of total appropriations to be allocated at the discretion of dhs47 dhs chose to use the states population percentage of the national population as the basis for this secondary distribution and to distribute base amount of 025 to us insular areas congress required dhs to allocate fy2005 shsgp and letpp grants in the same manner as in fy200448 dhs is also changing the distribution method for uasi in fy2006 in fy2003 fy2005 uasi discretionary allocations were distributed using credible threat presence of critical infrastructure vulnerability population population density law enforcement investigative and enforcement activity and the existence of formal mutual aid agreements as funding formula factors49 in fy2006 dhs intends to 44 for more

formula dhs also intends to group major jurisdictions into single urban areas requiring grouped jurisdictions to determine allocations within the urban areas eleven urban areas that received uasi funding in fy2005 are not eligible to apply for funding for new homeland security projects but they may apply for sustainment funding to complete homeland security projects begun in previous years finally dhs intends to authorize urban areas to apply for funding for homeland security projects that have dualuse for terrorist incidents or natural disasters capabilities such as evacuations and search and rescue teams50 critics of the present funding distribution method including some members of congress and the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states have stated that the funding distribution methods used to provide federal homeland security assistance to states and localities are inadequate and unfair51 the issue of allocation of dhs counterterrorism training funding is part of larger issue the distribution of federal homeland security funding to states and localities52 the allocation of counterterrorism training funding however presents some policy questions that can be addressed separately from the issue of federal homeland security assistance distribution it could be argued that every state should receive minimum amount of homeland security funding but that not every state and locality can receive priority in counterterrorism training terrorism intelligence may identify one state or locality at greater risk of attacks whereas other locations may not be at the same risk some states and localities may have greater risk of terrorist attacks due to their population density or critical infrastructure additionally it could be argued that state or locality should not receive training funding that would allow first responders government officials and emergency managers to attend counter terrorism training that would not enhance their preparedness because the state or 49 continued 2005 homeland security grant program program guidelines and application kit washington nov 2004 p 1 50 us department of homeland security homeland

locality does not face terrorist threat have critical infrastructure or possess threat specific counterterrorism equipment these arguments however may not address the need for baseline counter terrorism training it could be argued that every state should receive the same training due to the unpredictable nature of terrorism some may argue that neither the absence of critical infrastructure nor relatively low population density protects state or locality from terrorist attacks from that perspective every state and locality can be seen as needing some if not an equal amount of counterterrorism training possible approaches include status quo congress could determine that the present amount of training and funding that states and localities receive is adequate in support of this position it might be argued that the current allocation of training funding and priority of training is necessary to ensure that every state and locality is provided baseline amount of counterterrorism training this option however does not address the argument that some states and localities are at greater risk of terrorist attacks and may need more training or funding than those states or localities at lesser risk establishing training attendance priority if congress were to decide that the present counterterrorism training provided by dhs is not fully meeting the needs of states and localities at greater risk of terrorist attacks it could direct dhs specifically gt through statutory or conference language to establish priority attendance list of states and localities this list could give training priority to states and localities that are determined to be at greater risk of or vulnerability to terrorist attacks gt with access to intelligence concerning the national terrorist threat might be designated to determine which states and localities appear to have greater need for training this option however might result in some states or localities receiving reduced training due to the limited space in and availability of the training programs and it could be argued that this would not ensure adequate security for some states and localities increasing funding for specific states or localities congress could direct gt to increase funding to specific states or localities based on terrorist threat information since congress through the usa patriot act directed only that minimum of 075 of total appropriations be allocated to states for homeland security it could through statutory or conference language require gt to provide additional funding to specific states and localities for counterterrorism training this option could increase preparedness of states and localities at greater risk of terrorist attacks as determined by threat information this option however would require gt to coordinate terrorist threat information with its allocation of shsgp funding which it presently does not do supporters of this position would be likely to argue that since gt coordinates terrorist threat information with its allocation of uasi funding it could do this for shsgp allocations possible redundancy and consolidation of department of homeland

training institutes that are part of the national domestic preparedness consortium ndpc described earlier in this report some training programs offered by emi and nfa have similar subject matter in training provided by ndpc training institutes such as incident management homeland security planning hazardous material incident response emergency operations and wmd response because of the possible similarity of these training programs for state and local first responders it could be argued that there is need to consolidate or coordinate training offered by these two separate dhs agencies femas firefighting training provided by the nfa however focuses primarily on the needs of local fire departments whereas ndpc provides some training primarily focusing on law enforcement some of the training that is tailored to specific profession such as law enforcement or firefighting would not seem to be redundant basic or introductory training such as incident management or wmd response however may not be specifically tailored for single profession or type of first responder this possible redundancy of training and the potential consolidation of training may be policy questions that congress may choose to address through oversight of dhss role in providing assistance to states and localities possible approaches include status quo if congress were to determine that there was redundancy or need to consolidate dhs training programs it could allow dhs to continue to provide first responder training through two separate agencies this would allow emergency managers law enforcement personnel firefighters and emergency medical personnel to apply for and receive training from the two agencies and the training institutes they administer this option however appears to leave unresolved the claims of possible redundancy of training or the possibility that these training programs are not coordinated government accountability office gao evaluation of programs congress could ask gao to undertake an evaluation of dhs counterterrorism training programs the evaluation could review odp and fema training curricula individual courses intended and actual trainees and training facilities after conducting review of these courses gao might be able to identify any duplication of training and possible options for consolidating or coordinating this training this option would give the committee additional tools for oversight of these programs hr 1544 as reported section 6 proposes this evaluation this option however would require the committee to work with gao to set mutually acceptable scope and time for the study coordination of department of homeland security training if congress were to find undesirable redundancy in training programs it could direct dhs to be more attentive to coordinating the counterterrorism training programs administered by gt and fema dhs could possibly establish board to review the gt and fema training programs and to recommend coordination or other steps to reduce duplication crs17 consolidation of department of homeland security training if congress were to determine that there is need to consolidate dhs training programs it could direct dhs through statutory or conference language to conduct review of its training programs and develop plan to consolidate its training this consolidation might involve the removal of similar programs provided by gt and fema to ensure there is redundancy if congress did not consider this consolidation adequate to ensure against redundant or uncoordinated dhs training it could also direct dhs to consolidate all counterterrorism training under one agency gt might be directed to assume the responsibility of administering not only its training but also the training fema provides first responders through emi and nfa some would argue this is logical choice since gt is responsible for administering the funding to states and localities that assist them in receiving this training this option however might be seen as impractical due to the specific training emi provides state and local emergency managers that is specific to natural disasters and the specific training nfa provides firefighters fema historically has administered training programs for emergency managers and firefighters whereas gt has administered law enforcement focused training crs contacts for further
