federal block grants summary the welfare reform law of 1996 pl 104193 sharply increased federal child care funding for lowincome families with the expectation that new work requirements for welfare parents most of whom were single mothers would increase demand for child care services this additional funding was accompanied by the creation of unified and expanded child care and development block grant ccdbg program with the aim of serving lowincome families regardless of welfare status the expanded program is financed through two funding streams commonly referred to in combination as the child care and development fund ccdf ccdf appropriations in fy2002 from the two funding streams total 48 billion 27 billion in mandatory funding and 22 billion in discretionary funds figure 1 the two funding streams fall under separate committee jurisdictions and carry with them different rules regarding allocation state matching requirements and time limits for obligating and spending money portion of the mandatory funding is guaranteed to states and is based on states spending on child care prior to the 1996 welfare law in order for state to be eligible for its share of the remaining mandatory funds which require state matching the state must first spend designated amount also based on historical spending of its own state funds discretionary ccdf funding is 100 federal ie requires state match and is allocated according to different formula than either portion of mandatory funds both the mandatory and the discretionary funding streams expire at the end of fy2002 and are due to be reauthorized this year the mandatory funding as part of welfare tanf reauthorization although the ccdf is the only federal grant program dedicated solely for the purpose of providing child care subsidies and activities for lowincome families states also are using two other federal block grants for this purpose tanf and the social services block grant ssbg states have increasingly used tanf dollars for child care services within their tanf programs 22 billion in fy2000 in addition to transferring tanf funds to the ccdf the tanf transfers to ccdf in fy2000 24 billion exceeded the discretionary funds appropriated for any single year so far overall expenditure data show that in fy2000 states spent more than 9 billion in federal and state funds associated with the ccdf and tanf more than double the amount spent on child care via these programs in fy1997 ssbg expenditure data are not available for fy2000 but states are reported to have spent almost 400 million in ssbg funds in fy1999 to support child care services as congress decides how much funding to make available for child care it will need to consider multiple programs and the various funding streams within them it is unclear whether the current level of child care funding via tanf and ssbg will be sustained if the recent economic downturn gives rise to needs perceived to be more

provided an increase in federal child care funding for lowincome families with the expectation that newly implemented work requirements for welfare recipients many being single mothers would create greater demand for child care services this additional funding was accompanied by the creation of unified and expanded child care and development block grant ccdbg program with the aim of serving lowincome families regardless of welfare status the expanded program is financed through two funding streams one discretionary authorized by the ccdbg act and one mandatory appropriated under section 418 of the social security act these two funding streams are commonly referred to in combination as the child care and development fund ccdf since passage of the welfare law states have spent increasing amounts of both federal and state money on child care as will be discussed later portion of federal mandatory funding to states is contingent on states spending some of their own state funds on child care although the ccdf is considered the primary source of federal funding for child care subsidies for lowincome working and welfare families two other federal block grants are contributing significantly to the child care funding picture the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant and the social services block grant ssbg states use all three of these sources to help finance child care assistance for families but only the ccdf is dedicated solely for this purpose the ccdf supports child care subsidies and activities and nothing else whereas tanf and ssbg provide wide range of assistance including child care this report focuses on the financing structure of the ccdf actual expenditures made from it and the role of tanf and the ssbg in child care funding and spending authorization for the discretionary portion of the ccdf and appropriations for both the ccdf mandatory funds as well as the tanf block grant are due to expire at the end of fy2002 therefore congress is expected to confront child care financing issues this year as part of both the child care and welfare reauthorizations debates over the level of funding necessary for child care are already percolating and although the 1996 law consolidated several components of federal child care funding the financing structure remains complicated potentially leading to calls for simplification multiple ccdf funding streams with different state funding and spending rules fall under different congressional committee jurisdictions and comprise only portion of complex child care financing picturehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31274crs2 seeing the full picture also requires focusing on the degree to which tanf funds contribute to child care expendi tures recent tanf expenditure data show that states are spending increasing amounts of tanf funds for child care services within the tanf program 22 billion in fy2000 however the extent to which this will continue during an economic downturn is an unanswered question for tanf and child care state administrators alike states also have the authority to transfer up to 30 of their annual tanf block grant to the ccdf andor the ssbg at maximum of 10 for use under those programs rules and as this report will discuss many states have done so before examining these three sources of child care funding in greater detail the next section provides an overview of how changes made as part of the 1996 welfare law affected child care programs and funding the report concludes with an analysis of trends in child care expenditures both nationally and by state and the implications of the recent spending trends for reauthorization overview of child care changes in 1996 the current structure of federal child care programs and funding is more easily understood by tracing its evolution from the system that existed prior to 1996 when the welfare law simultaneously repealed created and consolidated child care programs described below welfare afdc child care programs before 1996 four separate federal programs specifically supported child care for lowincome families three were associated with the cash welfare system families on welfare then aid to families with dependent children afdc were entitled to free child care families who had left the afdc rolls with employmen t were entitled to 12 months of transitional subsidized child care the third afdcrelated child care program targeted families who without child care subsidy would be at risk of qualifying for afdc these three programs operated under three separate sets of rules and targeted three separate populations critics argued that mothers navigating their way through the welfare system faced unnecessary complexity that could be alleviated with more unified child care program all three of the afdcrelated child care programs were funded with mandatory money and fell under the same congressional committee jurisdiction ways and means committee in the house and the finance committee in the senate afdc child care and transitional child care were both openended federal entitlements ie there was limit on program funding with the federal share of payments to states based on the states medicaid matching rate the afdc atrisk program on the other hand was not openended but was instead authorized as capped entitlement to the states at an annual level of 300 million ccdbg the fourth pre1996 child care program for lowincome families was the child care and development block grant ccdbg established in 1990 it supported child care for lowincome families not connected to the afdc welfare system the block grant subsidized child care for children under age 13 whosehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31274crs3 1 section 418 of the social security act requires that states spend at least 70 of their mandatory child care funds on families receiving tanf assistance families attempting to transition from tanf to work or those atrisk of welfare dependency however because the atrisk group is not defined as distinct group from other working poor families the targeted group for ccdbg discretionary funds the 70 target could in practice be met by spending all funds on lowincome working families with connection to tanf ie the requirement could be met by spending all of the earmarked funds on atrisk families continuedworking family income did not exceed 75 of state median income smi adjusted for family size in addition it provided funds for activities to improve the overall quality and supply of child care for families in general unlike the afdcrelated programs the ccdbg was funded with discretionary funds appropriated as part of the annual appropriations process authorizing legislation fell under the jurisdiction of the education and labor committee in the house later renamed the committee on education and the workforce and the labor and human resources committee in the senate later renamed the commit tee on health education labor and pensions figure 1 components of child care system prior to 1996 welfare law how the 1996 welfare law expanded child care funds the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 repealed afdc and its three associated child care programs like cash welfare child care was longer to be an individual entitlement to welfare families instead of preserving three separate programs the new law created consolidated block of mandatory funding under section 418 of the social security act like the earlier three programs this new block of funding was designed to be largely targeted toward families on leaving or at risk of receiving welfare now temporary assistance for needy families tanf1 however unlike the threehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31274crs4 1 continued national data on ccdf subsidy receipt by tanf status are not available 2 other federal programs and tax provisions related to child care but not discussed in this report include head start the 21st century learning center program the child and adult care food program the dependent care tax credit and the dependent care assistance program for description of these programs and recent funding levels see crs report rl30944 child care issues in the 107th congress by melinda gishafdcrelated child care programs each of which was administered under its own set of rules the 1996 law instructed that the new mandatory funding be transferred to each states lead agency managing the ccdbg and be administered according to ccdbg rules the law appropriated 139 billion for this new child care block grant over 6 years up 4 billion from spending estimated by cbo under old law committee jurisdiction for the mandatory funds remained with the house ways and means and senate finance committees in addition to creating the new block of mandatory child care funding the 1996 welfare law reauthorized and amended the ccdbg the 1996 law authorized discretionary funding levels at 1 billion annually the authorized such sums as necessary for fy1995 had led to an appropriation of 935 million and modified the program rules including an expansion of program eligibility from 75 of smi to 85 of smi the discretionary funding and the ccdbg program rules remained under the same committees jurisdiction as before this combination of new mandatory funding and expanded ccdbg discretionary funding is commonly referred to as the child care and development fund ccdf and makes up the largest source of federal program funding 48 billion in fy2002 appropriated solely for child care subsidies and child care activities for lowincome families2 states are required to spend less than 4 of their combined mandatory and discretionary ccdf allotments on activities to improve the quality and availability of child care more detailed explanation of the ccdf its funding streams rules and appropriations is provided belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31274crs5 3 table of state ccdf allotments for fy2002 by funding type is found in appendix the child care and development fund ccdf ccdf v ccdbg whats in name the child care and development fund or ccdf is term that emerged from the aforementioned consolidation and expansion of child care programs that took place in 1996 this term does not appear anywhere in statute but rather was coined by the department of health and human services hhs to refer to the combination of mandatory and discretionary funding provided to states for their use in administering child care programs governed by the rules and regulations of the ccdbg readers should note that while the ccdf is in essence funding term it is not unusual for it to be used interchangeably with ccdbg nevertheless from financing perspective there are technical distinctions between these two acronyms which are noted in the following discussion of the multiple funding streams that comprise the ccdf ccdf funding streams mandatory funding the mandatory funding component of the ccdf is sometimes referred to as entitlement funding this refers to an entitlement to states not individuals although the individual entitlement to child care was eliminated in 1996 states remain entitled to portion of federal funds for child care from specified annual blockgranted amounts appropriated in section 418 of the social security act for fy1997fy2002 as part of the 1996 law each state receives fixed amount that fixed amount is guaranteed and equal to the funding received by each respective state under the three earlier afdcchild care related programs in fy1994 fy1995 or the average of fy1992fy1994 whichever is greatest in other words states are entitled to receive this portion of federal funding without having to match those dollars with any child care spending from their own state funds in order for state to be eligible for its share of the remaining funds also known as matching funds that state must first meet maintenanceofeffort moe requirement meeting the moe requires that state expend at least the same amount of state funds for child care as it did under its afdcrelated child care programs in fy1995 or fy1994 whichever was higher once states child care spending has reached that moe level in the given year it may begin to access its share of the years remaining federal mandatory funds states matching fund allotments are determined after setting aside the guaranteed mandatory portion described above and are based upon each states relative share of children under age 13 every dollar of state child care expenditures above the moe amount is matched at the states medicaid matching rate to the extent provided for by the states allotment of federal matching funds3 discretionary funding the discretionary portion of the ccdf is authorized by the child care and development block grant act as amended in 1996 actual funding amounts are determined in the annual appropriations process this portionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31274crs6 how are states ccdf allotments determined mandatory guaranteed funds each state receives fixed amount based on its historic levels of afdcrelated child care spending mandatory federal matching funds each states allotment is based on its relative share of children under age 13 moe requirement must be met in order to be eligible for matching funds discretionary funds each states allotment is based on three factors its share of children under age 5 its share of children receiving free or reducedprice lunches per capita incomehas sometimes been singled out as the ccdbg funding when referring to funding trends over time because prior to 1996 the discretionary child care funding was the sole source of ccdbg funding however since 1996 the distinction between discretionary and mandatory funds has not been so relevant from the programmatic angle since all ccdf money is directed to ccdbg programs but rather from the standpoint of differences in rules regarding the time limits that states have for obligating and expending the different funding streams discussed below and state matching requirements on those funds discretionary funds are allocated among states accordin g to the formula contained in the original ccdbg act of 1990 and retained in the amended act of 1996 that formula is based on each states share of children under age 5 its share of children receiving free or reducedprice lunches and its per capita income half of 1 of the appropriated funds is reserved for payments to the territories and between 1 and 2 is reserved for indian tribes and tribal organizations ccdf allotments for fy2002 categorized by funding type ie mandatory matching and discretionary are found in appendix discretionary funds do not require state match the ccdbg act currently authorizes funding through fy2002 at 1 billion annually however actual appropriation s have surpassed that level up to 21 billion in fy2002 funding made available for both the discretionary and mandatory portions of the ccdf for each of fy1997 through fy2002 are shown in table 1 the second and third columns of the table distinguish between advance and same year appropriations with the fourth column showing the total discretionary funding amount available for the given fiscal year readers should note that the total amount shown as appropriated does not reflect all funds ultimately made available for ccdf expenditures as mentioned earlier in this report states may transfer portion of their tanf allotments to the ccdf for expenditure under that program and have chosen to do so in varying degreeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31274crs7 4 note that the rules being discussed here regarding obligations and expenditures apply to states not the federal government from the perspective of the federal budget an obligation instead refers to the ccdf grants awarded to statestable 1 ccdf appropriations mandatory and discretionary fy1997fy2002 in millions fiscal yeardiscretionary funding mandatory entitlement funding total advance appropriation from prior yearsame

2717 4817 sour ce table prepared by the congressional research service crs using annual health and human services hhs administration for children and families budget justifications what appears in the table to be limited discretionary ccdf funding in fy1997 and consequently in total funding actually reflects shift to advance appropriating of funds for the following fiscal year the fy1997 appropriation law provided 956 million for ccdbg with only 19 million available immediately during fy1997 and the remainder available on october 1 1997 the first day of fy1998 in earlier years the funds appropriated for ccdbg became available for obligation only in the last month of the given fiscal year and therefore most of the appropriation for given year 935 million in fy1996 was actually obligated in the following fiscal year time limits on states for obligating and spending ccdf funds specific and different rules govern time limits for obligating and spending ccdf money depending on the funding stream figure 2 first what does it mean for state to obligate funds essentially obligated ccdf funds reflect money that states have committed to spend from their ccdf grant awards4 ccdf regulations impose some restrictions on state definitions of obligations but generally leave discretion to the states in defining what constitutes an obligation examples of obligations may involve states subgranting funds to programs that operate independent of state agencies ie statesupervised countyrun programs or private contractors or making transactions that require future payment for services when the state actually makes payment for the service an expenditure is recorded ccdf discretionary funds states have 2 years in which to obligate discretionary funds appropriated in given fiscal year states have an additional year to actually spend the money in other words total of 3 fiscal years from the time of appropriation for example ccdf discretionary funding appropriated for fy2001httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31274crs8 is available for obligation through the end of fy2002 states then have until the end of fy2003 to actually make payments on those obligations they can however make expenditures at any point within the 3year period if state fails to make expenditures for all its obligations within the 3year limit hhs will take back that portion of the grant award that is not spent ccdf mandatory funds the deadlines for states to obligate and expend mandatory funds differ from those for discretionary funds different rules apply to indian tribes mandatory guaranteed ccdf funds must be obligated by the end of the fiscal year in which they are awarded only if the state intends to qualify for matching funds if state does not intend to qualify for matching funds there is deadline for obligating funds regardless there is deadline for states to expend these funds as explained earlier in order for state to qualify for federal matching funds it must first meet maintenanceofeffort moe requirement moe state funds must be obligated and expended within the fiscal year of the grant award if the state is to become eligible to receive its share of federal matching funds for that year matching funds both the federal and state share must be obligated within the fiscal year of the grant award state then has an additional year to make expenditures in the event state fails to expend its share of matching ccdf funds by the end of the second fiscal year hhs will take back the unmatched portion of the federal grant award figure 2 provides pictorial representation of the varying time frames that states have for obligating and expending funds from the various ccdf funding streams states flexibility to obligate and spend funds across years is of particular relevance when analyzing ccdf expenditures over time and will be addressed in more detail later in this report however before analyzing those expenditures both nationally and by state the following sections describe the role that two other federal block grants tanf and ssbg play as additional funding sources for child carehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31274crs9 5 for detailed information on the tanf block grants financing structure and the rules that apply to it see crs report 30723 welfare reform federal grants and financing rules under tanf by gene falk figure 2 time limits for obligation and expenditure of ccdf by funding type source figure prepared by the congressional research service crs additional funding sources tanf and ssbg as noted earlier child care for lowincome families is also supported by funds from tanf and the ssbg although states are not required to use these funds for child care expenditure data indicate that these block grants are indeed supplementing funds appropriated directly through the ccdf tanf the welfare reform law provides fixed block grants 165 billion annually through fy2002 for statedesigned programs of timelimited and work conditioned aid to families with children5 since its implementation increasing amounts of tanf funding have been used for supporting child care both through transfers to the ccdf and by funding child care within the tanf system itself as mentioned earlier states are permitted to transfer combined total of 30 of their annual tanf allotments to the ccdf and the ssbg with maximum limit of 10 to the ssbg once transferred the funds must be administered according to the ruleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31274crs10 6 most tanf program requirements for family or the state ie work requirements time limits child support assignment are triggered when tanf money is spent on assistance as defined by hhs in regulation whether supportive service such as child care is classified as assistance depends on the situation for example child care for working person is not assistance and would not trigger tanf requirements however child care provided to nonworking person such as cash welfare recipient in training program would be categorized as assistance and would therefore trigger tanf requirements 7 not included in the 22 billion figure are any expenditures made by the states to meet the tanf moe requirement that could also be counted toward meeting the ccdf moe requirement the treatment of state child care expenditures under tanf and ccdf and the potential of double counting certain state expenditures is discussed in greater detail later in this report 8 for more information on the ssbg see crs report 94953 social services block grant title xx of the social security act by melinda gishof the program that receives them tanf rules apply to funds that remain within the tanf program6 over the course of fy1997fy2000 states transferred total of 6 billion from tanf to the ccdf representing over 9 of their tanf allotments awarded over the 4year period the 24 billion of that total that was transferred in fy2000 represents 14 of states fy2000 tanf allotment in other words the amount transferred from tanf to ccdf in fy2000 24 billion exceeds the amount that was appropriated directly in discretionary ccdf funds for fy2002 21 billion or any single fiscal year so far for statebystate table showing cumulative amounts of tanf funds transferred to the ccdf in fy1997fy2000 and transfers made from fy2000 allotments in fy2000 see appendix b of this report transferring funds to the ccdf is not the only channel through which states may use tanf funding to support child care services for lowincome families tanf funding can be used directly to pay for variety of services that support work and child care is prime example in fy2000 states reported spending total of 22 billion of federal tanf and related state funds on child care7 note that this is in addition to the aforementioned tanf funds transferred to the ccdf for expenditure under that program an analysis of trends in expenditures from both these funding sources begins on page 13 ssbg the ssbg is flexible source of federal funds that states may use to support variety of social services including child care8 states are entitled to specified allotment of funds based on population size and there is state match required for receipt of these federal funds states have complete discretion over how these funds are distributed and to whom restrictions are placed only on any funds states opt to transfer from their tanf allotment to the ssbg states have the authority through fy2002 to transfer up to 10 of their tanf allotment to the ssbg any of these transferred funds must be used only for expenditures to assist children and families whose income is less than 200 of the federal poverty guidelineshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31274crs11 9 us department of health and human services administration for children and families office of community services social services block grant program annual report on expenditures and recipients 1999 washington gpo 2001over fy1997fy2000 states have cumulatively transferred 39 billion or 6 of their tanf awards for the period to the ssbg however unlike tanf transfers to ccdf transfer to the ssbg is not necessarily subsequently spent on child care nor are the funds that are directly appropriated for the ssbg required to be used for child care states use at their own discretion only portion of all ssbg funds to support child care services the most recent hhs analysis of statereported ssbg expenditures reveals that in fy1999 43 states spent total of 397 million for child day care services accounting for 13 of all fy1999 ssbg expenditures9 this represents greater percentage of all ssbg expenditures than that made in fy1998 when 46 states applied just over 9 279 million of all ssbg expenditures toward child day care services as shown in table 2 funding appropriated directly to the ssbg has been decreasing since 1997 with additional transfers from tanf hovering around 1 billion the amount transferred in fy2001 is not yet available appropriations for fy2002 were 1700 billion decrease of 25 million from the prior year the extent to which fy2000 and fy2001 ssbg funding in addition to any funds transferred from tanf has and will be

thus far focused on sources of child care funding emphasizing the amounts made available each year through federal block grants and the rules that apply to states for obligating and spending those funds the next sections focus on the data that show what amounts states have actually spent from year to year following is an analysis of trends in actual child care expenditures using data availablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31274crs12 from the ccdf tanf and their predecessor programs the limited information available regarding the ssbgs role in funding child care expenditures has already been discussed in the preceding section in this report expenditures for given fiscal year reflect expenditures made within that given fiscal year regardless of the year in which the funding was provided however for fy2000 breakdown of spending by year of funding source is also provided recall that as described earlier states are afforded different time frames for spending money from different funding streams with multiple funding sources available expenditure data help in answering the questions of how much states are spending on child care for lowincome families via which programs and in what time frame overview of child care spending trends the following sections look at components of child care spending by program ccdf and tanf and more specifically by funding stream within given specified program however before doing so it is useful to focus on the big picture what is the big picture child care expenditures made through the ccdf and tanf programs have been growing steadily since the passage of the 1996 welfare law and build on levels that were already increasing prior to that time the most recent available data indicate that in fy2000 combined child care expenditures made from these two programs totaled over 9 billion more than double the level of expenditures made for child care via these same two programs in fy1997 expenditures from the ccdf made from funds provided either directly through the ccdf or from tanf transfers to the ccdf represent the largest portion of that child care spending reaching over 7 billion in fy2000 supplementing this were over 2 billion in additional child care spending within the tanf system figure 3 displays the growth in spending for child care showing combined expenditures from ccdf and tanf both federal and state shares for fy1997fy2000 for fy1992 fy1996 the figure reflects expenditures made for afdcrelated child care programs both federal and state shares and the ccdbg the chart does not indicate which programs and funding streams comprise what portion of each years spending discussion of those breakdowns follows starting with an analysis of ccdf expenditureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31274crs13

combined in billions includes federal and state shares source figure prepared by the congressional research service crs based on data provided by the department of health and human services hhs note for breakdown of these expenditures by funding source see appendix c trends in ccdf spending as described earlier ccdf funding comes in both mandatory and discretionary amounts one portion of mandatory money is guaranteed another portion of the mandato ry money is only available to states if they first meet an moe requirement with state funds and then provide additional state matching funds match applies to the discretionary fund therefore expenditure data for ccdf can be broken down into those same categories mandatory and discretionary distinguishing between federal and state contributions table 3 shows the breakdown of ccdf and predecessor program expenditures for fy1992fy2000 by funding source for fy1992fy1996 the amounts shown as federal ccdf mandatory guaranteed spending actually reflect federal expenditures for afdcrelated child care spending why because the guaranteed funding amounts for the ccdf are based on afdc child care spending during this period likewise the moe requirements established for the ccdf are based on the state spending from the afdc era and are therefore included in the moe column the ccdf federal matching money essentially represents new mandatory funding which states can only access by spending the required share of their own state funds expenditures made from federal funds are shown in the first three columns of expenditures and those made from state funds are in the fourth and fifth columns the final column shows total expenditures made from the ccdf and its predecessor programs in each year the trend in

include spending from tanf transfers to ccdfb expenditures made in fy1992fy1996 from the federal share of afdcrelated child care matching funds are included in the same column as the mandatory ccdf expenditures because these expenditures were the basis for determining mandatory guaranteed funding levels for the ccdf similarly the fy1992fy1996 expenditures made from the state share of afdcrelated child care matching funds appear in the same column showing ccdf moe expenditures for fy1997fy2000 because they formed the basis of determining the moe requirement level ccdf spending in fy2000 as table 3 shows in fy2000 total of 72 billion was spent from the ccdf over 3 billion of the 72 billion total reflect expenditures made from federal ccdf discretionary funds approximately 22 billion in ccdf expenditures were made from guaranteed mandatory funding and the federal share of matching funds why do the federal expenditures made from the ccdf in fy2000 discretionary mandatory federal share of matching 53 billion significantly exceed the fy2000 ccdf funding level see table 1 of 35 billion first the expenditure numbers shown in table 3 reflect spending by states in fy2000 and as explained in the discussion of time limits for obligation and expenditure of funds states may make expenditures from not just the current years funding but also from funds provided in earlier years10 moreover when stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31274crs15 10 continued frames the end of fy2000 marked the time limit for states to have spent all available ccdf discretionary funds originally provided in fy1998 expenditure data indicate that nine states failed to obligate total of 296000 by the 2year obligation deadline an additional 305000 in discretionary funds that were obligated by four states were not actually expended by the time limit ie end of fy2000 in other words of all fy1998 discretionary funds made available and tanf funds transferred in fy1998 states had obligated and expended all but 003 by the end of fy2000 of fy1998 matching funds only three states failed to obligate all available funds and all obligated funds by all states were spent by the deadline similarly all but 02 of fy1998 mandatory funding which has deadline for expenditure by the states had been spent by the end of fy2000transfer funds from tanf to the ccdf those transfers ultimately show up as ccdf expenditures included in the discretionary column table 4 provides breakdown of ccdf expenditures made in fy2000 showing the source of those expenditures both by type ie discretionary mandatory matching and the year the funding was actually appropriated for example the first column of expenditures shows that cumulative total of almost 31 billion in expenditures from ccdf discretionary funds were made in fy2000 of that amount over 12 billion can be attributed to discretionary funding appropriated in fy1998 and fy1999 and 18 billion was expended from funds appropriated in fy2000 states were able to spend more in discretionary funds than were actually appropriated in fy2000 in part because expenditures from transferred tanf funds are included as discretionary table 4 ccdf expenditures made in

in the given yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31274crs16 b states must make expenditur for meeting the moe requirement within the given year and therefore fy1998 and fy1999 moe expenditures were made in each of those respective years and applied to the moe requirement for those yearsc federal and state shares of ccdf matching funds must be expended by states by the end of the fiscal year following the year of appropriation therefore fy1998 matching funds had to have been expended by the end of fy1999 and could not be source of fy2000 expenditures tanf child care spending tanf contributes to the big picture of child care spending in two ways expenditures made from funds transferred to ccdf discussed above and expenditures made directly within the tanf system of the expenditures made directly within tanf some are made from federal funds while others are made from state funds associated with the tanf maintenanceofeffor t moe requirement tanf like the ccdf has its own moe requirement which states must meet if they are to be eligible for their full tanf allotment the tanf moe requires states to expend on tanfeligible families an amount equal to their historic spending level generally in fy19941995 on tanf predecessor programs afdc emergency assistance job opportunities and basic skills and afdcrelated child care why is this important to the calculation of tanfs contribution to child care spending role of the tanf moe in calculating child care spending within the rules for applying state child care expenditures toward tanf and ccdf moe levels states may double count many expenditures toward both programs requirements in other words as long as child care expenditure is for tanf eligible family it may be applied toward both the tanfs moe level and the ccdf moe states are not required to explain in either their tanf or ccdf expenditure report whether any all or none of their moe spending overlaps as result if moe expenditures from the ccdf and tanf expenditure forms were to be added together the resulting total might overstate the level of moe child care spending actually made by the states therefore for this analysis of tanf child care expenditures only tanf moe spending that exceeds the level of ccdf moe expenditures made by state will be counted recognizing that this method results in the most conservative estimate stepbystep look at the process of reaching unduplicated tanf moe expenditure amounts is provided later in the report where tanf expenditures are analyzed on statebystate basis trends in tanf child care spending tanf expenditure data reveal that states as group are spending increasing amounts of tanf funds on child care services table 5 shows that the combined total of federal tanf funding and the excess or unduplicated child care expenditures made from state funds has grown from over 133 million in fy1997 to almost 22 billion in fy2000 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31274crs17 table 5 tanf child care spending fy1997fy2000 in

spend any given amount of their tanf funds on child care states have the flexibility to spend their tanf funding on variety of services in addition to cash assistance and therefore it is useful to

spending amounts by funding source the final column of the table reflects the calculation of excess child care tanf moe expenditures which are explained in more detail below calculating excess tanf moe child care expenditures table 9 includes the expenditure data used to make the excess tanf moe expenditure calculations for fy2000 the excessexpenditure amount is defined here as any amount that remains after the total reported ccdf moe expenditures are subtracted from the tanf child care moe reported amount if the subtraction yields negative amount or zero then there is excess amount to report as statefunded tanf expenditure if the reported tanf moe child care spending amount is greater than the amount reported toward the ccdf moe then the positive difference is counted in table 9 as the excess amount for example as shown in the first column of numbers in table 9 alabama was required to make 6896 million in child care expenditures from state funds to meet its annual ccdf moe requirement according to alabamas reporting form for fy2000 ccdf expenditures they spent precisely that amount in fy2000 the third column shows the level of child care expenditures reported on the tanf expenditure form toward the tanf moe 4409 million because the tanf moe expenditures do not exceed the ccdf moe expenditures and all 4409 million could already potentially be accounted for as part of the 6896 million reported as ccdf moe spending expendit ures are counted toward state tanf child care spending in other words 44 million minus 68 million yields negative number in other cases arkansas for example table 9 shows that the reported tanf moe child care expenditures 5278 billion exceed those reported toward the ccdf moe 1887 billion therefore the excess rounded to 34 billion in this case is the amount that appears in table 8 under tanf child care moe table 9 also reveals the extent to which states reported expenditures above the required moe level according to fy2000

the supporting table of data can be found in appendix c source figure prepared by the congressional research service crs based on data provided by the department of health and human services hhs funding issues in reauthorization congress is expected to address child care financing issues as part of reauthorizing child care and welfare legislation the issue of how much funding to make available for child care will likely be at the forefront but is complicated by the fact that child care is supported by multiple funding sources as policymakers consider funding levels for child care the following questions might be asked with respect to each potential funding source are funds from this source specifically dedicated for child care how are funds from this source allocated to states what is the distribution formula are states required to match funds from this source with their own state fundshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31274crs28 can funds from this source be transferred to other programs how long do states have to obligate and spend funds from this source the answers to these questions highlight the varying implications of providing child care funding through different sources for instance funds provided through ccdf are the only funds dedicated solely for child care but nevertheless expenditure data through fy2000 reveal that tanf has also played significant role in funding child care both through transfers to ccdf and directly within tanf therefore should ccdf funding levels be set with the presumption that states will continue to use the same amount of tanf funds for child care lesser or greater amount likewise what are the implications of the ccdf funding decision on setting the overall tanf funding level will an economic downturn prompt states to make different decisions as to how they allocate their tanf funds greater child care expenditures have been fueled by reduced cash welfare caseloads through fy2000 will these spending trends continue if cash welfare caseloads level off or rise to what extent are ccdf funds used to serve welfare tanf families even with respect to the funds targeted specifically for child care ie the ccdf the implications for states differ depending on whether funds are provided via the mandatory or discretionary stream as described earlier the mandatory and discretionary portions of the ccdf are currently allocated among states according to different formulas based on different factors consequently the same amount of funding will translate into different allocation amounts for states depending on the funding stream from which the money is allocated furthermore mandatory funds bring with them state matching requirements for the nonguaranteed portion of course whether states actually spend state funds in order to access the available federal mandatory funds depends on each states individual decision to participate in the matching program for example michigan has not always opted to access its full matching grant but has instead applied state child care expenditures toward meeting its tanf moe requirement discretionary and mandatory ccdf funds also carry with them different time limits for states to obligate and spend the money policymakers will be faced with deciding what portion of ccdf funding should be delivered via discretionary money versus mandatory money should the formulas for allocating those funds remain as they are should states historical spending levels from the early 1990s continue to serve as the basis for the fixed amount of guaranteed mandatory funding should matching requirements remain the same how long should states have for obligating and spending the funds decisions regarding states authority to transfer funds between block grants ie tanf funds to ccdf and ssbg are also expected as part of the reauthorization process in addition to the allowable level of transfer some critics of the status quo argue that states should be allowed to transfer tanf funds remaining from prior years rather than only current year funds of course just as an economic downturn could prove to affect states decisions to use tanf funds directly for child care so too could it affect their decisions to transfer fundshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31274crs29 appendix fy2002 ccdf allotments by funding type in millions state discretionarymandatory guaranteedmatching federal
