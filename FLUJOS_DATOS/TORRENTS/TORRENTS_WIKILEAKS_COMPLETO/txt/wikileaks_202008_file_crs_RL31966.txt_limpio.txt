overview the legislation establishes new voluntary prescription drug benefit program under new part d of title xviii of the social security act effective january 1 2006 new optional benefit will be established under new part d beneficiaries will be able to purchase either standard coverage or alternative coverage with actuarially equivalent benefits in 2006 standard coverage will have 250 deductible 25 coinsurance for costs between 251 and 2250 then coverage until the beneficiary has outofpocket costs of 3600 5100 in total spending once the beneficiary reaches the catastrophic limit the program will pay all costs except for nominal costsharing lowincome subsidies will be provided for persons with incomes below 150 of poverty coverage will be provided through prescription drug plans or medicare advantage prescription drug mapd plans the program will rely on private plans to provide coverage and to bear some of the financial risk for drug costs federal subsidies covering the bulk of the risk will be provided to encourage participation plans will determine payments and will be expected to negotiate prices eligibility and enrollment each individual entitled to medicare part or enrolled in medicare part b will be entitled to obtain qualified prescription drug coverage through enrollment in prescription drug plan beneficiary enrolled in medicare advantage ma plan see below providing qualified prescription drug coverage mapd plan will obtain coverage through that plan in general ma enrollees may not enroll in prescription drug plan under part d the secretary is required to establish process for enrollment disenrollment termination and change of enrollment of eligible beneficiaries in prescription drug plans the secretary is required to use rules similar to and coordinated with rules established for mapd plans sixmonth initial enrollment period beginning november 15 2005 will be established for all persons who are eligible beneficiaries on that date it is the same period established for enrollment for ma plans for that year an initial enrollment period will apply for individuals becoming eligible after that date in case can such period be less than six months the secretary is required to conduct activities that are designed to broadly disseminate information to eligible beneficiaries and prospective eligible beneficiaries it must be available at least 30 days prior to the initial enrollment period the information dissemination requirements are similar to and are to be coordinated with the activities the secretary is required to perform for ma plans 1 see ftpftpcbogov48xxdoc48081120medicareletterpdf for cost estimate crs3 comparative information is to include information on benefits and formularies under plan monthly beneficiary premium and beneficiary costsharing prescription drug benefits the legislation specifies the requirements for qualified prescription drug coverage qualified coverage is defined as either standard prescription drug coverage or alternative prescription drug coverage with at least actuarially equivalent benefits in both cases access would have to be provided to negotiated prices for covered drugs plans are permitted to provide supplemental prescription coverage consisting of either certain reductions in cost sharing ie reduction in deductible reduction in coinsurance percentage and increase in initial coverage limit or coverage of drugs which are excluded because of application of the medicaid definition of covered drugs pdp sponsor may not offer plan that provides supplemental benefits unless it also offers basic plan in the area for 2006 standard prescription drug coverage is defined as having 250 deductible 25 coinsurance up to the initial coverage limit 2250 accounting for 750 in total outofpocket costs and 2250 in total spending then coverage until the beneficiary had outofpocket costs of 3600 5100 total spending once the beneficiary reached the catastrophic stop loss limit the program would pay costs except for nominal costsharing the costsharing is equal to the greater of 1 copayment of 2 for generic drug or preferred multiple source and 5 for any other drug or 2 5 coinsurance nothing is to be construed as preventing pdp sponsor or ma organization from reducing the costsharing for preferred or generic drugs beginning in 2007 the annual dollar amounts would be increased by the annual percentage increase in average per capita aggregate expenditures for covered outpatient drugs for medicare beneficiaries for the 12month period ending in july of the previous year plans will be permitted to substitute costsharing requirements for costs up to the initial coverage limit that were actuarially consistent with an average expected 25 coinsurance for costs up to the initial coverage limit they may also apply tiered copayments ie different levels depending on whether generic preferred multiple source or other drug is used provided such copayments were actuarially consistent with the average 25 costsharing requirements the act specifies incurred costs that count toward meeting the catastrophic limit costs are only considered incurred if they are incurred for the deductible cost sharing or benefits not paid because of application of the initial coverage limit incurred costs do not include amounts for which benefits are provided because of the application of formulary costs can be treated as incurred costs only if they were paid by the individual or by another family member on behalf of the individual paid on behalf of lowincome individual under the subsidy provisions or under state pharmaceutical assistance program any costs for which the individual was reimbursed by insurance or otherwise will not count toward incurred costs coverage offered by pdp plan sponsor or mapd entity will be required to provide beneficiaries with access to negotiated prices access must be provided even when benefits were payable because of the application of costsharing or an crs4 initial coverage limits negotiated prices are to take into account negotiated price concessions such as discounts direct or indirect subsidies rebates and direct or indirect remunerations for covered part d drugs and include dispensing fees the pdp sponsor or mapd entity is required to disclose to the secretary the aggregate negotiated price concessions made available to the sponsor or organization and passed through in the form of lower subsidies lower monthly beneficiary premiums and lower prices through pharmacies and other dispensers manufacturers will be required to disclose pricing information to the secretary beneficiary protections for qualified prescription drug coverage the act establishes beneficiary protection requirements for qualified prescription drug plans pdp plan sponsors are required to disclose to each enrolling beneficiary information about the plans benefit structure sponsors will be required to furnish to enrollees detailed explanation of benefits when drug benefits were provided including information on benefits compared to the initial coverage limit and the applicable outofpocket threshold pdp sponsors are required to permit the participation of any pharmacy that meets the plans terms and conditions pdp could reduce copayments for its enrolled beneficiaries below the otherwise applicable level for drugs dispensed through innetwork pharmacies in case could the reduction result in an increase in subsidy payments made by the secretary to the plan the pdp sponsor is required to secure participation in its network of sufficient number of pharmacies that dispense drugs directly to patients other than by mail order to assure convenient access the secretary will establish convenient access rules that are less favorable to enrollees than rules for convenient access established for the tricare retail pharmacy program the rules are to include adequate emergency assess for enrolled beneficiaries sponsors will permit enrollees to receive benefits which may include 90day supply through community pharmacy rather than through mailorder with any differential in charge paid by enrollees if pdp sponsor uses formulary it will have to meet certain requirements pharmaceutical and therapeutic committee must develop and review the formulary the committee will be required when developing and reviewing the formulary to base clinical decisions on the strength of scientific evidence and standards of practice the committee must also take into account whether including particular covered drug in the formulary or in particular tier in formulary had therapeutic advantages in terms of safety and efficacy the formulary must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered part d drugs although not necessarily all drugs within such categories or classes the secretary is required to request the united states pharmacopeia to develop in consultation with pharmaceutical benefit managers and other interested parties list of categories and classes that may be used by plans the secretarys request must also include the revision of such classification from time to time to reflect changes in therapeutic uses of covered drugs and the addition of new covered drugs the plan sponsor can not change therapeutic categories and classes in formulary other than at the beginning of plan year except as the secretary may permit to take into account new therapeutic uses and newly approved covered drugs each sponsor is required to establish policies and procedures to educate and inform health care crs5 providers and enrollees concerning the formulary any removal of drug from the formulary and any change in the preferred or tier costsharing status of drug could not occur until appropriate notice had been provided to the secretary beneficiaries and physicians pharmacies and pharmacists the plan must provide for periodic evaluation and analysis of treatment protocols and procedures the pdp sponsor will be required to have directly or indirectly through arrangements costeffective drug utilization management program quality assurance measures medication therapy management program and program to control fraud waste and abuse each pdp sponsor will be required to have meaningful procedures for the hearing and resolving of any grievances between the sponsor including any entity or individual through which the sponsor provided covered benefits and enrollees enrollees will be afforded access to expedited determinations and reconsiderations in the same manner afforded under ma beneficiary in plan that provides for tiered costsharing can request coverage of nonpreferred drug on the same conditions applicable to preferred drugs if the prescribing physician determines that the preferred drug for the treatment of the same condition is not as effective for the enrollee or has adverse effects for the enrollee pdp will be required to have an exceptions process consistent with guidelines established by the secretary in general pdp plan sponsors will be required to meet the requirements for independent review and appeals of coverage denials and tiered costsharing in the same manner that such requirements applied to ma organizations for feeforservice benefits an individual enrolled in pdp plan may appeal to obtain coverage for drug not on the formulary only if the prescribing physician determines that all covered part d drugs on any tier of the formulary for treatment of the same condition would not be as effective for the individual or would have adverse effects for the individual or both the pdp sponsor will be required to meet requirements related to confidentiality and accuracy of enrollee records in the same manner that such requirements applied to ma organizations each pdp sponsor will provide that each pharmacy that dispenses covered drug shall inform enrolled beneficiaries at the time of purchase or at the time of delivery in the case of mail order drugs of any price differential between the price to the enrollee and the price of the lowest cost generic drug covered under the plan that is therapeutically equivalent and bioequivalent and available at the pharmacy the secretary is permitted to waive this requirement pdp sponsors are required to issue and reissue as appropriate card or other technology that could be used by an enrolled beneficiary to assure access to negotiated prices for drugs the secretary will provide for the development adoption or recognition of standards relating to standardized format for the card or other technology electronic prescription program the act requires the secretary to develop electronic prescription standards the standards apply to prescriptions for covered part d drugs and required information that are transmitted electronically under an electronic prescription drug program that meets the following requirements crs6 the program must provide for the electronic transmittal of information on eligibility and benefits including formulary drugs any tiered formulary structure and prior authorization requirements information on the drug being prescribed and other drugs listed in the patients medication history including drugdrug interactions and information on the availability of lowercost therapeutically appropriate alternative drugs additionally the program must provide for the electronic transmittal of the patients medical history disclosure of information must meet the requirements of the hipaa privacy rule and to the extent feasible be on an interactive realtime basis access to choice of qualified prescription drug coverage the secretary is required to assure that each beneficiary has available choice of enrollment in at least 2 qualifying plans in the area in which the beneficiary resides at least one plan has to be prescription drug plan the requirement is not satisfied for an area if only one pdp sponsor or one ma organization offering mapd plan offers all the qualifying plans for the area the act permits the secretary in order to assure access to approve limited risk contracts as discussed below only if access is still not provided will the secretary provide for the offering of fallback plan pdp regions the act provides for the establishment of pdp regions the service area for plan includes an entire pdp region the secretary shall establish and may revise pdp regions in manner that is consistent with the requirements for establishment and revision of ma regions to the extent practicable pdp regions shall be the same as ma regions the secretary may establish different regions if the secretary determines that it would improve access to drug benefits plan can be offered in more than one pdp region including all pdp regions submission of bids each pdp sponsor is required to submit to the secretary specified information at the same time and in similar manner as such information is submitted by ma organizations the information to be submitted is 1 information on the prescription drug coverage to be provided 2 the actuarial value of the qualified prescription drug coverage in the region for beneficiary with national average risk profile 3 information on the bid including the basis for the actuarial value the portion of the bid attributable to basic coverage and if applicable the portion attributable to supplemental benefits and assumptions regarding reinsurance subsidy payments 4 service area 5 level of risk assumed including whether the sponsor requires modification of risk level and if so the extent of the modification and 6 such other information required by the secretary plan approval the secretary will review the submitted information for purposes of conducting negotiations with the plan the secretary has the authority to negotiate the terms and conditions of the plans the authority is similar to the authority the director of the office of personnel management has with respect to federal employee health benefits fehb plans the secretary may not interfere with the negotiations between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and pdp sponsors further the secretary may not require particular formulary or institute price structure for the reimbursement of covered part d drugs crs7 after review and negotiation the secretary will approve or disapprove the plan the secretary may only approve plan if certain requirements are met the plan must comply with part d requirements including those relating to beneficiary protections the secretary must determine that the plan and the sponsor meet requirements relating to actuarial determinations further the secretary may not find that the design of the plan and its benefits including any formulary and tiered formulary structure are likely to discourage enrollment by certain beneficiaries the secretary may not make finding with respect to design of categories and classes within formulary if such categories and classes are consistent with guidelines if any for such categories and classes established by the united states pharmacopeia the act provides that the secretary may only approve limited risk plan for pdp region if the access requirements for the region would otherwise not be met except for the approval of limited risk or fallback plan only the minimum number of limited risk plans necessary for region to meet access requirements may be approved the secretary shall provide priority to those with the highest level of risk in case can the reduction of risk provide for or minimis level of financial risk there is limit on the number of full risk plans that may be approved fallback if required access is not provided including through limited risk plan the act establishes fallback process the secretary is required to establish separate process for the solicitation of bids from eligible fallback entities single fallback entity may not offer all fallback plans throughout the united states the secretary can only approve one fallback plan for all fallback service areas in any pdp region for contract period competitive contracting provisions apply the secretary shall approve fallback plans so that if there are any fallback service areas in the region for the year they are offered at the same time as prescription drug plans would otherwise be offered fallback prescription drug plans are permitted to offer only standard prescription drug coverage and meet such other requirements specified by the secretary the fallback plan would not be permitted to engage in any marketing or branding of the contract under fallback contract the secretary would pay actual costs of part d covered drugs taking into account negotiated price concessions payment would also be made for prescription management fees tied to performance management requirements established by the secretary beneficiary premiums under fallback plans would be uniform and equal to 26 of the secretarys estimate of the average monthly per capita actuarial cost including administrative costs to the entity offering the fallback plan the federal government would pay the remainder in general contract requirements for fallback plans would be the same as those established for prescription drug plans contract for fallback plan would be for three years and be renewable after subsequent bidding process however contract could not apply in an area in any year unless the area was fallback service area contract requirements the act establishes organizational requirements for pdp sponsors in general pdp sponsor must be licensed under state law as risk bearing entity eligible to offer health insurance or health benefits coverage in each state in which it offers prescription drug plan alternatively it could meet crs8 solvency standards established by the secretary for entities not licensed by the state to the extent an entity is at risk it must assume financial risk on prospective basis for covered benefits that are not covered by direct subsidy payments pdp plan sponsors would be required to enter into contract with the secretary under which the sponsor agreed to comply both with the applicable requirements and standards and the terms and conditions of payment premiums the conferees have stated that the average monthly beneficiary premium in 2006 will be 35 and represent on average 26 of the cost of the benefit provided the act specifies the calculation as follows the monthly beneficiary premium for prescription drug plan is defined as the base beneficiary premium as adjusted the base beneficiary premium equals the product of the beneficiary premium percentage and the national average monthly bid amount the beneficiary premium percentage is equal to 1 26 divided by 2100 minus percentage equal to total reinsurance payments divided by the sum of such reinsurance payments and total payments the secretary estimates will be paid to prescription drug plans in year that are attributable to the standardized bid amount taking into account amounts paid by the secretary and enrollees and the application of risk adjustment the national average monthly bid amount is weighted average of standardized bid amounts for each prescription drug plan and each mapd plan once the base beneficiary premium is calculated it is adjusted up or down as appropriate to reflect differences between it and the geographicallyadjusted national average monthly bid amount it is further increased for any supplemental benefits and decreased if the individual is entitled to lowincome subsidy the premium is uniform for all persons enrolled in the plan except for those receiving lowincome subsidies or those subject to late enrollment penalty late enrollment penalties would be applied to beneficiaries who failed to maintain creditable coverage for period of 63 days within continuous period of eligibility beginning on the day after the individuals initial enrollment period and ending on the date of enrollment in prescription drug plan or mapd plan beneficiary premium payments may be paid directly to the pdp sponsor or ma organization alternatively the beneficiary has the option of having the amount withheld from his or her social security payment or having payment made through an electronic funds transfer mechanism payments withheld are to be paid to the pdp sponsor premium and costsharing subsidies for lowincome individuals the act provides premium and costsharing subsidies for lowincome subsidy eligible individuals there are two groups of subsidy eligible individuals the first group is composed of persons who 1 are enrolled in prescription drug plan or mapd plan 2 have incomes below 135 of poverty and 3 have resources in 2006 below 6000 for an individual and 9000 for couple increased in future years by the percentage increase in the cpi also included in this group are persons who are dually eligible for medicare and medicaid regardless of whether or not they meet the other eligibility requirements the second group of subsidy eligible individuals are persons meeting the same requirements except that the income level is 150 of poverty and an alternative resources standard may be used this alternative crs9 standard in 2006 is 10000 for an individual and 20000 for couple increased in future years by the percentage increase in the cpi individuals with incomes below 135 of poverty and resources meeting the requirement for the first group will have premium subsidy equal to 100 of the lowincome benchmark premium amount essentially weighted average for the region but in case higher than the actual premium amount for basic coverage under the plan other lowincome subsidy eligible persons will have sliding scale premium subsidy ranging from 100 of such value at 135 of poverty to 0 of such value at 150 of poverty persons below 135 of poverty will have premium subsidy for any late enrollment penalty equal to 80 for the first 60 months of delayed enrollment and 100 thereafter beneficiaries in both groups are entitled to costsharing subsidies individuals with incomes below 135 of poverty and resources meeting the requirement for the first group will have deductible costsharing for all costs up to the outofpocket threshold of 2 for generic drug or preferred multiple source and 5 for any other drug institutionalized dual eligibles will have costsharing full benefit dual eligibles with incomes up to 100 of poverty will have costsharing for all costs up to the outofpocket threshold of 1 for generic drug or preferred multiple source and 3 for any other drug other lowincome subsidy eligible persons will have 50 deductible 15 costsharing for all costs up to the outofpocket limit and cost sharing for costs above the outofpocket threshold of 2 for generic drug or preferred multiple source and 5 for any other drug the deductible amounts are increased each year beginning in 2007 by the annual percentage increase in per capita beneficiary expenditures for part d covered drugs the costsharing amounts are increased by the increase in the consumer price index eligibility determinations are to be made under the state medicaid plan for the state or by the commissioner of social security the determinations shall remain effective for period determined by the secretary not to exceed one year full dual eligible persons are to be treated as subsidy eligible persons the secretary may provide that other medicaid beneficiaries be treated as subsidy eligible the secretary will provide process whereby the secretary will notify the pdp sponsor or ma organization that an individual is eligible for subsidy and the amount of the subsidy the sponsor or entity would reduce the premiums or costsharing otherwise imposed by the amount of the subsidy the act specifies that medicare is the primary payer for covered drugs for dual eligibles medicaid coverage is not available for such drugs or any costsharing for such drugs in 2006 states are liable for approximately 90 of the costs they would otherwise incur if drug coverage for dual eligibles continued to be offered under medicaid by 2015 this percentage drops to 75 direct subsidies federal subsidy payments will be made to qualifying entities the stated purpose of such payments is to reduce premiums for all beneficiaries consistent with an overall subsidy level of 74 for basic coverage reduce adverse selection among plans and promote the participation of pdp sponsors and ma organizations such payments would be made as direct subsidies and through reinsurance crs10 the act specifies formula for the calculation of the direct monthly per capita subsidy amount it is equal to the plans standardized bid amount adjusted for health status and risk and reduced by the base beneficiary premium as adjusted to reflect the difference between the bid and the national average bid reinsurance payments equal to 80 of allowable costs would also be provided for an enrollee whose costs exceeded the annual outofpocket threshold 3600 in 2006 risk corridors the act provides for the establishment of risk corridors which are defined as specified percentages above and below target amount the target amount is defined as total payments paid to the plan taking into account the amount paid by the secretary and enrollees based on the standardized bid amount risk adjusted and reduced by total administrative expenses assumed in the bid payment adjustments will be made if adjusted allowable costs for the plan are at least equal to the first threshold lower limit of the first risk corridor but not greater than the first threshold upper limit of the risk corridor for the year ie if the plans are within the first risk corridor portion of any plan spending above or below these levels is subject to risk adjustment if adjusted allowable costs exceed the first threshold upper limit then payments are increased if adjusted allowable costs are below the first threshold lower limit then payments are reduced adjusted allowable costs are reduced by reinsurance and subsidy payments payment adjustments would not affect beneficiary premiums during 2006 and 2007 plans will be at full risk for adjusted allowable risk corridor costs within 25 above or below the target plans with adjusted allowable costs above this level will receive increased payments if their costs are between 25 of the target first threshold upper limit and 5 of the target second threshold upper limit they will be at risk for 25 of the increased amount that is their payments will equal 75 of adjusted allowable costs for spending in this range if their costs are above 5 of the target they will be at risk for 25 of the costs between the first and second threshold upper limits and 20 of the costs above that amount that is their payments will equal 80 of the adjusted allowable costs over the second threshold upper limit conversely if plans fell below the target they will share the savings with the government they will have to refund 75 of the savings if costs fall between 25 and 5 below the target level and 80 of any amounts below 5 of the target higher risk sharing percentage will apply in 2006 and 2007 if the secretary determines that 60 of prescription drug plans and mapd plans representing at least 60 of beneficiaries enrolled in such plans have adjusted allowable costs that are more than the first threshold upper limit in this case payment to plans would equal 90 of adjusted allowable costs between the first and second upper threshold limits for 20082011 the risk corridors will be modified plans will be at full risk for drug spending within 50 above or below the target level plans will be at risk for 50 of spending exceeding 50 and below 100 of the target level additionally they will be at risk for 20 of any spending exceeding 10 of the target level subsidies for retiree plans under certain conditions the secretary is required to make special subsidy payments to sponsors of qualified retiree crs11 prescription drug plans these payments are to be made on behalf of an individual covered under the retiree plan who is entitled to enroll under pdp or mapd plan but elected not to subsidy payments will equal 28 of retirees gross covered retiree planrelated prescription drug costs over the 250 deductible but not over 5000 the dollar amounts would be adjusted annually by the percentage increase in medicare per capita prescription drug costs relationship to other programs the act requires the secretary by july 1 2005 to establish requirements to ensure effective coordination between part d plan both prescription drug plan and mapd plan and state pharmaceutical assistance program the coordination requirements are to relate to payment of premiums and coverage and payment for supplemental drug benefits requirements must be included for enrollment filesharing claims processing claims reconciliation reports application of the catastrophic outofpocket protection and other administrative procedures specified by the secretary similar coordination provisions are to be applied to other prescription plans including medicaid including plan operating under an 1115 waiver group health plans federal employees health benefits plan military coverage including tricare and other coverage specified by the secretary medigap the act prohibits effective january 1 2006 the selling issuance or renewal of existing medigap policies with prescription drug coverage for part d enrollees the prohibition does not apply to renewal of medigap prescription policies for persons who are not part d enrollees persons enrolling under part d during the initial enrollment period may enroll in medigap plan without drug coverage or continue their previous policy as modified to exclude drugs medigap issuers will be required to notify individuals of these changes 60 days prior to the initial part d enrollment period medicare prescription drug discount card for the period prior to implementation of the new drug program the secretary was required to establish temporary program to endorse prescription drug discount card programs meeting certain requirements the purpose is to provide access to prescription drug discounts through card sponsors to persons who voluntarily enroll in the program each card sponsor is to provide each enrollee with access to negotiated prices the program also provides transitional assistance for lowincome persons enrolled in endorsed programs2 the act requires the secretary to implement the program so that discount cards and transitional assistance are available later than six months after enactment it does not apply to covered discount card drugs dispensed after december 31 2005 the act specifies that persons eligible for the discount card are those entitled to or enrolled under part or enrolled under part b however an individual enrolled in medicaid or under any section 1115 medicaid waiver who is entitled to any 2 for discussion of the card program see crs report rl32283 medicare endorsed prescription drug discount card program by jennifer osullivan crs12 medical assistance for outpatient prescribed drugs is not discount cardeligible individual an individual not enrolled in card program may enroll in any card program serving residents of the state at any time beginning on the initial enrollment date and before january 1 2006 discount eligible individual may only be enrolled in one endorsed card program at time an individual enrolled in one program in 2004 may change the election for 2005 card sponsor may charge an annual enrollment fee not to exceed 30 the act provides special provisions for lowincome persons defined as those with incomes below 135 of poverty transitional assistance eligible individual is entitled to have his or her discount card enrollment fee paid those individuals with incomes below 100 of poverty special transitional assistance eligible individuals are liable for coinsurance charges of 5 of incurred costs up to 600 in both 2004 and 2005 other transitional assistance eligible individuals those with incomes between 100 and 135 of poverty are liable for coinsurance charges of 10 of incurred costs up to 600 in both 2004 and 2005 thus the program pays 95 of special transitional eligible individuals incurred drug costs up to 600 in 2004 and 90 of other transitional eligible individuals incurred drug costs up to 600 in 2004 similarly payment is made for 95 or 90 whichever is appropriate of the individuals incurred drug costs up to 600 in 2005 in addition any balance left over from 2004 may be added to the amount available in 2005 except rollover is permitted if the individual voluntarily disenrolled from an endorsed program certain persons are not eligible for transitional assistance these are persons who have coverage for drugs under group health plan federal employees health benefits plan or through coverage made available to members of the uniformed services medicare advantage the act establishes the medicare advantage ma program under part c of medicare to replace the medicarechoice program ma local plans continue to be offered as coordinated care and other plans on countywide basis beginning in 2006 in addition to the ma local plans the ma program will begin to offer ma regional coordinated care plans that cover both in and outofnetwork required services beginning in 2010 the comparative cost adjustment cca program will be established for sixyear period to 1 examine new ma payment system under which payments to ma plans would be based on weighted average of plans bids and 2 introduce possible adjustments either increases or decreases to feefor service part b premiums based on comparison of the costs of providing required feeforservice benefits to the costs of providing the same benefits in the ma program beneficiaries in ma plans will not be required to enroll in the new prescription drug program part d however at least one plan offered by an ma organization in an area is required to offer part d prescription drug coverage therefore if the beneficiary has only one available ma plan from which to chose then in effect the beneficiary must enroll in part d in order to enroll in plan crs13 prior to the enactment of the act medicarechoice mc plans were paid an administered monthly payment called the mc payment rate for each enrollee the per capita rate for payment area was set at the highest of one of three amounts 1 minimum payment or floor rate 2 rate calculated as blend of an areaspecific local rate and national rate or 3 rate reflecting minimum increase from the previous years rate currently 2 for 2004 the act modified payments to ma plans first fourth payment mechanism was added so that plans are paid the highest of the floor minimum percent increase the blend or new amount the new payment amount is 100 of feeforservice ffs payments made for persons enrolled in traditional medicare the ffs payment is calculated based on the adjusted average per capita cost for the year for an ma payment area county for services covered under medicare parts and b for beneficiaries entitled to benefits under part enrolled in part b and not enrolled in an ma plan second there was change made to the blend payment so that there is adjustment for budget neutrality in 20043 third the calculation of the minimum percentage increase was also be revised for 2004 and beyond the minimum percentage increase is the greater of 2 increase over the previous years payment rate as under current law or the previous years payment increased by the growth in overall medicare for the previous year beginning in 2005 the statute longer allows ma payments to be annually updated by the floor or blend thus only the minimum increase and in certain years4 100 of per capita ffs will be used to update payment rates additional changes to the ma program will be made beginning in 2006 the secretary will determine ma payment rates by comparing plan bids to benchmark plans will submit bids for providing required parts and b benefits the benchmark will be calculated by updating the previous years capitation rate by the annual increase in the minimum percentage increase for plans with bids below the benchmark the payment will equal the unadjusted ma statutory nondrug monthly bid amount as adjusted and the rebate the rebate will equal 75 of any average per capita savings the amount by which the riskadjusted benchmark exceeds the risk adjusted bid the rebate may be used to provide additional benefits reduce cost sharing or may be applied towards the monthly part b premium prescription drug premium or supplemental premium the remaining 25 of the average per capita savings will be retained by the federal government for plans with bids at or above the benchmark for which there are average per capita monthly savings the payment amount will equal the ffs areaspecific nondrug monthly benchmark amount as adjusted for the plans with bids above the benchmark the enrollees premium will equal the full amount by which the bid exceeds the benchmark 3 under current law budget neutrality adjustment is made so that estimated total mc payments in given year will be equal to the total payments that would be made if payments were based solely on areaspecific rates the budget neutrality adjustment may only be applied to the blended rates because rates cannot be reduced below the floor or minimum increase amounts 4 the secretary must rebase or update 100 of ffs at least once every three years but could also choose to update more often in years in which the secretary does not rebase ffs payments ma payments would be based on the minimum update only crs14 beginning in 2006 the ma program will also begin to offer ma regional coordinated care plans that cover both in and outofnetwork required services there will be at least 10 regions established and more than 50 regions each ma regional plan must offer maximum limit on outofpocket expenses and unified deductible each year an organization will submit separate monthly bid amount for each plan it intends to offer in region payments will be based on competitive bidding system so that the benchmark for ma regions will be calculated using statutory formula that includes weighted average of plan bids for the region for plans with bids below the benchmark for which there are average per capita monthly savings the payment will equal the unadjusted ma regional statutory nondrug monthly bid amount as adjusted and the rebate the plan will provide the enrollee monthly rebate equal to 75 of the average per capita savings for plans with bids at or above the benchmark for which there are average per capita monthly savings the payment amount will equal the regionspecific nondrug monthly benchmark amount as adjusted for the plans with bids above the benchmark the enrollees premium will be increased by the full amount by which the bid exceeds the benchmark the act also establishes stabilization fund to provide incentives for plans to enter into and to remain in the ma program there will be 10 billion initially provided to the stabilization fund and additional amounts will be added to the fund from portion of any average per capita monthly savings amounts5 the secretary will be responsible for determining the amounts that may be given to ma plans from this fund based on statutory requirements for example the national bonus payment will be available to an ma organization that offers an ma regional plan in every ma region in the year but only if there was national plan in the previous year during 2006 and 2007 medicare will share risk with ma regional plans if plan costs fall above or below statutorilyspecified risk corridor if the secretary determines that plans allowable costs are over 103 of specified target amount the plan will receive an additional payment conversely if regional plans allowable costs are under 97 of the specified target amount the plan will receive decrease in its payment the act requires the secretary to establish program for the application of comparative cost adjustment cca in cca areas the sixyear cca program begins january 1 2010 and ends december 31 2015 the cca program is designed to examine the efficiency of private plans in the medicare program verses traditional medicare for that purpose 1 payments to local ma plans would be based on competitive bids similar to payments for the regional ma plans and 2 premiums for individuals enrolled in traditional medicare could be adjusted either up of down upon completion of the cca program the secretary will submit report to congress that evaluates the cost of the program provider access beneficiary satisfaction and recommendations for any extension or expansions 5 beneficiaries receive 75 of average per capita savings in the form of rebate the federal government retains the remaining 25 of the average per capita savings and onehalf of the amount retained by the federal government is available to the stabilization fund crs15 the secretary will select cca areas from among those metropolitan statistical areas msa or such similar area as the secretary recognizes that meet certain requirements the requirements for an msa to qualify as cca include 1 for the reference month in 2010 defined as the most recent month during the previous year for which the secretary determines that data are available to compute the relevant calculation at least 25 of ma eligible individuals who reside in the msa are enrolled in an ma local plan and 2 before the beginning of 2010 at least two ma local plans will be offered by different organizations in the msa during the annual coordinated election period each meeting the current law minimum enrollment requirements for plan as of the reference month the number of msas selected may not exceed the lesser of six sites or 25 of the number of msas meeting the requirements additionally an ma local area county in an msa will be excluded from the cca area if in 2010 it does not offer at least two ma local plans each offered by different ma organization payments will be based on competitive bidding system so that the benchmark for cca areas will be calculated using statutory formula that includes weighted average of plan bids for the area similar to the rebates under the ma program beneficiaries in cca areas will receive rebate equal to 75 of the average per capita monthly savings for plans with bids below the cca benchmark for plans with bids above the benchmark the enrollees premium will be equal to the full amount by which the bid exceeds the benchmark the cca program is phased in through 2013 during the first year of the phasein 2010 the benchmark is one fourth cca benchmark and threefourths noncca benchmark increasing the cca share by another onefourth each year until the benchmark is 100 cca the cca program will introduce competition between traditional ffs medicare and local private plans as result an individual residing in cca area who is enrolled in part b of medicare but not enrolled in an ma plan can have an adjustment to his or her part b premium either as an increase or decrease premium adjustment will be made for individuals for month that they are subsidy eligible individual those individuals qualifying for subsidy under the part d prescription drug program the part b premium adjustment for ffs beneficiaries in cca areas will be made as follows 1 if the ffs areaspecific nondrug amount for the month does not exceed the cca nondrug benchmark the part b premium is reduced by 75 of the difference and 2 if the ffs areaspecific nondrug amount for the month exceeds the cca nondrug benchmark the part b premium is increased by the full amount of the difference this adjustment will be phasedin over four years there is also 5 annual limit on the adjustment so that the amount of the adjustment for year can not exceed 5 of the amount of the monthly part b premium as otherwise determined cbo estimates that over the 10year period fy2004fy2013 direct spending will be increased by 142 billion for the provisions of title ii of that total 141 billion will be for payments to ma plans and 04 for other provisions offsetting those costs cbo estimates savings from the cca programs payments to plans of 03 billion crs16 cost containment the act requires the president to propose and congress to consider legislation to address medicare spending any time general revenue funding6 of medicare is projected to exceed 45 in two consecutive years specifically the medicare board of trustees of the hospital insurance trust fund part and the supplementary medical insurance trust fund part b are required to include the their annual reports determination as to whether excess general revenue medicare funding exceeds 45 excess general revenue medicare funding is general revenue medicare funding defined as total medicare outlays minus dedicated medicare financing expressed as percentage of total medicare outlays for the purposes of this provision total medicare outlays are defined as total outlays from the medicare trust funds and includes medicare administrative expenditures dedicated medicare financing includes medicare payroll taxes premiums for part a7 part b and part d transfers from the railroad retirement accounts taxation of certain oasdi benefits state transfers for medicare coverage of beneficiaries who receive public assistance and gifts8 beginning with their report in 2005 the trustees annual report is required to include information on 1 projections of growth of general revenue medicare spending as percentage of the total medicare outlays for each year within seven fiscalyear timeframe and 10 50 and 75 years after the fiscal 2 comparisons with the growth trends for the gross domestic product private health costs national health expenditures and other appropriate measures 3 expenditures and trends in expenditures under part d and 4 financial analysis of the combined medicare part and part b trust funds if general revenue funding for medicare were limited to 45 of total medicare outlays the trustees reports are also required to include determination as to whether there is projected to be excess general revenue medicare funding for any of the succeeding six fiscal years in their annual reports of medicares trust funds an affirmative determination of excess general revenue funding of medicare for two consecutive annual reports will be treated as funding warning for medicare in the second year for the purposes of the presidents budget content and submission to congress whenever any trustees report includes determination that within the 6 currently 75 of the part b trust fund financing comes from general revenues the remaining 25 comes from beneficiary premiums that beneficiaries voluntarily pay to enroll in medicare part b the 2003 monthly premium is 5870 the part trust fund revenues come primarily from payroll taxes employers and employees each pay 145 of the employees earnings while selfemployed workers pay 29 of their net income other hi revenue sources include interest on the investments of the trust fund federal income taxes on social security benefits premiums from voluntary enrollees into part railroad retirement account transfers and reimbursement for certain uninsured persons 7 small number of medicare beneficiaries are not entitled to part but are eligible to purchase the part benefit by paying monthly premiums currently 316 per month 8 excluded from the list is interest on the part trust fund according to the medicare trustees 2002 report this amounted to approximately 77 of the revenue to the trust fund in 2002 crs17 sevenfiscalyear timeframe that there is excess general revenue medicare funding the president is required to submit to congress proposed legislation to respond to the warning procedures and timeframes for house and senate consideration of the legislation are prescribed administration of medicare part c and part d the medicare program is administered by the centers for medicare medicaid services cms within the department of health and human services hhs both the house and senate bills would have established new agency to administer medicare advantage and part d prescription drugs within hhs but separate from cms in the act new center for beneficiary services within cms is established to administer medicare advantage the prescription drug benefit and beneficiary information activities appeals regulatory and contracting provisions the act contains numerous provisions addressing medicare appeals regulatory relief and contracting reform specifically the act modifies the way medicare regulations and guidance are communicated modifies the procedures used to resolve payment disputes and establishes various provider appeal processes particularly for those who face termination of medicare participation or denial of their application to participate in the program the act refines the information required to be provided in the appeals process and makes other modifications the administrative law judge alj function for medicare hearings is required to be transferred from the social security administration ssa to hhs later than october 1 2005 the act gives the secretary the authority to competitively contract for claims processing services with any qualified entities requires these contracts to be competitively bid at least every five years and places new requirements on the medicare claims processing contractors including an increased emphasis on provider education other program changes demonstration projects and mandated studies are also included in the act the act authorizes increased funding but action by the appropriations committees is required for cms to receive additional money crs18 provisions affecting medicares feeforservice program payments demonstration projects expansion of covered benefits and beneficiary cost sharing changes to medicares feeforservice program 9 the act contains extensive changes to medicares feeforservice ffs program including payment increases and in certain instances decreases development of competitive acquisition programs implementation or refinement of other prospective payment systems notably the development of an endstage renal disease esrd basic payment system expansion of covered preventive benefits establishment of demonstration programs and required studies the anticipated financial impact of these changes on any individual provider physician or supplier will vary depending on many factors such as the unique characteristics of the individual or entity participating in medicare as well as the number and type of services provided to the medicare beneficiaries they serve selected highlights of the ffs payment provisions and those establishing preventive care benefits and demonstration programs will be briefly described selected rural provider provisions generally medicare payments to certain rural providers increase many of the rural provisions benefit urban providers as well cbo estimated that the rural provisions in title iv of the act increase medicares direct spending by 93 billion from 2004 through 2008 and by 199 billion from 2004 though 2013 it should be noted that other provider payment provisions in the law can impact rural providers but their cost implications for rural providers is unclear rural hospitals rural hospitals and hospitals in small urban areas receive an permanent 16 increase to medicares base rate or per discharge payment the limit on rural and small urban hospitals that qualify for disproportionate share hospital dsh payments increases from 525 to 12 hospitals in low wage areas those with wage index values below 1 receive additional payments through decrease from 71 to 62 in the laborrelated portion of the base payment rate certain small rural hospitals with less than 50 beds those in newly established scarcity areas receive cost reimbursement for outpatient clinical laboratory tests rural hospitals with less than 100 beds are protected from payment declines associated with the hospital outpatient prospective payment system opps for an additional two years these opps hold harmless provisions are extended to sole community hospitals for services from 2004 through 2006 cbo estimated that these provisions increase direct medicare spending by 156 billion over the 10year period 9 for detailed discussion of these provisions see crs report rl32005 medicare fee forservice modifications and medicaid provisions of hr 1 as enacted by sibyl tilson et crs19 critical access hospitals critical access hospitals cahs have their bed limit increased from 15 to 25 there is restriction on the number of these beds that can be used for acute care services at any one time cahs are able to establish distinct part rehabilitation and psychiatric units of up to 10 beds that will not be included in the cah bed count cost reimbursement of cah services increased to 101 of reasonable costs starting january 1 2004 periodic interim payments for cahs are authorized state authority to waive the 35mile requirement for new entities to qualify as cah will be eliminated as of january 1 2006 cbo estimated that these provisions increase direct medicare spending by 900 million over the 10 year period rural physicians rural physicians in newly established scarcity areas receive 5 increase in medicare payments in 2005 2006 and 2007 physicians in certain lowcost areas with geographic adjustment factors below 1 receive payment increases so as to increase this factor to 1 starting in 2004 through 2006 cbo estimated that these provisions will increase direct medicare spending by 17 billion over the 10year period rural practitioners rural practitioners in rural health clinics and federally qualified health centers can bill separately for services provided to beneficiaries in skilled nursing facilities cbo estimated that these provisions increase direct medicare spending by 100 million over the 10year period rural home health providers rural home health providers received 5 increase in medicare payments for one year beginning april 1 2004 cbo estimated that this oneyear increase will increase direct medicare spending by 100 million over the 10year period selected acute hospital provisions generally medicare payments to hospitals increase under the law acute hospitals paid under the inpatient prospective payment system ipps that submit data on specified quality indicators will receive full update from 2005 through 2007 those hospitals that do not submit such data will receive an update minus 04 percentage points for the year in question cbo expected that this latter provision will reduce direct spending 02 billion from 2004 through 2008 teaching hospitals will receive an increase of an expected 400 million in their indirect medical education payments from 2004 through 2006 onetime geographic reclassification process to increase hospitals wage index values for three years that was expected to increase payments by 900 million from 2004 through 2008 was established low volume hospitals with fewer than 800 discharges that are 25 road miles away from similar hospital may qualify for up to 25 increase in its medicare payments changes to outpatient hospital payments for covered drugs were expected to increase payments by 700 million from fy2004 through fy2008 redistribution of unused resident positions increase both direct and indirect graduate medical education spending by an anticipated 200 million from fy2004 thought fy2008 and by 600 million from fy2004 through fy2013 certain teaching hospitals with high per resident payments will not receive payment increase from fy2004 through fy2013 this provision was scored by cbo as reduction in medicare spending of 500 million from fy2004 through fy2008 and 13 billion from fy2004 through fy2013 for 18 months from the date of enactment physicians can not to refer medicare patients to specialty hospitals in crs20 which they have an investment interest this provision does not apply to hospitals that are in operation or under development before november 18 2003 both medpac and hhs are to complete required studies on specialty hospitals within 15 months of enactment selected physician provisions the impact of the act on medicares spending for physician spending is difficult to determine although physicians receive 15 update in 2004 and 2005 which is expected to increase spending by 28 billion from fy2004 through fy2007 subsequently from fy2008 through fy2012 the provision is expected to result in decline of 28 billion in medicare spending medicares payments for practice expenses particularly the administration of covered drugs increased starting in 2004 transitional adjustment to the drug administration payments of 32 in 2004 and 3 in 2005 was also established these payment increases were expected to be counterbalanced by decrease in medicares payments for covered outpatient drugs provided in doctors office many covered outpatient drugs furnished in 2004 are reimbursed at 85 of the average wholesale price awp with certain of these drugs paid as low as 80 of the awp as of april 1 2003 blood clotting factors and other blood products drugs or biologicals drug products that were not available for payment by april 1 2003 covered vaccinations drug products furnished in during 2004 in connection with renal dialysis services drugs provided through covered durable medical equipment are paid at higher rate during 2004 the decline in payments for covered outpatient drugs in 2004 could only be implemented concurrently with the increased payments for the administration of the drugs starting in 2005 medicares payment for many covered outpatient drugs is based on average sales price methodology that uses different pricing and cost data depending on the prescription drug generally multiple source drugs are paid 106 of the average sales price single source drugs are paid 106 of the lower of the average sales price or the wholesale acquisition costs unless the widely available market price or the average manufacturer price for those drugs exceeds certain threshold starting in 2006 physicians will have the option of obtaining covered part b drugs from selected entities awarded contracts for competitively biddable drug products under the newly established competitive acquisition program selected provisions affecting other providers and practitioners the follow provisions affecting other providers and practitioners are included in the legislation ambulatory surgical centers payments to ambulatory surgical centers ascs are expected to be lower by 800 million from fy2004 through fy2008 and by 31 billion from fy2004 through fy2013 as result of the legislation ascs received an update of the consumer price index for all urban consumers cpiu minus 30 percentage points starting april 1 2004 and receive 0 update for services provided starting october 1 2004 through december 31 2009 therapy caps application of the caps on outpatient therapy services provided by nonhospital providers was suspended for the remainder of 2003 in 2004 and 2005 cbo estimated that the therapy cap moratorium will increase direct medicare spending by 700 million over the 10year period crs21 durable medical equipment dme competitive bidding for dme will be phased in beginning in 2007 with 10 of the largest metropolitan statistical areas and may be phased in first among the highest cost and highest volume items and services the update for most dme items and services and for prosthetics and orthotics is 0 in 2004 2005 2006 2007 and 2008 for 2005 payment for certain items oxygen and oxygen equipment standard wheelchairs nebulizers diabetic lancets and testing strips hospital beds and air mattresses are reduced by an amount calculated using 2002 payment amounts and specified payment amounts by fehp beginning january 1 2009 items and services included in the competitive acquisition program will be paid as determined under that program and the secretary can use this information to adjust the payment amounts for dme offtheshelf orthotics and other items and services that are supplied in an area that is not competitive acquisition area class iii items devices that sustain or support life are implanted or present potential unreasonable risk eg implantable infusion pumps and heart valve replacements and are subject to premarket approval the most stringent regulatory control receive the full increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers cpiu in 2004 2005 2006 2008 and subsequent year the secretary will determine the update in 2007 cbo scored the dme provisions of the bill as reducing spending by 68 billion over the 10year period home health home health agency payments were increased by the full market basket percentage for the last quarter of 2003 october november and december and for the first quarter of 2004 january february and march the update for the remainder of 2004 and for 2005 and 2006 is the home health market basket percentage increase minus 08 percentage points cbo estimated that this provision will reduce direct medicare spending by 65 billion over the 10year period the act suspended the requirement that home health agencies must collect oasis data on private pay nonmedicare nonmedicaid until the secretary reports to congress and publishes final regulations regarding the collection and use of oasis selected feefor service demonstration projects the act establishes numerous demonstration projects for the medicare program several demonstrations address aspects of disease management for beneficiaries with chronic conditions chronic care improvement under feeforservice the act requires the secretary to establish and implement chronic care improvement programs under feeforservice medicare to improve clinical quality and beneficiary satisfaction and achieve spending targets for medicare for beneficiaries with certain chronic health conditions participation by beneficiaries is voluntary the contractors are required to assume financial risk for performance under the contract cbo estimated that this demonstration will increase direct medicare spending by 500 million over the 10 year period chronically ill beneficiary research demonstration the act requires the secretary to develop plan to improve quality of care and to reduce the cost of care for chronically ill medicare beneficiaries within six months after enactment the plan is required to use existing data and identify data gaps develop research initiatives and propose intervention demonstration programs to provide better health crs22 care for chronically ill medicare beneficiaries the secretary is required to implement the plan later than two years after enactment coverage of certain drugs and biologicals demonstration the secretary is required by the act to conduct twoyear demonstration where payment is made for certain drugs and biologicals that are currently provided as incident to physicians services under part b the demonstration is required to provide for costsharing in the same manner as applies under part d of medicare the demonstration is required to begin within 90 days of enactment and is limited to 50000 medicare beneficiaries in sites selected by the secretary homebound demonstration the secretary is required to conduct two year demonstration project where beneficiaries with chronic conditions would be deemed to be homebound in order to receive home health services under medicare adult day care the secretary is required to establish demonstration where beneficiaries could receive adult day care services as substitute for portion of home health services otherwise provided in beneficiarys home expansion of covered benefits the act contains number of provisions that expand coverage beginning january 1 2005 including the following initial physical examination medicare coverage of an initial preventive physical examination is authorized for those individuals whose medicare coverage begins on or after january 1 2005 cbo estimated that this provision will increase direct medicare spending by 17 billion over the 10year period cardiovascular screening blood tests medicare coverage of cardiovascular screening blood tests is authorized cbo estimated that this provision will increase direct medicare spending by 300 million over the 10year period diabetes screening tests diabetes screening tests furnished to an individual at risk for diabetes for the purpose of early detection of diabetes are included as covered medical service in this instance diabetes screening tests include fasting plasma glucose tests as well as other tests and modifications to those tests deemed appropriate by the secretary cbo estimated that this provision will increase direct medicare spending less than 50 million over the 10year period screening and diagnostic mammography screening mammography and diagnostic mammography are excluded from opps and paid separately cbo estimated that this provision will increase direct medicare spending by 200 million over the 10year period intravenous immune globulin the act includes intravenous immune globulin for the treatment in the home of primary immune deficiency diseases as covered medical service under medicare cbo estimated that this provision will increase direct medicare spending by 100 million over the 10year period crs23 beneficiary cost sharing in feeforservice the act contains two provisions changing beneficiary cost sharing responsibilities under feeforservice medicare income relating to the part b premium the act increases the monthly part b premiums for higherincome enrollees beginning in 2007 beneficiaries whose modified adjusted gross income exceed 80000 and couples filing joint returns whose modified adjusted gross income exceeds 160000 will be subject to higher premium amounts the increase will be calculated on sliding scale basis and will be phasedin over fiveyear period the highest category on the sliding scale is for beneficiaries whose modified adjusted gross income is more than 200000 400000 for couple filing jointly cbo estimated that direct medicare spending will be reduced by 133 billion over the 10year period 2004 through 2013 indexing the part b deductible the medicare part b deductible remained 100 through 2004 increases to 110 for 2005 and in subsequent years the deductible will be increased by the same percentage as the part b premium increase specifically the annual percentage increase in the monthly actuarial value of benefits payable from the federal supplementary medical insurance trust fund will be used as the index medicaid and miscellaneous provisions title x of the act makes some changes to medicaid and other programs omitted from the act were two provisions contained in s 1 including provision to amend the age discrimination in employment act of 1967 to allow an employee benefit plan to offer different benefits to their medicare eligible employees than to their nonmedicare eligible employees and provision to allow states to cover certain lawfully residing aliens under the medicaid program cbo estimated the medicaid and other provisions included in the law will increase direct spending by 57 billion between fy2004 and fy2013 the following general points can be made about the medicaid and miscellaneous provisions included in title x of the act the act temporarily increases states disproportionate share hospital dsh allotments to erase the decline in these medicaid amounts that occurred after special rule for their calculation expired the act includes several other medicaid provisions including raising the floor on dsh allotments for extremely low dsh states providing dsh allotment adjustments impacting hawaii andor tennessee increasing reporting requirements for dsh hospitals and exempting prices of drugs provided to certain safety net hospitals from medicaids best price drug program miscellaneous provisions in title x of the act include funding federal reimbursement of emergency health services furnished to ndocumented aliens and funding administrative startup costs for crs24 medicare reform various research projects work groups and infrastructure improvement programs for the health care system tax incentives for health and retirement security title xii of the act authorizes new taxadvantaged accounts for medical expenses called health savings accounts hsas these accounts are similar to the medical savings accounts msas that were authorized by the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 pl 104191 but they will be more widely available and have more generous contribution limits as is the case with msas unused balances can be carried over from year to year contributions to hsas may be made when individuals have qualifying high deductible medical insurance and other health insurance with some exceptions in 2004 the insurance deductible for selfonly coverage must be at least 1000 rather than 1700 for msas while for family coverage it must be at least 2000 rather than 3450 for msas in 2004 contributions are limited to the lesser of the insurance deductible or 2600 for selfonly coverage and 5150 for family coverage individuals who are at least 55 years of age but not yet 65 can contribute more unlike msas hsas may be offered through an employers cafeteria plan for more details see crs report rs21573 taxadvantaged accounts for health care expenses sidebyside comparison the joint committee on taxation estimates that the revenue loss attributable to hsas for fy2004 through fy2013 will be 64 billion title xii of the act also includes provision allowing employers to exclude from gross income the medicare subsidy payments they receive to maintain prescription drug coverage for their retirees the joint committee on taxation estimates that the revenue loss attributable to this exclusion for fy2004 through fy2013 will be 178 billion the act does not include two tax provisions that had been in the house bill one authorizing health savings security accounts hssas and another allowing up to 500 in unused benefits in health care flexible spending arrangements to be rolled over to the following year or to an hsa hssa or certain qualified retirement plans for other versions of this document see
