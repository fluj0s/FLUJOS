routine 212 part ii lecture given on 27 november 1962 okay here we are second lecture november 27th ad 12 saint hill special briefing course and this is talk about r212 there have been an awful lot of queries about r212 i have actually audited this procedure and audited it and audited it and audited it and reviewed it and given out pieces of it to be audited actually for about eighteen months long time to audit procedure and ive made every mistake that youre going to make i made them all and followed them over the hills and far away and finally found out why theyre mistakes and the only thing that i have mapped here is an invariable procedure i have mapped an invariable procedure i have not mapped all the mistakes there isnt enough paper in christendom there just isnt enough to map all the mistakes that you could make with this people can always dream up more mistakes than you can circumvent and the only thing you can do is to try to get it down to terrifically invariable action now as training becomes advanced you of course expect people to be able to exercise judgment you give them more judgment factors to handle and so on remember that this one is designed for the hpahca level of action and it is very very close to totally muzzled totally invariable procedure and if you just stay on it as line why you will arrive at the other end now that it is an invariable procedure does not mean that it occasionally wont lay an egg youre going to get an occasional egg laid with it even though its done perfectly now why is this well put it this way youve picked up an item on your first list by some sort of an assessment which was not part of the gpm you could almost classify it as mistake but mistake that you would make you tiger drilled it and it had some withholds on it and it stayed in see it wasnt well cleaned up now it actuallyit isnt worthwhile to well clean up these items you dont have to sit there and polish up one of these items with tiger drill for three hours and half you understand youre mainly interested in the session withholds and suppressions you understand now in view of the fact that youre not going to tiger drill these things forever with big tiger and run prepcheck on the first list assessment item youre occasionally going to get one that is simply held down by couple of withholds or misdemeanor thats not connected to the gpm at which time you will lay an egg thats all right if you know that you can lay an egg with it why fine and that is the phenomenon which we have been calling in 3ga criss cross currying dead horse you can go on and curry this dead horse and polish up and gild his hoofs and polish his harness and do all sorts of things with him and buy him wreathes and so forth but it doesnt make him any less dead and youre notalsoyoure not going anyplace while you are currying the dead horse so you have to learn to recognize dead horse now the source of the dead horse is just what i have just given you there was something in on the list because it wasnt well cleaned up on the tiger drill and therefore the thing continued to read as the only thing in so you started busily and methodically to list this thing and so on itll happen sometimes that somebody will miss read or something like that on it or imagine he saw read or something or the meter will need new batteries or something goofy will occur you see that doesnt have anything to do with the technology and it gets something like this so you have to know this one it doesnt matter how come youve got dead horse you have to recognize what is dead horse and its an integral part of 212dead horses it is list whether represent or an oppose list which contains wide slams and that is dead horse youve gotten this thingyou see you dont have slam on your list one its rare that you would have slam on your list one but three cheers you do have slam on one and you just omit 4 5 and 6 but thats the only thing that happens so you have big slam going along on list one all right well you just omit 4 5 and 6 and directly oppose what you had on list one but that slam of course only occurs after assessment because that slam can shift around as you will rapidly learn what i mean by dead horse is represent or oppose list that does not slam after youve given it chance in listing if slam occurs anywhere on listing list with the mid ruds in for the session thats dead horse well how far do you have to go on list to find out if something is going to slam well frankly you can go as far as fifty if you havent got anyif nothing has slammed by the time you get to fifty items thats by the way about twice as long as i go but if you havent slammedif you havent read slam on this thing by the time that you get up to fifty items or something like that theres just little dirty needles dirty needles dirty needle and dirty read dirty read dirty read i should be saying youre going to lay an egg that list is going exactly place and the best thing to do with it is carry it to fifty if theres rock slam has appeared and the meter is hooked in abandon it now how do you readif thats the casethen how do you read slam while youre listing well its very simple on mark iv meter you turn it back to sensitivity 8 and carry your tone arm so that it is somewhere around the middle of the dial so youve got sensitivity 8 is your best action on mark iv meter that doesnt mean then that the needle is going to wander so far off that while youre listing youre in continuous and continual nervous prostration about catching up with this meter now what can throw you off pc who does calisthenics in the auditing chair can throw this off the best way to handle the pc is to say put the cans in your lap and sit still these pcs that scratch their head with cans and scratch their knees with cans and do this with cans and that with cans are actually in kind of rock slam all the time but you can cope with this and theres particular reason why you should permit this to be loused up justyou can put it in your rfactor and it wont surprise the pc you see you start throwing these cans around while im listing on list and i wont be able to see whether or not its valid list or not so im going to have to tell you to sit still put the cans in your lap and it wont break your pcs heart but dont go along with superpermissiveness that permits this all the time so that you never get rock slam visible now on mark v you set it at sensitivity 8 with the knob furthest to the left in other words you set that knob furthest to the left and sensitivity 8 actually the sensitivity could be little bit lower than 8 it could actually be down to about 6 and you would still be all right you would still see your rock slam that keeps yourthats to keep your needle from drifting around so madly and so wildly that you cant keep it on the dial and youre always having to adjust it and so forth well you can very visibly see rock slam if your sensitivities are as i have mentioned its necessary that you list with the tc on the meter otherwise you will never notice this and the meter should turned on there are lots oflots of ways that you can get dead horse list you can get them lot of ways and the most popular of these ways is not the way i mentioned but to get wrong assessment you get yourself wrong assessment and youre liable to get all manner of dead horse lists fellow cant go down and just sit there comfortably and read these things off barkbarkbarkbark and mark those that are in and winds up misses read misses two reads misses three reads as hes going down the list doesnt repeat find out if they did read or not just made up his mind that they didnt read and of course the item that he missed is the item which would have stayed in and he gets down to the end of the line and he becomes very wroth with the pc because he cant quite get anything to tiger drill in so he arc breaks the pc enough to get one of them to read now that is successful action in getting an item to read but its not going to be successful in listing that item and youre liable to have some item that shouldnt be reading anyway an emeter has the peculiar characteristic of spotting for you what pc can have reality on its actually reality indicator and if the thing reads well on an emeter or reads at all on an emeter you can get somewhere into the pcs zone of reality but supposing you have an arc broke item which is simply because the pcs never heard of it lets say mest were auditing raw meat pc and mest were on list one and hes never heard of mest and he doesnt know what it is well its been long time since weve stressed clearing the auditing command and somebody was writing as an emergency from an academy that all around him he saw pcs trying to answer questions in the academy that they didnt understand well i dont know anything about that i do know that somebody had neglected this old factor of clear the auditing command if the pc cant answer it why you have to word it up so that the pc can answer it and youre going to get something like this sooner or later youre going to get something like mest lets say that was on the listit isnt and the pc doesnt know what it is so every time you say it he wonders what it is and then he withholds asking you and of course at the end of the assessment it stays in now you say who or what represents miest to you and this is going to be wonderful mishmash believe that will breed more dead horses that can be easily buried that is going to be tough one is the misassessment the misassessment now misassessment will be caused because the pc didnt understand something it can also be caused because when the pc gave the word the auditor mistook the word and wrote down something else and of course when the auditors nulling the list he calls down the something else the pc doesnt recognize that as being in proper sequence and so tends to protest it which will therefore make it read theres another way of getting dead horse if you dont understand what the pc says even though the pc arc breaks every time you ask the pc what he saidyou understandif the pc arc breaks every time the way to really ruin his case is to put down something he said that you didnt understand that really ruins the lot you understand its much better to arc break him every word that he says than to write bad one on the list youll at least get list of sorts that has some possibility of having an item on it but you get one of them with an improper item on it the pc said cats and you wrote down scratch youre in mess i dont care if he says rrrh and that was supposed to be cats now the way you ask pc to repeat something is of interest to any auditor the way you ask him to repeat something is dont say you didnt say that clearly say it again see the pcs insession is very susceptible to comments of this particular kind you always say i didnt understand that what was it now pc very often believes that you have challenged him on the properness of the item on that list see he said bwwrr and that was supposed to be cats then you say i didnt understand that what did you say he very often thinks that you are telling him that cats dont belong on the list and that he shouldnt put it on the list so if pc is getting of this frame of mind you say i didnt understandi didnt understand that would you please spell it for youre going to be lot better off got it then you do want it on the list we want him to spell it if he cant spell youve had it now you mustnt say you didnt say it clearly and put the burden of responsibility for its incorrectness on the pc that is very improper and another thing that you mustnt do is repeat the item after the pc you just mustnt repeat the item after the pc he says cats you say cats thank you he says game warden you say game warden thank you he says tiger you say tiger thank you man itll drive him round the bend the highest point of psychology the tremendous zenith that they reached in all of their researches was machine that drove people crazy you said word into it and it said the word back and after that they had achieved the zenith and they stopped their researches but they did achieve something its wicked of you to continue to insist that the psychologist never never accomplished anything he did do this theres monument i think somewhere in the middle westbeen covered up during these last centuries but it says on this spot they invented the machine that drove people mad we put it there back in 2052 anyhow space opera i justall jokes aside the idea of repeating something back particularly little bit out of phase with the pccan make him feel like hes spinning particularly in susceptible condition insession so you mustnt repeat items to the pc its all right to null them but repeating them back to the pc every time he says them has tendency to shut him up i know you can play this game with little kids and they get big gag out of it remember youre playing it in the spirit of big gag its quite different proposition when youre just in there and youre writing down solemnly he says cats you say cats so forth see now the wrong way really to get an item straightened out is to say did you say interim he says anteroom see and you say did you say interim now he immediately has to protest that doesnt he and it will leave mark on the list that will show up during its nulling hell sometimes forget that he did it and itll still register youll get it off eventually but it takes lot of time so the saying words back to him which you didnt understsaying words back to him always carries the liability of your not having understood them and saying them differently aside from its factor of making him feel spinnywhy it looks like youre correcting him and hell take vast unction to it now that goes so far as never point to an item on list not did you mean this one just never do that in the first place you should never make motions toward the pc anyway his anchor points are peculiarly liable to being driven in by you the auditor to whom he has granted great deal of responsibility and power and you start pointing up the list in his direction he gets feelinghis whole theta beams will be pressed down against the end of your finger trying to bring your finger down to the point on the list where your finger should have stopped and you get the effort of that will read on the item youre discussing thats marvelous way to get wrong goal i myself have had wrong goal found on that way one day the auditor pointed to the wrong goal and said you mean that one i made remarki made remark and the remark was misinterpreted as to applying to another goal and the auditor pointed to the other goal and it stayed in by protest and it took the devils own time to find that protest when it was finally cleaned up it was just dug in but deep and youll find lot of items can be pushed in on list by the auditor pointing to items now the pc can put anything he likes on list but he must never take anything off of list he can put anything he likes on one he must never be able to take anything off of one he wants word changed you write the whole thing down with the changed word in it as brandnew item thats an invariable action he says to dance the hornpipe and then he says to be able to dance the hornpipe is what i meant and youre nulling to dance the hornpipe you say thank you very much and you write to be able to dance the hornpipe down underneath the one youre clearing and go on and finish clearing to dance the hornpipe and then take up the next one if its completely disrelated you put it at the end of the list hes got new one so you put it at the end of the list now thatshe wants the changed to an well now if youre sitting from the high pinnacle of always having put it down right first then this is change of the list and you wont run into any arc breaks to amount to anything if the pc tells you well thats to be able to dance the hornpipe and you say all right you want that on the list thank you very much and you put it on the list see pc says he doesnt want it on the list dont put it on the list he says just change that one and you say im awfully sorry the rules of the game i cant do that ive got to put it on the list down below here and i will ill write it down to be able to dance the hornpipe well see if that isnt it or not okay its usually okay with the pc these are the littlethe little points of listing that get overlooked that hang pcs with wrong items and that give you dead horses and other things like that so you just do the thing do good clean job on listing it and then do good clean job on nulling it and with right assessments it just runs like ball we havent made allowances for all of the ways that you can go reverse wise see we havent we havent said now these it so happens that if you null list which has given you consistently dirty needle and you take dirty needle final angle on the thing and then you oppose that that you wont wind up with very much and so forth and all of that has more or less been cut out of this thing we say you get clean assessment you take what stays in and you represent it you get rock slamming item and you oppose it in other words youve got an invariable action there if you cant carry out that invariable action dont try to carry out something else scrub your dead horse in other words youve been listing on this thing and man its just going place theres slam on it get your mid ruds in get your mid ruds in on this list has anything been suppressed and so forth get your mid ruds in make sure theyre nice and clean everything is fine and by the way never put mid ruds in when the pc originates that is absolutely against the law pc originates say you know i had an interesting thought then i thought that i must have suppressed that item i thought thati thought that cats never got that big actually and the auditor all right on this list has anything been suppressed man if you want to drive pc out of session just try that hes keeping his own ruds in so what so what hell eventually get so he wont its not you up to you to use mid ruds for punishment but at the same time dont shy off getting mid ruds in you know the reverse can happen every time i open my mouth if you operate from the armor plated turret of always doing good helpful job and doing everything you can do for the pc and doing everything youre supposed to be doing right and using very reliable processes believe you dont have any qualms about heading the pcs attention this way or that or straightening out something or other or going on and doing something if youre auditing with guilty conscience of not knowing quite whether youre doing right or not you are very vulnerable as an auditor because you think you might be committing overts and therefore you tend to withdraw from them and even an auditor whos auditing almost letter perfectly can sometimes be shaken up by pc who says oh there goes those damn mid ruds again all im doing is sitting here getting in mid ruds and moraooww see mid ruds well all right so you had to get in your mid ruds too often tell your pc im awful sorry im sorry treat it as an origin dont ask him dont punish him now with the random missed withhold question see thats the other thats the other mark of tyro say im awfully sorry but just exactly what are you doing there well i just and so on and so on all right what havent i found out about that see well soandso and soandso and soandso and thats what im trying to tell you you say all right im trying to get these in so i can get this needle straightened out and we can go on you know and ive got to put them in im sorry and go right on in and put them in well thats good auditing see but ive actually had pcs try to scold out of getting my rudiments in and yap at it and i dont care whether it was one reason or another i found out the way to handle the pc was to go ahead and put them in and the way to mess it all up was to try not to you know try to qanda with the pcs objection nope if youre operating from the certainty of being rightyoure doing your best for the pc and so forth and your pc starts to ream you out and you know very well you havent been using mid ruds to punish his withholds you see you know to punish him every time he originated excuse and you know you havent been misusing this and youve been handling him all right and the pcs going straight through the roof well dont qanda by going straight through the roof yourself go on and do what youre supposed to do hell simmer down sometimes has legitimate beef most of the time not get in your mid ruds now the next big source of dead horses is this incomplete list and i dont know how to tell you emphatically enough what an incomplete list is because actually ive been bleating and nattering and beating my gums and splintering bits of enamel out here for long time on the subject of incomplete lists and really nobody hears but i finally caught up with one thing that i mean to be very emphatic about i have caught out the auditor who says the pc said he put it on the list and therefore i stopped the list ive caught up with it if the pc says the last one he put on the list was it i will guarantee you that the list is not complete its that reversed pc says the list is complete just volunteers it i will absolutely guarantee you that the list is not complete i will guarantee you also that this has happened that coming right over the horizon is nice big rock slamming item and the pc has just chickened the pc hits the silk man he unloads right there and part of the sensation is is that he has put it on the list hes fooled himself what he really has said is hes put the last safe item on the list and ive tested this out some times now and i finally got the number because ive heard this for long time and i finally got this thing straight and made some tests on it and its arc broken the pc i made the test on well it does good for to tell you the list is complete because then i put that on the list because you just keep on going on and that sort of thing yeah but heres the test of the pudding are we getting the package and thats always the test of the auditing have we got the package that made the pc well this pc could have screamed bawled howled shouted through the entire session and if at the end of the session you have got an item to show for it i guarantee you that if it was the good item that everything is fine the pc will just itll all evaporate all the bad everything evaporates the one thing you can do wrong is not to get package not to get items reliable items thats what you can do wrong you knock off doing that and the pc will never forgive you what do you mean hes liable to say to you you mean just because i yelled and screamed and so forth you knocked off and didnt get the item what are you trying to do get even with unreasonable beast see youre handling very unreasonable breed of cat the pc is not forgiving you for getting the item and will never forgive you for not having gotten one so you take your choice now this is particularly true on scientology list where somebody is slamming bit on the list maybe theyre not slamming enough to make it really interesting or have rock slamming item but theres just quivers you know and zzz and quarterinch zzz and you go down bangbang dirty reads big dirty reads you know that sort of thing and youre going on down the line man when you start representing that youre liable to run yourself into more tears and protests and upsets than youve seen in long time pc just digs their heels into the auditing room floor and just isnt going to go forward from there wont list and so forth well anything short of mayhem make them list thats the answer to it the answer to it is to get the list because thats the only road out unless the pc has legitimate beef pc might have legitimate beef say well iyouyou just keep doing that youyou just keep reading that particular item and i tell you thats in because im just protesting it i dont believe that is it get the protest off the item and then test it again pc may be right see dont throw it down his throat but youre listing something and it seems to be quite legitimate list the pc all of sudden sets his heels he isnt going to go on well i dont know what you have to do to make some pcs go on but let tell you that whatever you have to do to make them go on the only thing youll never be forgiven for is not having made them 90 on thats what youll never be forgiven for that will really shock them and upset them i dont care so pc cries so the pc emotes so the pc gets mad so the pc does this so pcs are pcs get the list pc says im not going to list any more and thats it thats it thats the last item thats the last item youre going to get out of you say all right i understand how you feel lets see what are we listing from now turnip seeds all right listing from turnip seeds okay what do you think about them well i think its silly the whole thing is preposterous all right all right dont turn their cases around just keep them talking see keep them talking and more times youll be startled out of your wits theyll suddenly say well theres field hands theres feed stores theres this and youre back there listing again see dont try to take words out of what they are saying to you and list them they consider that terrible betrayal because they didnt give you the item therefore you have robbed them but you get yourself gooda good list that list is going to look in certain way as you are listing listnow heres the way list looksas youre listing list and you go down the line youre liable to run into dwindling rock slam or youre liable to run into sporadic occasional rock slam we dont care which you run into but if you dont get an item that slams when the list is being written down by you youve got list theres got to be some on it that slam man now how many is some well three or four in row one or two occasionally on the thing that arent attributable to the pcs moving his hands and youll find out that very often you run into the textbook dwindling rock slam every one rock slams little bit less every item he gives you you get little smaller rock slam on starts from dial wide or something like that goes to threequarters of dial and goes to half dial goes to quarter of dial goes to dirty reads dirty reads dwindle on down and go absolutely clean and slick as whistle and you say boy weve really done it now and you close your book and you start nulling and you are horrified to behold that you get dirty needle not dirty reads but you get dirty needle what the hells this dirty needle all about well its the list isnt complete thats what its all about lists go in through phases of looking flat now there are various tests you can get the mid ruds in and ask the question that youre listing from to see if it produces read that is really not an absolute guarantee that that list is listed out that is good indicator thats good indicator the absolute guarantee that it is an incomplete list occurs on this test when you go down the list nulling items you can clean up dirty needlenot dirty read but dirty needleby simply asking the pc if he thought of something you say to the pc did you think of something pc fishes around finally digs it up and says yes and your needle goes clean again if you have to use more mid rud than that that list is incomplete you see its not even mid ruds its just the offhand twoway comm question you just say well did you think of something pc said yes soandso and soandso and your needle cleans again now even that one if you have to pull it two or three times for ten items or twelve items man that list is not complete so you want to go at it this way is did you think of something this is alsothis is an invitation you see its twoedged sword its an invitation to give you his withhold or what he just thought or what he invalidated or something like that its an invitation to do that also an invitation to give you more items see did you think of something and then you can write this new item down at the end of the list but let tell you that pcs arc breaks about not completing the list do not stem from the auditing or auditing flubs they come entirely from the pcs unwillingness to confront because when list is complete the pc will list forever so when he ends listing is not test of complete list if list were complete he would go on listing but when list isnt complete he blows his stack he balks so any balk by the pc is an indication of an incomplete list simple just over the hillyou watch it youll see this manifestation from time to time youll be going down the line pocketapocketapocketapocketa and all of sudden the pc will say well thats strawberries thats it you say huh you know your pencil screams to rubbery stop he says yeah thats the item that that thats that is the one thatthat is the one well just for fun sometimes null the list youve just done you want to get skunked just null what youve just done you arent going to get anything its going to be one of these horrible things im going to put this in some bulletins so it can be spread more broadly im going to put some actual patterns of incomplete list nullings and some actual patterns of some actual complete list nullings boy they sure look different i did list the other night that was real complete list man i think on the whole list there were five items in and some fifteen pages on the first pass and boy the one that showed up at the end of that was the nicest juiciest matchedup item you ever saw yumyum you know was just out out out out out out out out out did you think of something you know oh so and so on suppressed something i thought that was funny all rightout out out out out outall right did you think of something yeah it was this brrt good all right third fourth page all of sudden ones in thats all right mark it in next one in uhuh uhuhuh well what have you been up to here what do you think about it and so on heres the list have you invalidated any of these things or anything like that i dont know oh that one that one hahaha yeah haha thought that one was awful funny hahaha an auditor gets an awful lot of you clowns and that sort of thing suppressed in doing this sort of thing anyway they just go right on down the line pocketapocketapocketa pocketapocketapocketapocketa one read out one read out one read out one read out one read out one read out see just nothing nothing nothing two in consecutively mid ruds went out imagine my embarrassment on one sector of it though i had two in consecutively two were actually in one after the other id gotten so cocky by that time i was pestering the pc because the second one was in of course you know then you say pardon you see and reallyreally apologize and keep on going but thatsthat is very ideal situation to get into and mary sue dragged out the other day some of the old 3d criss cross lists and i really am going to have to post them for you because youll scream man twelve items long this list is up to the point where the pc said didactically well that is it i have now put it on the list and then we have as many as twentyfour to twentyeight slant marks after each item oh you thought i was going to say the one that was in oh it went around to the back of the page and items resulted and we could never understand why the case wasnt getting anywhere that was why the case wasnt getting anywhere every time the pcd say well its on the list the auditor would stop and that was it and then start this arduous nulling you see three sessions later still trying to null twelve wild business man so anyway the pcthe pc actually slows down sees that just over the horizon there is the smell of danger one shouldnt go over that rise and so instantly gets up the one thats it presents it to the auditor and says they arent going to go any further than that theyll say it in various ways when you try to persuade the pc to go further than that they say it in various ways they just dont want to go any further now you shove themwell this is the other test you should makeyou shove them just few inches further and they start listing againslam you wont go four or five items beyond where they put it on the list before you are looking at the first rock slam you saw in the session in many cases thats quite amazing see marvelous and now heres another one for you you can have as many as about three groups of slams and slam will dwindle two or three times on list thats not common but it can be expected so that you have had dwindling slam is test at all except thats valid thing to list from you just keep going well how far do you keep going well until you dont have to get the mid ruds in to null it well how far is that well thats as far as it is how long is piece of string some pcs seem specialized in terribly long lists they just love these 589 lists you know let tell you pc has short lists there arent such things as lists of ten twelve fifteen or twenty twentyfive there are such lists you dont get short lists like that the person would be almost to ot before theyd give you lists like that you understand and then their confront would be up so high that you wouldnt have anything to know they would have blown them all anyhow so you just dont get short lists you get these longer lists and pc that works somewhere in the neighborhood of eighty to hundred and fifty on list is just dandy you can have list complete as short as sixty or seventy but not very often its eighty up some of these pcs go five hundredi think there are some who have gone as long as thousandare actually habitual theyre habitual i mean you ask for their next list and they give you five hundred you know well im sorry for it and im sorry that they do this they happen to be rare its much commoner to have pc that will run around hundred see but youve had it id up their auditing rates at once but anything that restrains pc or tries to keep the pc from doing proper length list will wreck your r212 just as it will wreck 3d3ga criss cross you say well your lists are too long i dont want to audit you theyll give you short lists with items on them then youre really wasting your auditing time see you find out theyll suppress items and put them out of sight then you never can get the needle cleaned up and you finally say well how come you suppressed all those items i mean you know they seem perfectly good items and weve now got them on the list but how come you suppressed them if you asked them something like that thats too jabbery and talky to for an auditing session but if you were to say something like that theyd say well wed get through so much faster if the list werent so long see if theyd given you their normal list you would have gotten through it and nulled it and found their item in two hours and half you see everything would have been dandy you see so on this is the second session which youve still been battling with this youve now burned up five auditing hours and the pc is trying to save you time im afraid as an auditor i never have quite measured up to the ideal auditor the ideal auditor would never say anything about it he would never say anything about it and im afraid after pc has done this to few times and so forth im liable to say to the pc thank you so much for your help im afraid im not completelynot completely proof against doing that thats the one that really gets though the pc is trying to help you out so that you cant even vaguely do your job oh what can you say you know and you sit there and you sweat it out and thats as far as id go there is just to thank them little too loudly they sometimes get the point and they say oh well you didnt want to do that you mean it would have got done faster if id justjust gone ahead and let you do it yeah thats what i mean ah well ill help you out next time thank you justjust sit there and answer the auditing question will you please but actually the more you beat up pc the less youre going to get done the more you harass pc the more you worry pc the more you yap at pc about dirty needle and so forth the less youre going to get done you should never yap at pc about dirty needle now youll rapidly come off of that and it wont be one of your sins as soon as you learn to complete list youll stop chopping up pcs for having dirty needle now although the ideal auditor the perfect auditor would never cause any arc break at all good auditor inevitably causes little bit inevitably its just part of the business youre going down the line and there you sit there and youre going down the line and youre checking this and that and youre saying catfish tigers waterbucks so forth and youre going down the line and all of sudden this thing is going bzzz bzzz bzzz bzzz bzzz bzzzzz your list is already 320 see now the ideal auditor would have completed the list in the first place but an actual auditor very often finds it out in midflight in other words theres difference between perfect ideal form and the form that you can achieve you can come awful close to perfect form but this one will always throw you the thing was clean everything was clean there was indicator clouds on the horizon everything was beautiful the sun was shining youre going down the list like mad and all of sudden clank you got dirty needle now if you say to the pc all right lets list some more items youre not going to get too much cooperation but frankly the more monkeying around you do why the less cooperation youre going to get so its almost that abrupt you say all right now i see here youve probably got some more items that you thought of in progress and were going to turn it over to the next page and now all right just give some more items and the pc says but weve done that twice and you say yeah im awful sorry but we have and so forth well just go back and you know kind of pick up one item there that you that you thought of when i was going along well gophers and you say gophers yeah give some more and the pcs all of sudden going aaaaaa you know straight down the line marvelous to behold sometimes they overlist five would have cleaned it up see and they give you twenty but never stop pc from listing youllbecause its too hard to get them started in the first place you never stop pc from listing never they go on and on and on and on and on well just sit there and take the items down now you can have as many as three dwindling rock slams from the same item that is little discovery that is quite interesting you thought there it was and it disappeared and it went to perfectly clean needle and you say ive got it made in the shade dont be too smug you keep on listing as long as the pc wants to list and you get your mid ruds in make test of the thing and so forth and watch that carefully because any slightest disturbance of that needle on that test means more items on that list the test simply consists of getting your mid ruds in and asking the question from which you were getting the items and you just ask that question and man watch that meter because if theres any roughup that needle was flowing and you asked the question and it stopped flowing and just sort of souped didnt read theres more items on the list and you say well all right try to sound happy about it say all right good well all right all right well i see youve got some more here and here we go and lets just write them up see get your mid ruds in and test the thing again its always an invariable action you get your mid ruds in and you test now on list one there is an accidental that you must know about on 3ga criss cross on all other steps of routine 212 you probably wont notice that before you start to null you have put in your mid ruds you see because you wrote the list and then you put in your mid ruds and tested the list so your mid ruds are in arent they and on list one the scientology list before you do it you havent completed any list so you havent put in the mid ruds so it becomes absolutely vital to get your mid ruds in on the scientology list now one of the reasons why you cant add anything to the scientology list turns up that if you ask the pc to add as much as one two or three items you have started the pc listing and will have to continue the pc listing it to get rid of your dirty needle but if it never occurred to the pc to list you wont have dirty needle but you get your mid ruds in not on the list you just get your mid ruds in for the session so forth but that becomes little extra piece of stuff that has to go on ahead of it just because in all other lists it occurs inevitably that you accidentally have gotten your mid ruds in at the beginning of the list see before you started nulling now if you add nothing to the scientology list you wont have dirty needle to worry about unless its just the dirty needle of missed withholds or the dirty needle of out mid ruds otherwise than that theres nothing different on h the first list than h any subsequent or successive lists now the thing to do in doing routine 212 is just keep your eye on what youre trying to do youre trying to find trace first in scientology because areas because thats closest to the session and then in the present time environment of the pc youre trying to find trace of the gpm and where it might be keyed in because the individual will then have chronic and consistent present time problem now having found this trace in present time you recognize that the other side of the packagethe second sphere the second valencethat is opposing that thing in present time is keyed in all the time but also recognize please as an auditor that it is complete lie that it is in present time it is only keyed into present time so the moment you start listing represent list your pc is going to fly out of present time but of course the thing isnt in present time where else could he go but out of present time he only thinks its in present time it only appears to be into present time to him and as soon as you represent why youll carry him out of present time but dont get too disturbed if for all his understanding of present time somebody starts to list backtrack like crazy well what else is there to list you dont think this life had enough duress in it even with the democrats in power you see and the republicans about to succeed them you see i mean even with combinations like that you still dont get masses of the gpm in this lifetime let assure you of that there couldnt be anyplace but the backtrack probably the thing he thinks is keyedin in present time actually was million years old at the very youngest so of course youre going to go backtrack that youre going backtrack doesnt invalidate it as wiping out the present time problem now one other thing you should realize is in 1938 there was this matter of identities similarities and differences and you saw it first in dianetics modern science of mental health see in other words everything is identical to everything see everything is identified with everything well of course this is the reason the present time problem is in present time he has got the gpm mass identified with the present time item nothing is wilder than this one that occurs in scientology organizations youre trying to help this guy out you see and he keeps shoving dirk in your back why well because youre the king of the gluklocks or something of course hes been dead several million years but somehow or another you restimulated him minds being minds now the aaa factor is terribly interesting to you from the viewpoint of the represent step of 212 you can represent anything and you will peel identifications off of it so the representing alone is auditing listing is auditing and by taking anything somebody is worried about and just representing itemsyou see oppose see you cant say what would oppose it this fellow says im awfully worried about ice cream cones im showing you now little shortcut goofball assist use of this just to teach you the principle see you cant say what would oppose ice cream cones and wind up anyplace because there is such package as something versus ice cream cones it doesnt exist hed have to invent it but you can say what would represent ice cream cones to you and hell give you the scale of substitutes for ice cream cones this helps him to differentiate so he sees theyre only similarities not identities now you can always use represent as an assist the fellows got bellyache you say all right now whats bellyache represent to you see you havent got him on the meter you havent done anything with him so whats bellyache represent to you well it represents this and that and the fact that i am dying andha thats real funny im not dying and he feels better you understand but youre handling now one of the most fundamental fundamentals there are with that represent list and any time you say who or what would do something youre still writing list and its still got some represent in it and youre actually using items to separate them out and get the pc to differentiate and therefore he can see what is what and what is true and what is false so youre handling all of these factors while youre handling r212 and the factors are in there and hidden but theyre quite startling when you get full parade of how many factors youre handling in r212 its dizzying so the best answer to it is just do it and youll see those things peel off but its very funny somebody will be absolutely sure his wife is an ogre youve heard of this you see well actually hes just got an and you say well what does your wife represent to you hed say thuh and thuh and thuh and thuh and thuh well hed feel better just from doing that and of course thats very short of what r212 could do and the wrong way to do it actually but you could use it that way and hed differentiate so remember now while youwhile youre cursing there at the length of list remember the more identification on an item the more items are going to come off on the list the more identified the person is with something the more items youre going to get coming off of it and all the time youre listing those items youre auditing him like crazywhether its represent or opposebecause the oppose too is stripping down certain idea or concept and dont lose sight of the fact that all the time youre listing youre auditing him like mad and now well take nulling and every time you go down this list he thinks there and he reintegrates this stuff and youre auditing him like mad so its all auditing solid auditing and about the soundest and most condensed auditing that you could do gain per unit of time now done right and arriving with items this is absolutely wonderful i mean you get someplace with thisits fabulous now wherehow many how fast should something like this go well id say in an hgc an auditor who was accustomed to it or something like that should be able to get two packages very easily in twentyfivehour intensive two packages thats four items you know versus b and c versus d in twentyfivehour intensive he would really be loafing see he would have run into lot of hard luck he would have had to have done this he would have had to have done that it was tough pc you understand all these things but i notice i notice that to get complete package that imwith long items and 212 and that sort of thing and with not being too careful or meticulous or trying to make time actually loafing bit on the job and so forth i notice its going about 7y2 itemhours per pair for that would be for you 2 12 sessions of 3hour sessions for pair thats really loafing you understand and so i say then for 2 pairs for twentyfivehour intensive that isshould be pretty close to minimal expectancy of course you can always go up from there of course you can gear in and of course you can really get flying i can do list and get an item if i want to really sit down and sweat at it in one hour and ten minutes but this is of course putting on the pressure of this really really knocking it out man your voice is such blur you can hardly hear it yourself you know but just to give you some kind of level of expectancy and when you get two items youve got to make package out of them so when you say two packages you mean two pair so you get two packages in twentyfive hour intensive that would be very slow going indeed actually youll find your better leading auditors will get up to about six in twentyfivehour intensive but actually in terms of case gain two packages of r212 well listed perfect they are the items that should have been gotten and that sort of thing do more for the pc than thousand hours of anything weve ever had before because youve removed the present time problem out of his road and now he can get gains from auditing those are the reasons for fast results now do you understand this technique little better audience yes well i wish you lots of luck with it thank you very much
