comments on clay table tv demo lecture given on 4 november 1964 thank you well you should give the first team actually some applause give them hand they were very good well frankly you know im astonished and pleased im very pleased the instructors have done very beautiful job of relaying this do you realize that both clay table healing and clay table processingi mean clay table clearing alike i have never demonstrated and this was straight off the cuff and actually ive never coached anybody on this and just written up the bulletins and there it is and its going along very very well you can attribute lot of that both to the excellence of your instructors which i think is very high and to the fact that i had studied how to write study materials before i did it you know the relay of the communication but that isthats one of the most reassuring things ive seen in long time both of those sessions just went along pocketapocketapocketa its shameits shame now that i have toi have to groove them in nicely but i just want to say that you got the word and nothing im going to say now destroys that fact we can make this little bit better but oddly enough it has practically nothing to do with clay table that im going to mention with regard to these sessions it has to do with basic auditing and i have just seen something and recognized it and it becomes important i realized that what we had as repetitive auditingrepetitive auditing levels where you keep giving commandwhich is now by the way hqs and its hca too of course as you give the command repetitively over and over and over that can be learned splendidly thats very fine that can be learned very well person can get that down and theyve gone long way when theyve gotten there now having become able to duplicateand you see this is one of those things where after you know your business why then you can do something else do you follow that because if youre doing something else because you dont know your business why watch it do you see and those two points of somebody doing something else because he knows his business you see and somebody doing something else because he doesnt know his business is pretty wild for instance i remember when wilson was elected there were bunch of photographers and they were holding reflex cameras over their heads and shooting picture of wilson dont you see well you could have immediately said well these boysthese boys arethats pretty wild you know and somebody who didnt know anything about it could say well i could hold my camera over my head and take picture that takes great deal of skill that takes enormous amounts of skill reflex camera has ground glass in the bottom of it well you wouldnt know that ordinarily but these press photographers were so hot they could swing camera over their head look at the ground glass get him in focus and fire him and to the public at large it just looked like somebody was holding camera over his head wildly you know its very interesting european photographer he often takes pictures around corners with those things and you know that sort of thing well it takes fantastic amount of skill to hold camera steady at arms length and that sort of thing you see the guyd really have to know his business i didnt mean to get photography into this but im trying to give you frame of reference see on the other hand somebody who doesnt know enough to look through the view finder well thats another story so he holds camera over his head to take picture of course he never gets anything and thats the single test of it do you get what you start out for do you see so an expert is only interested in getting what he starts out for do you follow that that is his aim he wants to get what he starts out for now he has to be pretty well trained as to the stylized or regular or very routine methods of getting what you start out for see he has to know that there is way to get what you start out for to get this end result and he has to know for instance that youyouve got to compose and look through finders and ground glasses dont you see in photography see in order to get picture in the frame and so on hed have to know all these things you see well now an auditorthats because we won on study of photography why i hope youll forgive my interjecting it as comparative example here but now both of those sessions wound up you see with what the auditor started for that made them competent sessions thats all that made them competent sessions and there was just one point of the second session which demonstrated very conclusively that the auditor had gotten what he started out for regardless of how he was getting it hed gotten what he started out for all right now did you recognize the point what was it audience cognitionpc cognition yes thats right pc had cognition pc said theres place from which to start theres whatswhat old john sanborn one time or another said you know i always likedi always get worried when sometime or another pc doesnt say what do you know or something like that once during session you know and he said i get worried well he had good reason to be worried because pc who doesnt ever have what do you know he isnt going anyplace well in other words something had illuminated there some new concept had occurred some new view had taken place see all right when that took place pc expressed it as cognition so therefore the auditor did get what he started out for correct all right that was successful session now somebody at has level perhaps thinks that he can get what he starts out for by giving some kind of covert session that nobody knows is happening and hes going around the corners and hes weaseling in and out and he got somebody to talk and so forth and he thinks hes going someplace and hes often astonished to find out that he doesnt wind up with proper result he went through the motions you know but of course he didnt know what he was going for or why he was going or what would happen if he did get there he doesnt know whether he got result or didnt get result because he didnt know what he was going for in the first place do you follow well so hed be in confused mess all the way wouldnt he and therefore he doesnt even know theres method of going all right now lets take levels i and ii where the terrific amount of repetitive processing is done now that gets to be quite drill and its an interesting drill and its very fine and it must be done and it very often is much better to do it just that way than any other way and i myself very often sit down and give one of these goshawful grind sessions you know of the equivalent of do birds fly you know right straight on through to the bitter brutal end of it and so forth and the pc winds up at the other end and says hey they do you know and i say yes sir all right thats fine but i recognize what im doingrecognize very clearly what im doingthat im giving repetitive process and there is point between level ii and level iii that an auditor is not trained to bridge you bridge from the purely repetitive process to the expert tap at the exact correct moment only do you follow now theres bridge point so that youd reallyyoure being well trained in practical on clay table healing yes thats the way its done thats good drill and that drill is right there now when you know that drill perfectly you can drop about sixty percent of it how well you dont ask the person if theyre satisfied every time because that is the thing youre supposed to do youre supposed to wind up your eyeballs so that they throw little line of sparks and flitter and observe the fact that the pc is confoundedly well satisfied that that is it and then you never mention it you follow say yeah hes satisfied in other words between ii and iii we start tuning it up in the first place the persons case state has upped now to point of where he can observe our old subject and braincracking word obnosis the observation of the obvious the ability to look at the obvious and so at between ii and iii we expect that the auditor has taken this stepthat he has gotten to point where he can observe the obvious so when somebody you ask them what should be near them you see and he saysand he says cow he gives it to you see cow you see that should be near then we dont ascertain point which we have already ascertained by our obnosis see we dont ascertain that point now because weve ascertained it theres doubt in his mind as to what went near it it almost snapped your head off see cow you know well of course you know he might as well be saying you know what youre looking for is the wella cow thats what youre looking for you see and then you say well now are you perfectly satisfied that that is what should go near well as matter of fact im really not and so forth theres some sort of bovineuhhsomething therei know what it is milk now at that point for gods sakes dont say are you satisfied that its milk dont you see you follow and thats the only hole i can punch in that but you see that the process is quite workable even with the repetitive im just teaching you the fine point and you dont keep punching along on something which is already established by your own observation and along about level ii why we expect the person to begin to observe now the reason for that is very very precise it probably has never occurred to you entirely that point of view and power of choice are synonymous theyre practically synonymous if person can occupy viewpoint or person can be viewpoint then he can observe and observing he can then choose because he is choosing out of observation always either the observation is past observation or its pure extrapolation but he can still observe you see now the detached personthe person that you run into that takes responsibility for anything in life and that sort of thinghe isnt where he is looking from see hes detached we use that word advisedly you see hes detached from existence he hasnt got anything to do with it existence is up here you see and hes sitting back you know has nothing to do with you know you got the idea but as you process somebody he starts moving back up into viewpoint and of course just before person exteriorizes or something like that he has to be able to accumulate his viewpoint very nicely he has to be able to occupy viewpoint at will actually therefore that is raised on power of choice whats power of choice you say well whats right and whats wrong and the pc says whats right and whats wrong oh my god dont ask question like that yeah at some lower level you know who knows you know pontius pilate reaction you know who knows i wouldnt know whos to say well you feel like saying to somebody like that youre to say you see now how would he say something about it well hed have to bring himself up to point of what he was looking at and look at it and say whether it was right or wrong according to his judgment and experience dont you see so we ask him what is right or wrong why this is very very esoteric this is farflung and far away you see but the moment we can understand this by saying about that or about an existing situation you see we say about this existing situation what is itwhat would be the right action what would be the wrong action we can ask him something like that well he has to swing himself into where he observes it and the whole course of processing is actually bringing somebody up to higher and higher ability to view their existence and the existence around them in life and their mind from their point of view and when you first pick somebody up he hasnt even found himself or located himself or done anything so that you can bring about the most magical change in persons life by just asking him where he is in the auditing room it doesnt sound like process dont you see it doesnt sound like anything but its complete sneaker youve asked him the very question which will take him all the way to the top the type of question would take him all the way you see where are you what do we stress in case analysis where are you see find the pc we say see well that pc if we just sat there waiting for the auditor to find him and so forth hed remain pretty buttered all over the place but the actual case of the matter is is were asking the pc to find himself and well give him little bit of help with the meter but there he is now i just got through running session earlier today which was very interesting session from my point of view because it didnt have any process that i ever heard of connected with it it was just having observed that the pc was upset saw clearly that the pc did not respond to an explanation or datum or spotting of bypassed charge or anything of the sort pc still upset you understand so i said well im gettingim not getting anyplace so this pc must be mired down someplace must be obviously mired down in an end word root word something like this dont you see and ill just try to get this out and i put the pc on meter and i got big surge on one word and i was asking the pc whati tried to get flash answer dont you see this is old stuff you see what word occurs to you when i snap my fingers you know boy thats really going back you know and said nothnothing nothing didnt get anything all right now what word occurs to you when i snap my finger repeated it see oh oh well yeah i got word that time thats survival see and the meter starts falling off the pin the tone arm was way at the top of the meter dont you see well i was just trying to talk this meter down by finding out what end word was this pc sitting in and that was my purpose see i dont know what purpose the pc had but we went on and with bit of itsa and bit of this and bit of that i get another word zooom you see big surge but the surge didnt repeat when i said the word did it when the pc said it didnt do it when the auditor said it so therefore it couldnt be the word the pc was sitting in because if it was the word the pc was sitting in then of course my saying the word would cause the word to react do you follow but the pc saying the wordthat was all thethe whole cause of the reaction dont you see so therefore i knew the pc wasnt sitting in that word but anyhow were getting charge off and we started getting tone arm action finally and the tone arm was going up and down madly and i wasnt even running list somebody else looking at it said i wonder what this is listing session or what this wasnt anything this was sortout onbased on my observation of the pc well the pc finally bit some computation or another that the pc was perfectly satisfied with without what do you know but i hadnt found the end word the pc was sitting in so i got the pc to talk some more seeing if the end word would now fall out of the conversation using the words which id already gotten off of the pc and then got the pc to state the whole thing as problem based on these words the pc did state the problem the end word occurred in the problem it now after all this timeyou see i knew the end words of the bank so i justthere it is see hah what do you know the meter of course started going booooom and started blowing down and heat started coming off and so forth well id reached my purpose as an auditor see that was it and i wouldnt have cared after that if the pc had gone on and itsaed for an hour or two or anything else i knew we had it so i almosti didnt interrupt the pc but i waited for pause and i said all right now thats the end word which has been thrown into restimulation in the last twentyfour hours and that is what you have been worried about oh yes the pc said thats right thats right it sure is im sure glad to find that and so forth and the pc would have gone on then but i said all right how do youyou feeling all right now good thank you very much thats the end of that assist and took the meter backtook the cans back and you would have said thats very interesting looking session because it really didnt look like any kind of session there was listing but there was listing but were trying to find word but we didnt have any word which would require the pc to give us word you got the idea so what you were seeingwhat you were seeing was simply the camera held over the headsnap know the mechanics of the bank ability to observe the pc you follow this had certain goal knew more or less what it was because of knowledge of the bank steered the pc and knew then i was getting off locks so let those go off but then used the locks to trail in against the end word and there it sat do you follow that you would have been surprised at the amount of charge that came off would you say in fifteen minute assist or something like that there should be upwards to twenty divisions of ta well there were in those fifteen minutes and i dont know how much ta came off afterwards because i didnt bother to find out dont you see i just ended the session pc walks off still chattering about it not worried about what the pcbecause undoubtedly pc walked off with lot of tone arm action still going on well let the pc cognite on their own time see you got the idea all right now lets compare that kind of an approach you know all the factors involved you could do them all right you know dozen ways to do any of these things and you just go ahead and hit the meat of the situation and clank you see right there session rather terrifically controlled almost controlled right up to the stretching point ofwell if youd controlled it much more youd have blown the pc out of session dont you see right up to the point where the pc doesnt blow and is still insession see makes for great speed of auditing but the nice judgment it takes to audit at that brinkthats pretty close to the edge you see you can hear rocks fall every once in while all right now there is one run you might say at upper class vi you see and heres this other session on repetitive do you follow now actually the repetitive could never have done this other assist of course but the repetitive would have gotten person quite distance with the assistance of the exact routine being run so nobodys saying anything against repetitive auditing im just saying the bridge between repetitive auditing and your beginning to be your own master is at ii from ii to iii the upper ii and lower iii and in that zone you as an auditor should begin to master this point obnosis should start setting in right at that point your own determinism as case should be pretty well up youre able to occupy position as an auditor without flinch dont you see you can view the pc from where you are your power of choice over what you do should have risen considerably because of skill that youve developed on your lower levels and therefore you start dropping out the parts of the session which are not essential to theim not talking now about parts of the comm cycle or something like that but parts ofyou start dropping out things to do out of the session which are not essential at that moment to the progress of the pc do you follow that and you dont say are you satisfied are you satisfied well its obvious see you follow this so at level iii dont make yourself slave dont you see and at the same time dont omit so much you dont make any progress you see whats being asked or something thats why clay table is up at this point you know clay table requires comm cycle the like of which nothing else everooh youve really got to be an auditor to run clay table you can foul up faster than scat you just get in there too obtrusive in the session see little bit too obtrusive little mauling around too much little too much control and so forth and your pc is brrrrplow see youve just pushed your pc right out of session bang youve got to be on the ball pc makes an originationyou dont understand it you havent got clue pc all of sudden says in clay table clearing well i have just suddenlysuddenly got it here ii got this right straight fire engines dont always have hoofs and the auditor says okay now theres certain rapport exists between an auditor and pc and when the auditor doesnt understand something and he says he does hes introduced lie into the session which will not only hang him up but very often practically flips the pc so this auditor because he is now trying to be so unobtrusive doesnt then get anything clarified now youve got to learnnow lets take the bridge between iii and iv at iii and iv anybody can understand clay table healing see you can understand these things it doesnt take much you still have to ask once in awhile what is that something like that but that doesnt require lot of you see but you get up into the esotericsdid you notice between the two sessions which i repeat were well runthat they were entirely different in the presentation of clay see thats why they are two different processes at two different levels and did you noticewhat was probably not visible is what was being demanded of the auditor was far greater even though the auditor appeared to be busier at iii what was being demanded of the auditor at iv was far greater because he had to be on the ball all the way and all of sudden the fellow says well fire engines dont have hoofs and ithatsi get that now and this is representation of fire engine with hoofs and so forth and the auditor says okay okay well he doesnt even have to make face over it the pc knows he hasnt got it and at that moment it all goes appetite over tin cup now i invite you some time to go on very sound solid program of for some space of time take the people around you and every time you miss word make them clarify it dont develop this as scientology occupational disease i find it gets that way with once in awhile every once in awhile now ill see dispatch coming back with circle around it i didnt get this word very good its very good the guys got an order of which one word he doesnt understand ohh that would be very very weird wouldnt it but heres circled word i didnt understand this and so forth so i just clarified it nowbut go at it on this basis i dont care if its total strangers and the guy says gluffwuff say to him exactly what did you say what did you say dont give it to him on the basis of youre challenging what they said but just clarify it you know and your first reaction is liable to be little bit of snap from this person see and just train yourself not to let the snap deter you and ask again oh well if you must know i said soandso that was what i said see and this person may get the idea that youre little deaf he may get the idea that youre so forth or that youre inquisitive orwe dont care what ideas he gets but if you followed out that program you would find something very strange would occur in your relationship with that person that person will become much more friendly much more confiding and much more relaxed in your vicinity
