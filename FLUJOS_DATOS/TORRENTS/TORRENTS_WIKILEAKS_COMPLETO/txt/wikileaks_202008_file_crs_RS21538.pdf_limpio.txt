or providing questi onable information concerning the athletes possible profess ional prospects unfair practices to be regulated by the federal trade commission ftc witnesses at hearings emphasized the far reaching consequences of frequen tly unethical or unscrupulous conduct of sports agents in pursuing and soliciting st udent athletes such conduct can subject student athletes to penalties i ncluding loss of student eligibility and possible loss of scholarship money and their colleges to sanctions monetary penalties forfeiture of games in which an ineligible athlete played tarnished reputations the agents involved however generally face punishment for their offenses because according to spartas primary sponsor onl 35 states regulate agent conduct at all of that number 18 have

in the promotion of any product service or event all citations are to the bill as amended and reported by the house committee on the judiciary june 2 2003agents2that student athletes are frequently approached and treated unethically or unscrupulouslybyeither genuine or wouldbe s ports agents anxious to acquire clients was detailed by several witnesses before the subcommittee on commercial and administrative law of the house committee on the judiciary3most often noted was the prevalence of instances in which the student athlete himself or members of his family4 are given either cash or gifts to induce the athlete to sign with an agent who many timespromises unrealistic or impossible results including eg lucrative contracts with professional sports teams or ssurances of high draft picks because the rules of the national collegiate athletic association ncaa generally prohibit student athletes from signing agent contracts or accepting the impermissible gratuities offered to solicit th em athletes who do accept the gratuities or sign the contracts lose their eligibility to participate in ncaa competition and possibly any scholarship money provided by the athletes college the penalties their colleges may face include repayment of any monies received from ncaa championship contests in which the ineligible athlete participated forfeiture of those contests loss of television revenue other specific monetary penalties andor tarnished reputations but unless the agents conduct occurs in one of the few states which ve meaningful statutory regulation of sports agent activities they are largely free of any potential penalties 5 hr 361 sports agent responsibility and trust act sparta to designate certain conduct by sports agents relating to the signing of contracts with student athletes as unfair and deceptive acts or practices to be regulated by the federal trade commission was introduced jointly on ja nuary 27 2003 by former college football coach representative tom osborne and repr esentative bart gordon considered first by the house energy and commerce committee and reported favorably on march 5 the bill was considered and amended by the house judiciary committee and its administrative and commercial law subcommittee and reported favorably on june 2 many provisions of the proposed act are identical to or track those of the uniform athlete agents act uaaa6both include endorse ment contracts7signed by student athletes which are deemed to be in the same category and subject to the same constraints as are agency contracts the following actions in the direct or indirect solicitation ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21538crs3 8 4a the ftc rulemaking authority is found at15 usc 57aa1b the commissions general unfairness authority is found at 15 us c 45 which declares unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce unlawful 9 3b1 3 10id 11 4a see also note 8 however as there is mandate in sparta directing the commission to promulgate rule specifically c oncerning athleteagent practices nor any reference to any existing applicable ftc unfairness rule nor are we aware of any such rule we assume that 3 of sparta which sets out the practices which constitute violations of the act is to be considered the equivalent of an ftc r ule as note 8 indicates the ftcs general unfairness authority is found i n5o ft h ef t ca c t 1 5u s c 4 5 student athletes to enter into agency contr acts would be considered violations of an ftc rule presumably although hr 361 does not so state rule to be promulgated in pursuance of the commissions rulemaking authority8inasmuch as ftc rule specifically directed at athleteagent activities currently exists defining unfair acts or practices providing anything of value to stude nt athlete or anyone associated with the student athlete before the stude nt athlete enters into an agency contract including any considera tion in the form of loan or acting in the capacity of guarantor or coguarantor 3a1b giving any false or misleading information or making false promise or representation to the student athlete 3a1a entering into an agency contract w ith student athlete without providing the statutorily prescribed disclosure statement 3a2 pre or postdating agency contracts 3a3 the required disclosure document would be separate from and in addition to any disclosure which may be required under s tate law and would have to contain conspicuously ie near the student athletes or guard ians signature and in boldface type the following warning to student athlete if you agree orally or in writing to be represented now or in the future you may lose your eligibility to compete as student athlete in your sport9 further the disclosure document must war n that both the student athlete and the agent signing representation contract must notif the student athletes athletic director or other individual responsible for the college s athletic programs of that fact within 72 hours of such signing or before the next ath letic event in which the student athlete would be eligible to participate whichever occurs first10 sparta which treats all violations of th act as violations of rule defining an unfair act or practice prescribed by th commission pursuant to its rulemaking authority11and incorporates all applicable term s and provisions of the federal trade commission act 15 usc 4 1 et seq is to be enforced at the federal level by thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21538crs4 12 4b 13 5a1 2 absent this authority state ttorneys general would probably not be able to enforce spartas provisions because nothi ng in the federal trade commission act may be enforced by any entity other than the commission seenote 19 infra which although it speaks specifically to private enforcement of the ftc act is nevertheless instructive we note that the ftc act is not enforceable by the department of justice 14 5d 15 5b 16 5c 1715 usc 1391 reads in pertinent part civil action wherein jurisdiction is founded only on diversity of citizenship may be brought only in 1 judicial district where any defendant resides if all defendants reside in the same state 2 judicial district in which substantial portion of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred or 3 judicial district in which the defendants are subject to personal jurisdiction at the time the action is commenced b civil action wherein jurisdiction is not founded solely on diversity of citizenship may identical text as in a1 and a2 above or 3 judicial district in which any defendant may be found if there is district in which the action may otherwise be brought 18 6b1 but see note 20 infra the uaaa also author izes actions by educational institutions against student athletes 16a recogniz ing that an educational institution should be able to recover any loss of revenue arising from failure of either the agent or the athlete to timely notify it of contract signing 16c specifies that remedy under it state law is not an educational institutions exclusive remedy 19 6b4commission12state attorneys general may bring civil actions to enforce the mandatesprohibitions of spart if they have reason to believe that an interest of the residents of their states has been or is bei ng adversely affected by any practice that violates the act but must notify the ftc in writing before any action is filed or simultaneously with the filing if prior notice is not possible13they are prohibited however from bringing actions against fendant named in an ftc complaint during the pendency of commission action14the ftc is given the right to intervene in state action to be heard and to appeal15state attorneys general are specifically not prevented from exercising any other rights granted to them by their respective states to investigate administer oaths r subpoena witnesses or documents16any action brought to enforce the acts prohibitions or mandate s may be brought in federal district court subject to the venue requirements of 28 usc 139117in other words actions to enforce sparta may only be brought in the judicial districts which are authorized by the federal venue statute educational institutions are given the right to bring civil actions against athlete agents for damages caused by any violation of the act18but specifically are not restricted in the exercise of any other right or remedy under law or equity19 the fact that the act as introduced did not provide right of legal action to student athletes was noted and questioned during judiciary subcommittee consideration of the act and subsequent subcommittee amendment clarified that student athletes retained their rights to take action ie seek damages from agents under existing state laws thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21538crs5 20 7 of the act states nothing in this act shall be construed to prohibit an individual from seeking any remedies available under existing federal or state law or equity emphasis added presumably an individual includes an injured student athlete whethe r however sparta is considered either 1 to direct the ftc to promulgate rule embodying its substantive provisions or 2 itself to be the equivalent of an ftc rule st udent athletes as private parties likely could not under existing law sue absent some more cl early articulated congressional language it is well established that the federal trade commission act may be enforced only by the federal trade commission nowhere does the act bestow upon either competitors or consumers standing to enforce its provisions alfred dunhill ltd v interstate cigar co 499 f2d 232 237 2d cir 1974 quoted in federal trade commi ssion v owenscorning fiberglas corp 853 f2d 458 464 6thcir 1988 see also moore v new york cotton exchange 270 us 593 603 1925 holloway v bristol myers corp 485 f2d 986 988989 dc cir 1973 we note that the uaaa does not either grant student athletes the right to sue under it but inasmuch as it is to be adopted as state law statelaw rights and remedies eg contract law any state unfairness law that allowed suits by private p arties would remain available we note further that the provision in the uaaa retaining existing rights remedies or defenses under law or equity 16c appears in the section dealing with the right of educational institutions to sue unlike the similar but standalone provision i n sparta which presumably is meant to apply as well to the student athletes to be protected by the sparta 21 8 according to the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws about ½ of the states have already enacted the uaaa or are very close to enactment it is in various legislative postures in the other states in which it was introduced the current nccusl legislative fact sheet for the uaaa lists the following state adoptions alabama arizona arkansas delaware district of columbia flori da idaho indiana kansas kentucky maryland minnesota mississippi montana nevada north dakota pennsylvania us virgin islands washington west virginia the bill was introdu ced during 2003 in legislatures in connecticut georgia illinois maine missouri new j ersey north carolina oklahoma texasacts sponsors had earlier indicated their be lief that state contr act law might provide adequate protection further amendment in the full judiciary committee purported to provide student athletes with the right to sue i n federal courts although the effect of that provision with respect to sparta is matter of conjecture20as hr 361 was passed by the house under suspension of its rules it retained the language of the reported bill the final section of sparta is sense of congress provision endorsing the uaaa it is the sense of congress that states should enact the uniform athlete agents act of 2000 drafted by the national confer ence of commissioners on uniform state laws to protect student athletes and the in tegrity of amateur sports from unscrupulous sports agents21
