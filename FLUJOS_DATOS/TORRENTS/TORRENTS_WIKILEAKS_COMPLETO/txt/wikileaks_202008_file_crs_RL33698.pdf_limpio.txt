httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33698reauthorization of the feder aviation administration background and issues for congress summary reauthorization of the federal avia tion administration faa and other aviation programs is likely to be high priority in the 110th congress funding authorizations for aviation programs as we ll as authorization of existing aviation tax structure that provides revenue for the aviati on trust fund are set to expire at the end of fy2007 congress may consider variety of financing options to maintain the ability of the aviation trust fund to provide sufficient revenue stream for ongoing operational costs and planne d infrastructure improveme nts one particularly controversial alterna tive under consideration is user fee system which is supported by the airlines but strongly opposed by many other system users faced with growing operational costs and fiscal needs to pport system expansion airport capital imp rovements and moderniza tion efforts options to control costs within the faa and the air traffic organization ato may be particular focus of reaut horization cost control op tions generally revolve around two overarching strategies consolidation of facilities and functions and competitive sourcing some have recommended that formal process similar to the militarys base realignment and closure brac pro cess be implemented to assess how the faa could best consolidate its functions to control costs and address future system needs besides controlling costs options to maintain and balance air traffic controller staffing levels are likely to be of particular in terest as the faa is facing large wave of controller retirements ove r the next five years options for improving and streamlining training increasing productivity better balancing staffing needs and perhaps consolidating air traffic facilities over the longterm may be considered during reauthorization congress may examine variety of aviation safety issues during debate over faa reauthorization options for preven ting runway overruns and for reducing the risk of runway collisions may be of particular interest the adequacy of faa safety oversight has been continuing concer n and recent accidents may draw particular attention to oversight of contract repair facilities smaller passenger service operators as well as air charter and air tour operators other safety issues that may arise include longstanding concerns such as mitigating the risks of fuel tank explosions addressing concerns over aging aircraft and addressing the ique safety issues affecting allcargo operations issues regarding airliner cabin health and safety may also be considered options to mitigate the spread of infectious diseases among aircraft occupants and the safetyofflight implications of cell phones and portable electronic devices may also be examined growing interest in alternatives to petroleum fuel may generate some debate over alternative fuel technologies for ai rcraft and airport ground vehicles and growing international pressures to regulate aircraft emissions may prompt debate on aviations environmental impacts longsta nding aircraft noise policies may also be examined to assess whether quiet aircra ft technologies and policy changes could further mitigate the community impacts of airc raft noise this report will be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33698

context of faa reauthorization these include faa budgetin g and finance airport development and finance faa cost control measures systemwide demand and capacity issues modernization of national airspace system nas infrastructure aviation safety airliner cabin issues energy environment and noise issues nd international civil aviation issues faa budget and finance issues authorization of the existing aviation ta x structure that provides revenue for the aviation trust fund will expire at the end of fy2007 while such tax authorizations have expired in the past the current liberations over faa funding are considered particularly critical this in part is b ecause uncommitted balances in the airport and airways trust fund aatf commonly refe rred to as the aviation trust fund have declined in recent years leaving rela tively small reserve to pay for aviation programs in the event that tax collection authorities are allowed to expire also major initiatives to devel op and deploy the next ge neration air transportation system ngats by 2025 initiated during th last reauthorization process are reaching stage where they will require dditional funding resources if these plans are to be realized while official projections are yet available on the total cost for ngats early estimates indicate that it w ill require an average of 200 million to 1 billion annually in facilities nd equipment costs over the next several years to keep ngats development initiatives on track congress may consider variety of financing options to maintain the ability of the aviation trust fund to provide suffici ent revenue stream for ongoing operational costs and planned infrastruct ure improvements in the n earterm and to support the longterm ngats development efforts in the course of this debate congress mayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33698crs2 2 general aviation refers to all aviation activ ity except for commercial airline allcargo airline and military operations 3 paul lowe alphabet groups ready to wage userfee battle aviation international news the convention news co inc midland park nj april 2006consider the appropriate cost allocation between aviation system users the share of the cost burden to be borne by the aviati on trust fund and the share to be derived from treasury general funds the soca lled public interest contribution the relative tax burden placed on various industry participants has been source of controversy for over 36 years since th aviation trust fund was created the airlines argue that they have been paying disproportionately larger share of the system costs compared to general aviation users since the largest revenue sources for the aviation trust fund are rived from passenger ticket ta xes the airlines claim that in their highly compe titive industry they must absorb some of the taxrelated costs in their fare pricing schemes the airlines have identified general aviation2 users and business je t operators in particular as segment of the aviation economy that in their opinion is not paying its fair share of the costs to maintain and improve the national airspace system nas general aviation users argue on the other hand that the nas has largely been developed to support the airline industry that the incremental costs to accommodate general aviation users is not that large and that existing fuel taxes are sufficient to compensate for their impact on the system one alternative to the existing tax structur supported by the airlines is feefor service system that would be more of direct user fee system than what is in place now some industry observers claim that the faa has been mulling the idea of direct user fee structure to replace existing aviation taxes and fees and an administration proposal s reportedly been under review by the office of management and budget omb for some time3 while the details of the proposal are unknown specula tion is that it will conform more closely to international standards that stipulate user fees be com puted as some function of the specific impact on air traffic facilities and services such as the commonly used fees based on aircraft weight and distance flown used by many nations during the reauthorization debate cong ress may consider variety of aviation trust fund revenue alte rnatives that may include keep ing the existing passenger ticket and fuel taxes largely or completely intact moving to tax revenue scheme based solely on fuel taxes adopting user feeba sed system or devel oping hybrid scheme that consists of some combination of thes alternatives one hybrid approach that has been discussed is to charge user fees for airlines and operators of larger general aviation aircraft while small general avia tion users would continue to contribute solely by means of fuel tax although th fuel tax rates and structure could differ from what currently exists airport development and finance issues the airport improvement program aip provides federal grants for airport development its funding is derived fro m the airport and airways trust fund and it is one of five major sources of funding for airport developm ent and improvementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33698crs3 airports also fund capital projects us ing taxexempt bonds passenger fac ility charges pfcs local tax levied on each boarding passenger state and local grants and airport revenue the preemin ent reauthorization issue for aip is whether its funding levels will be increased substantially held steadyincreased modestly or reduced the outlook for aip funding will be influe nced by the resolution of the debate concerning taxes and fees supporting the av iation trust fund as well as any decision concerning the scope of the general f und share of the faa budget failure to secure more revenue for the faa budget in light of the recent decline in the uncommitted balance of the trus t fund could constrain any attempts to increase the aip budget during the reauthorization process congress may also examine wide variety of other issues pertaining to the aip program including airport eligibility and apportionments among various si zes of airports discretiona ry funding levels and uses of discretionary grants the scope of grant assurances to protect federal interests in airport projects funding vels set aside for noiserela ted projects the appropriate federal share of funding for airport project s at airports of various sizes possible expansion of or modification to the air port privatization pilot program partial defederalization of ai rport funding allowing airports to use pfcs instead of aip as primary or sole source for project f unds limitations on the use of aip funds for airport security projects the possible impacts of accommodating new users classes such as very light jets vljs and the airbus a380 superjumbo jet on airport infrastructure needs and airport financing and the use of earmarks or place naming in legislation regarding airport infrastructur projects in addition to aip funding and related issues congress may consider options to raise the cap on pfc levels to provide additional funding ava ilability outside of aip nd options to make airport bonds more attractive to inve stors although some may ar gue the latter may be more appropriately addressed through tax reform legislation rather than faa reauthorization cost control issues besides consideration of revenue system for fundi ng the aviation trust fund controlling the costs of operating and maintaining the existing national airspace system has been an ongoing concern fo r the faa and for congressional oversight cost control measures may be partic ular issue of interest during the faa reauthorization debate as congress gra pples with the prospect of escalating operational costs that must be balanced with the fiscal needs to support planned infrastructure development both over the nearterm to fund ongoing and planned system expansion and over the longter m to support the ngats development outsourcing has been seen as viable alternative for controlling costs in some instances such as the faas federal cont ract tower fct program and the recently privatized automated flight service sta tions afsss expanded outsourcing of various faa functions such as further expa nsion of the contract tower program and privatization of the faas aeronautical ch arting functions are possible options that both the faa and congress may examine also the faa and congress may lookhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33698crs4 4 designees are individuals that are neith er government employees nor government contractors that are authorized or designated by the faa to carry out regulatory functions examples include designated medical examin ers that issue medical certification pilot examiners that issue pilot certificates and ratings and manufacturing representatives that certify the airworthiness of production aircraftto increase the use of designees4 to carry out certain av iation oversight functions however some critics argue that these outsourcing options are likely to yield relatively small cost savings in compar ison to the overall faa operations budget further these options are likely to be highly contentious and face strong opposition from labor organizations whether th outsourcing measures potentially compromise safety in any way remains specific point of contention while some have advocated large scale privatization of air traffic services as has been done in canada australia the united kingdom and parts of main land europe this approach would be highly complex to carry out and this option has failed to garner much support in congress the current ad ministration has indicated previously that is has plans to privatize route and terminal air traffic control facilities but may opt to expand the contract tower program consolidation of facilities and functions has also been viewed as possible way to control operational costs at the faa the faa is currently in the process of consolidating administration and support functions in its regional service areas and has plans to consolidate weat her services provided at route centers also under the privatized afss program an extensive consolidation of flight service facilities is currently in process some have pr oposed that the faa implement systematic process perhaps using something akin to the militarys base realignment and closure brac process to address futu re consolidation plans for facilities and functions congress may deba the merits of this pr oposal during the pending faa reauthorization in the long term under ngats consolida tion of air traffic services and air traffic facilities may be possible with increased reliance on automation and by increasing the autonomy flexibility and authority granted to individual flights operating in the national airspace system nas the ratio of air traffic controllers to aircraft operating in the system is likely to drop in the near term this will likely be offset by the growth in air traffic operations so that modest increase in the overall number of air traffic controllers is expected in the longterm however the changing nature of controller responsibilities and f unctions may result in need for fewer controllers and may allow for considerable consolidation in air traffic control facilities across the united states the faa has also expressed interest in consolidation of air traffic facilities as possible means to address ongoing staffing issues particularly among route centers where there is shortage of fully qualified controllers to handle the most complex airspace sectors the faa believes that facilities consolidation could help in its efforts to better match controller skills and levels of experience with airspace complexity and provide controllers with better job advancement opportunities while at th same time reducing infrastructure and relocation costs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33698crs5 5 crs calculation based on faa budget documents and statements regarding average air traffic controller workforce compensation and benefits 6 soaring controller pay looms large in discussions on atc air transport world daily news may 16 2005 7 see eg see s 2201 and hr 4755 which were introduced during the 109th congresswith regard to controlling operational costs air traffic controller pay remains contentious issue as controller compen sation and benefits make up sizable proportion of the faas operational costs co mprising roughly 35 of total operating costs5 under 1998 contract agreement betw een the faa and controllers controller compensation and benefits grew about 64 in eight years6 outpacing the increase in labor costs for other faa employees nd federal workers during contract renegotiations in 2005 and 2006 the faa looke d to obtain sizable concessions from controllers but the two sides could not come to agreement as called for in statute the impasse was referred to congress ho wever congress did not act on the impasse submittal thus allowing the faa to imple ment its final contract proposal which became effective in september 2006 while the law giving the faa authority to negotiate compensation and benefits in labor contracts rarity in the government sector was enacted largely for the purpose of improving the faas ability to attract and retain high quality professional workforce it has been criticized by management for leading to escalating ope rating costs and by both management and labor for straining relations between the two sides while the main objectives of the law to improve the recruitment and retention of high quality employees is laudable congress may wish to examine whether options to improve the law are available to control escalating operational costs and maintain more positive and constructive managementlabor relations within the faa with regard to labor ne gotiations one legislative option offered during the 109th congress proposed to add an additional pha requiring manage ment and labor to enter into binding arbitration after the period of congressional review that follows an impasse in the contract negotiation process7 while congress did not take up formal debate on this proposal in the midst of the recent faacontroller labor dispute this proposal may resurface during debate over faa reau thorization other options to streamline the labor negotiations process within faa may also be considered in the context of faa reaut horization as recent bor negotiations were rather disruptive and highly contentious controller staffing is also likely to be key focus in the reauthorization debate as the faa seeks to effectively manage its controller workforce in preparation for an expected surge in retirements over the next several years some available options that congress may consider include dedicated funding authorizations marked for new controller hiring and training authorization for new hires from accredited collegiate air traffic programs to enter directly into onthejob training funding authorization for initiatives to enhance controller traini ng using advanced simulation technologies and consolidation of certain air traffic facilities and functions to provide for greater flexibility in meeting staffing needs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33698crs6 system demand and capacity issues the current faa reauthorization cycle comes at critical time with respect to addressing increasing capacity needs at highvolume airports in airspace around many major metropolitan areas and along certain highly congested routes while recent stopgap measures implemented by the faa have served to stave off unacceptable congestion and delays thus far longterm solutions are likely needed in consideration of future air traffic growth projections many believe that technology is needed to reduce low visib ility aircraft spacing standards to those allowable in good visibility in order to acco mmodate projected future growth at busy airports however some experts caution that even with the implementation of these proposed options and the completion of planned airport expansions across the country certain very busy airports incl uding both major commercial airports and busy general aviation reliever airports may experience p eak hour demand levels that exceed airport capacity limitations besides addressing expected capacity needs significant challenge facing congress and the faa in the years ahead is accommodating new classes of airspace users in manner that optimizes safety and efficiency for all users new users will consist of the very big such as the air bus a380 superjumbo jet as well as the very small very light jets vljs the most ta lkedabout class of new system users are the vljs which are expected to begin opera tions in small numbers in 2007 and are projected to experience rapid growth over the next ten years vljs are seen by some as possible solution to provide small communities improved access to the national air transportation system therefore their introduction may spur renewed public policy debate over approaches to enhance air transportation in small communities also because these vljs will share high altitude airspace and congested airspace around major metropolitan areas with commerc ial passenger jets their impact on system capacity and air traffic control workload is likely to be of particular interest besides vljs the introduction of pilotle ss unmanned aerial vehicles uavs or unmanned aerial systems uass also poses significant challenges to maintaining safety and not impeding access to airspace for other users such as small general aviation aircraft due to persisting capacity limitations in certain locations the faa and congress may be faced with difficult choices regarding how best to maintain access and address demand in an quitable manner at capacity c onstrained airports vision 100 provided the faa with limited authority to implement negotiated scheduling among air carriers at few capacityconstrained airports on trial basis this approach along with other options such as peakperiod pricing slots and quota systems have all been examined as po ssible options the faas approach to addressing capacity constraints at new york s laguardia airport is likely to be an issue of particular interest during the bate over reauthoriza tion as the statutorily imposed slot system for lagu ardia expired in january 2007 while capacity constraints are posing challenges at major metropolitan airports several trends including the continuing loss of commercial air carrier service in rural america are making the essential air service eas air carrier subsidy program more attractive to many ru ral communities however even with increased funding for this program in recent years it is becoming increasingly difficult for the eashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33698crs7 program to generate additional air service against this backdrop the eas program faces number of issues that are likely to be addressed in forthcoming reauthorization legislation primary among these is how to prioritize access to the program so that eas funds are used in th most efficient manner possible it is likely however that without signifi cant increase in funding additional limitations on the use of eas program fundi ng may have to be consid ered in addition to the eas program the small community air service development scasd program was established to develop solutions for improving air carrier service to communities that are experiencing insufficient access to the national air transportation system while an initial review of the program found mixed results it has been noted that it is still too early in the programs history to fully assess its potential effectiveness system modernization issues present initiatives to modernize air traffic facilities and services have been channeled into unified effort to deve lop the next generation air transportation system ngats under provision in vi sion 100 vision 100 created the joint planning and development office jpdo multiagency entity headed by the faa and charged with the task of conceptualizing and integrating the development of the ngats the dot envisions ngats as system capable of tripling effective system capacity by 2025 by some estimates air traffic levels throughout the united states could increase at that pace thereb necessitating these system enhancements the specifics of these effort s and future funding and ma nagement challenges facing the jpdo and the faa in carrying forth th plans to build the ngats are likely to be major focus during the current faa reauthorization process significant issue facing congress during the upcoming f aa reauthorization process is obtaining working estimates of what building the ngats will cost crs analysis of available preliminary cost estimates indicates that the total cost to build the ngats by 2025 is estimated to be between 69 billion and 76 billion which is roughly 5 billion to 12 billion above baselin facilities and equipment fe spending levels another significant issue that may be addressed during the reauthorization process is how to best manage the ngat s development effort one major hurdle is that while the jpdo can set objectives goals and strategies for the ngats framework the funding stream for carrying out these plans will ultimately come from the budgets of th various agencies involved primarily the faa and nasa in recognition of this congress may examine op tions to align budget elements of the various agencies involved within the ngats framework another potential issue is the appropriate sc ope of the jpdos efforts while some consideration of various ancillary functions and issues such as security and environmental impacts may improve the overall system design for the ngats too much emphasis on these various issues could impede progress on the central issue of improving the efficiency and capacity of the air traffic system besides the scope of the jpdos efforts another issue of interest is the jpdos approach some observers contend that the jpdo has remained too focused on policy and establishing paradigm for collaboration among agencies and stakeholders and it has not yet translated these general objectives into cohesive blueprint with high degree of engineering specification regarding timelines and contingencies among the various component elements of the ngats one possiblehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33698crs8 option being discussed for streamlining ngats system development is the use of an overarching lead systems integrati on lsi contract for overseeing the ngats project while many questions still remain regarding the management approach to developing ngats there is growing consensus among experts in the field regarding the technological objectives and likely technologies that will comprise the core functionality of the ngats system the core technologies needed to meet these objectives include 1 precision na vigation capabilities to pinpoint aircraft locations project flight paths or flight trajectories and predict future aircraft positions with high degree of accuracy and 2 highly integrated information networks to enable shared situation awareness regarding traffic weather airport conditions and other factors affecting flights and provide tools to facilitate distributed adaptive decisionmaking nd informationsharing about operational changes such as flight path deviati ons and their potential impacts on other system users the investment strategy for thes technologies that is adopted and carried forth over the next three to five years is likely to have lasting impact on both the endstate of ngats and the path to reaching that end state in addition to deciding on technology i nvestment and deploy ment strategy for the ngats challenging and potentially c ontentious issue is the phasing out of existing facilities and equipment for air traffic communications navigation and surveillance phasing out of existing syst ems must be addresse d carefully because on the one hand maintaining legacy syst ems while deploying new technologies can be costly and resource intensive on th other hand phasing these systems out too quickly could place an undue burden on system users to equip aircraft and could pose safety concerns if adequate backups and redundancies are not in place congress may express particular in terest in the faas efforts to assess how proposals envisioning new navigation and surv eillance technologies w ill address the issue of providing equivalent safety to the current radarbased air traffic surveillance system congressional interest regarding the phase out of legacy systems may also focus on how these plans may impact airspace system users particularly smaller operators who may face greater challenge in equipping aircraft to keep pace with the evolution from the existing national airs pace system to ngats compliant avionics and aircraft systems while advances in precision navigati on and information sharing show great promise for reducing aircraft spacing in all weather conditions thereby increasing system capacity wake turbulence produced by large transport aircraft currently imposes practical limitations on aircraft spacing even under ideal weather conditions current air traffic procedures specify separation standards for aircraft departing behind large and heavy jets to llow their wake vortices to dissipate some view these standards as overly conserva tive and argue that accurate wake vortex prediction capabilities could allow for d ecreased separation thereby increasing airport capacity in many weather conditions others argue that the limited capability of available technology and the complexities of wake vortex propagation make it difficult to predict wake

capacity at airports perhaps by as much as 20 but is still at very early stage of research and development safety issues since the last reauthorization major ai rlines have maintained an impressive safety record congressional oversight of faa safety initiatives and programs has not been major focus of congress in veral years as concerns over aviation security since septembe r 11 2 001 have been much more dominant issue however there are many aspects of safety where there is still room for improvement in an industry that is for the most part ve ry safe one area of growing concern is the safety of the airport environment r ecent runway overrun accidents have highlighted concern over the adequacy of runway safety areas and the level of attention the faa has given to mitigating the risk of catastr ophic runway overrun accidents also with regard to runway safety the faa has identified mitigating runway incursions or potential ground collisions with departing or landing aircraft as one of its highest priorities however the faas approach to addressing this issue has been criticized by the national transportation safety board ntsb and other aviation safety advocates who maintain that improving p ilot situation awareness of the airport environment is critical need for effectively mitigating runway incursions longrunning safety concern is the ad equacy of the faas oversight of air carrier operations and maintenance the growing trend of outs ourcing maintenance to third party maintenance repair and overhaul facilities has raised questions over the adequacy of these facilities compliance with air carrier and faa standards for work conditions and quality assurance particular concerns over repair facilities that service commuter aircraft and work performed on air carrier aircraft by small repair shops that are not required to be certified by the faa are two particular issues where congress may consider options to enha nce regulatory requirements and faa oversight of these maintenance activities another continuing safety concern that congress may again examine during this reauthorization process is th continued airworthiness of aging aircraft which was highlighted by the ongoing investigati on of commuter seaplane built in 1947 that crashed while departing miami for the bahamas on december 17 2005 particular issue of interest is the faas approach to continued airw orthiness and safety monitoring of the fleet of small commuter aircraft and the aging general aviation fleet which are not covered under the aging aircraft inspections program established for large airliners the 10year anniversary of the crash of twa flight 800 on july 17 2006 has renewed interest in measures being taken to mitigate the risk of fuel tank explosions on large transportcategory aircraft while technological advances in fuel inerting systems have been made in recent ears and the faa has proposed fuel tank flammability reduction requirements for new and

flammability and perhaps options to mitigate the fina ncial impact of complying with proposed aircraft modificati ons on air carriers airliner cabin issues issues related to passenger safety comfort and public health in aircraft cabins have often been of interest in past f aa reauthorization pro cesses and may again generate considerable debate during the current reauthor ization cycle one particular concern is the potential for spread of deadly infectious disease such as communicable strain of avian flu among airline passengers the risk of such threat was highlighted few years ago when the deadly sudden acute respiratory syndrome sars virus caused widespread concern over the public health risks posed by airline travel congress may debate whether more research is needed on methods to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in the aircraft cabin and how to effectively deploy available methods to detect and mitigate the spread of disease among airline travelers with regard to cabin occupant safe ty congress may once again consider whether infants and t oddlers under two years of age should be restrained in child seats on airline flights or whether the current practice of allowing lap children should be continued the faa recently rescinded its plans to require child restraints for these children as advocated by the ntsb citing fears that families would opt to instead travel by car an arguably riskier mode of travel if faced with the prospect of paying for an additional ticket for their infant or toddler to fly the ntsb maintains that the failure to restrain all aircraft occupants is an unsafe practice and the faas crossmodal safety comparisons detract from the central issue of whether such prac tice should be allowed to continue also with regard to issues of passenger comfort safety and convenience in the airliner cabin the use of cell phones and table electronic devi ces peds has been an issue of growing interest technological advances in wireless voice and data communications are far outpacing the faas ability to study the safety implications of using these radio frequency rf emitting devices on board aircraft and make sound policy decisions regarding the inflig ht use of these devices while vendors are pushing for approval of onboard system s to make cell phone and wireless internet access available in flight researchers have expressed continuing concern that cell phones and other peds may inte rfere with aircraft instrumentation during the current reauthorization debate congre ss may consider whether more focused research on this issue is needed to deter mine if and under what circumstances these devices can be used in flight without any foreseeable safety consequences energy environment and noise issues issues related to energy and the envir onment may play larger than usual role during the current reauthoriza tion debate energy and fuel issues in particular have been part of the larger public policy debate in recent years and may spur consideration of alternative fuels for aircra ft and airport vehicles growing concernshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33698crs11 over global warming and nvironmental impacts may so prompt debate over options for reducing aircraft emissions historically high fuel costs are driving much of the current push for more efficient aircraft which also can be cleaner and quieter however congress may debate available options to study alternative aircraft fuels monitor international approaches to mitiga ting aircraft emissions and noise sponsor research on aircraft emissi onsreduction and quiet aircraft technologies and provide incentives for manufacturers and operators to develop and utilize aircraft technologies that reduce dependence on fossil fuels and environmental impacts international civil aviation issues although not technically within the jurisdiction of the faa there are at least three major international aviation issu falling under the jurisdiction of the department of tran sportation dot that may ar ise as congress considers faa reauthorization legislation first ther is the potential that the open skies agreement with the european union will remain unsigned and unimplemented which is major concern for many us airlines seeking greater flexibility to operate flights in european markets second is th closely related issue regarding dots rulemaking on foreign ownership and cont rol of domestic carriers although the administrative process has been completed the dot has not to date issued final rule the delay has been due in part to strong congressional opposition that has taken the form both of introduced legislation and attempts to prevent the final rule through appropriations riders according to some commentators as comprehensive as the proposed agreement appears to be there cannot be meaningful reform in the international aviation market until congress repeals the socalled citizenship test which limits foreign ownership and control of us air carriers finally there is the longstanding issue of cabotage which is defined as the trans portation of passengers or cargo by foreign air carriers from one point in the united states to another and is with couple of narrow exceptions genera lly prohibited by us law limited statutory exception to this prohibition allowi ng international carri ers to carry certain cargo shipments between airports within the united states and destinations in alaska while route to foreign destinations wa s included in vision 100 in light of these various ongoing international aviation i ssues the faa

summer 2006airport and airway trust fund issues the forthcoming reauthorization debate is likely to focus on three major issues related to the trust fund first is the stion of whether the trust fund will provide sufficient revenue to meet the growing needs of the faas activities and programs second is the long standing issue of whet her the existing tax and fee system is the appropriate mechanism for pr oducing trust fund revenues or whether an entirely new revenue collection mechanism should be adopted and third is the controversial issue of how much of faas total funding shoul d come from treasury general funds gf aviation trust fund re venue adequacy there is considerable discussion over the question of trust fund revenue adequacy for the years ahead table 2 shows that total trust fund income rose dramatically in fy1998 following the last major reauthorizati on of trust fund directed taxe s and fees by the taxpayers relief act of 1997 pl 10534 income increased even further in fy1999 declined somewhat in fy2000 and droppe d precipitously after september 11th as result primarily but not exclusively of the post september 11th drop in airline activity the revenue stream did not exceed the fy2001 level until fy2005 and was not expected to exceed the record fy1999 level until fy2006 throughout this period faa spending has not been reduced to accommodate the trust funds reduced income stream rather faa spending has continued apace mostly by spending down the uncommitted balance of the trus t fund which stood at over 73 billion at the end of fy2001 and is expected to be down to around 12 billion by the end of fy20069 when the faa began discussing reauthorization in 2005 the future of the aviation trust fund was listed as key item for consideration10 the faa contends that something needs to be done to incr ease the trust fund income stream and to prevent further erosion in the uncommitte d balance of the fund for number of reasons detailed at its reauthorization website the faa sees little prospect of major increase in revenue from the trust funds exis ting tax and fee system instead as will be discussed subsequently the faa seeks reexamination of the tax and fee system with an eye toward new system that more closely tracks actual aviation industry activity than the current system and in th process ensures that the trust fund will receive adequate revenues to finance future faa aviation system needs the faa position is supported by the department of treasury estimates that suggest that annual revenue increases to the trust fund in the years ahead will be modest11 treasury forecasts that annual increas in trust fund revenue will increase by 766 million in fy2007 to 116 billion increases in future years will be between

likely to be matter of considerable debate in line with the cbo estimate number of outside groups disagree with the treasury and the faas assessment of future trust fund revenues as being insufficient to fund ngats and other initiatives the ai rcraft owners and pilots association aopa for example has produced its own revenue forecasts and predicts that the trust fund will have an adequate revenue stream well into the future14 unlike the faa view aopa and others sharing their pe rspective believe that rising airline fares and airline activity increased income from fuel taxes and cost reductions from air traffic control atc modernization will be sufficient to result in an unexpended trust fund balance of over 4 billion by fy 2011 with the possibility that the balance could be considerably higher tax and fee structural issues the coming debate about how the faa should be funded largely revolves around the concept of user fees there are number of variations as to how user fee is defined useful definition of user fee from transportation perspective was provided in 1953 by the department of commerce office of transportation and is still valid for todays discussion user charge is defined as any charge made to beneficiaries or users of services and facilities directly related to transportation and furnished in whole or in part by the federal government such charge must be paid for use of such service or facility and shall be fixed to recover part or all of the capital operating and maintenance costs of such service or facility the services shall not include cash subsidies mortgageaid or taxaid or certain other activities not confined to transportation or involv ing transportation only incidentally15 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33698crs16 16 the terms airway system and air traffic control are often used interchangeably in the context of this report the airway system is br oader including air traffic control services personnel and equipment as well as us na vigable airspace and some other supporting activities of the faa 17 wald matthew w faa seeks new source of revenue in user fees the new york times march 7 2006 p a18for aviation most of the interest in user fees has been in recovering the costs associated with industry use of the nationa l air navigation system airway system or air traffic control system16 user fees can be direct sometimes referred to as payforuse or payforservice whereby an aircraft or pilot is charged for specific activity examples of direct charges include radio contacts with atc enroute centers contacts with airport towers and weightdistance charges of the type levied frequently outside the united states the weight of the aircraft multiplied by the distance flown the other type of user fee that can be levied is an indirect fee examples include fuel taxes aircraft registration fees and gross re venue taxes indirect fees and charges are often viewed by economists as proxies for user fees rath er than as actual user fees they are normally viewed as imperfect in that the fee charged is often more poorly correlated to the service provided than direct fee would be common example is the existing airline passenger tax where airline passengers flying on the same aircraft are charged user fees based on the fare that they paid even though all are using exactly the same amount of airway resources for number of reasons i ndirect fees are the dominant type of fee in use in the us aviation system today on may 21 1970 president nixon signed the airport and airway development and revenue acts of 1970 pl 91258 1970 act which was the origin of the trust fund financing system still in place today the fee system created to provide revenue for the trust fund consisted of an airline ticket tax freightcargo waybill tax an international departure tax also applied to alaska and hawaii per gallon tax on noncommercial prima rily ga use of gasoline and je t fuel and finally graduated aircraft registration fee three and half decades later the same basic framework of taxes and fees with the deletion of the ai rcraft registration fee and the addition of segment fee an international arrivals tax and frequent flyer tax which can be viewed as an extension of the ticket tax remain the principal sources of income for the trust fund see table 2 in 2005 the faa announced that it was beginning detailed examination of how the agency was funded and whether th ere could be more appropriate funding mechanism key element of the examination is the longdebated issue of whether the existing indirect system of taxation should be replaced by direct charges for specific air navigation services to some degree the faa tipped off the aviation industry as to the likely direction of its study when faa administrator marion blakey remarked that using the existing ticket tax mechanism was system that might as well be tied to the price of milk17 the faa however has not yet made any public proposals for new funding mech anism and

use the exception in the ata proposal is that pistonpowered general aviation aircraft should continue to pay only fuel tax by its own estimates the ata proposal could shift an estimated 2 billion of system co sts to certain ga sector users primarily corporate aircraft which the ata believes currently underpay for their use of the atc system19 the ata proposal go beyond just fee structure changes and suggests that the faas air traffic orga nization ato become an autonomous part of the agency with the ability to operate without the need for direct congressional appropriations instead the fees collected from aviation system users which would still be deposited in the avia tion trust fund one final feature of the proposal would give the ato the authority to issue bonds for infrastructure improvements backed by expected future fee collections on the same day that the ata made its proposal group of garelated interest groups released statement suggesting that the airlines plan for improving the air transportation system is for them to pay less and control more20 from the ga perspective the ata case that certain ga users underpay for their use of the atc system is incorrect for number of reasons the ga contention is that the current structure of the atc system was primarily created to support commercial airline use and that they are not putting significant additional burden on the atc system as result of their flying activities from the ga perspective fuel taxes remain the most appropriate type of user f ee and the atas proposal to reorganize the ato outside of the congressional appropriations process is view ed as undesirable public policy the above discussion is simplification of very complex and contentious issue about who pays and who should pay for faa aviation services that goes back over at least six decades it should be noted th at the discussion of aviation user fees has been almost exclusively conversation be tween the federal gove rnment and

the atc debate has moved away from whether or not the airways system should be operated as public good and is instead often focu sed on how the system could be operated more efficiently using business principles calls for atc privatization in the united states and the fact that other nations have at least to some degree allowed their airways systems to be privatized woul d seem to indicate that the provision of airways services is not something that must always be exclusively performed by government corporatization the concept that the f aas atc services could be reorganized as government corporation within the faa andor independent from the faa was considered at length in the 1990s during the clinton administration the idea was that an independent entity operated along business principles although not fully privatized would be able to operate more efficiently and make needed system improvements on more timely basis although the effort had the support of the administration and especially vice presiden t gore it ultimately failed to gain much congressional pport and was aba ndoned in favor of other personnel system and procurement system reforms adopted in the latter half of the 1990s21 privatization unlike corporatizati on would most likely move the atc organization outside of government and require that the organization act like private corporation in most respects this would include pricing for example setting fees at levels designed to rec oup operating costs and to provide capital for needed investment privatization in some form has been adopted in canada the united kingdom australia and new zealand among other nations privatization has strong proponents22 and attempts have been made to make it at least an option for consideration during the upcoming reauthoriz ation debate it re mains to be seen however whether the faa or congress will consider the concept in earnest the general fund share since the existing tax and fee structure was created in 1970 there has been general accepta nce of the concept that there is public interest component to the operation of the national aviation system from the perspective of federal aviation policy the public interest generally refers to that portion of the cost of the faas operation of the airway system that is appropriated from the treasury general fund for the f aas budget this is the

oups believe that the federal general fund contribu tion to the faas annual ppropriation is too small to correspond to the existing and potential milita ry and other public benefits of the airways system conversely the faa omb and other g overnment agencies as well as congressional appr opriations and budget committees usually believe the general fund contribution is too large the authors of the 1970 act envisioned that the trust fund would primarily support faa capital programs although ther are some who contend that the trust fund was intended only for capital progra ms several studies have suggested that this was not the case and that the 1970 ac t allowed trust fund re venues to be spent for noncapital mostly operations and maintenance activities23 since president nixon unsuccessfully sought to fund all faa act ivities out of the trust fund in the early 1970s tension has existed between those who seek to maximize use of the trust fund for all aviation purposes and those who seek to have its funds directed onlyprimarily toward capital activities as table 2 shows the general fund contribution to overall faa appropriations has varied over the last decade ranging from low of 0 in fy2000 to high of 38 in fy1998 and fy1999 in the most recent four year period however the genera l fund share has been more consistent 20 or so the issue of the general fund share is closely tied to the issue of spending guarantee provisions including penalty nd cap provisions which are an almost routine portion of faa reauthorization legi slation these provisions and their policy implications are discussed in the ne xt section of this report aviation spending guarantees as mentioned above since the 1971 creation of the usersupported airport and airway trust fund there has been disagreement over the appropriate use of the trust funds revenues this led beginning in 1976 to the enactment of ries of legislative mechanisms designed to assure that federal capital spending fo r us airports and airways ie aip and fe would be funded at their fully aut horized levels supporters also hoped that these provisions would assure signifi cant general fund share for the faa budget such funding guarantee proposals have b een part of every faa reauthorization debate since 197624 the cap and penalty era from fy1977 through fy1990 the guarantees consisted of variety of both cap and penalty provisions which by law set ceiling on the amount of aviation trust fund money that could be used to fund faahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33698crs20 25 an element of this softening of support was that the implementation of the nas fell behind the schedule that was assume d when fe was being authorizedoperations and penalty that would reduce this ceiling by formula linked to the capital programs appropriations shortfall below their authorization for the fiscal year although the cap and penalty c p provisions had so apparent early success fy1977fy1980 there was growing resistance to passing appropriations bills that adhered to the penalties during the 1980s the cap alone appears to have been even less often adhered to durin g the mid1990s following the penaltys elimination in 1990 over time however certa in unintended consequences arose that continue to play part in the debate over funding guarantee mechanisms for example the cp appeared to have significant role in the growth of the uncommitted balance in the trus t fund sometimes referred to as surplus although the various mechanisms may have succeeded in restricting spending from the aviation trust fund on operations they did not necessarily succeed in forcing full appropriation of authorized aip and fe funding levels ov erall congressional support for adherence to the annual cap s and penalties durin g the appropriations process was not always sufficient to lead to their enforcement25 in addition especially during the 1990s within the c ontext of the unified congressional budget some appropriations and budget committee mbers were more c oncerned about the overall size of the budget or deficit than with adhering to the spending guarantee mechanisms under the unified cong ressional budget the growing unexpended balance of the trust fund could be viewed as in effect offsetting spending elsewhere in the budget or reducing the apparent size of the budget deficit this broader budget situation and related appropriations prior ities trumped the cp mechanisms under the cp especially prior to the eliminati on of the penalty the general fund share remained in most years significantly hi gher than most estimates of the appropriate public interest share during fy1999 and fy2000 however years when spending guarantee was authorized the general fund share dr opped to 15 and 0 respectively current law point of order enforced spending guarantees in 2000 air21 included two new spending guar antees one made it outoforder in the house or senate to consider legislation that failed to use all

for fe as was true under the cp mechanism th first years of the air21 guarantees fy2001fy2003 appeared to have successfully assured that both aip and fe were funded at or very near their authorized vels however as was true under the cp mechanism congressional support for adherence declined during the following years adherence to the guarantees in the annual appropriations bills dur ing the last three years has been mixed on the one hand the obligation limitations for aip for fy2004fy2006 have been very close to their authorized levels for these years on the other hand fe spending has been cut significantly in each of these years see table 1 fes annual appropr iation fell below its authorization as follows 320httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33698crs21 26 in part this may have been because if point of order were uphel d the entire aip or fe financing provision would be stricken from the bill that senate conferees would take to conference this absence of funding prov ision could put the senate conferees at disadvantage in negotiating with house conferees over the contents of the bill to be voted out of conferencemillion for fy2004 468 million for fy2005 and 498 million for fy2006 these fe funding levels were out of conformance with the guarantees and should have made the funding of the om and red components of faas budget out of order during these years it also should have led to additional popup budget authority for the aip equal to the annual underfunding of fe there are number of reasons that th guarantee provisions have not been adhered to in recent years specific to fe spending there has been the lack of confidence that congress has had in the ability of the faa to oversee nas modernization the hesitance to fully fund fe may have more to do with this than with specific resistance to dherence to the funding guarantees however some other weaknesses in the current guarantee mechanism have manifested themselves in recent years spending guarantees that are enforced by pointoforder actions only work if the pointoforder is raised by member and if they have not been waived by rule in the house recent annual appr opriations bills have had all pointsoforder waived by the rules committee senators have also chosen not to raise pointsof order against violations of the aip and fe funding guarantees26 pointsoforder have not been allowed on ppropriations bill conference reports also the popup aip budget authority which some viewed as part of the mechanism for preventing appropriators from spending any fe shor tfall for noncapital aviation spending can and has been rescinded th rescissions allow appropriators to bring down the nominal total cost of the transportation treasury appropriations bills in the next budget year as was true during the cp era the current spe nding guarantees can still be trumped by broader budget policy goals such as deficit reduction or at times by the spending priorities of appropriators funding guarantee options aviation funding guarantees are expected to be considered in the faa reau thorization debate during the 110th congress and could include keeping the current system modifying the current guarantees resurrecting mechanism analogous to the cap and pena lty provisions reconsidering taking the trust fund offbudget or erecting budgetary fire walls as was done for the highway and transit programs in 1998 so would argue that there should be guarantees and that the normal congressi onal budget process should be allowed to progress unfettered the absence of large uncommitted trust fund balance could also have an impact on the support for new or continued aviation spending guarantee mechanisms during faa reauthorization in the 110th congress airport development and finance the airport improvement program aip

considered small airports are more likely to be dependent on aip grants than large or mediumsized airports the larger airports are also much more likely to participate in the taxexempt bond market or finance capital development projects with the proceeds generated from pfcs each of these funding sources places differing legislative regulatory or contr actual constraints on the airports that use them the two financing sources for airports with the most significant federal involvement are the aip and the pfc programs the aip provides federal grants to ai rports for airport development and

available for public use aip funding is usually limited to construction or imp rovements related to aircraft operations typically for planning and construction of projects such as runway s taxiways

reduced as can be seen in figure 1 aips funding underwent majo r increase in fy2001 and has had relatively small increase of 100 million each year since the outlook for aip funding will likely be influenced by the reso lution of the debate concerning the taxes and fees supporting the aviation trust fund as well as any decision concerning the scope of the general fund share of the faa budget failure to secure more revenues for the faa budget in light of the recent decline in the uncommitted balance of the trust fund could constrain attempts to increase the aip budget consensus in congress to reduce the federa l budget deficit or hold the deficits to existing levels as happened during the mid1990s also could constrain any aip budget increases35 these broader budget issues c ould have implications not only for the aip programs funding but also for its scope and formul and discretionary funding distribution under such overall budget constraint s congress could consider changes

airports the funds are available during the year that they are first apportioned and continue to be available for use for two years thereafter the remaining funds are apportioned to th discreti onary fund airports sponsors apply for discretionary funds to pay for planned airport capital development needs in recent years how ever significant amounts of discretionary funding have been earmarked by congress37 in recent years aip discretionary funds have ranged from roughly 2530 of th total annual aip funding distribution38 entitlement formula and discretionary small airport setasides tend to be supported by smaller airports and most airport advocates the air carriers tend to be critical of entitlements and set aside funding especially wh it benefits the smaller noncommercial service airports and have argued that c ongress must reconsider the vast array of setasides and earmarks under the aip prog ram which have seriously undermined its utility in providing mean ingful system capacity improvements39 business and general aviation advocates take exception to this view and counter that airports of all sizes are critical to the national airport system as whole and that reliever airports in partic ular are critical component of managing airline and general aviation traffic in an urban environment40 apportionment and eligibility changes apportioned funds sometimes referred to as entitlements were substantially increased in air21 and the range of landside projects that are eligible for aip grants were increased somewhat in both air21 and vision 100 most of the eligib ility changes benefitte d airports smaller than mediumhub41 although this trend coul d continue in the upcoming reauthorization debate if the budget environment is constrained project eligibilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33698crs26 42 recently the air transport association ata which represents the major air carriers argued that the current aip entitlements and set asides provides nearly one third of federal airport grants to airports that provide co mmercial service the ata argued that such expenditures would be more appropriately funded from general fund revenues than from the airport and airway trus t fund which supports aip 43 for example against cargo or commuter aircraft or night time flight operatorsmight need to be reconsidered if the overall authorization is reduced the apportioned funds may ve to be reduced to assure that sufficient funds remain to fund discretionary grants in particular for opera tional evolution plan projects the acina supports the maintenance of aip fundi ng for smaller airports and argues for giving these airports increased flexibility in the use of their entitlements the case can be made that over the years the broadening of aip eligibility at small airports has made it increasingly difficult to identify the federal interest that has been met by such spending as mentioned earlier air carriers are skeptical of the benefit to the national airport system of some proposals seeking to broaden project eligibility42 discretionary fund setasides the discretionary funds which are the remainder funds after the appor tionments are satisfied are subject to setasides for noise mitigation the military airports program map reliever airports and the capacitysafetysecuritynoise setaside any of these could be modified during

money remains the apportionments ar reduced pro rata to bring the discretionary funding up to the require d level because aip has been funded since fy2001 at historically high levels the minimum discretionary fund provision has not been factor in aip funding if however aips budget is reduced substantially or if the entitlements are increased substantially the appropriate minimum discretionary f und level may need to be reconsidered grant assurances along with the acceptance of aip funds come certain obligations generally referred to as assura nces that airports must agree to these assurances include the obligation to maintain and operate their facilities safely and efficiently as well as more specific obligations such as not to discriminate against any class of air system users43 to adhere to davisbacon prevailing wage requirements and to use air port revenue solely for spendi ng on airport operations and capital costs proposals to alter the aip gr ant assurances can be expected to arise during the reauthorization debate for example the acina is seeking bill that simplifies airport grant assurances including reforms that permit airports to use non aeronautical revenue sources to attract new and competitive air service to their communities supporters of maintaining the grant assurances generally argue that they not only help establish and enforce federal policy priorities but also insulate airports from local efforts to limit or shut down airport operations for example because of noise concerns or for land

and airports in states participating in the state block grant program45 but included sunset clause that returns the federal share back to 90 after 2007 should the federal or faa budget be constrained or held at current levels congress may wish to consider adjusting the federal share the federal share for most projects at large and medium hub airports is 75 privatization the airport privatization

congress may wish to review the pilot program although most us airports are public entities it is noteworthy that nearly all airport activities are carried out by private firms working under contract arrangements for the airport owners the city of chicago recently expressed interest in offering midway airport up for long term lease it has not yet applied for privatization exemption however partial defederalization one way to reduce the amount of trust fund revenue needed for aip would be to allo w large and medium hub airports to opt out of the aip program in favor of unrestricted or higher pf c financing this would in the view of some airport executives give them the flexibility they would prefer to have in managing their airports these airports would longer be bound by all of the grant

very light jets vljs and the airbus a380 impact on aip some predictions of the rapid growth of new type of aircraft the very light jet jets with takeoff weight less than 12500 pounds that can land on 3000 foot runway have in turn led to concerns that increased airport funding will be needed to accommodate them even if the optimistic estimates of the speed of introduction of vljs panout given that vljs have been specifically desi gned to operate at most existing general aviation airports existing airport facilities s hould be able to handle the traffic if however the advent of vljs leads to increasing demands for installing all weather capabilities at small airports or if insurers place requirements on vlj use for example that vljs only be us ed at airports with runways longer than 3000 feet the demand for aip funded improve ments at small airports could increase over time as mentioned previously small airports are more dependent on aip funding for their capital projects than larger

single facility in kansas city mo flight service information for alaska will continue to be coordinated out of the anchorage office the faa selected these sites for placing its consolidated area

federal aviation administration washington dc undated the faa in considering future consolidation efforts such as consolidation of certain air traffic service functions which are likel to be much more complex and could be much broader in scope compared to cons olidation efforts carried out thus far consolidation of air traffic services has been identified by some as potential means to adapt to anticipated changes in the controller workforce resulting from large scale retirements of experienced controllers as well as potential changes in controller job functions and to address staffing shortages particularly at certain route facilities congress may also have particular interest in the faas future consolidation plans of this kind because relocation of fe deral workers is likely to have impacts on regions and congressional districts even if the size of the job losses in particular location have minimal impact on the local economy they can be viewed as symbolic loss to community in terms of losing federal jobs and the perception that the federal government viewed the particular locale less favorably than other sites placing regions and districts in competition for consolidated federal facilities has the potential of creating large political pressures that can complicate the location selection process some observers have suggested that the military base

segmente d into route terminal area and airport tower control functions and facilities route fac ilities are called centers and usually handle traffic in highaltitude airspace while terminal area facilities refer generally to approach control facilities that control arrivals and departures to and from major airportsto pilots and mostly support general avia tion users while some in congress opposed this largescale conversion of federal jobs to the privat sector they were ultimately unsuccessful in getting legislation passed to prevent the faa from moving forward with the contracting of these afss positions in general most faa positions includi ng air traffic controller positions are considered commercial and not inherently governmental in nature these jobs could therefore be outsourced at the faas discretion following guidelines set forth in the federal activities inventor reform act of 1998 fair pl 105270 and omb circular a7657 hence specific initiatives to outsource certain functions or programs within the faa do not require dditional authority nd therefore typically are not central issues in the reauthorization debate however as in the case of the debate over protecting air tr affic functions from priva tization during the vision 100 reauthorization process and the in troduction of legislation in the 109th congress to prevent the outsourcing of flight serv ice station positions congress may opt to consider limitations on the outsourcing of faa functions while the intent of outsourcing is to control escalating costs within the faa outsourcing initiatives are always likely to be contentious because they involve conversion of federal jobs to the private sector and large scale outsour cing efforts could impact morale and productivity among federal workers under current policy the faa continues to expand the federal contract tower program and consolidation of automated flight service station functions is underway under the private contract awarded in 2005 while these initiatives are not likely to be the focus of debate during the upcomin g faa reauthorization they illustrate the faas approach to competitive sourcing and may provide model for other faa functional areas such as aeronautical charting and operating and maintaining the faas telecommunications infrastructure to streamline operations and improve cost savings through competitive sourcing therefore these ongoing outsourcing programs are examined in further detail below the federal contract tower fct program the fct program awards faa contracts for staffing certain

contentious issue concerns we re raised that further expansion of the program could escalate to widescale priva tization of larger components of the air traffic system such as route and terminal area

the united states the fct program came into existence in 1982 initially as pilot program at five airports in an effort to provide continued air traffic services at lowactivity towers in the wake of the nationwide ai r traffic controller strike and subsequent dismissal of striking faa air traffic cont rollers for the first twelve years the program remained relatively small growing to 27 towers by 1993 nonetheless the program gained the attention of the national performance review npr an initiative spearheaded by thenvice presiden t gore that later became known as the national partnership for re inventing government wh ich endorsed the program in 1993 as an effective means of reinven ting government services and recommended its expansion59 beginning in 1994 the contract tower program rapidly expanded to 160 towers by the end of fy199760 the fct program was advocated by the npr largely because of its perceived effectiveness as costsaving initiative th cost savings were quantified in 2003 audit by the dot oig the audit compared operating costs at 12 contract towers to operating costs at comparable faarun towers and found the average annual cost savings of the contract tower pr ogram to be about 917000 per tower61 the dot oig determined that the cost savings unde r the contract tower program are primarily due to lower staffing levels and lower salaries in comparison to similar faastaffed facilities the same anal ysis was conducted by the faa in 1999 using fy1998 data when it was determined that the average nnual cost savings of the contract tower program to be 787000 per tower the dot oig attributed the increase in cost savings to increased costs associated with the controller pay system that was implemented in fy1998 while the national air traffic controlle rs association natca has continued to challenge the fct program on lega l grounds the program has continued to expand and it now includes more than 230 airport control towers beginning in

repeated audits of operations at cont ract towers conducted by the dot oig have indicated that these facilities provide level of safety comparable to that of faastaffed towers natca has challenged these findings claiming that contract towers have fewer controllers provide less training and subject personnel to inadequate work conditions natca contends that these conditions result in degradation in the level of safety and service that controllers are able to provide63 while the dot oig did conclude that contract towers are staffed with fewer controllers none of these othe r claims have been substantiated by dot oig findings or any other independent asse ssment of contract towers to date in 1999 congress mandated an faa study to examine further expansion of the fct program to include faarun towers without radar capability while faa took narrow view of this requirement and id entified only 41 airport towers without any radar capability whatsoever subsequent review by the dot oig in 2000 identified an additional 30 airports for possible in clusion that had limited radar monitoring capability and provided limited ai rcraft separation services under instrument flight rules ifr but were in its opinion fficiently similar to other airport towers already in the fct program64 natca however raised significant objections to the proposal to further expand the contract to wer during debate ove r reauthorization of the faa in 2003 in part because 11 of th 71 airports cited in dot oigs report were among the 50 busiest towers in the united states65 primarily because the staffing levels nd costs of federallyoperated towers are significantly greater than those of contr actoroperated towers the contract tower program has largely been viewed as an effective means for funding the continued operation of certain towers that would otherwise be cost prohibitive to operate as faarun facilities audits and review s of the program have not found any meaningful differences in the quality and safety of air traffic services provided by contract and subcontracted towers under th is program compared to faarun towers ongoing issues for continuance and po ssible expansion of the

separation incentives to downsize staff in preparation for the transition to minimize the need for i nvoluntary separations despite these steps the reorganization nd shift to contracted operations had notable impact on those federal employees nearing retirement eligibility recognizing that some displaced afss employees close to reaching retirement eligibility were significantly disadvantaged by the

function that may be likely candidate for future competitive sourcing is the aeronautical charting function which produ ces and distributes charts and flight information publications in hardcopy and ectronic formats for system users the aeronautical charting function is comparably small in scale however consisting of about 220 positions which is less than oneten th the size of the afss function the faa assumed responsibility for aeronau tical charting from the national ocean service component of th national oceanic and atmospheric administration in fy1999 presently th faas national aeronautical charting office naco publishes and distributes civil aeronautical charts and flight information publications to both government and public users in recent years the move toward digital geospatial data and geographic information systems gis has provided for easier consolidation and sharing of geospatial data used for among other th ings creating the faas aeronautical chart products most observers believe that naco has done well in keeping pace with these technological changes thus far however as aviation moves more and more toward digital charts and flight information publications in the cockpit naco may find itself taking on new roles of developi ng digital products to interface with new avionics equipment and technology at all levels of aviation rather than simply providing this information in hard copy and digital renditions to end users among airlines and other commercial operators already using digital flight information and chart products extensively commercially prov ided data used in flight management systems electronic flight bags and so forth accounts for large proportion of the disseminated data even with respect to hard copy charts and flight information publications naco products for the most pa rt already compete in the market with products produced by commerc ial vendors and have done so virtually since the government began dissemina ting aeronautical charts more than70 years ago such direct competition between government provided and comme rcial vendor products is often considered telltale sign of whether particul ar

legislation to protect any faa functions from privatization or competitive sourcing including naco functions during that last reauthorization cycle because naco functions closely resemble aeronautical charting functions provided by at least one co mmercial vendor it may be difficult to make strong case that such functions should continue to be governmentrun if congress were to task the faa with identifying functions that are readily amenable to competitive sourcing competitions naco functions already have commercial corollary and therefore could be prime candidate for inclusion however the small size and relative efficiency of the naco organization may render any attainable cost savings from outsourcing relatively small given that the total naco budget is only about 50 million annually

designated by the faa to carry out regulatory functi ons examples include designated medical examiners that issue medical certification p ilot examiners that issue pilot certificates and ratings and

functions are supplemented by more than 11000 designees including bout 4800 conducting airc raft certification about 1500 involved in flight standards and almost 5000 designated aviation medical examiners while the use of designees is longstanding policy at the faa and it is widely considered an effective means for controlling operational costs it has been considered controvers ial in some cases while the use of aviation medical examiners that conduct medical exams on be half of the faa and check airman that conduct pilot tests for certificates and ra tings is less controversial the use of designees in aircraft design and manufact uring organizations and for oversight of airline operations and mainte nance has raised some cerns among aviation safety experts also the gao recently identifie d faas inconsistent monitoring and inadequate oversight of designees as si gnificant weaknesses in these programs70 although the use of designees provides an effective means to control costs safety oversight concerns may impose some limitations over the extent of using designees to effectively utilize designees as cost control measure and address these safety oversight concerns the faa ma consider options to target designee use and give priority to qualified faa retir ees to perform designee functions for example the faa may seek to expand the use of designees at manufacturer and airline facilities that have clearly demonstrated that they have effective safety management programs in place by increasing the use of designees among these operators and facilities the faa may be able to better align its inspector workforce to concentrate more on sectors of the av iation industry where more extensive safety concerns have been identified such as at contract repair stati ons and among smaller commercial operators by using qualified former faa employees in designee roles the faa may be able to further improve the quality of its designee workforce also by increasing the number of federal annuitants with aviation experience in the designee workforce the faa may be able to reduce concerns over designees being mostly dependent on their salaries or compensation received from

president reagans firing of striking c ontrollers in 1981 the faas strategy for controller staffing issued in december 2004 relies primarily on an accelerated rate of hiring of controllers through 2014 nd achieving increased controller productivity through variety of human resource management initiatives71 the faas projections show total of just over 11000 active controllers roughly 75 of the 2005 workforce retiring or otherwise leaving the controller ranks between 2005 and 2014 about 8250 of these losses will specifically be due to retirements during this period th faa plans to hire 12500 controllers to replace controller losses and meet future system needs72 historically the faa had filled controller positions once they became aware that controller was planning to leave which meant that there was usually little leadtime to hire replacements the strategy for addressing the impending wave of controlle r retirements is intended to be more proactive it invol ves planned surge in hiring in the nearterm compared to historic hiring trends to put controller trainees into the pipeline so that they can replace retiring controllers on more accelerated pace given that it takes on average little over three years for controller to become fully certified this initial surge in hiring is anticipated to be followed by steady flow of new hires to keep pace with attrition rates see

are also be ing developed and deployed to improve and provide greater automation and assessment capabilities in the controller training environment the faa is continuing to work with universities through the collegiate training initiative cti to recruit and provide baseline training to the future generation of controllers despite these steps congress may debate whether controller staffing standards nd projected staffing levels provide an adequate level of sa fety and whether funding and in itiatives to train and place high quality controllers will adequately meet projected staffing needs over the next several years congress may also consider options to allow cti program graduates to enter directly into onthejob training this approach may streamline controller training and could significantly cut the faas traini ng costs but questions remain regarding whether the cti program by itself would pr ovide sufficient screening of prospective controllers or whether initial training at the faa academy is also needed to identify and weed out trainees not we ll suited for controller careers74 beside hiring new controllers the faa strategy also consists of improving controller productivity the faa expects to achieve savings of 10 by 2010 through better management of controller shifts greater flexibility in shift staffing better management and oversight of overtime and sick leave usage reducing productivity losses due to dical restrictions and wo rkrelated disabilities and reducing the amount of time controllers spend on paperwork union business and attending workshops mee tings and conferences75 progress on these initiatives may be of particular interest during cong ressional debate over faa reauthorization the faa asserts that the current situation is characterized more by staffing imbalances across the system rather than systemwide staffing shortage76 the faa is addressing facility imbalances in its controller workforce strategy by restricting transfers that do not maintain ba lanced staffing objectives and by offering voluntary reassignments to be tter balance staff allocations particularly at those route facilities that are understaffed

congress may consider whether better screening tools during initial training such as simulation training and evaluations can serve to better identify controller aptitude and assign to busy route centers only those developmental controllers considered most likely to be successful in onthejob training at these facilities such tools c ould help eliminate controller washout at busy route terminals that results in tran sfers to smaller less demanding terminal airspace increased use of emerging air traffic automati on technologies may also help to improve staffing imbalances in the futu re both by reducing st affing requirements and by decreasing job complexity that could greatly reduce failure rates one longterm option for reducing staffing imbalances is to consolidate air traffic facilities the faa asserts that colocating facilities of different complexity levels can help developmental controllers progress to more complex airspace in manner that better fits each controllers individual progression77 colocated facilities may also provide experienced controllers with greater career advancement opportunities without having to relocate and may help the faa reduce operational costs for facilities and employee transfers while options to consolidate air traffic facilities are only in the initial conceptual stages congress may consider options to require the faa to examine consolidation alternatives or for impartial observers such as the national academies to study the feasibility costs and benefits and impacts of consolidating air traffic services on systemwide basis as previously discussed congress may also consider whether braclike process may provide mechanism for evaluating air traffic control facility consolidation options faa labor relations and negotiations with regard to controlling operational costs air traffic controller pay remains particularly contentious issue as cont roller compensation and benefits make up sizable proportion of the faas

increasing capacity needs at highvolume airports in airspace around many major metropolitan areas and along certain highly congested routes after decrease in air travel brought about by variety of factors including most prominently the terrorist attacks of ptember 11 2001 air traffic is again on the rise and so are the associated congestion and delays at many commercial airports while stopgap measures implemented by the faa have served well to stave off unacceptable congestion and delays thus far longterm solutions are likely to be needed in consideration of future air traffic growth projections quantifying delay and mitigating its impacts delay is multifaceted metric that is largely regarded as symptom of possible strains on capacity within the national airspace system nas while there was relatively large decrease in demand for air travel from 2001 to 2004 that produced fewer delays over the past tw years key delay statistics ve been steadily rising indicating possible

challenges are mounting as traffic during the summer of 2006 at many busy airports surpassed traffic levels during the summer of 2000 when the f aas inability to cope with demand combined with thunderstorms and maintenance inefficienci at airlines produced large spike in delays to the chagrin of air travelers while many travelers perceive that delays are frequently associated with weather

understood what speci fic inefficiencies in the system have the most detrimental effects on delay most experts agree that in order to alleviate capacityrelated delay at busy airports priority must be given to increasing the systems ability to handle traffic during w visibility conditions many believe that technology is needed to reduce low visib ility aircraft spacing standards to those allowable in good visibility in order to acco mmodate projected future growth in air traffic operations at busy air ports however some experts caution that even with the implementation of these proposed options and the completion of planned airport expansions across the country certain ve ry busy airports throughout the country including both major commercial airports and the busiest general aviation reliever airports may experience peak hour demand vels that greatly exceed airport capacity limitations while these capacity constrained airports as well as surrounding airspace and certain route corridors be tween these busiest airports are becoming saturated at peak operating hours these impacts are highly geographically specific these geographic distributions of congestion and delay can be linked to population trends toward increased growth in ma jor metropolitan areas throughout the united states fastgrowing cities in the southeast and southwestern states and to socio economic factors of particular metropolitan ar eas that have strong effect on demand for air travel99 the asymmetry of capacity straining operations one major challenge for system planners is that air traffic is highly concentrated among relatively small number of airports serving major metropolitan areas across the united states therefore across the entire national airspace system the volume and distribution of air traffic is highly asymmetric or unbalan ced specifically in high altitude airspace there are choke poi nts where aircraft transitioning between cities in the northeast and chicago and the west coast converge and also along the heavily congested air routes up and down the east and west coasts of the united states prior crs analysis found that projected future system demand based on geographic population distribution trends is likely to continue along the path of increasing air traffic density at these already congested major metropolitan airports and along the busiest traveled flight routes100 similarly analysis by the faa and th mitre corporation found that despite ongoing efforts and plans to expand air port and system capacity under the faas operational evolution plan oep capacity constraints are likely at several airports that serve major metropolitan areas and fastgrowing cities101 in addition to examining projected increases in flights between major cities extensive socioeconomic information was used in the study to identify locations wherehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33698crs48 additional capacity needs are anticipated that would not otherwise have been

new york metropolitan area newark laguardia and john f kennedy internationa l made the list as did three airports in the angeles area if planned impr ovements dont occur the total number of airports needing additional capacity may rise to 26 by 2020 the study predicts that the number of airports needing additional capacity will grow to 18 assuming planned enhancements stay on track before then an additional 23 airports were identified as potentially needing additional capacity by 2020 if planne d improvements are delayed or cancelled for some metropolitan areas the outlook is not particularly promising in angeles for exampl if planned enhancements dont occur additional capacity will be needed at all major commercial airports and two key reliever airports even with the planned enhancements in place the angeles metropolitan area will face significant capacity constraints in the next 10 to 15 years while major metropolitan areas like an geles and new york face significant challenges to meet aviation capacity needs over the next 15 years anticipated capacity needs identified in the study were not just limited to the largest metropolitan areas and the current busiest airports fo r example the study found that the fast growing metropolitan areas of austin and san antonio texas and tucson arizona while not included among the nations 35 busiest airports the oep35 are nonetheless anticipated to have signifi cant need for additional capacity over the next 15 years spurred by large economic growth in sum the capacity needs study identified significant challenges ahead for meeting aviation capacity demand in large and fastgrowing metropolitan areas accommodating future airspace users besides addressing expected capacity needs and recognizing that these needs are likely to be highly specific to particular geographic regions of the united states significant challenge facing congress and the faa in the years ahead is accommodating new classes of airspace users in manner that optimizes safety and efficiency for all users new users will consist of the very big such as the airbus 380 superjumbo jet as well as the very sm all very light jets vljs the most talkedabout class of new system users ar the vljs which are expected to begin operations in small numbers in 2007 and are projected to experience rapid growth over the next ten years vljs are seen by some as possible solution to provide small communities improved access to the national air transportation system therefore their introduction may spur re newed public policy bate over approaches to enhance air transportation in small co mmunities also because these vljs will share high altitude airspace and cong ested airspace around major metropolitan areas with commercial passenger jets their impact on system capacity and air traffic control workload is likely to be of partic ular interest besides vljs the introduction of pilotless unmanned aerial vehicles uavs or unmanned aerial systems uass poses significant challenges to maintaining safety and not impeding access to airspace for other users such as small general aviation aircraft also there is continued interest among so developers

pounds maximum ta keoff weight with typical seating configurations for two to seve n occupants marketing of vljs has targeted fractional ownership programs and airtaxi operations as an alternative to airline travel with much lower operating costs than traditional business jets growth projections for vljs operations over the next 10 years suggest that the faa considers that vlj utilization may have significant impact on aviation system dema nd the faas optimism over vlj utilization are reflected in its most recent aviation forecasts which project an average annual growth of 102 in general avia tion turbojet activity over the next ten years attributable in large part to the anticipated popularity of vljs102 while there appears to be considerable market for vlj aircraft their specific impact on the airspace system will largely depend on how they are utilized if the utilization of vljs is predominantly accounted for by individual owners corporations and fractiona l ownership programs then vljs may have more substantial impact on general aviation reliever airports if on the other hand large number of vljs are used for airtaxi service with connectivity to commercial air carrier networks then the vlj impact could exacerbate concerns over congestion and delay at larger commercial airports or perhaps seconda ry commercial airports such as chicagos midway airport there is varying speculation regarding how significant of an impact vljs will have on the national airspace system pointing to historical trends some have concluded that much of the speculation over vlj boom that could cripple the existing airspace system is largely hype103 but others see great promise in the vlj concept because of their comparatively w operating costs and flexibility to utilize small airports that are inaccessible to larger aircraft used in airline and commuter operations104 the vlj aircraft are envisioned by some to fulfill perceived needs for air transport in small communities where

airtaxi services using these small jets this in turn will likely depend on variety of fact ors including the public perception of vlj safety and reliability public demand for newly offere d services and the ability of companies to control operational costs so that vlj transportation can be offered at reasonable price one operational issue that may arise is whether the faa will allow these jets to fly with single pilot in airtaxi operations while the jets are certified for single pilot operations current commercial flight regulations require two pilots on flights conducted for hire this could have significant impact on costs in an environment where revenues on each flight can be generated from only five or six available seats thus far only one company dayjet is poised to try out the concept of using vljs in an airtaxi operation with plans to initiate service in the southeast united states within one year106 dayjet has developed an ex tensive program for monitoring operations and has received safety co mpliance certification from key industry auditing firms meanwhile others that have expressed interested in launching vlj airtaxi operation including th muchtalkedabout pogo jet company appear to be taking waitandsee approach before launching operations the high degree of uncertainty regarding the extent of the market for vlj airtaxi operations makes it difficult to predict how and where vlj operations will specifically impact the national airspace system nas during debate over faa reau thorization congress may consider options involving the use of vljs to provide

given the intens interest in uav technologie s and the safety concerns raised by other airspace user s the faas approach to regulating the safety of uavs could be topic of partic ular interest as

the evolving blueprint for nearterm airport and airspace capacity enhancement and the anticipated increase in effective capacity and operational efficiency envisioned under the ngats plan several airports th roughout the united states either are already constrained by available capacity or will become capacity constrained in the coming years if future growth projections prove accurate111 due to these persisting capacity limitations in certain locations the faa and congress may be faced with difficult choices regarding how to best maintain access and address demand in an equitable manner

such as having the faa or dot serve as mediator during discu ssions of scheduling or as an observer to ensure that there is collusion or other violation of antitrust statutes and regulations and that specific user gr oups are unfairly disadvantaged in establishing schedules and access to airports the government may take somewhat more active role in such activities by discussing air traffic concerns over proposed schedule options or even suggesting scheduling options based on air traffic manage ment considerations and models of traffic flow another way in which government could exert limited control over scheduling practices is to implement incentives for offpeak scheduling or disincentives for operations during peak hours incentive pr ograms could be accomplished through quota systems for example multiplying landing or takeoff during peak hours by weighting factor when calculating an operators daily or monthly quota of operations at specified airport incentiv programs could also be implemented by increasing or imposing fees such as landi ng fees or atc impact fees during peak hours more direct government involveme nt may involve the use of slot or quota systems where operators and air carri ers are allocated limited access to certain congested airports at the other end of the spectrum from government involvement at all over airlin scheduling practices is g overnment regulation of the airline industry which was deregulated in 1978 since it is likely that any proposal to reregulate the airline industry woul d face strong opposition from both the airlines and consumers such an option is not considered further in the current debate over alleviating congestion at major airports significant policy question that remains is what degr ee of government

daily july 15 2004 pp 12options under consideration to address this issue fall into two broad categories 1 strategies for curtailing peak hour demand at busy airports through various incentives or disincentives and 2 the use of slots or quotas to allocate access at capacity constrained airports nonprice depeaking strategies and incentives d p k i n g strategies are designed to alleviate congestion and delay at airports during peak travel times depeaking strategies can be implemented with varying degrees of government involvement with minima l level of government i nvolvement airlines may negotiate schedules in manner that would reduce delay under recently passed statutes that exempt airlines from antitrust laws to allow them to hold meetings for these purposes specifically vision 100 tablished collaborative decisionmaking trial program at two of the most capacityconstrained airports in the united states under the experimental program air lines are provided special immunity from antitrust laws in order to hold collaborative discussions regarding flight scheduling in order to use air traffic capacity most effectively112 under this program airlines have nego tiated peak hour schedules at chicagos ohare airport over the past two years with some limited success the faa persuaded united airlines and american air lines to voluntarily cut peak hour flights at ohare however there is concern that these concessions alone were not sufficient to alleviate congestion because ot her carriers have adde d peak time flights at ohare113 consequently the faa has been working with industry to come up with an equitable schedule arrangement for addressing congestion at ohare in recent decision the faa has limited the number of unscheduled operations at ohare to 5 per hour but so operators have criticized this measure because they assert that it disadvantages charter operators who are longer able to use meigs field nearby general aviation reliever airport that was closed by the city of chicago in the spring of 2004 as we ll as operators who base or perform maintenance on their aircraft at ohare the process for managing schedules at ohare is increasingly leading the two legacy carriers who have curt ailed operations to complain about losing market share to smaller low cost airlines that are expanding in the chicago market the ongoing frustrations in effectively managing sc hedule demand at ohare highlights the challenges of trying to do so in an equitable fashion that does not impact competition in the market ironically the statutory us of slots at ohare was eliminated in 2002 under provisions in air21 pl 106181 th current scenario at ohare suggests that some government intervention to c ontrol schedules at some of the nations busiest

seats114 this analysis indicates that by depeaking operations carriers may be able to increas productivity make more efficient use of gates and consolidate ter minal operations thus there appears to be viable business case for depeaking operations in cer tain instances consequently airlines may be quite willing to adopt nonprice peaking strategies that could serve mutual benefit to both air line operations as well as f aa air traffic operations in cases where there are clear cut business advantages to nonprice peaking operations and where equitable solutions can be attained by airline industry collaboration and barg aining over flight schedules the federal government or more likely airport opera tors may look to specific peaking incentives such as peak hour pricing as means to manage schedule demand few in the airline industry are in favor of such system the ata opposes congestion pricing schemes because they argue that these mechanis ms siphon off revenues from airlines and put the money in the hands of the airports which are natural m onopolies and do not have to compete in the highly competitiv and price sensitive airline industry115 similarly regional airlines and genera l aviation operators object to peakhour pricing because they believe that such pr icing schemes would unfairl limit access to major airports to large carriers who can pass along increased landing fees to larger consumer base there is concern that peakhour pricin g may further limit air service to small communities served by regional carriers who will essentially be priced out of major airports116 airport operators may also look less favorably on peakhour pricing schemes over alternatives such as slots and quotas because peak hour pricing scheme is more complex to manage and may not result in meeting scheduling objectives to the extent that can be achieved by implementing slots and quotas117 slots and quotas since economic deregulati on of the airline industry in 1978 slots have been used at few busy ai rports as method to control airport scheduling under air21 statutory lang uage was enacted phasing out the use of slots largely over concerns that slots coul d preferentially

currently unable to gain slots at the airport and provisions to insure continued laguardia access for eas and other small community service118 the nprm is viewed as being in sync with existing temporary slot restrictions at chicago ohare airport in december 2006 the faa issued an order tablishing temporary limits to prevent congestionrelated delays at laguardia while the faa retains the authority to limit flight operations in this ma nner on the basis of safety c oncerns over the potential that the allocation of slots could result in unintended market imbalances or may disadvantage service to small communities could prompt congressional oversight or possible legislative action on the i ssue of airport slot allocations the ata opposes such system largely on the belief that exceptions and variances for slots such as those that currently exist for new entrant carriers and for flights serving small communities undermines the purported basis of these schemes for managing operational demand at busy airports and instead melds facets of market controls that directly affect airline business practices on the other hand the airport council interna tionalnorth america acina trade organization representing several large airport operators favors slot auctions over other schemes such as congestion pricing noting that allocating slots is administratively easier to implement and results in regular predicta ble schedules with fixed numbers of flights that can be tied directly to available air port capacity in st congestion pricing schemes can be difficult to manage and may have little or impact on congestion if they do not correctly predict market f actors and demand for peak travel times that may fluctuate based on va riety of market factors119 providing air service to

of reasons commercial air service in rural america has been falling since september 11th and this trend has continued even though air service nationally has largely returned to preseptember 11th

bring the ngats vision to its fruition in 2005 the national research council nrc issued critical review of the jpdo raising concerns that the jpdo was not sufficiently focused on its primary objective to resolve demand issues and increase capacity in the nas128 among its recommendations the nrc suggested that the jpdo restructure to become more productfocused on solutions for airport ope rations terminal area operations and route and oceanic operations the jpdo has elected to largely ignore this advice and continue along its more broadly define d issuefocused program areas because it believes that the technical challenges facing the development of the ngats are crosscutting in nature and cannot be easily segmented by the operational areas identified by the nrc which are based on the current segmentation of airspace and air traffic operations and do not nece ssarily fit well in the future ngats architecture129 while the jpdos position is seen as reasonable by some in light of the complexity and synergy of the issues facing ngats development the nrc also voiced concerns that the various integrat ed product teams ipts are functioning primarily as experts in specific disciplines rather than as crossfunctional integrated multidisciplinary teams organized to liver specific products that will improve operational capabilities of the air transportation system130 the ability of the jpdo to identify and fully exploit multidisciplinary synergies by bringing together multiple government agencies and aviation stakehol ders under unified umbrella structure is an underlying central issue in assessi ng the jpdos overall effectiveness in developing and executing the ngats enterprise architecture on this issue gaos preliminary analysis of the jpdo was much more favorable than that of the nrc the gao found that jpdo is implementing several bestpractices to foster collaboration among federal agencies but recognized that the jpdo faces ongoing challenges in defining common

funding st ream for carrying out these plans will ultimately come from the budgets of the va rious agencies involved primarily the faa and nasa as planning and coordination entity the jpdo does not have authority over the funding personnel and resources needed to ultimately implement the ngats plan in recognition of this f act congress may examine options to align budget elements of the va rious agencies involved within the ngats framework another potential issue is the appropriate scope of the jpdos efforts the gao noted that jpdos scope is broade r than traditional atc modernization in that it is airport curb to airport curb enco mpassing such issues as security screening and environmental concerns the broad scope could be either benefit or hindrance to the jpdo as it lays out the ngats blueprint while some consideration of various ancillary functions and issues such as security and environmental impacts ma improve the overall system design for the ngats too much emphasis on these issues coul d impede progress on the central issue of improving the efficiency and capacity of the air traffic system during the faa reauthorization the scope of the jpdos tfolio may be an issue of considerable interest besides the scope of the jpdos efforts another issue of interest is the jpdos approach some observers have claime d that the jpdos process has been too driven by issues or areas of interest nd not enough attention has yet been paid to specific goaldirected products and processes132 in general some observers contend that the jpdo has remained too focused on policy and establishing paradigm for collaboration among agencies and stakeholde rs and it has not yet translated these general objectives into c ohesive blueprint with high degree of engineering specification regarding timelines and tingencies among the various component elements of the ngats some have ex pressed concern that what the jpdo has achieved thus far appears to be little more that general conceptual framework for the ngats while this general framework conforms to what most experts believe is the most appropriate appr oach to developing the ngat s the lack of specificity and detail in what has been develope d thus far is concerning to some133 in this view while the jpdo has only been in existence for little more than two years there is pressing need to develop an enterprise arch itecture of sufficient specificity in the near future so that new initiative and pr ograms needed to support the ngats development are adequately reflected in congressional authorization and appropriations legislation and ngats deve lopment can proceed on schedule to meet the 2025 target completion date one possible option for streamlining ngats system development is the use of an ove

task however dot oig initial review of the jpdos progress toward establishing mechanisms to carry out this requirement found th at information on the jpdos progress summarized in its march 2006 progress report to congress lacks sufficient detail to identify how the jpdo expects to leverage research projects and funding at faa and among the other agencies involved in th ngats development to ensure that they are coordinated and avoid duplication of effort the dot oig asserted that without this information it is difficu lt to assess progress with alignment of budgets135 such information is likely to be considered critical to congress for setting both authorization levels and annual appropr iations amounts for ngats related research and acquisition programs therefore congress may consider various options to improve the interagency coor dination of budgetary alignment and improve the transparency of this information for relevant congressional committees one option may be to require specific budget ary alignment reporting for ngatsrelated efforts across the various agencies represen ted in the jpdo under such scheme agencies may be required to provide ma trices or other supporting information indicating how specific programs and pr ojects align with ngats objectives and how these efforts interface with initiatives bein g carried out by othe r agencies involved in the ngats development while many questions still remain regarding the management approach to developing ngats there is growing consensus among experts in the field regarding the technological objectives and likely technologies that will comprise the core functionality of the ngats system these technological objectives and core technologies discussed in various jpdo planning documents including its draft concept of operations136 are described in further detail below because this discussion introduces large number of ne w technical terms and acronyms brief glossary of key terms is provided in

needs in the national airspace system largely through the deployment of new t echnologies the technological objectives of the ngats are designed to allow for gr eater volume of traffic to flow through the system without compromising safety and when feasible improving safety as well as efficiency the core technologies needed to meet these objectives include 1 precision navigation capabilities to pinpoint airc raft locations project flight paths or flight trajectories and predict future aircraft positions with high degree of accuracy and 2 highly integrated information networ ks to enable shared situation awareness regarding traffic weather airport conditi ons and other factors affecting flights and provide tools to facilitate distributed adaptive decisionmaking and information sharing about operational changes such as flight path deviati ons and their potential impacts on other system users the working operational concept for ngat s incorporates variety of new technologies and

to meet these objectives to contrast these proposed technologies nd operational procedur envisioned under ngats to the current national airspace sy stem nas the following discussion provides brief synopsis of opera tions in the presentday nas the presentday airspace system and its technologies t understand the manner in which the ngats plan would transform the existing airspace system basic understanding of th presentday airspace system is needed the presentday national airspace system consists of network of route airways or highways in the sky interconnected by groundbased navigati on facilities that emit directional signals that aircraft track limits on the transmission distances of these signals prevent aircraft from flying direct routes on long distance flights and limit the utilization of airspace to predefined routes where aircraft can reliably transition from one navigational signal to the next in th terminal environment near busy airports and metropolitan areas aircraft follow arrival and departure routes by tracking groundbased navigational signals much like navigation during the route phase of flight or by following the instructions of air traffic contro llers often referred to as receiving radar vectors surveillance and separation of aircraft both route and in terminal airspace is largely provided by an extensive network of radar sites and air traffic controllers who are directly responsible for ensuri ng adequate separa tion between aircraft receiving radar services maintaining this separation is achieved through extensive use of voice communications be tween controllers and pilo ts over open twoway radio frequencies under this system c ontroller workload radio frequency voice communication congestion and the coverage and accuracy of groundbased navigational signals impose practical limita tions on the capacity and throughput of aircraft in the system particularly in busy terminal areas near major airports and around certain chokepoints in the route airway infrastructure where many flight paths converge strict adherence to sta ndardized navigation pr ocedures may reduce controller workload and communications demands and expand capacity to some degree but this too has practical limitations mostly related to the relatively low level of precision available from the current groundbased navigation infrastructure and the relatively imprecise methods currently available for coordinating tracking and monitoring flight plans and intentions experts largely concur that achieving thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33698crs69 138

observers envision that the ngats will consist of revolu tionary systems concepts for air traffic management atm and communication navigation and surveillance cns that rely on satellitebased navigation capabilities technological advances in digital voice and data communications shar ed distributed informati on technology architectures and advanced automation and decisionaiding tools these functional capabilities can be grouped into two br oad operational concepts precision navigation and shared situation awareness and dist ributed adaptive decisionmaking precision navigation one core element of the future airspace system is precision navigation capabilities that can pinpoi nt the location of aircraft with much greater precision than existing groundbase d navigational aids and provide for much greater accuracy and reduced uncertainty regarding aircraft flight plans and trajectories the faas approach to defining the navigational requirements of the future airspace system has been to set forth policy defining performancebased requirements specifying certain level of navigational accuracy required to participate in certain types of flight operations rather than identifying specific technologies or naviga tional equipment standa rds or requirements138 while these performance requirements are just being established they are likely to form framework for minimum requirements to operate to and from the nations busiest airports and terminal areas and in higha ltitude airspace while the faas objective is to define performance requirements in operational terms rather than tying them to any specific technology or tec hnical capability it is widely agreed that at least in the near term satellitebased navigation re lying on systems such as the global positioning system gps will likely become the primary means for navigation under the ngats concept satellitebased navigation since it is widely held that the gps will initially serve as primary means for navi gating in the future airspace system many experts regard the evolution to the ngats with regard to navigation systems to involve shift away from groundbased na vigation transmitter stations to primary reliance on satellite systems such as gps gps consists of constellation of satellites that transmit preci timing signals used to compute highly accurate position and time information gps is already used for wide variety of applications including aviation navigation while russia maintains smaller less capable satellite navigation system called glonass short for the global navigation

established policy of setting performancebased criteria for navigation systems that may in the future be met by other satellitebased systems besides gps or novel na vigation technologies that have not even been conceptualized yet nonetheless the federal government has invested heavily in gps and it is generally viewed as the primary means for precision navigation for the foreseeable future the military has committed to fully deploying the next generation of gps satellites to further improve the systems accuracy and reliability recognizing the growing performance requirements for high precision navigation capabilities among aviation system users the faa has also invested heavily on an auxiliary system to augment gps signals known as the wide area augmentation system or waas the faa has spent nearly 3 billion over the past 10 years to achieve initial operating capability of waas which is comprised of 25 gr oundbased reference sites two master stations and two geostationary satellites139 waas improves the accuracy of gps position information usin g its array of groundbased reference stations to monitor gps satellite signals and apply corrections to compensate for signal errors such as errors due to nor mal atmospheric variations these signal compensations computed by the array of ground based receiver stations are continuously beamed to two geostationary satellites that in turn transmit these corrections to any waasenabled gps unit including aircraft with waasenabled gps navigation systems waasenabled avionics improve position accuracy from about 20 meters to within 15 to 2 ters both horizontally and vertically140 factoring in margin of safety the faa certifies waasenabled gps avionics to provide guaranteed accuracy of 50 meters vertically and 40 meters horizontally141 the waas system began initial operati ons in july 2003 in march 2006 the faa began approving instrument approaches to airports for aircraft with certified waasenabled gps avionics

approach procedures the faa has also been looking to devel op more precise local area augmentation system laas that may enable precision landings using satellitebased navigation during very low visibility operations at selected airports while waas is operationally available and the faa has expressed its commitment to the waas program there are still questions regarding the future of laas issues regarding laas include whether the improvement in navigational accuracy of current laas systems over waas is enough to justify th eir cost and whether the relatively small user base for highly

standard that defines the required position accuracy needed to keep the aircraft within speci fied containment area or bubble 999 of the time the required navigational performance is not tied to any specific technology but sets technical standard that can be met usin g various faaapproved equipment while precision satellitebased navigation is curren tly the principal technology for meeting rnp standards these standards allow for the use of other technologies including yet to be developed technologies to meet navigational pe rformance standards rnav is also navigational performance standard for aircraft that provides specific capability to establish very accura waypoints or specific navigational reference points that can be positioned anywhere in the airspace system thus eliminating the need to define airways and terminal arrival and departure procedures in references to specific groundbased navi gational stations the rnav concept has been around since the 1970s and has histor ically relied on ground based navigational stations and distance measur ing equipment dme to navigate using more direct routing at present the primary aircra ft technology being utilized to meet these performance requirements is waasenabled gps with dme considered by many to be viable backup or secondary m eans to determine aircraft position and accurately follow precise flight routes in cases of equipment outages or disruption of satellitebased navigational services over the next five to ten years the faa anticipates issuing mandates for rnp at the busiest airports and in high altit ude airspace in the 2016 to 2025 time frame system wide mandates for performancebased navigation capabilities are expected to meet anticipated interoperability re quirements for the ngats and to respond to gradual phaseout of the current ground based navigational in frastructure while the specific levels of navigation performan ce for various segments of airspace and operations are yet to be determined it is likely that relatively precise means of navigation will be required for users of high altitude airspace and busy route corridors and when operating to and from rge commercial airpor ts and busy general aviation airports in highly congested terminal areas sometimes referred to as super density airports and superdensity operations while meeting precision navigation performance

is also constrained by large air traffic separation requirements that are considered necessa ry in the current operating environment based on current technology capabilities and controller workload considerations the working concept for the ngats envisions system in which air traffic surveillance and separation of aircraft will become more of shared res ponsibility between air navigation service provider personne l such as air traffic controllers and air traffic managers and pl anners and system users143 key technological objective needed to support this concept is to estab lish data network that provides scalable shared information data repository for sy stem users and service providers referred to as shared situational awareness servi ces elements of the shared situation awareness data repository would likely incl ude elements such as dynamic weather information air traffic surveillance flight plans and flight trajectories air traffic control clearances and aeronautical info rmation such as airport and airspace conditions and restrictions service providers and users would be able to tap into these data repositories at scalable levels of detail for example pilots might receive information such as weather traffi c and airport and airspace conditions pertinent to their own aircrafts flight while an air traffic controller might receive information and analysis of data pertinent to specific sector of airspace and an air traffic manager or system planner might receive data on more global scale that might provide information and analysis of traffic flows weather conditions and other factors that may impact system flow across an entire day of operations one key element of achieving such capability is reliable airground data network that can provide system data to airborne aircraft and receive critical information such as precision navigation positioning and trajectories from these aircraft the primary candidate system to fill such role is system called adsb which stands for automatic dependent surveillance broadcast automatic dependent surveillance broadcast adsb adsb is technology that is just being introduced to aviation system users but is expected by many to become the backbone of future aircraft surve illance cap abilities perhaps replacing radar facilitie s across much of the country adsb relies on gps or other precision navigation signals to pinpoint ai rcraft position and works by automatically broadcasting that position information along with unique aircraft identifier and other information such as the aircraft speed and whether it is turning climbinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33698crs73 144 adsb out capability refers to basic level of adsb functionality that only broadcasts outbound transmissions of aircraft position tracking and identification information adsb in refers to an enhanced adsb capability that involves receiving air traffic data from either other aircraft ground stations or some combination of these two sources

conform to universal access transceiver uat equipment standards145 the faa regards adsb as the backbone of the ngats and in 2006 expressed high level support for moving forward with plans to expand adsb availability and usage and u ltimately to transition to system that uses adsb instead of radar as the primary means for air traffic surveillance146 the benefits of adsb include the potential largescale cost savings of replacing multimilliondollar radar system s with groundbased transceivers that cost less than 200000 to purchase more accurate trackin g than radar which may allow reduced aircraft spacing and anticipated safety improvements by providing pilots and controllers with shared situation awareness allowing them to see the same realtime displays of air traffic by establis hing datalink communi cation platform adsb also provides means to recei ve weather and flight info rmation such as temporary flight restrictions that can be graphica lly presented on cockpit displays these datalink services also may greatly improve pilot situation awareness by providing accurate realtime weather information and cr itical flight information in the cockpit virtually all aviation system users suppor t the transition to adsb surveillance with the general caveat that costs imposed on system users be carefully controlled the ata asserts that while the technolog is promising its ultimate feasibility should be determined through detailed assessments of all costs and benefits to both system users and the faa the aopa representing mostly small general aviation aircraft owners and operators has stressed that the costs to these users be kept as low as possible the aopa has proposed that the present cost of transponder equipment the avionics needed to interface to the current radar surveillance capabilities of the nas be used as benchmark or target price point for the minimum equipment requirements to operate in future ai rspace system based on adsb surveillance147 aopa

networks to develop robust systems architecture for swim phasing out legacy systems as the faa and the jpdo move forw ard with implementing the ngats and associated technologies challenging and potentially contentious issue is the phasing out of existing facilities and equipment for air traffic communications navigation and surveillance phasing out of existing systems must be addressed carefully because on the one hand maintaining legacy systems while deploying new technologies can be costly and resource inte nsive on the other hand phasing these systems out too quickly could place an undue burden on system users to equip aircraft and could pose safety concerns if adequate backups and redundancies are not in place with regard to navigation infrastructure the shift to satellitebased navigation will likely result in significant reducti ons in groundbased na vigational facilities which will ultimately translate into cost savings to the faa by greatly reducing maintenance and sustainment costs for th facilities to accommodate users as they slowly transition to satellitebased navigation these phaseouts will likely be gradual but nonetheless significan t over the next fifteen years nondirectional beacons ndbs used primarily for nonprecision approaches to smaller airports and as additiona l position references for some precision approaches and route navigation are ready being phased out and will mostly be fully decommissioned over the next ten years current plans also call for the gradua l phasedown of gr oundbased veryhigh frequency omnirange vor tr ansmitter sites the backbone of the current federal airway system starting in 2010 the trans ition plan calls for an initial reduction of about 30 of the vors in the united st ates by 2012 with further reduction to about half of the current number by 2020 to maintain minimu m operating network to support airspace users that are not equippe d with gps and to provide an interim backup capability for those users that are gps equipped while vor sites will likely be phased down from current levels distance measuring equipment dme transmitters are viewed as potentially vi able navigational backup to gps giving aircraft less precise rnav cap ability in the event of disruption to gps signals such disruption could occur for variet of reasons from equipment malfunctions to intentional jamming therefore dme sites may fill an impor tant backup role in the ngats although final terminations regarding backup requirements and how they will be met have not yet been finalized plans also call for gradual phasedown of standard category i instrument landing system ils systems and appro aches for airport runways starting in 2015 advanced ils equipment that provide wer landing minimums for operations in very poor visibility category ii and category iii ils systems are not planned to be phased out however these approaches requi re special avionics and special flighthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33698crs76 crew qualifications these facilities will continue to serve relatively small user community that require these services mostly consisting of large commercial aircraft operators the faa is continuing to eval uate whether laas can provide navigation performance and reliability equivalent to these advanced ils systems besides navigational facilities the decommissioning of radar facilities especially longrange radar may become future option if adsb is to be used as the primary means for aircraft surveillance in the ngats however one significant weakness of adsb in comparison to radar is that it is completely dependent on aircraftbased systems to transmit position da ta to ground stations and other aircraft equipment or power failures on the aircra ft could make an aircraft completely invisible to other airc raft and to air traffic controllers by contrast radars would at least give controllers the ability to see the aircrafts primary target generated by radar reflections off of an aircrafts skin loss of this capability without some backup means to identify aircraft could have implications for safety as well as for airspace security one option being discussed is to keep terminal radars in place around busy airports as backup for safety reasons and maintain radar covera ge near major cities and other potential terrorist targets for airs pace security purposes under such plan many longrange radar sites that provide coverage on route traffic may be decommissioned for airliners and large aircraft that already have sufficient system redundancies and backup power capabilities reliance on adsb alone will likely provide an equivalent level of safety to the curre nt route radar environment however for small aircraft that typica lly dont have redundant systems and backup power maintaining an equiva lent level of safety may be more challenging congress may express partic ular interest in the faas efforts to assess how proposals envisioning adsb as the primary means of aircraft surveillance will address the issue of providing equivalent safety to the cu rrent radarbased air traffic surveillance system congressional interest regarding the phaseout of legacy systems may also focus on how these plans may impact airspace system users particularly smaller operators who may face greater challenge in

large transport aircraft currently imposes practical limitations on aircraft spacing even under ideal weather conditions while most casual observers think of wa ke turbulence as primarily an issue

limitations on various approaches such as reducing aircraft arrival and departure spacing nd increasing the utilization of closely spaced parallel runways current air traffic procedures specify paration standards for aircraft departing behind large and heavy jets to allow their wa ke vortices to dissipate some view these standards as overly conservative and argu that accurate wake vortex prediction capabilities could allow for decreased sepa ration thereby increasing airport capacity in many weather conditions others argue that the limited capability of available technology and the complexities of wake vortex propagation make it difficult to predict wake turbulence or to use such predictions to significantly reduce arrival and departure spacing without compromising safety wake turbulence separation standards have been the focus of considerable attention recently as the faa and international regulators mull the appropriate following distance behind the airbus a380 superjumbo aircraft currently in velopment the international civil aviation organization icao has set an interim following distance behind the a380 of 10nautical miles double that of current heavy jets currently

rate of less than one in every 88 million flight hours157 nonetheless aviation safety experts are to some degree at odds over whether the current level of commercial airline safety can be further improved upon ex perts also have differing views on whether the current low rate of accident occurrence may obscure the potential future effects of va riety of underlying safety tre nds such as

operational consid erations to prevent ground co llisions and runway overruns looking beyond commercial passenger operations th safety of allcargo operations and other commercial aviation activities has been examined to determine whether targeted safety enhancements can imp rove the safety record of these sectors of the aviation industry for example some have argued that bringing the safety

an emas arrester bed can still be installed to help slow or stop an aircraft that overruns the runway even if less th an 600 feet of land is available163 emas is particularly appealing option because othe r overrun mitigation techniques used by the military such as arresting cables and nets are not readily adaptable to the civil aviation environment other options to slow aircraft such as frangible

incorporating the use of this safety margin into their standard operating procedures which must then be approved by the faa the ntsb had also mulled the idea of eliminatin g the assumption that thrust

ssible scenarios involving less than full deceleration capability and is supported by the airline indus try it has been criticized by charter operators because it seems too arbitrary and could significantly restrict flight operations at certain air ports particularly in wi nter weather conditions165 another option to mitigate overrun accidents is to develop and deploy effective means for airports to mainta in adequate runway brakin g action under various adverse weather conditions research on techniques to effectively remove contaminants like snow slush ice and water from runways nd improve runway friction coefficients particularly in winter conditions is still ongoing but could yield advances in contamination removal nd improving runway friction under variety of environmental conditions166 while these programs have historically been funded out of nasas aeronautics research program congress may opt to review this research to assess its progress and determine whether any advan ces can be transitioned to the faa for operational deployment preventing runway incursions and collisions since 1990 there have been four runw ay collisions in the united states involving large

collisions on its list of most wanted transportation safety improvements since the list was first released in 1990 to get better grasp on the existing risks of runway incursions the faa has been closely tracking and studying errors that could have led to runway collisions since 1999 whenever an aircraft or gr ound vehicle strays onto runway when an aircraft is taking off or landing there is potential for collision these errors whether caused by pilots air traffic cont rollers or ground vehicle operators are referred to as runway incursions curtailing runway incursions has been priority for the faa however statistics indicate that the overall runway incursion rate has remained relatively constant slightly above level of five incursions per million flight operations since 1999 data do however suggest that the severity of these incursions has decreased somewhat in r ecent years from 08 serious incursions per million flight operations in fy2001 to 06 serious incursions per million flight operations in fy2004 neverthe less high profile events involving aircraft coming within few hundred feet of each other tinue to occur and raise concerns over the potential for large scale disaster for example two highprofile incidents at chicagos ohare airport in march 2006 ra ised questions about controller training and experience controller fatigue and the effectiveness of currently available runway safety technology167 the ntsb concluded that the airport movement area safety system amass technology currently being deployed at large airport control towers as faas primary tool for reducing the severity of runway incursi on incidents fails to provide an acceptable solution to reduce the risk of runway collisions because it does not provide direct warning capability to flight crews the ntsb has consequently classified its recommendation for preventing runway collisions and incursions as having an unacceptable re sponse from the faa in 2001 the ntsb evaluated amass and determined that it was not capable of providing sufficient warning to prevent runway collisions in all instances and as currently imp lemented provides capability to issue warnings directly to pilots and other vehicle operators168 i n essence the amass system inserts controllers into the decision cycle thereby increasing the time needed for pilots to take evasive action to prevent collision providing traffic information and alerting directly to pilots as opposed to only alerting controllers is viewed as preferable in this regard but this is not what the ntsbs original recommendation sought rather the ntsb specifically asked the faa to develop system analogous to co ckpit traffic collision avoidance systems tcas to alert controllers to pending runway incursions169 however tcas

recommende d changes in operational procedures at airports the ntsbs recommendations urged the faa to install ground movement safety systems at all airports with passeng er service that provide direct warning capability to pilots and demonstrate through comput er simulations or other means that the system will in fact prevent r unway incursions the recommendations also included numerous suggested changes to opera tional procedures to increase pilot and controller situation awareness and resolve ambiguities regarding runway crossing clearances eliminate the practice of positioning an aircraft on runway to await takeoff at night and in poor weather modify phraseology of airport movement instructions to be consistent with international standards and provide controllers with guidance on appropriate phraseology and speaking rates especially when communicating with foreign flight crews170 the faa continues to addr ess many of these procedural changes to enhance runway safety however the ntsb has expressed continued frustration with the faas progress the ntsb questioned the completeness of the faas runway incursion incident reporting and cast doubt on faas claims that the incursion rate is declining171 most observers agree that there is single solution to mitigating runway incursions and continued inve stment in airport design procedural modifications pilot and controller training and technology is needed to reduce the risk of runway accidents in addition to amass the faa has viewed the airport surveillance detection equipment model x or asdex as pr imary means to provide controllers with situation awareness of airport surface m ovements the gao found that costs for equipping airports with asdex have escalated by 859 million since the programs

carryin g 230 passengers that exploded and broke apart inflight while departing new yorks john f kennedy intern ational airport for paris france the ntsb attributed the crash to an explosion in the center wing fuel tank that resulted from the ignition of fuel vapors while the specific ignition source was never determined it was attributed to an electrical failure that likely produced arcing in wiring that introduced electrical energy into the tank184 since the tragic crash of twa flight 800 two fuel tank explosions both while aircraft were on the ground have been documented these include the march 3 2001 destruction of thai airways boei ng 737 in bangkok thailand and the may 4 2006 explosion on transmile airlines boeing 727 in bangalore india these events demonstrate that the risk of fuel tank explosions still exists and is not unique to the design of the boeing 747 fuel system the ntsb and other aviation safety advo cates have been befuddled by the slow progress to address the risks of fuel tank ex plosions over the past ten years options for using less volatile aviation fuels such as jp5185 which is sometimes used by the military or antistatic additives were discussed but were never considered to be fully adequate and viable solutions also the faa and the aviation industry largely rejected the use of available fuel inerting foam technology that has been used by the military since the late 1960s186 the foam which is placed inside aircraft fuel tanks greatly reduces the risk of explosions nd postcrash fires but would be costly to install adds weight to aircraft and reduces the distance an airplane can travel by reducing the amount of fuel that can be carried the ntsb and other safety advocates so have expressed disappointment that the faa and the airline industry did not take adequate steps to make interim changes to operational practices to reduce fuel tank flammability until longterm solutions could be identified and put in place the ntsb believes that relatively simple steps such as filling tanks to levels that sufficiently reduce the flammability of the fuelair mixture and minimizing the use of heatgenerating equipment such as cabin airconditioning systems before flight would effectively mitigate risk until proven technologies to reduce fuel tank fl ammability were iden tified and deployed the faa never mandated that these steps be taken and an faa survey of the airline industry found that recommended changes to operating procedures which were only advisory in nature were never widely adopted

oxygen from the air in fuel tanks replacing it with nitrogenrich mixture that greatly reduces flammability in may 2002 the faa announ ced an innovative prototype inerting system187 this system unlike earlier versions used by the military weighs significantly less uses moving parts is more reliable and could be retrofitted into airplanes currently in service at fraction of the industryestimated cost188 boeing is now shipping new aircraft from its factories with these systems already installed the issue of retrofitting the existing fleet with these systems or other alternative solutions to reduce flammability such as inerting foam and establishing fuel tank flammability reduction requirement for new airplanes has not yet been fully resolved but the faa is proposing an appro ach that would require passenger airlines to take such steps to reduce fuel tank flammability in their aircraft fleets over the next eight years specifically on november 23 2005 the faa issued proposed rulemaking to require that operators of large transport cat egory airplanes used in passenger airline service take steps to reduce fuel tank flammability such as installing fuel inerting systems the proposed rule however does not require fuel tank flammability reduction for wing tanks as it only establishe s requirements for an aircrafts main fuel tank and would exempt allcargo aircraft also contrary to some commonly held misconceptions about the proposed rulema king it does not specifically require the fuel tank inerting systems discussed above fo r all passenger airliners but leaves the door open for alternative means of complia nce the proposal actually seeks to set flammability exposure criterion how this criterion would be met may become particular point of contention over the cer tification of both new aircraft types and retrofit modifications of the existing air carrier fleet to meet the requirements set forth in the proposed rulemaking airbus for example would like its doubledecker a380 to be certified without fuel tank inerting systems arguing that design considerations for the center fuel tank alr eady take into consid eration and adequately mitigate the risk of explosive fuelair mixtures189 under the faas proposed timetable depending on fleet composition 50 of an air carriers fleet woul d have to be in complian ce in the 2009 to 2011 time frame and airlines would have to achieve 100 compliance between 2012 and 2014 the faa estimates that it will cost passenger airlines about 809 million 2005 dollars to comply with the proposed fuel tank fla mmability reduction measures over the next 50 years based on faa assumptions of ex plosion risk that conclude that four explosions would be prevented over the next 50 years if the proposed action is taken the estimated benefit of the rulemaking over this time period was calculated to be 490 million in 2005 dollars assuming the cost of one human life is 3 million if the assumed cost of human life is rais ed to 55 million then the estimated benefitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33698crs90 190 national transportation safety board ntsb marks 10th anniversary 191 ibidover the next 50 years climb to 890 million in 2005 dollars the faa notes that while these benefits assume four explosions over the next 50 years they calculated 37 chance that five or more accident s could occur during that period and noted that the estimated benefit c ould be much higher if the prevented accidents were assumed to have involved large jets like boeing 747 or airbus a380 aircraft carrying large numbers of passengers based on these considerations the faa c oncluded that the costs of the proposed action were justified but some observers may question this conclusion because slight alternations in assumptions can tip the benefit to cost ratio in either direction one particular assumption that the faa attempted to account for is how effective special regulations put in place in 2001 will be in terms of id entifying potential ignition sources and mitigating the risks they pose in the baseline case cited above the faa assumed that these steps would be 50 ffective in reducing ignition sources the faa presented several other cases vary ing their assumptions with about half showing benefit to cost ratios greater than one and about half s howing benefit to cost ratios less than one the faa also noted that because the flying public may assume terrorist act has occurred fo llowing an aircraft explosi on this could have sizable impact on airline revenues if people subse quently avoid flying the faa thought that this could cost airlines 5 billion per accident while this wasnt considered in the formal costbenefit analysis some argue this possibility alone could sufficiently justify requirement for fu tank flammability reduction in the end the faa asserted that the benefits justify the compliance cost however aircraft manufacturers and airlines may challenge this conclusion and assert that if ongoing efforts to remove ignition sources are effective costly retrofits to inert fuel tanks may not be fully justified by the expected benefits however because of the considerable attention gi ven to this issue stemming from the twa 800 crash there may be consider able pressure to do all that is feasible to reduce both ignition sources and fuel tank flammability the ntsb points out that dealing just with ignition sources was not sufficient to ensure safe flight and that fuel tank flammability must be addressed190 while the ntsb supports the proposed rulemaking as positive step toward reducing the risk of fuel tank explosions it has been frustrated by the slow rulemaking process and notes that while implementation of an effective mitigation technology is now on the horizon airliner fuel tanks are as flammable today as they were ten years ago191 during the faa reauthorization process congress may examine in detail the faas approach to reducing fuel tank flammability among transport category aircraft and its justification for proposing that these actions be required for passenger airlines particular concerns may be raised about the sufficiency of the scope of aircraft covered under the faa proposal given that it exempts allcargo aircraft and doesnt mitigate fuel tank flammability in wing tanks congress may also debate whether the faa timeline for compliance is appropriate given the significance of the risk to aviation safety posed by fuel tank explosi ons and the financial burden to the industry to comply httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33698crs91 192 see 49 usc 44717addressing aging aircraft issues agerelated aircraft struct ural fatigue which can cause structural failures and aging wiring which can cause inflight fires remain significant concerns for all sectors of the aviation industry allcargo aircraft are particular concern because statistics indicate that while the average age for passenger airliners in the united states is under 10 years the average age of jet freighters is more than 20 years general aviation aircraft may also be at particular risk because the average age of the fleet is already 35 years and it is expected to increase to 50 years by 2020 however general aviation advocates are resisting proposals to require continuing inspections of aging aircraft and aircraft systems citing concerns over operational costs that could escalate considerably if owners and operators are faced with requirements for periodic deta iled examinations of aircraft systems and structures aging aircraft used in commuter and charter service may also be safety risk because the faas regulatory framework to comply with aging aircraft requirements does not include aircraft with fewer than 30 seats or those not used in scheduled air carrier service aging airliners in 1991 congress passed the ag ing aircraft safety act of 1991 as part of the dot appropriations act for fy1992 pl 102143 establishing an aging aircraft inspections program to study agerelated structural issues in the air carrier fleet through process of inspections and systematic record keeping192 action was prompted by several agerelate d incidents and accidents including the highprofile structural separation of rge section of fuselage above the passenger cabin aboard an aloha airlines boeing 737 airplane in 1988 in immediate response to this accident congress passed the av iation safety research act of 1988 pl 100591 mandating research on the effects of fatigue and environmental degradation of aircraft structures and approaches to mitigating associated safety risks subsequent research pointed to need for proactive approach to inspecting aging aircraft under the aging aircraft inspecti on program the faa has stepped up requirements for maintenance inspections to check for small fatigue cracks which can propagate causing component and major structural failures of the airframe and preventative measures to slow corrosi on on aircraft stru ctural components maintenance experience over these years has demonstrated that tiny fatigue cracks and areas of corrosion are often quite insidious lurking in hard to access locations and often are not visible to the naked eye ultrasound inspection techniques have played an important role in identifying fatigue cracks during periodic inspections allowing airlines to take corrective actions before these fatigue cracks propagate however these inspection methods can be costly and time consuming so inspections are usually targeted based on risk assessments considering what structures are most prone to fatigue and are st ructurally most critical there has been growing concern that widespread fatigue damage may impose practical limitations on the continued airwor thiness of airframes on

compone nts are life limited based on numbers of cycles but to date the airframe itself can continue in service indefinitely so long as it is kept in an airworthy condition by following all faa and manufacturer requirements regarding insp ections maintenance and repair the faa proposal would change this by setting maximum num ber of cycles for airframes after which an aircraft must be retired unless an operator demonstrates that it able to extend this service life through detailed inspections and maintenance program in which case service life extension may be granted while most passenger airlines in the united states divest of their airplanes long before what most consider commercially viable service life of about 25 years they might nonetheless experience sizable financial burden from this proposed action because aircraft would likely depreciate much faster if they have limited service lif imposed through regulation therefore aircraft leasing would likely cost more and those aircraft that airlines purchase outright would likely be worth less on the used aircraft market when they go to sell and replace them cargo operators also could be impacted financially because they tend to utilize older aircraft and therefore may have to increase their fleet replacement rates under the proposal however the costs to operators that currently operate fleets consisting of mostly older aircraft may in particular be offset to some degree if transitioning to younger fleet of aircraft as consequence of the proposed rule results in lower maintenance costs aging commuter aircraft the faas proposal would only cover aircraft weighing more than 75000 pounds at maximu m takeoff weight potentially raising questions of whether similar rules should be considered for smalle r aircraft such as the commuter seaplane involved in the d ecember 2005 crash off the coast of miami fl the december 19 2005 crash of turboprop powered grumman mallard seaplane departing miami for bimini island in the bahamas drew attention to the potential catastrophic effects of structural fatigue on aging aircraft being used by smaller specialty airlines and charter operators while the ntsbs investigation of that accident which killed all 20 on board is still ongoing investigators have identified fatigue cracks near the location where failure and separation of the right wing surface is suspected to have occurre d shortly after takeoff these smaller operators may be particular concern because they dont have as extensive capabilities to inspect aircraft for fatig ue and corrosion and dont typically come under as much scrutiny and oversight from the faa compared to major airlines this stems in part from an faa regulatory change issued in february 2005 limiting the scope of supplemental inspection require ments for aging aircraft to only those aircraft manufactured after 1957 that have 30 or more pa ssenger seats or payload capacity of more than 7500 pounds the ntsb in the course of its ongoing investigation of the miami crash noted th is exemption of smaller aircraft as particular safety concern and issued recommendation calling for the broadening of aging aircraft inspection

according to the faa the average aircraft age acr oss the ga fleet is about 35 years and this is expected to increase to almost 50 years by 2020195 several ga accidents have been attributed to aging ai rcraft structures and component failures the faa has also uncovered many trends in agerelated effects among specific ga aircraft models presently ga aircraft are specifically excluded from the aging aircraft program the aopa has resisted specific aging aircraft inspection programs across the ga fleet fearing that mandated program would impose significant costs on operators the aopa argues that such requirement is unnecessary without specific data that agerelated corrosion or component failures affect particular model of aircraft the aopa points to 39 reduction in maintenancerelated ga crashes over the past 20 years despite steady increase in the average age of the fleet over that same time frame196 they advocate continuati on of the current approach which largely relies on indivi dual operators to adopt reco mmended best practices for maintaining and inspecting their aircraft to minimize and correct agerelated effects the faa is studying the issue of whether more proactive approach may be needed to identify and correct specific agerelated effects across the ga fleet before they lead to catastrophic failures and accidents duri ng the debate over faa reauthorization congress may consider whether more form approach to assessing agerelated effects among ga aircraft is needed and may discuss various options regarding the depth and scope of specific inspection progra ms to assess the effects of aging on the ga aircraft fleet advocat for ga operators such as the aopa are most concerned about the possibility that aircraft life limits such as those being considered for large transport aircraft might be considered for some or all of the ga fleet they point to the unique challenges of owners and operators of vintage airplanes whose manufacturers are often long since defunct as particular area where flexible approach is needed to insure that aviation heritage can be maintained in manner that is not overly burdensome or overly costly to operators197 during

general air cargo pilots operate in an environment in which they are permitted to work longer hours than commerc ial airline pilots and often do so during latenight and earlymorning periods wher humans are particularly susceptible to fatigue effects also in air cargo opera tions pilots have more direct responsibility for assessing weather airport conditions pr oper aircraft loading and other safety critical aspects of flight in the case of small operators the pilots are very much on their own with regard to safetycritical decision making not unlike charter operators covered under the same set of rules however cargo pilots on more routine basis operate in demanding environments where pressures to complete flights to maintain delivery schedules compete with safety cons iderations regarding weather and airport conditions and cargo pilots more frequently fly in night conditions additionally because airports are regulated largely based on the size of scheduled passenger aircraft

more detailed safety assessments of shipments containing lithium batteries is needed several air carrier accidents have been traced to improper loading including overloading aircraft improperl distributing loads and inadequately securing freight resulting in weight shifts during flight mishandling of cargo can also cause damage to aircraft that if undetected or unre ported can lead to future incidents and accidents211 while the ntsb called for improved flight crew oversight of loading procedures following the 1997 crash of fine air dc8 in miami pilots report that they often are not able to observe the loading process and lack of uniformity in forms and procedures among loading contractors and facilities makes it difficult to ensure that the job has been done right212 several options exist for improving the safety of cargo handling alpa believes that incor porating the industrys best practices into universal sta ndard operating procedures for cargo loading is needed213 alpa also believes that bette r training supervision and oversight of cargo handlers and establishing certificati on requirements for loadmast ers would improve safety also the ntsb has recommended

that while highefficiency particulate air hepa filters are widely used by airlines on larger aircraft and their use is recommended for recirculated air systems by air quality experts they are not

raise significant privacy issues cell phones and portable electronic devices recently there has been considerable interest in approving cell phone use aboard aircraft however studies by the british civil aviation authority caa demonstrated interference to various avionics equipment from signals similar to cell phone transmitting at maximum power219 possible compromise is to ensure that cell phones trans mit only at low transmission powers the pico cell concept which consists of small cellphone interface installed on the aircraft that forces active cell phones to transmit at low power attempts to utilize such an approach however there is still lingering concern that the power outputs of multiple cell phone devices in aircraft could be additive potentially resulting in signals that could interfere with critical aircraft systems there is also concern that systems like the pico cell concept dont have enough safeguards to prevent transmissions that exceed acceptable output levels other portable electronic vices peds like laptops portable media players personal digital assistants pdas and handheld electronic games have historically posed less of concern because they are primarily nonintentiona l emitters of radio frequency rf energy and their rf emissions are of comparably low power however new breed of intentional transmitters imbedded in these kinds of devices that use wifi and bluetooth wi reless connection prot ocols represent relatively new form of technology that is rapidly proliferating in peds there is considerable interest in using rf emitting devices relying on wifi protocols in particular as means for providing broadband internet access to air travelers researchers from carnegie mellon university recently completed study looking at emissions from peds on board commercial passenger aircraft they found that in violation of current faa and fcc regulations cell phone calls are regularly made from commercial aircraft220 while the researchers noted that spurious emissions from variety of peds are potential safety concern they focused their attention on emissions fro m cell phones and their impact on frequency bands used by aircraft navigation systems they concluded that the most serious concern for interference from cell phones is for gps receivers which will become the primary means for aerial naviga tion over the next several years httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33698crs100 221 these aircraft technologies are discussed in greater detail in the section on technological objectives and core technologies of the ne xt generation air

devices may be used above 10000 feet however in terms of regulatory standards the faa ultimately leaves it up to the individual air carriers to determine which peds are safe for use aboard their specific aircraft in practice besides the specific ban on cell phones most commonly used consum er peds are permissible the rapid proliferation of these vari ous wireless technologies has far outpaced the ability to conduct thorough research nd testing to determine their potential to interfere with aircraft communications navigation and surv eillance equipment protection of avionics from interference is likely to become increasingly important in the future as these functions become more fundamentally integrated in technologies such as adsb gps and coc kpit multifunction displays of navigation traffic and weather information221 in approaching this issue safety concerns may conflict with airline consumer demand for inflight access to wireless voice communications and internet connectivity congress may consider options to more fully assess the safety implications of rf emitting devices on aircraft and available means for protecting aircraft systems from rf interference options may include extensive study of the issue by an i ndependent agency such as the national academies and the implementation of more clearly defined safety standards and safety monitoring capabilities for assessing rf interference and for reporting and monitoring suspected rf interfe rence with aircraft systems besides concerns over rf interference lithium batteries in carryon portable electronic devices also pose potential fire hazard222 however because fires in accessible areas of the cabin are more likely to be quickly detected these types of fires may pose less of threat of causing catastrophic loss of the aircraft than fire that propagates in an unaccessible baggage or cargo hold nevertheless any fire during flight poses significant threat to cabin occupants from both heat and smoke and could potentially be catastrophic if not ndled effectively by the flight and cabin crew from policy perspective genera l prohibitions against carrying peds using lithium batteries on aircraft are seen as unpopular options because the use of lithium batteries in such devices is so commonplace during the course of reauthorization congress may consider whether the faa needs to work more closely with the consumer product safety commission the national institute of standards and technology nist and other government tities to ensure that risks to aircraft safety posed by

cost of purchas ing seat for young child would prompt many families to drive instead of fly which arguably poses greater risk of death or serious injury to all family members the ntsb on the contrary believes that all aircraft occupants should be restrain ed during takeoff landing and in turbulence and that infants and small children s hould be restrained using restraint system tailored to their height and weight also the ntsb questions the validity of the argument that diversion to highway travel is valid justification for not mandating the use of child restraints for occupants under two years old223 the airlines view the potential of diversion to highway travel as signifi cant threat to the industry and note that increased security measures following the 911 terrorist attacks have already diverted large numbers of potential customers to travel by highway instead the airlines believe that the revenue loss due to diversions would fa r outweigh any revenue gains realized by requiring occupants under two years to be ticketed instead of imposing mandatory regulatory requirements for child restraints the faa encourages voluntary compliance with its stated recommendation that strongly urges travelers to secure children in an appropriate restrain t based on weight and size and recently issued public education ma terials to promote th safe practices224 the faa also announced in september 2006 its approval of ne w lightweight child safety restraint designed so lely for use in aircraft225 congress has largely remained silent on this issue allowing the faa to pursue regulatory options and promoting voluntary compliance as it sees fit however in consideration of the continuing disagreem ent between the ntsb and the faa on this issue options for improving the safety of child occupants of airliner cabins may be debated in the current reaut horization process besides regulatory mandates options to increase the use of child restraints on aircraft may include improved public education and awareness of the safety risks to unrestrained occupants including infants and toddlers and incentives to air lines that develop innovative approaches to increase the use of child restraints for passengers under the age of two energy and environmental considerations recent uncertainty over petroleum s upply and growing policy interest in identifying alternative fuel sources may generate interest in this issue during debate over faa reauthorization although energy issues have not been major focus of past faa reauthorization processes provision allowing the

larger role in this reauthorization process in response to growing international pressures to set standards and goals for reducing aircraft emissions key policy issue centers on whether current industry demand for more fuel efficient aircraft will result in adequate emissions reductions over time or whether more proactive policies to curtail ai rcraft emissions are needed debate over aircraft noise policy may focus on whether emerging quiet airc raft technologies can yield substantive noise reductions whethe r adequate noise vel reductions can be attained through industry mand for more efficient airc raft designs or whether stricter aircraft noise st andards may be needed and whether existing community noise standards and noise policies are sufficient to mitigate noise impacts considering forecast growth in air traffic and possible community growth in noise impacted areas alternative fuels for aircraft recently oil and refined petroleum prices have been relatively high as result airlines and other users of aviation fuels are increasingly interested in ways to decrease fuel consumption which would have the effect of reducing air emissions to lesser extent most of this attention has focused on increasing the fuelefficiency of jet aircraft but plane manufacturers fu suppliers and others have also turned their attention to alternatives to petroleum fuels roughly 99 of civilian aviation fuel used in the united states is jet fuel226 and most efforts have focused on jet fuel alternatives jet fuel is similar in composition to kerosene or diesel fuel so diesel fuel substitutes are of particular interest synthetic diesel fuel can be produced from various processes including the conversion of natural gas to liquid fuel oft referred to as gas toliquids or gtl and the conversion of biological oils into biodiesel coalderiv ed fuels can also be produced using processes similar to gtl these fuels could potentially be used as blending components to extend conventional jet fuel stocks or as direct substitutes for conventional fuel however there are some key cost and technical barriers to using these fuels for aviation technical barriers include issues related to the reliability safety and performance of the fuel for example biodiesel freezes at higher temperatures than conventional jet fuel which can be problem in high altitude low temperature environments therefore research on biodiesel for aviation has included studying whether additives can be used to lower the freezing point or whether heaters could be added to fuel tanks to maintain fuel temperature the us department of defense dod and the us air force particularly are keenly interested in alternative supplies of jet fuel both in terms of cost and in terms of supply security one of dods goals is to use single fuel jp8 in all of its battlefield operations jp8 is militarygrade fuel similar to commercial jeta roughly half of dods total energy c onsumption and 23 of dods

the vast majority of aircraft fuel is jet fuel smaller piston engine planes use highoctane leaded gasoline small number of general aviation planes are operated on ethanol highoctane fuel pr oduced from grains or sugar mostly corn in the united states leaded gasoline s been banned for automotive use since the mid1990s and there is concern among some general aviators that leaded aviation gasoline will eventually be banned as well therefore there is interest in expanding the use of ethanol and other altern atives in these smaller planes in addition to substituting alternative fuels in existing jet and piston aircraft research is ongoing on new engine tech nologies to incorporate other fuels and engines for example various early unm anned prototypes have been developed to test the feasibility of solar or hydrogen fuel cellpowered aircraft alternative fuels for airport ground service vehicles while alternative fuels have been slow to penetrate into aviation natural gas propane

ozone in major metropolitan areas and s econd their contribution to global climate change from the emissions of aircraft in the upper troposphere ozone nonattainment areas aircraft account for only about 05 of the major categories of emissions from mobile sources in the united states according to the government accountability office232 but the emissions tend to be concentrated at airports in major cities most of these cities have not attained epas national ambient air quality standard for ozone and must reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides nox and volatile organi c compounds vocs to reach

contribute to climate change but most us trading partners are several of these partners including the european union are considering fees or other programs to encourage airlines to reduce emissions thus there will be pressure in the coming years to develop aircraft that are more fuel efficient and have fewer emissions whether the faa bill would be vehicle for such efforts remains to be seen mitigating aircraft noise through policy and technology since the introduction of civil jet ai rliners in the early 1960s significant reductions in noise emissions ve been made systematic effort to curtail aircraft noise impacts has reduced the number of peopl in the united states exposed to what is considered significant noise levels from about 7 million in 1975 to less than 400000 today this has been accomplishe d by technological advancements in reducing noise emissions as well as efforts to mitigate community noise exposure around airports while significant advances have been made over the years the united states is now at crossroads in terms of its public policy toward aircraft noise mitigation some experts predict that wh ile the pace of noise reduction technology will slow largely due to diminishing marginal gains in noise reduction capability increases in the demand for air travel coupled with continuing population growth may largely offset any technical advances if there are changes to existing policies and approaches to mitigating aircraft noise and its impacts on communities policymakers have long debated the relative merits of investing in noise reduction technology or inves ting in noise mitigation efforts in affected communities in the past combination of both of thes approaches has been applied however faced with current challenges to reduce budget

technologi cal advancements to reduce aircraft noise will continue to progress at these historical rates may depend in part on the adequacy of funding for ai rcraft noise technolog programs however these investments are seen as being of relatively high risk because it is not certain to what extent these historical trends can continue or wh ether significant technological advances in noise reduction beyond what s already been achieved or demonstrated are even possible stage 3 and stage 4 noise standards aircraft noise reduction technologies over the past decade have been driven to some degree by national and international noise st andards current stage 3 noi standards were completely phasedin under rules promulga ted by the faa to meet the mandate of the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 anca pl 101508 under the phasein plan all aircraft operators were required to gradually trans ition to 100 stage 3 compliant aircraft operations by 2000 for aircraft weighing 75000 pounds or more for most aircraft types stage 3 aircraft are considerably quieter than earlier generation stage 2 aircraft whose noise guidelines were established in the early 1970s based on available technical capabilities at that time the most significant reductions in permissible noise levels under stage 3 were for 2engine aircraft weighing between 125000 and 600000 pounds this includes most ai rline fleets currently in operation and typical reductions in permi ssible noise levels for these aircraft were in the range of eight to 10 decibels which is roughly equivalent to cutting the perceived noise level by half241 the international civil aviation organization icao has since adopted more stringent noise standards called chapter 4 noise standards for new aircraft designs these b

mitigate noise is through the process desc ribed in title 14 cfr part 150 completion of the part 150 process while not manda tory requirement for airports is prerequisite for federal funding of noise mitigation progra ms at airports such as home and land purchases and soundproofing of residences nd schools and is carried out to comply with the national environmental policy act nepa 42 us code 4331 et seq thus part 150 defines the regulatory pr ocess for faa compliance with nepa and related statutes pertaining to the submi ssion of noise exposure maps 49 us code 47503 and noise compatibility programs 49 us c ode 47504 completion of part 150 process primarily involves development of noise exposure map for the airport detailing noise exposur levels in surrounding areas and establishment of noise compatibility program the purposes of noise compatibility program are to promote planning process th rough which the airport operator can examine and analyze the noise impacts perform costbenefit analyses of various approaches to noise mitigation and identify existing and forecast areas of nonco mpatible land uses and consider actions to reduce noncompatible use areas to bring together through public participation agency coordination and overall cooperation ll interested partie s to facilitate the development of an agreed upon noise abatement plan tailored to the individual airport while not undul affecting the national air transportation system and to develop feasible comprehens ive noise reduction techniques and land use controls which to the ma ximum extent possible confine noise levels of 75 dnl or greater to areas inside the airport boundary and establish and maintain compatible land uses in the areas affected by noise between the 65 dnl and 75 dnl contours245 because land use zoning is largely local function that is seldom preempted by state or federal action achieving compa tible land uses typically involves close cooperation with local officials246 in other words simply having part 150 noise compatibility program does not establish any formal requirement or obligation regarding land use but rather acts as guideline for zoning while the faa notes that the responsibility for determining accep table and permissible land uses and the relationship between specific properties nd specific noise levels rests with local authorities its published land use compatib ility tables specify that dnl of 65 or above is incompatible with residential use and schools while other noise sensitivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33698crs110 247 14 cfr part 150 a102 248

airports the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 anca 49 us code 47521 et seq mandates national aviation noise policy for reviewing noise nd access restrictions at airports the statute limited the applicability of this progra m to restrictions pr oposed after october 1 1990 under the provisions of th statute limitations on stage 3248 aircraft can only be imposed if agreed to by the air port and all affected aircraft operators or adopted through review process administe red by the faa the types of aircraft operating limitations covered unde r this provision include noise level restrictions using either single event or cumulative exposure criteria direct or indirect limitation on the number of stage 3 operations noise budget or noise allocation program encompassing stage 3 aircraft limitation on the hours of operation for stage 3 aircraft or any other limit on stage 3 aircraft proposed restrictions will be approved only in cases where there is s ubstantial evidence that the proposal is reasonable nonarbitrary and nondiscriminat ory does not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce is not inconsistent with maintaining safe and efficient use of navigable airspace does not conflict with any existing federal statute or regulation and does not create an undue bur den on the national aviation system the statute also limited the ability of airports to impose restrictions on noisier stage 2 aircraft but made these restrictions relatively easier to impose under the statute airport operators are required to provide public notice of the proposed access restriction including costbenefit analysis and an analysis of alternatives the statute also phasedin the elimination of noisier stage 2 aircraft weighing more than 75000 pounds by december 31 1999 large stage 2 aircraft including all aircraft in air carrier fleets were either retired or retrofitted with new engines or hushkits to bring them into compliance with stage 3 standards by the

ubsequently denied the naples airport authoritys proposal to ban all stage 2 ai rcraft on the basis that it appeared to contradict the airports grant obligati ons under the airport improvement program aip title 49 us code 47101 et seq while the naples airport has moved forward with imposing its ban on stage 2 airc raft it did so at the jeopardy of losing future federal grants the naples airpor t authority however challenged the faas decision in federal court on june 3 2005 the us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia found that the napl airport authority had provided ample evidence justifying the stage 2 ban and remanded the case back to the faa250 despite this favorable outcome for airports stage 2 bans may be hard to justify froma costbenefit standpoint given their length and costly process and the estimate that only about 2000 stage 2 jets continue to ope rate in the united states and are being phasedout over time 251 in the case of naples airport the number of aircraft affected by the ban accounted for less than one percent of its total operations252 because the part 161 process has proved to be such significant hurdle for airports seeking to impose access restric tions as evidenced by the experience of naples airport specific statutory waiver to the requirements of anca and the part 161 process was included in vision 100 speci fically section 825 of that act states that sponsor of comme rcial service airport that does not own the airport land and is party to longterm lease agreement with federal agency other than the department of defense or the

pursua nt to this provision jackson hole airport implemented stage 2 ban that went into effect june 28 2004 given the complexities of the part 161 process and airports experiences with proposing

on reasonable cond itions and without unjust discrimination if the airport receives aip grants for airport improvements253 in other words if an airport continues to enforce noise ordinance and accepts aip federal grants the airport may be compelled by the faa or by user groups challenging the restriction in the federal court system to substantiate that the noise restrictions do not unjustly discriminate against certain users one example of an access restriction challenged on such grounds that was ultimately upheld was the nonaddition rule and quotas on stage 2 aircraft at van nuys airport in va n nuys california at van nuys airport there are restrictions on adding stage 2 aircraft to the fleet based at van nuys and restrictions on the number of nonbased stage 2 aircraft operations these restrictions which were proposed befo re the passage of anca and considered exempt from part 161 requirements by the faa were challenged by the national business aircraft association but upheld in federal court254 weightbased restrictions because permissible aircraft noise levels generally increase as function of aircraft weight one method to curtail noise would be to limit or restrict aircraft over certain size doing so solely on the basis of noise emissions would be governed by anca nd the part 161 process however some airports have also sought to restrict larger aircraft out side of the part 161 process solely on the basis of paveme nt loadbearing criteria in other words airports have sought to limit larger aircraft for reas ons other than noise emissions although arguably noise emissions may be the most salient factor in community opposition to the operations of such aircraft to curtail the practice of using pavement weightbearing data to justify what some may arguably consid er noiserelated restricti ons the faa has proposed to adopt policy for justifying airport restric tions on the basis of pa vement strength and separating these types of actions from noi serelated access restrictions the faa proposes that the pavement loadbearing cap acity be considered design standard that can be exceeded on occasi on rather than an absolute limit on aircraft weight and has drafted policy that would require ai rports adopting weightbased restrictions based on pavement loadbearing capacity to demonstrate that thos restrictions are reasonable and not unjustly discriminatory255 the faa notes that many airport pavements are capable of supporting limited operations that exceed engineering weight limits for pavement by up to 50 the proposed policy goes on to note that it applies only for considerati ons of operator investment in pavement and is not substitute for noise restrictions in other words the faas proposed policy if adopted could significantly limit an ai rports capability to impose weightbased restrictions without justifying these restri ctions in terms of their direct impacts on improving pavement durability and could prevent airports from limiting larger aircraft on the basis of weight one outside of the part 161 processhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33698crs113 to date one airport teterboro air port teb in new jersey

permission is obtai ned from the airport manager the intent of the legislation is to keep this requirement in full force regardless of the faas action regarding its proposed policy on airport weight limits airspace redesign and pro cedural modifications often noise problems tied to specific airport or ai rports in regional area can be mitigated through airspace redesign or modifications to operational procedures examples of such actions abound and include actions ch as reconfiguring approach patterns redefining preferred runways and establishing airport traffic patterns that avoid residential communities and other noisesensitive areas large scale airspace reconfigurations are currently in the pla nning and public review stages in the new yorknew jerseyphiladelphia region and in the angeles basin region while these airspace reconfigurations were initiated by the faa for operational reasons they provide an opportunity to address community noise implications as required under national environmental po licy act nepa requirements recourse for seeking modifications to airspace layout or operational procedures may be formally sought through petition for rulemaking as described in title 14 code of federal regulati ons 1117 some airspace modi fication options may also be considered as part of larger part 150 study and may benefit from the detailed assessment of such options c onducted as part of the part 150 process if part 150 study is not contemplated then informal dialogue with the faa may be useful avenue for discussing possible options for airspace modifications and operational changes to mitigate noise such exchanges may provide more complete perspective on what options may be viable and what op tions may be signifi cantly constrained by concerns over the safety and efficiency of traffic flow of both rrivals and departures as well as aircraft transitin g the surrounding airspace one specific option that is being studied is implementing steeper quieter descents research examining the use of steeper approaches to runways has shown particular promise in reducing community noise levels steeper approaches reduce community noise by keeping aircraft at higher altitudes for longer periods reducing required engine power during descent nd delaying flap extension thus reducing airframe noise recent testing of c ontinuous descent approach cda noise abatement procedures that can be progra mmed into existing aircraft onboard flight management systems yielded noise reductions of three to six decibels on average the most substantial noise reductions using such procedures are in communities that lie about seven to 15 miles fro m the airport however traffic flow issues may limit the ability to implement these ty pes of approaches at speci fic airport because these procedures show particular promise for re ducing noise levels they may merit specific study to determine their applicability for specific airport environment international civil
