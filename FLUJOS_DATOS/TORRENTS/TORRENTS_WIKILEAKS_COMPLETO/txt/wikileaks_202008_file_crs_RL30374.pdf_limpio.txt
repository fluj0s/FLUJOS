natorussi an relations allied capabilities future enlargement allied unity nonarticle v operations and the response of potential adversaries remain under debate this report provides brief lessons learned from operation allied force nato had limited political objectives in the conflict most of which were at least partially met key considerations such as avoiding civilian casualties and losses to nato forces affected design of the military strategy supporting these objectives natos restrained escalation of force with threat of ground attack and gradual application of increased air power violated conventional us military doctrine to maximize shock desire to sustain allied unity largely caused this restraint and ceded time and initiative to milosevic subsequent proposals to streamline allied decisionmaking including an intervention committee are discussed why milosevic decided to accept nato terms and withdraw his forces remains unclear damage caused by nato bombing sustained allied unity possible allied planning for ground war desire to preserve his forces and desertion of russia as possible protector were likely principal reasons nato sought to maintain political engagement with russia which sharply opposed the air war russia sought to undermine natos objectives but in the end acceded to allied desires to assist in achieving diplomatic solution the conflict revealed significant gap in military capability between the united states and its allies which were deficient in key areas such as lift precisionguided munitions and night combat these shortfalls may have spurred european interest in developing greater capabilities an interest not yet reflected in defense budgets the three new allies gave political support to nato goals but did not send combat forces their restrained involvement raised issues for possible next round of enlargement such as candidate states military preparedness and political will nato maintained unity but range of views was evident in allied governments leftist or centerleft governments supported the conflict britain took leading role italy bore heavy burden and the greek government despite vigorous popular opposition maintained its political support for the war the conflict broke new ground in that the allies went to war in part for humanitarian reasons potential adversaries learned that nato may longer regard claims of sovereignty as shield against allied intervention in their affairs they may also have learned useful lessons from milosevics tactics intended to divide the allies and that nato may be more likely to take decisive action to protect interests near europe than when interests at greater distance are affected this report in the form of memorandum was originally prepared for senator william

paul gallis specialist in european affairskosovo lessons learned from operation allied force introduction operation allied force ended with the withdrawal of yugoslav forces from and the return of most refugees to kosovo the conflict however raised many questions about broader issues affecting the future of the nato alliance this memorandum examines number of lessons learned with the realization that any conflict is unique and only elements of allied force may have relevance for future operations during the war there were questions about natos strategy particularly president clintons announcement that the use of ground forces was not being considered as an option and the need for an escalation of air operations bringing together 19 allies with disparate histories and interests and often different political cultures was formidable task how did that task affect formulation of political goals and military objectives were the allies consistent in those goals and objectives the first section of the memorandum examines these questions in the second section crs examines decision making and command arrangements did the chain of command operate as expected by the allies was allied force war by committee with least common denominator determining final decisions or was greater flexibility in reconciling national sentiments with strategic requirements apparent in the third section russias role is examined nato has sought for several years to engage russia in security issues on the continent without giving moscow veto over decisionmaking from the allied perspective did russia play constructive role does the conflict indicate need for different ways to engage russia in the future the fourth section examines nato capabilities and burdensharing it is clear that the united states bore the brunt of the air campaign given this fact how significant was the role played by european allies in allied force what did the war indicate about strengths and shortcomings of natos military forces how did the new member states which joined the alliance only two weeks before the conflict began respond to their initial and undoubtedly difficult test does their performance in the conflict have implications for possible next round of enlargement the final section analyzes the implications of the conflict for natos future were the allies satisfied with the outcome of allied force how well did natohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30374crs2 prepared by julie kim specialist in international relationstolerate range of sentiments in allied governments and how important is consensus building and unity in such conflict does the war indicate need for greater european military capability particularly for nonarticle v operations what insights might potential adversaries have learned about nato from the conduct of allied force operation allied force the strategy political objectives of operation allied force natos political goals in first threatening then engaging in air strikes against yugoslavia were limited in essence nato utilized air strikes as means to compel yugoslav president slobodan milosevic to change his behavior in kosovo which was viewed to be unacceptable to the international community on humanitarian grounds and threatening to neighboring states and to promote peaceful resolution to the conflict outside of kosovo nato also sought to stabilize neighbo ring countries maintain allied unity and limit damage to relations with russia the air campaign did not have as stated objectives taking kosovo away from serbia by force providing defense for the kosovo liberation army or removing milosevic from power nato first threatened air strikes against yugoslavia in october 1998 as means to enforce agreements reached between richard holbrooke and milosevic on cease fire and serbian force levels in kosovo the nato threat theoretically remained in place during the peace negotiations at rambouillet in early 1999 providing an incentive for the parties to reach an agreement after yugoslavia rejected the interim agreement nato publicly renewed its threat of air strikes in march 1999 at the start of the operation us and nato leaders said that the action was intended to stop the killing in kosovo and compel milosevic to accept the interim political settlement negotiated at rambouillet on march 24 president clinton outlined three objectives of the mission to demonstrate the seriousness of natos purpose to deter an even bloodier offensive by yugoslavia against innocent civilians in kosovo if necessary to seriously damage the serbian militarys capacity to make war in kosovo instead of capitulating or reversing course however milosevic immediately intensified his massive ethnic cleansing campaign to drive out most of the ethnic albanian population from kosovo hundreds of thousands of kosovar refugees fled or were driven out to neighboring countries although natos objective of deterring such violence failed nato resolved to continue the air campaign until certain conditions were met in april nato established five core demands on milosevic stop all military action violence and repression in kosovo withdraw from kosovo his military police and paramilitary forces agree to the stationing in kosovo of an international military presence with nato at its core agree to the return of all refugees and access to them by humanitarian aid organizations and provide assurancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30374crs3 prepared by steve bowman specialist in national defenseof willingness to work on the basis of the rambouillet accords to establish political framework agreement for kosovo nato held to these objectives through the rest of the campaign some proved to be more controversial than others regarding the withdrawal of serb forces nato subsequently specified that all of belgrades forces had to leave kosovo in contrast to earlier agreements that would have allowed belgrade to retain some forces in the province us officials asserted that only full withdrawal would allow for the return of substantial number of refugees in an apparent concession however nato said at the april 1999 summit in washington that it would consider pause in the air campaign if milosevics forces began to withdraw with regard to the international military presence nato asserted that it should provide the core of the force the may 6 statement adopted by the group of 8 countries however referred only to effective international civil and security presences endorsed by the united nations making mention of nato and implying possible command and control howeve r the june 3 statement presented to milosevic by the russian and finnish envoys restored natos substantial participation and united command in the international security presence milosevics agreement to the statement and the subsequent military technical agreem ent worked out between nato and yugoslav military leaders with terms meeting natos requirements enabled the alliance to end operation allied force on june 10 nato later reached demilitarization agreement with the kosovo liberation army with these agreements and the passage of security council resolution 1244 june 10 nato claimed that the stated political objectives of the allied force operation had been met these objectives limited in scope could only provide conditions for peace to take hold in kosovo the larger objective of securing peace and security in kosovo and southeastern europe would depend on other operations and international efforts military goals of operation allied force without access to nato military planning documents any discussion of military objectives is limited to public statements and consequently must be generalized it is impossible to separate the military goals of operation allied force from their political context given that they were crafted and adjusted to maintain political consensus among the allies in announcing the onset of the air campaign nato secretarygeneral solana stated alliance military action is intended to support its political aims to do so natos military action will be directed towards halting the violent attacks being committed by yugoslav army and security forces and disrupting their ability to conduct future attacks against the population of kosovohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30374crs4 1defense news july 26 p 30 prepared by edward f bruner specialist in national defensefrom the onset however there appeared to be disconnection between this objective and the conduct of the air campaign targeting was restricted almost entirely to air defense and infrastructure facilities destruction of which appeared not to hamper serb ethnic cleansing operations in kosovo in addition operation allied forces design as campaign of phased escalation indicated that hopes of signaling natos resolve took precedence over solely military concerns as it became apparent that air strikes could not stop serb operations public military objectives were brought more in line with what could be achieved on april 15 before the senate armed services committee secretary cohen stated our military objective is to degrade and damage the military and security structure that president milosevic has used to depopulate and destroy the albanian majority in kosovo now the military objectives were drafted in relative terms eg degrading capabilities and hence achievable almost by definition outright destruction of serb armed forces and halting the attacks in kosovo were longer included as military objective because they could not be achieved solely though an air campaign and ground offensive was politically unacceptable for the allies though nato spokesmen emphasized that all targets had military significance the air strikes were increasingly targeted against economic and political infrastructure eg bridges power plants tv stations presidential residences these were targets of value to the milosevic regime and reflected an intensified effort to force political capitulation from president milosevic rather than an effort to wipe out operating ground forces in kosovo hence from the outset operation allied force was unique type of operation and not guided by normal military doctrine there appears to have been confusion on military objectives among nato military forces the significant differences in perspective were rather on the national political level where shortterm military objectives were affected by political adjustments in target lists strong aversion to casualties on either side of the conflict and concerns over domestic public reactions nato military leaders including general clark general naumann and general short have criticized the extent to which they were unable to conduct the operation based upon military objectives and have called for an examination of the alliances decision making processes once military operation has been undertaken gen naumann has also noted that while the yugoslavs prepared for war nato prepared for an operation distinction marking the inherent constraints on natos military leaders1 application of military force escalate or overwhelm natos military

20 1999 p14strategists and others despite the fact that it ultimately did compel his withdrawal at cost in nato lives the use of force was restrained in several dimensions first there was confrontation or serious threat by allied ground forces second air power was applied gradually third some strategic civilian targets were kept off limits and fourth air power was restricted to high altitude delivery in order to reduce danger to allied pilots this restrained escalation of force appeared to violate conventional us doctrine to apply optimal joint forces for decisive results2 it also contradicted us air force doctrine to maximize shock with simultaneous effectsbased targeting whether one preferred strategic paralysis of serbia or destruction of its combat forces as the aim3 the advantages of gradual escalation were primarily political an overriding consideration was to sustain allied unity throughout the military campaign against yugoslavia4 key participants such as italy and greece might have been hardpressed to control public dissent in the face of perceived nato heavyhandedness especially if it resulted in sizable serbian civilian or nato military casualties all western democracies currently place high priority on avoiding casualties many western policymakers expected that modest air strikes would quickly bring milosevic to the table per the precedent of the bosnian serb reaction in 1995 as practical matter beginning with limited operations demonstrated nato resolve immediately while avoiding long possibly awkward wait for more massive forces to be assembled militarily the incremental approach allowed conservative attack and assessment of serbian air defenses to minimize dangers to allied air crews bad weather and serbian dispersal and camouflage of forces also constrained effective targeting the disadvantages of gradual escalation were that it ceded time and initiative to milosevic whereas massive strikes might have damaged serbian military capabilities and shocked the leaders and public into early capitulation limited strikes permitted physical and psychological accommodations and adjustments to be made on

military and security forces to concentrate on their ethnic cleansing missions allied forces per were not under serious threat and could afford to take as long as necessary to prosecute incremental attacks against yugoslavia the same was not true of course for the kosovo albanians each day of the campaign meant added deaths and displacements for them whether an alternative overwhelming strategy could have been mounted and concluded within less than the 78 days of operation allied force will never be known for certain it is likely however that looser political constraints on civilian targeting and operating altitudes would have allowed air strikes to create greater damage sooner to both serbian infrastructure and combat forces exclusion of ground force option the element of natos strategy of force escalation that was most visibly and heatedly debated was the decision to exclude participation of ground forces special criticism was reserved for public declarations of that policy such as president clintons statement on march 24 that i do not intend to put our troops in kosovo to fight war5 the political justification for such militarily unwise statement was to reassure any skittish nato allies that the united states was serious about keeping the kosovo operation limited and as bloodless as possible it became increasingly apparent that should the air campaign fail to compel serbian withdrawal from kosovo nato would either have to use ground forces or define down its objectives by may 18 the president said i dont think we or our allies should take any options off the table6 in the end ground forces were not used but the debate continues about the efficacy of using or threatening to use them the decision to deploy ground forces generally evidences more serious intent than does highaltitude bombing alone the strategic advantage in this case was that milosevic would have been less able to wait out and ignore nato air actions he would lose the initiative the disadvantage was that all the allies would have to face the risk of military casualties and many other uncertainties and potential consequences flowing from commitment to invade yugoslavia although nato unquestionably could have mustered ground force capable of defeating the yugoslav army geography and politics complicated planning for its insertion7 major effort might have taken many months to prepare even without specific plan however had nato not ruled out ground forces milosevic would surely have felt threatened by the strong nato combat formations already deployed in neighboring bosnia macedonia and albania and logistics bases in hungary had milosevic and his generals not felt safe from ground attacks that could potentially strike from eighthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30374crs7 8at one

ethnic cleansing8 at the tactical level there were indications that forces on the ground working jointly with air forces enhanced the overall operation beyond their direct capabilities nato highaltitude precision bombing seemed quite successful against fixed infrastructure targets it was much less successful against serbian combat forces that were dispersed hidden and camouflaged nato air operations enjoyed their greatest success against serbian combat forces in the last days of the campaign when ground incursions by the kosovo liberation army forced the serbs to mass and move forces providing lucrative targets task force hawk us army unit based on apache attack helicopters and longrange rocket systems was assembled close to kosovo in albania although tf hawk was not committed it appears that its reconnai ssance and surveillance assets intelligence processing capability and ground oriented analysts were effective in providing useful target data for nato air forces9 at both the strategic and tactical levels therefore it appears that threatening to use or actually introducing ground forces early in operation allied force could have hastened milosevics withdrawal from kosovo and diverted effort from his campaign of ethnic cleansing whether all allies and neighboring countries would have supported such strategy remains uncertain why did milosevic agree to withdraw his forces from kosovo definitive explanation for milosevics decision to withdraw his forces from kosovo is not possible at present given that milosevic has yet to explain publicly the reasons for the withdrawal and that archives and memoirs that could shed light on the question are unlikely to be available for some time however observers have offered several plausible explanations one factor may have been the damage caused by 11 weeks of allied bombing according to press accounts the bombing appeared to be successful in destroying military bases and government installations as well as dual use infrastructur within serbia proper including bridges oil refineries and power plants perhaps most importantly nato targeted factories television stations and other assets of milosevics key supporters including the influential karic brothers milosevics cronies may have also been discomfited by an eu travel ban that prevented them from gaining easy access to their overseas bank accounts although milosevic may have at first received political boost from public outrage at the nato bombing he may have feared that the extensive damage caused by largescale openended bombing would sharply erode his public support and the loyalty of his inner circle10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30374crs8 11anthony cordesman the lessons and nonlessons of the air and missile war in

not have been key factor in forcing the withdra wal dispersal of forces and expert camouflage reportedly moderated their losses however the allied air presence may well have hindered yugoslav forces in their campaign to stamp out the kla which had been key objective of milosevics ethnic cleansing effort while the kla did not seriously threaten serbian control of the province during the bombing milosevic may have calculated that time was not on his side in the long run the tactical stalemate with the kla could eventually have turned to his disadvantage particularly if nato ground offensive would have been launched11 it is unclear the extent to which milosevic took seriously the threat of ground offensive nato countries never began serious preparations for an invasion in part due to concern about the negative political impact of likely western casualties general clark has said that he believes that milosevic had received intelligence that the united states and other nato countries were likely to begin serious consideration of ground assault in the near future milosevic may have calculated that his ability to secure deal would deteriorate rapidly if that occurred clark said that he believes milosevics military advisors told him that if nato ultimately did decide on ground assault yugoslav forces would be defeated12 milosevic may have calculated that such defeat and the heavy losses yugoslav forces would suffer could be politically fatal for him relatives of reservists demonstrated against the war in several towns in southern serbia in may 1999 after modest number of bodies were returned from the battlefields of kosovo some reservists in kosovo abandoned their posts in addition milosevic could not rule out the possibility that nato forces might not stop at taking kosovo and could move on belgrade in order to oust him from power milosevic may have also been swayed by his increasing international isolation he believed that nato countries would not be able to maintain the unity and resolve to carry out military operations of the necessary duration and intensity to force him to quit kosovo on april 30 milosevic said that we never thought we could defeat natohowever you are not willing to sacrifice lives to achieve our surrender but we are willing to die to defend our rights as an independent sovereign nation the us congress is beginning to understand that bombing country into compliance is not viable policy or strategy13 however the nato allies remained unified during the conflict in part due to public outrage in the west over the brutality of the serbian ethnic cleansing campaign in kosovo another important factor was the possible concern among many allied leaders that failure to achieve allied objectives in kosovo would deal devastating blow to natos credibility finally and perhaps most critically there were combat losses among allied pilots as milosevic had hoped httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30374crs9 14interview with jul

national defense 16for distinctive historical reasons some allies such as france have acquired in the 20th century much tighter civilian control over their military establishment than the united conta related consideration for milosevic may have been his perception that russia had abandoned him perhaps buoyed by the reports of his brother borislav who was yugoslav ambassador to russia milosevic may have been counting on russian support to deter allied action against him or if that failed for russia to provide him with concrete military assistance however it became clear that such assistance was forthcoming press accounts of the june 3 meeting between milosevic russian envoy viktor chernomyrdin and finnish president martti ahtisaari agree that chernomyrdin supported ahtisaaris insistence that the plan which was based on the core nato demands for ending the conflict was nonnegotiable given the constellation of international political forces against him milosevic may have seen the chernomyrdinahtisaari peace document as the best offer he was likely to get14 some observers have raised the issue of whether milosevic in fact wanted to get rid of kosovo all along they speculate that given the unfavorable demographic situation in the province and continuing western demands for autonomy for kosovo milosevic may have felt that serbian control of kosovo was doomed in the long run anyway and that having it taken away from him by force at acceptable cost was more politically palatable than to give it up without fight15 moreover the chernomyrdin ahtisaari document recognized yugoslavias sovereignty over kosovo while giving the the unenviable task of governing the province skeptics argue that such strategy would appear convoluted even by balkan standards they add that if such was milosevics strategy it has not been great success the defeat in kosovo has landed him in the most difficult domestic political situation of his rule nato decisionmaking and command arrangements performance of the nato chain of command given the generally smooth execution of the air campaign and its favorable outcome particularly with casualties to airmen natos military chain of command for operation allied force has suffered little criticism nato has great advantage in its longstanding and oftenexercised chains of command and standardized procedures coordinating the military efforts of nineteen nations on short notice without that advantage would have been daunting task on the other hand concern has been expressed about political influence over or within the nato chain

restraints placed on general clark cohen then noted the difficulty in getting 19 nations to think through their roles without hindering military planning consistent also with making sure there is always civilian control over the military17 in discussing the incremental nature of the campaign general clark acknowledged that he was compelled to sacrifice basic logic of warfare to maintain the political cohesion of the alliance18 as an example he cited the necessity for concern with antiwar pressures felt by coalition governments in germany and italy in the final analysis however nineteen sovereign and diverse democracies were able to retain their political prerogatives through to united military victory the question is open whether any structural change to nato could make the process easier in war limited to air strikes many questions were raised about nato target selection and approval secretary cohen testified that president clinton did not select targets although he did review recommendations and target lists it was also clear that air force generals would have preferred to receive political guidance on the effects desired by bombing and then select appropriate targets and timing rather than simply servicing an approved list of targets for maximum effect number of targets might be attacked nearsimultaneously political veto of just few of those targets could disrupt the whole plan air force generals were allowed to make their case for preferred strategies but accepted political judgements as the campaign progressed it appeared that nations became more comfortable with the targeting and the perception was that nations tended to veto only sensitive targets assigned to their own pilots it is claimed however that governments did from timetotime intercede and urgently request postponement or withdrawal of selected targets their wishes were usually but not always respected19 to streamline decisionmaking over targeting some have suggested small intervention committee representing the governments in coalition of the willing20 such proposal might well sacrifice allied unity in the kosovo conflict for example key allies such as the german and italian governments were urging restraint in attacking targets that they believed might cause high numbers of civilian casualties exclusion of such governments from the decisionmaking process would have

occupation of the pristina airfield in advance of nato peacekeeping forces in kosovo kfor was an indicator of weakness in the nato chain of command force of 180200 russians painted kfor on their vehicles and dashed from their station in bosnia to pristina before kfor entered kosovo it is alleged that saceur clark ordered british lieutenant general jackson commander of kfor to intercept or preempt the russian occupation of the airfield he did not or perhaps could not carry out the order if it was indeed an order in any event nato treated the russian stunt as political rather than military problem21 even from purely military perspective harm was done and neither nato nor us interests would have been served by an armed confrontation with russian troops the united states has not criticized ltg jacksons judgment in this matter according to president clintons policy us commander in multilateral force retains the option of not acting on an order exceeding the agreed mandate for that force and could refer his action to the president for review he could also act to protect his forces if they were endangered22 it could be presumptuous to reserve such safeguards to the united states and deny them to other nations and it is unlikely that such policies will be reviewed by nato russia russias goals during the kosovo conflict natos air campaign during the kosovo conflict aroused intense opposition across the entire political spectrum in russia as well as in the general public23 it also posed serious dilemma for moscow how to oppose natos military action without provoking confrontation with the us and nato europe the two prongs of this dilemma encompass russias apparent goals during the conflict and the tension between those goals seriously weakened moscows

the most of cold war moscow and belgrade were enemies after 1948 the tito regime viewed the ussr as its main military threat yugoslav military doctrine was based on organized small unit and partisan

conduct in chechnya was brutal it did not involve deliberate ethnic cleansing of the local populationrussias cultural religious and historical affinity with serbia24 was mistakenly highlighted by most western media as the prime factor behind moscows opposition to natos bombing other factors were almost certainly more important until recently the russian public had been largely unconcerned with foreign policy issues such as nato enlargement despite the agitation of political elites natos bombing of yugoslavia however stirred deep popular anger25 to the delight of communists and ultranationalists who capitalized on it and to the chagrin of the government and moderate politicians who wereare threatened by this development besides emotional and domestic political factors some russian leaders are worried by what they perceive as growing nato military threat approaching their borders while russian conventional armed forces are in ruins particularly alarming from this perspective is natos decision to use military force without or osce approval where russia would have veto power to address human rights situation in kosovo that reminds many russians of their own recent conflict in chechnya or dagestan26 russia could be next warn the hardliners other russian leaders probably realize that nato does not pose threat of military aggression against their country but are concerned that nato will act militarily elsewhere without russian consent and possibly against its interests from this it follows that russias goals in the conflict were substantially though not entirely at variance with natos russia wanted to bring about halt to nato military action and have the alliance accept the principle that outofarea military operations require approval moscow tried to use the kosovo conflict to divide and weaken nato and to strengthen its own ties with china on an antius basis these all contradicted us and nato objectives and policies russia also tried to use the conflict to demonstrate that it too is an indispensable world power at the same time moscow absolutely wanted to avoid being drawn militarily into the conflict and to prevent escalation or expansion of the conflict that would increase military risks to itself goals shared with nato finally russia wanted to avoid having the kosovo conflict lead to crisis in relations with the united states and nato europe that would deny russia the economic assistance it so urgently needed nato also wanted to maintain stable relations with russia russias warnings to nato about kosovo were blunted by its military weakness and its continuing pleas for economic assistance and debt relief as nato unity over kosovo continued to hold moscow shifted emphasis from its maximal goals directed against nato to the more modest ones of avoiding worstcase outcomes through active diplomacy in the end moscow became significant player in the diplomatic maneuvering that brought an end to the conflict ultimately distancing itself from belgrades positions andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30374crs13 27some might argue that the above assessment attributes more coherence to russias policies than is

milosevics decision to withdraw his forces from kosovo27 there is ample evidence of russian cooperation with serbia in the early weeks of the nato air campaign russian news coverage was almost indistinguishable from serbian which helped inflame russian public opinion in ways that the governing elites probably soon regretted russian news coverage later became less stridently onesided although it was never objective there are conflicting accounts as to whether russias electronic intelligence vessel in the adriatic provided information to belgrade or only to moscow28 two russian truck convoys of humanitarian aid to yugoslavia were mainly symbolic but its diplomatic support of belgrade until the end game was quite significant us and nato sources accused russias balkan envoy

intermediary there is debate and uncertainty in russia and the west over the june 12 dash of russian paratroopers to the pristina airport russian accounts differ as to whether yeltsin specifically authorized the move in advance30 seizing the airport may have been aimed at exerting pressure on nato to agree to russian terms for participation in kfor an issue then in heated dispute some say the russian military launched the dash to the airport as an expression of disgust at the governments diplomatic abandonment of belgrade the move may reflect struggle for control among factions in moscow under weak and disengaged president yeltsin some us and russian sources claim that the 200 paratroopers were the vanguard of much larger russian force meant to dictate facts on the ground that was headed off at the last minute by washington persuading hungary romania and bulgaria to cancel or deny overflight permission for russian troop transport planes31httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30374crs14

deal with kfor issues most other russianato contact is still on hold 34moscow still strongly opposes the accession of former soviet states to natothe kosovo conflict and natorussia relations from natos perspective aspects of russias role in the kosovo conflict were both hostile and helpful russias harsh criticism of the nato air campaign and its veiled threats almost certainly increased apprehension of some nato allies and weakened alliance cohesion though probably less than moscow expected adding to russian frustration this was likely one of moscows objectives on the other hand moscows decision to participate in natoeu diplomacy as an intermediary with belgrade tended to dampen those fears among allies assessments vary as to the importance of russias role in bringing milosevic to accept natos terms but there seems little doubt that russias active diplomatic engagement enhanced nato solidarity as the bombing campaign continued and collateral damage and civilian casualties increased the kosovo conflict laid open key contradiction in natos relationship with russia ie although the natoru ssia founding act and the permanent joint council create the veneer of treating russia and nato as equals in reality nato does not regard or treat russia as its equal as the kosovo conflict continued it further damaged already strained relations between nato and russia on one side years of nato efforts to convince moscow that the alliance was not military threat to its security were undermined on the other side western concerns about russian intentions and reliability were reinforced russian political leaders assert that the country must increase defense spending and preparedne ss to counter the alleged nato threat32 russia has frozen most military relations and cooperation with nato33 russian officials state more baldly than ever their intention to try to use the natorussia joint council as means of expanding russian influence over nato military decisions and failing that to withdraw from the joint council russian participation in kfor if it follows the bosnian model could over time help ease some of the tension in military cooperation also in recent weeks the putin government seems to have toned down moscows rhetoric about red line that nato dare not cross by admitting former soviet republics such as the baltic states

to tirane albania the apache pilots then underwent an intensiv training program to familiarize them with the terrain and the combat load for their aircraft the order to employ the apaches was never given and allied force ended without their participation variety of reasons have been offered for the delays in task force hawks deployment the ah64s alone were capable of deploying from germany to albania within 72 hours however they were only portion of the task force gen clark reportedly requested the ah64s prior to the onset of the air campaign37 they were to be based in macedonia along with other nato ground forces preparing for kfor the macedonian government however objected to the presence of attack helicopters and the deployment was changed to albania this change had several consequences first force protection became more important consideration albania was judged less secure environment than macedonia and consequ ently task force hawk was beefed up to include mechanized infantry armor and the armys atacms surfacetosurface missile system this in turn increased the assembly time and increased the number of air transport sorties required threefold the inadequacies of the tirane albania airport created major chokepoint the airport could accommodate only one c5 or two c17 transport aircraft on the ground at one time and task force hawk required over 150 aircraft sorties initially it was also unable to handle night landings or takeoffs then hardened helipads had to be constructed because heavy rains had turned the base area into sea of mud further complicating the situation the flow of refugees from kosovo into albania had made refugee assistance the first priority for tiranes limited air cargo capacity with the press closely following task force hawks deployment its arrival in albania led to the expectation that it would be immediately employed it was assumed that the apaches would move against the serb ground forces in kosovo which had proven difficult for the air force to locate and destroy here again the lastminute decision to base the helicopters in albania rather than macedonia played role thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30374crs17 38house

consequently several weeks of intensive training were undertaken also more experienced pilots from usbased units were added to the task force it should be noted that in testimony before the house armed services committee brig gen cody of task force hawk acknowledg ed that only army special operations helicopter pilots are trained to operate from standing start so that task force hawks training period was not necessarily unusual38 even with the completion of this training the ah64s were not employed and press reports indicate that resistance within dod and the army staff was factor39 reportedly pentagon officials were not convinced that gen clarks intended mission for the apaches to attack dugin serb ground forces was appropriate or worth the risk there had been some resistance to the mission from the first indicated by dods agreeing to the deployment but insisting the ah64s not be employed without pentagon approval the mountainous terrain the fact that serb forces knew where the helicopters were based and which approaches they would have to use and the density of air defenses in the region all contributed to this caution the atacms had been included in task force hawk to suppress air defenses prior to apache missions but there was concern that significant collateral casualties could result from their use which further complicated the employment decision some elements of task force hawk however did participate in offensive operations artilleryatacms support radars and ground intelligence assessment elements were able to pinpoint serb artillery positions for air

similar campaigns the new nato members appear to be better prepared politically and militarily for peacekeeping missions as demonstrated by their participation in kfor as well as sfor in bosnia in

unsympathetic to natos objectives maintained unified front over kosovo because the alliance remains central to their security range of viewpoints43 among the allies questions abound over us leadership of allied force some allies had raised questions about us leadership over balkan issues in the early 1990s then french and british officials criticized us reluctance to place peacekeeping forces on the ground in bosnia to prevent violence against the civilian population and the us decision to use air power alone against yugoslav forces to achieve allied objectives for some european countries the potential repercussions of instability in the balkans are sufficient justification for sending ground forces for peacekeeping into the region among governments strongly supportive of allied force the perception is common that british prime minister blairs government and not the clinton administration provided the key political leadership as the air campaign wore on without clear results the blair government pressed for an introduction of nato ground forces while most allied governments may not have supported the use of ground forces they gave high marks to blair and his foreign and defense ministers for forceful articulation of european interests at stake in the balkans blair also carried his message to smaller nato countries where he spoke on number of occasions to bolster several

germany housed over 300000 refugees during the conflict in bosnia their presence caused social tensions today of particular importance chancellor schröders government includes the traditionally

administration for not providing more public forceful leadership of allied force there remains clear consensus that the campaign could not have been carried out without the united states formulating strategy and leading allied militaries the united states remains alone among the allies both capable and willing to undertake largescale military conflicts nonetheless us hesitancy to use ground forces has left some allied governments most clearly britain france and italy with the sentiment that the united states does not share equally european concerns about such destabilizing developments as the flow of refugees and ethnic nationalism clear impetus for esdi is the recognition among european governments that there is gap in capability between their militaries and that of the united states and that they must improve their capability in the event that us forces may not join them in future conflict several countries are building multinational units and more mobile forces both for nato and for possible use by the european union significant obstacles to esdi remain the europeans have clear leaders in foreign and security policy most smaller nato and eu members concerned about domination by one of the larger member states greatly prefer us leadership from afar to political elbowing from neighbor several eu countries are not in nato are nonaligned and oppose close

destruction this viewpoint was also expressed in the us senate during the nato enlargement debate in the form of the kyl amendment which passed by wide margin49 in general the europeans oppose missions beyond europe fearing dilution of natos original purpose and voicing concern that nato might become the global instrument of the united states they prefer to confront such issues as terrorism and proliferation through political initiatives rather than military action the strategic concept ultimately reflected the europeans more guarded view of the alliances new missions to most european governments the kosovo conflict underscored that principal threats to security come from close at home in the form of instability in the balkans european governments joined allied force due to concern over instability and in response to the moral issue of stopping ethnic cleansing consensusbuilding while consensus over collective defense remains strong it is more difficult to achieve for missions such as crisis management defense secretary cohen has said that there was consensus in the alliance for anything more than an air campaign to contain ethnic cleansing in kosovo and that any effort to launch ground war would have led to fractious debate with possible loss of allied unity50 milosevics inability to split the allies in waging the air campaign was likely key factor in his governments decision to abandon the conflict from military perspective allied unity was clearly important for winning the war that unity allowed nato to stage most of its air strike missions from italy to send air support missions from hungary and to prevent russian forces from securing overflight rights into kosovo at the end of the war from states friendly to the alliance italian czech and hungarian leaders expressed early reservations about the conflict and greek public opinion remained critical of nato while supposition that cannot be proven it is possible should the air campaign have failed to achieve allied objectives that an absence of unity fostered by need to send ground forces under coalition of the willing would have seen countries such as italy deny the use of its air bases and greece the use of its ports both close to the area of operations further such opposition might have made more difficult natos effort to secure overflight rights from bulgaria and romania which proved of significan ce during allied force in missions short of collective defense involving combat forces consensus may prove difficult to achieve but if achieved its corresponding political effects could

early 1990s the europeans have sought imprimatur for nonarticle v missions the recent history of two world wars in which flimsy rationales were given for crossing borders has led the european allies to be extremely cautious in approaching issues that might require violation of another countrys sovereignty hence legitimization by the for military operation in sovereign country has been important to the allies in addition the is forum where nato countries may engage russia in matters of european security yet another interest of the allies the united states has opposed any requirement of approval for nonarticle v missions in part due to concern that russia or china might veto actions intended to protect critical allied interests the kosovo conflict saw the european allies step away from their insistence of approval for nonarticl v missions the french government for example strongly supported resolutions in the fall of 1998 condemning the frys violence against civilians in kosovo but reportedly concluded that returning to the security council at later point for endorsement of nato military action would have led to russian veto prime minister jospin in explaining the french decision to go to war in march 1999 said since the security council was not able to act we must act on our responsibilities similarly french parliamentary report after the conflict dismissed the as an old institution once useful in maintaining the cold war balance but now tied up by political maneuvering and bureaucratic delay the report gave its guarded approval to the political revolution allowing nato to intervene in sovereign country to prevent humanitarian catastrophe51 such sentiments were noticeable in several other key nato states at the same time an interest remains among the allies in securing involvement in international issues that may not require rapid response to crisis for example in the administration of postwar kosovo future missions while military action against the fry was unlikely without us leadership the kosovo conflict did signal that most european allies were willing to use their militaries on the continent to prevent humanitarian catastrophes such as ethnic cleansing however it remains unclear that there is consensus in the united states that engagement in kosovo was in the us interest increased discussion in europe of esdi is manifestation of the allies recognition that significant elements of us political leadership are hesitant about the use of american combat forces for such mission and that europeans must be prepared to act alone political result of the kosovo conflict may be that consensus in the alliance is strengthened over the need to develop combined joint task forces where coalition of the willing might borrow nato primarily us

allied force experts can only speculate over the lessons that potential adversaries are likely to draw from the outcome of operation allied force since the last chapter in kosovo and yugoslavia has not been written any current perceived lessons might not be the final ones nato is in transition and its future role is still being defined therefore natos performance is likely to have been watched with keen interest by potential adversaries the lessons drawn are important especially since other countries in the balkans europe and the world have volatile mixes of racial and ethnic groups living in uneasy coexistence the combination of ethnic tensions competing historical claims and grievances and economic problem s makes many countries and regions susceptible to potential strife that could severely undermine regional stability and international security one of natos seeming aims in yugoslavia was to discourage other potential perpetrators of ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity the alliance has achieved its primary objectives in yugoslavia ethnic cleansing has been reversed by natos military action yugoslavia has been forced to pay high price for the actions of the milosevic regime if the alliance had not prevailed in yugoslavia many observers believe that this would have seriously damaged its credibility with friends and foes alike if nato had failed to muster the political will to prevail over relatively small and weak opponent other potential adversaries might have calculated that nato would not act against future serious challenges natos success and the overwhelming condemnation and isolation of yugoslavia by the world community only china russia and india sought to block military action against milosevic could give pause to any regime that might be tempted to challenge significant nato interests especially any regime attracted to the notion of dealing with racial and ethnic problems along the milosevic lines potential adversaries may longer feel safe behind shield of sovereignty free to carry out any actions in violation of international norms inside their own borders nato took military action against yugoslavia without ever disputing its claim to sovereignty over kosovo thereby reinforcing an emerging consensus against viewing sovereignty as single overriding international principle potential adversaries are likely to be deterred by the fact that nato was able to agree on military action and maintain unity throughout the campaign despite different perspectives and interests among member nations and hesitancy by most tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30374crs26 prepared by paul gallisuse military force they are also likely to be impressed by natos ability and willingness to bring in massive air power once the decision was made however the deterrent effect of operation allied force is likely to be uneven the impact is likely to be greatest in and perhaps even limited to europe where nato is most willing and able to act natos success may make less of an impression in other parts of the world especially where significant us or allied interests are not perceived to be at stake the alliance has not acted in the face of humanitarian tragedies in africa and elsewhere and potential adversaries probably would not expect any different nato reaction as result of kosovo some potential adversaries might be encouraged by the difficulty that nato had in building the political consensus to act its hesitancy to escalate the war and its extreme reluctance to commit ground forces some countries might calculate that given the difficulty nato faced in carrying out the yugoslav operation the alliance would be even more reluctant than before to take military action outside of europe future adversaries may study the tactical successes milosevic gained because nato adopted tactics emphasizing casualty avoidance he was able to preserve yugoslav air defenses and to hide many other weapons systems they may wonder if milosevic could have used other asymmetric measures to weaken allied unity such as threatening attacks or the use of weapons of mass destruction against other nations finally the notion that the international community can take action against governments for their acts inside their own territory when they involve crimes against humanity are not universally shared russia china and india opposed natos action primarily on sovereignty grounds india actually used the example of yugoslavia as justification for its own decision to develop nuclear weapons some have suggested that natos action could be an impetus for nuclear and chemical warfare proliferation by other countries seeking to deter outside interference conclusion nato members clearly placed high priority on political unity in the effort to achieve the objectives of allied force political unity limited milosevics freedom of action put pressure on russias capricious leadership structure to accede to allied demands and helped to build network of support among nonallied states bordering yugoslavia at the same time the emphasis on preserving political unity meant that us military leaders could not fight the war in manner that would have followed us military doctrine in hopes of bringing about rapid resolution of the conflict nato fought the kosovo war as limited conflict in which measured objectives and operational restraint gave the adversary freedom to maneuver for timehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30374crs27 53freedman op cit heisbourg op citexploit openings destabilize neighboring countries and brutalize kosovos civilian population the allies fought for diversity of interests of greater importance to some than to others the moral issue of preventing then reversing humanitarian catastrophe was new interest at least in the sense of one prompting military action but it was limited interest one that did not seem to require to most allies the need to risk casualties by engaging ground forces or fighting the air war at lower altitudes for european allies concern over refugee flows and instability was also clearly an interest but again not one that demanded more than measured military response critics from within nato countries of the way the war was fought were troubled that the passion of allied rhetoric was not matched in their view by an intensity of military tactics and degree of risk some concluded that natos strategy and tactics allowed president clinton to engage the united states in conflict without clear preliminary support of congress and the american people53 natos decision to attack yugoslavia signalled that the allies would consider military action in response to governments violence against its own people most allies led by britain clearly longer regard claim of sovereignty as shield against military respons by other states this principle is far from universally accepted particularly in countries such as russia china and india that have restive populations within their territory and which demand approval for nato action potential adversaries were clearly put on guard by allied force while some adversaries may be deflected from aggressive action that challenges nato interests others especially states more powerful than yugoslavia may have gathered lessons of their own about how to weaken nato unity or to build on milosevics military tactics to protect forces or even be encouraged to obtain weapons able to deter the alliance states beyond the european region may be less intimidated by allied force the conflict left the allies with range of military needs and political challenges more clearly than before some allies acknowledged the need for more sophisticated weaponry and more mobile forces and even called for commitment to stronger european security and defense identity as an imperative to ensure greater burdensharing and to permit european military engagement in crises in which the united states might not wish to engage combat forceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30374
