secondary education act summary administered by the us department of education ed the impact aid program authorized by title viii of the elementary and secondary education act esea as amended by the child left behind act of 2001 nclb pl 107 110 is one of the oldest federal education programs dating from 1950 impact aid compensates local educational agencies leas for substantial and continuing financial burden resulting from federal activities these activities include federal ownership of certain lands as well as the enrollments in leas of children of parents who work or live on federal land eg children of parents in the military and children living on indian lands the federal government provides compensation because these activities deprive leas of the ability to collect property or other taxes from these individuals eg members of the armed forces living on military bases even though the leas are obligated to provide free public education to their children thus impact aid is intended to compensate leas for the resulting loss of tax revenue the program is explicitly authorized through fy2007 and was automatically extended for one additional year under the general education provisions act gepa the largest impact aid program is basic support payments for federally connected children section 8003b these are children who reside with parent who is member of the armed forces living on or off federal property reside with parent who is an accredited foreign military officer living on federal property reside on indian lands reside in lowrent public housing or reside with parent who is civilian working or living on federal land basic support payments are allocated directly to leas based on formula that uses weights assigned to different categories of federally connected children and cost factors to determine maximum payment amounts from fy1996 through fy2005 congress steadily increased appropriations for impact aid payments the fy2006 appropriation marked the first decrease in total funding since fy1996 fy2007 appropriations were levelfunded at the fy2006 level fy2008 appropriations provided slight increase in appropriations for the impact aid program

title viii authorizes several types of impact aid payments these include payments under section 8002 section 8003 section 8007 and section 80084 each of these types of payments is discussed briefly below section 8002 section 8002 compensates leas for the federal ownership of certain property to qualify for compensation the federal government must have acquired the property in general after 1938 and the assessed value of the land at the time it was acquired must have represented at least 10 of the assessed value of all an leas real property about 220 leas receive section 8002 payments annually5 payments are usually used by leas for general operating expenses eg teacher salaries books supplies and utilities6 in fy2007 payments ranged from 500 to 6 million7 section 8003 section 8003 compensates leas for enrolling federally connected children these are children who reside with parent who is member of the armed forces living on or off federal property reside with parent who is an

funds for emergency repairs and comprehensive capital improvements to 24 schools that ed currently owns but leas use to serve federally connected children14 two of the schools are located on closed military bases and operated by ed and the remaining facilities are operated by leas statutory language requires ed to transfer ownership of these facilities to leas or other entities15 in fy2007 emergency repairs were made to one school and two facilities were transferred recent appropriations appropriations for the impact aid program are made through the departments of labor health and human services and education appropriations acts appropriations to provide additional funding to leas serving significant numbers of military dependent students and federally connected children with severe disabilities have also been made available through the department of defense dod appropriations acts the dod appropriations however are substantially lower than those provided through lhhsed appropriations this section provides detailed information about impact aid funding provided through lhhsed appropriations and related funding made available through dod appropriations impact aid appropriations provided through the lhhsed appropriations table 1 details the most recent appropriations for impact aid fy2002 fy2008 as the table shows congress has generally increased appropriations for impact aid payments over this period the overall increase during this period has been 85 more specifically payments for federally connected children section 8003 rose by 118 from fy2002 to fy2008 with basic support payments section 14 since 1983 the department of defense dod has assumed funding responsibility for 46 other facilities located on domestic military bases these were formerly known as section 6 schools in reference to that section of pl 81874 since 1999 the number of schools for which ed is responsible has decreased from 53 to 22 for more information see ed fy2009 budget justifications 15 ed plans to transfer the two schools located on the closed military bases to the dod or to local school authorities whichever is appropriate based on the communities plans for redevelopment in the past however environmental problems have been identified at similar facilities and the military branch that owned the land refused to accept the facilities until the problems were corrected many of the 22 facilities operated by leas are deteriorating overcrowded or fail to meet building standards most leas will not assume ownership of the facilities unless ed provides funding for needed repairs the estimated costs of repairs and renovations for all 24 schools is approximately 48 million ed fy2009 budget justifications crs5 8003b rising by 125 123 million16 payments for federal property section 8002 experienced the largest percentage increase of any impact aid payment over this time period at 167 but the dollar increase in funding was less than 10 million payments for facilities maintenance and construction decreased from fy2002 to fy2008 by 392 and 635 respectively further examination of table 1 shows that payments for federally connected children section 8003 accounted for more than 90 of impact aid appropriations in fy2007 moreover the basic support payments section 8003b alone accounted for 891 of the appropriations in comparison payments for federal property accounted for 52 payments for construction accounted for 14 and payments for facilities maintenance accounted for less than 05 of appropriations for this reason this report includes detailed discussion of the section 8003b basic support payments for federally connected children from fy2007 to fy2008 appropriations for the overall impact aid program increased by 123 million or 10 at the individual payment level however only the basic support payment received an increase in funding for fy2008 the increase for basic support payments was 137 million or 13 this increase was able to exceed the overall program increase because all of the other impact aid payments were actually decreased by amounts ranging from 86000 for facilities maintenance to 864000 for children with disabilities for fy2009 the presidents budget request would continue to fund the impact aid program at its fy2008 level of 12 billion each of the specific impact aid payments would remain at their fy2008 levels with basic support payments continuing to receive 11 billion unlike many other federal education programs the impact aid program is not forwardfunded meaning that the earliest appropriations could be made available to leas is the first day of the fiscal year education programs that are forwardfunded generally have funds made available for 15month period starting nine months into fiscal year for example for forwardfunded programs fy2008 funds became available on july 1 2008 and will remain available through september 30 2009 on the other hand current funded programs including impact aid have funds available for the 12month fiscal year that is funds become available on october 1 of given year and remain available through september 30 of the following year 16 some of this increase is due to the incorporation of payments for certain heavily impacted leas previously funded under section 8003f into the appropriation for section 8003b payments crs6 table 1 impact

through department of defense appropriations in addition to appropriations made available through lhhsed appropriations funds have been appropriated through the department of defense dod to provide additional assistance to leas17 in recent years dod appropriations have provided additional funding for leas serving significant numbers of military dependent students the funds are provided to eligible leas if without the additional funding an lea would be unable to provide students with level of education equivalent to the minimum level of education available in the schools of other leas in the state18 leas are eligible for assistance if at least 20 of their students in average daily attendance during the preceding school year were military dependent students counted under section 8003a1 of esea title viii for fy2006 30 million was appropriated for this purpose for fy2007 appropriations were increased to 35 million for fy2008 appropriations were reduced to 30 million19 dod appropriations also include funding for children with severe disabilities to assist leas in providing such children with free appropriate public education the floyd d spence national defense authorization act for fy2001 pl 106398 authorized payments for this purpose beginning in fy2002 an lea may receive funding for this purpose if it serves at least two severely disabled students who are military dependent students section 8003a1b or di or who have parent who is foreign military officer section 8003a1aii or dii payments may only be made on behalf of children with severe disabilities whose cost of educational and related services does not exceed 1 the lesser of five times the national or state average perpupil expenditure for child who receives services in program outside of the boundaries of the lea that pays for the services or 2 three times the state 17 dod fy2006 fy2007 and fy2008 appropriations also provided support for leas experiencing changes in enrollment due to dods global rebasing plan the official creation or activation of one or more new military units the realignment of forces as result of base realignment and closure brac actions or change in the number of housing units on military installation for example for fy2008 10 million was provided for this purpose for more information on this funding see crs report rl33137 military base closures and the impact aid program for education by rebecca r skinner 18 the determination of whether an lea is able to provide students with at least the minimum level of education available in schools in other leas in the state is made by the secretary of defense in consultation with the secretary of education 19 each fiscal year congress generally passes dod appropriations act and an authorization act the dod authorization acts generally authorize funding for additional funding to leas serving military children additional impact aid for children with severe disabilities and special assistance to leas in broad statutory language that provides funding for operation and maintenance expenses defensewide these acts provide substantially more information about funding requirements than the dod appropriations acts as appropriations for the relevant programs are consolidated with funding for other activities for more information about dod fy2006 appropriations and authorizations see pl 109 148 and pl 109163 respectively for more information about dod fy2007 appropriations and authorizations see pl 109289 and pl 109364 respectively for more information about dod fy2008 appropriations and authorizations see pl 110116 and pl 110181 respectively crs8 average perpupil expenditure for child receiving services through program offered by the lea or provided within the boundaries of the lea the payment provided to an lea for each child with severe disabilities is based on the expenditures made by the lea on behalf of the child that is in excess of the average perpupil expenditure in the state in which the lea is located less the sum of funds received by the lea from the state to defray the costs of educational and related services for the child under the individuals with disabilities education act idea to defray the costs of services for the child and from any other source to defray the costs of services for the child provided specifically because the child has severe disabling condition if the amount of funds appropriated is insufficient to pay the full amount for all eligible leas the secretary of defense is required to ratably reduce payments to all eligible leas by an equal percentage fy2006 fy2007 and fy2008 dod appropriations have each contained 5 million to aid children with severe disabilities20 payment for federal property section 8002 under current law leas may receive payment under this section if they can demonstrate among other things that the federal government has acquired property in the lea since 1938 and the property had an assessed value at the time it was acquired of at least 10 or more of 1 all the real property in the lea at the time the federal property was acquired or 2 the greater of all real property as assessed in the first year preceding or succeeding the acquisition of the property if the property was not assessed at the time it was acquired and state law requires an assessment of property acquired in practice making these determinations may be difficult if the transaction occurred several decades ago the maximum payment an lea is eligible to receive for fiscal year is determined by applying the current real property tax rate for current expenditures levied by fiscally independent leas or imputed real property tax rate for fiscally dependent leas to the current annually determined assessed value of the federal property the assessed value of the federal property is determined of the basis of the highest and best use of property adjacent to the federal property this value must be determined by the local official responsible for assessing the value of real property 20 for more information about dod fy2006 appropriations and authorizations see pl 109148 and pl 109163 respectively for more information

respectively crs9 in the jurisdiction in which the lea is located for the purpose of levying property tax under current law two types of payments are made under section 8002 payments for prefy1995 recipients referred to as foundation payments and payments for fy1995 recipients pre1995 recipients receive grants equal to 38 of the leas maximum entitlement amount for fy1994 if funds are not sufficient to make these grants the grants are ratably reduced if funds remain after providing the foundation payments to the pre1995 recipients leas that received payment for fy1995 or leas determined to have filed their applications in timely manner to receive payments in subsequent years receive proportional share of the funds determined by subtracting the amount used for foundation payments for prefy1995 recipients from the total fy1995 appropriation for section 8002 if funds still remain available after making these payments the remaining funds are distributed among prefy1995 recipients and fy1995 recipients based on two proportional share formulas 25 of the remaining funds is distributed to leas that received foundation payments and 75 is distributed to all leas the 25 of funds is provided to leas based on the proportion that each leas foundation payment was of all foundation payments made the 75 is distributed based on the proportion that each leas maximum payment was of all maximum payments under current law an lea that was eligible for section 8002 payments prior to the 2000 reauthorization of impact aid law was eligible to receive payment only if it submitted an application for payment within seven years of the date of enactment of the impact aid reauthorization act of 2000 similar sevenyear time limit is placed on leas with other federal property that had property acquired by the federal government prior to the 2000 reauthorization leas that became eligible for section 8002 payments after the 2000 reauthorization have seven years from the date of acquisition to apply for section 8002 payment basic support payments section 8003b section 8003b authorizes payments to leas to compensate them for the cost of serving certain groups of federally connected children the presence of these children can both increase the number of children the lea must serve and decrease taxes that support public education as previously discussed federally connected children include children of parents in the military children living on indian lands children of civilian federal employees and children living in lowrent housing to be eligible for 8003b payments an lea must have at least 400 federally connected children or such children must represent at least 3 of an leas average daily attendance ada21 of the more than 14000 leas nationwide 1261 leas meet 21 in addition to receive payments for children of parents employed but not residing on federal property or certain children residing on federal property an lea must serve 1000 or more of such children or such children must represent at least 10 of the leas total ada crs10 one of these eligibility criteria22 thus fewer than 10 of all public school districts qualify for section 8003b payments the impact aid basic support grants formula for section 8003b has several components as follows leas provide ed with counts of various types of federally connected children weights are applied to each count with the intention of reflecting differences in tax revenues lost and educational costs cost factor or local contribution rate lcr basically per pupil expenditure amount is determined for each lea maximum grants are calculated by multiplying the weighted child count by the lcr actual payments are reduced if appropriations are insufficient as they currently are to make maximum grant payments types of federally connected children and their formula weights table 2 shows the categories of federally connected children and the weights that the act assigns to them as table 2 shows children residing on indian lands receive the highest weight the next highest weight is given to children who live on federal land23 and whose parents are employed on federal land are members of the armed forces or are accredited foreign military officers these relatively highly weighted children including children living on indian lands are sometimes known by shorthand designation as 3a or just children which is reference to subsection of the previous impact aid statute pl 81874 although longer relevant to the current law this shorthand designation is still widely used and will be used in this report those receiving much lower weights are children with parent in the military living off the base children residing in lowrent public housing children living on federal land but whose parents do not work on federal land and children whose parents work on federal land but do not live on federal land 22 ed fy2007 budget justifications 23 see section 80135 for definition of federal land crs11 these children receiving lower weights are sometimes known as 3b or just b children which again refers to subsection of the previous impact aid statute pl 81874 although longer relevant to the current law this shorthand designation is still widely used and will be used in this report according to ed b children create lesser but significant burden on leas than the burden created by children24 table 2 types of federally connected children and weights assigned to them in the impact aid basic support payments formula section 8003a1 shorthand children attending school in the lea who weight designation reside on federal property with parent employed on 10 children federal property situated in whole or in part within the boundaries of the lea ai reside on federal property with parent who is an official 10 children of and accredited by foreign government and is foreign military officer aii reside on federal property and have parent on active duty 10 children in

lea is located or in whole or in part in such lea if such lea is located in more than one county gi or if not in such county in whole or in part in the same state as such lea gii note uniformed services is defined in 37 usc 101 to include the army navy air force and marines as well as the coast guard national oceanic and atmospheric administration and public health service 24 ed fy2007 budget justifications crs12 to illustrate how the first part of the formula works suppose that school district has 200 students whose parents are in the military and live on the base 100 students who live on indian lands and 300 students whose parents are in the military but live off the base the school districts weighted student count would be 200 militaryon base 100 200 100 on indian lands 125 125 300 militaryoff base 020 60 600 total but under the formula 385 thus this hypothetical district has 600 federally connected children but for the purposes of the formula the weighted count of these children is 385 local contribution rate and maximum payments next the weighted student count or weighted student units is multiplied by cost factor or lcr which is the greatest of onehalf of the state average perpupil expenditure appe onehalf of the national appe the previously determined lcr for comparable districts with unusual circumstances such as those serving particularly large number of disabled children or the state appe times the local contribution percentage ie the percentage of educational revenues that come from the local level25 thus the lcr may vary from lea to lea even within the same states the weighted student total is multiplied by whichever of these amounts is greatest for given lea suppose for our hypothetical example that onehalf the national appe was the highest amount and it is estimated at 4000 the maximum basic support payment for our hypothetical school district would be 4000 385 1540000 reduction due to insufficient appropriations providing maximum payments to all eligible leas in fy2007 would require approximately 178 billion26 since section 8003b appropriations are well below this full funding amount statutory language provides mechanism for reducing payments to leas the general principle is that more heavily impacted districts ie those more dependent on impact aid payments receive higher percentages of their maximum payments than less impacted districts this principle is achieved by calculating learning opportunity threshold lot payment this is percentage of the maximum payment determined by adding 25 this alternative would be used in states in which local funds account for more than one half of the appe 26 ed fy2007 budget justifications crs13 the percentage of an leas average daily attendance that is composed of federally connected children and the percentage of an leas total current expenditure that is composed of section 8003 payments27 this total percentage must not exceed 100 this percentage is multiplied by the maximum payment to produce the lot payment if in our hypothetical lea federally connected children account for 20 of all children in average daily attendance and impact aid funds are 30 of the leas current expenditures then the lot percentage would be 50 and the lot payment would be 50 of 1540000 or 770000 if current appropriations were not sufficient to make all lot payments only percent of the lot payment would be made in recent years however appropriations have been sufficient to provide all leas with more than 100 of their lot payments the statute provides that funds in excess of what is needed to provide all leas with 100 of their lot payment be distributed in proportion to leas lot payments however lea may receive payment in excess of its maximum support payment this provision gives priority for additional funding to leas with higher lot payments that is priority for funding goes to leas that are more affected or impacted by federally connected children or more dependent on impact aid as revenue source returning to our hypothetical example if funds were sufficient to pay 125 of lot the lea would receive 50 125 or 625 of its maximum basic support payment that is the lea would receive 625 of 1540000 or 962500 heavily impacted leas in addition to the socalled regular impact aid leas certain leas are specifically classified as heavily impacted section 8003b2 in general there are two classifications of these leas 1 those that received heavily impacted payments in fy2000 referred to as continuing heavily impacted leas and 2 those that were not eligible to receive such payment until fy2002 or later new heavily impacted leas with certain exceptions eligibility is based on the leas percentage of total ada composed of federally connected children and the leas tax rate for example most continuing heavily impacted leas must have at least 35 of the ada composed of federally connected children and have tax rate that is at least 95 of their states average tax rate or have at least 30 of their ada composed of federally connected children and have tax rate that is at least 125 of the average tax rate of comparable leas in their state in fy2006 28 leas received payments as heavily impacted leas table 3 provides list of these leas and the states in which they are located 27 payments for certain heavily impacted leas section 8002b2 are excluded from the

prepared by crs based on data provided by the us department of education budget service crs15 calculations for these leas payments differ in three ways from calculations for regular impact aid leas first weights for certain classifications of federally connected children are greater for some heavily impacted leas for example leas that qualify as heavily impacted and have 100 or fewer federally connected children have their entire count of federally connected children weighted at 175 as opposed to using the weights depicted in table 2 second the maximum basic support payment for most heavily impacted leas is based on 80 rather than 50 of the state or national appe whichever one is higher finally given sufficient funds the lot percentage for these leas is 100 that is they receive 100 of their maximum support payment if funds are sufficient to provide these amounts as result of these provisions the 28 heavily impacted leas received about 230 million or about 20 of the total funding for basic support grants under section 8003b in fy2006 in terms of per student payments these 28 leas receive over 4 times the amount per child as regular impact aid leas28 for the 9 largest heavily impacted leas their average per child payments are 10 times higher than the average payment per child received by the regular impact aid leas use of impact aid section 8003b payments impact aid payments differ from funds provided by other federal elementary and secondary education programs impact aid funds provided under section 8003 are not limited to specified uses such as improving the educational achievement of disadvantaged students while funds are generally used for current local education expenditures29 they may also be used for capital expenditures30 in addition except for funds distributed based on disabled students section 8003d impact aid funds need not be spent just on federally connected children finally because impact aid payments are not aimed at specific educational goals accountability requirements for the use of funds or for specific outcomes are minimal payments for children with disabilities section 8003d in addition to basic support payments section 8003 authorizes payments to leas serving certain federally connected children who are eligible to receive services under the individuals with disabilities education act idea payments are limited to certain federally connected ideaeligible children those children whose parents are members of the armed forces residing on or off military bases and 28 ed fy2007 budget justifications 29 current local education expenditures means expenditures for free public education such as expenditures for administration instruction attendance and health services transportation and operation and maintenance of plant these may be contrasted with capital expenditures for construction and related debt service 30 us department of education impact aid section 8003 payments for federally connected students frequently asked questions available at httpwwwedgov programs8003faqhtml crs16 those residing on indian lands ed determines weighted child counts by multiplying more heavily weighted eligible children ie children with disabilities of military parents living on base and children with disabilities living on indian lands by 10 and lower weighted children ie children with disabilities of military parents living off base by 05 an leas payment is simply its percentage share of the total weighted child count multiplied by the funds appropriated for section 8003d unlike basic support payments leas receiving 8003d payments must use the funds to meet the needs of the federally connected children with disabilities for whom they received the payments in addition the funds must be used to provide free appropriate public education to these children in accordance with the provisions of idea construction section 8007 section 8007 provides funds for construction and facilities upgrading to certain leas with high percentages of children living on indian lands or children of military parents these funds are used to make formula and competitive grants under the statute 40 of the funds appropriated under section 8007 are used to make construction payments by formula to leas receiving section 8003 payments and in which students living on indian land constituted at least 50 of the leas total student enrollment or military students living on or off base constitute at least 50 of the leas total student enrollment the funds available for construction payments are divided equally between these two groups of leas 20 of the total section 8007 appropriation going to each group grants for leas impacted by military dependent students are determined by dividing the total amount of available funding by the total number of weighted student units of military children living on or off base across all eligible leas and multiplying this result by the total number of weighted student units of these children enrolled in an lea the same calculation is made for leas impacted by children living on indian lands the remaining 60 of section 8007 appropriations are used to make school facility emergency and modernization competitive grants emergency repair grants must be used to repair renovate or alter k12 public school facility to ensure the health and safety of students and staff modernization grants may be used to relieve overcrowding or upgrade facilities to support contemporary educational program31 emergency grants are given higher priority than modernization grants due to this directive and possibly due to limited appropriations for the past four grant competitions only emergency grants have been awarded32 in addition to other requirements an lea is only eligible to receive competitive grant under section 8007 if it receives payment under section 8003 and 31 us department of education purpose of the impact aid section 8007b discretionary construction

students living on indian land or military students living on or off base constitute at least 40 of the leas total student enrollment an lea is also eligible to receive modernization construction grant if the lea is eligible for grant under section 8002 and meets specific requirements related to bond indebtedness and assessed value of real property during the two most recent award cycles fy20042005 and fy20052006 21 of 22 grants have been awarded to leas serving students living on indian land33 state consideration of payments in providing state aid section 8009 state school finance equalization programs seek to increase educational equity by structuring state school finance formulas to take into account local capacity to raise educational revenue an equalization formula would compensate leas to reduce discrepancies in appe or ability to raise revenues for public k12 education throughout the state with one exception state school finance formulas are not permitted to take into account funds leas receive from impact aid the one exception to this prohibition which is contained in section 8009 of the impact aid statute involves state equalization program that is approved by the secretary if states program is approved the state may consider as local funds for the purpose of equalizing educational expenditures some or all of an leas impact aid funding currently alaska kansas and new mexico have approved state equalization programs the statute specifies the criteria the secretary must use to evaluate states equalization program the general principle is that the secretary must find that the state program results in discrepancy between those leas with the highest appe and those with the lowest excluding the appes of the top and bottom 5 of leas that is more than 2534 the appendix to the regulations related to section 8009 provides several examples of the application of this test the following is an example for determining whether spending disparity is 25 or less in state x after ranking all leas organized on grade 912 basis in order of the expenditures per pupil for the fiscal year in question it is ascertained by counting the number of pupils in attendance in those agencies in ascending order of expenditure that the 5th percentile of student population is reached at lea with per pupil expenditure of 820 and that the 95th percentile of student population is reached at lea b with per pupil expenditure of 1000 the 33 ibid 34 the secretary must also consider the extent to which the state program takes into account the additional cost of providing free public education in specific leas such as those that are geographically isolated or to specific types of students such as children with disabilities crs18 percentage disparity between the 95th and 5th percentile leas is 22 percent 1000820 18082035 that is after leas are ranked based on expenditures ed identifies the leas with the highest expenditures that collectively enroll 5 of the student population this process is repeated for the leas with the lowest expenditures thus ed currently implements this provision based on both lea expenditures and student enrollment in the leas with the highest and lowest expenditures two leas in new mexico zuni and gallupmckinley recently sued ed over the implementation of the equalization formula36 the leas argued that ed should identify the 5 of leas with the highest and lowest appe based on expenditures only with consideration given to student enrollment doing so they argued would only have enabled ed to eliminate 10 leas rather than 23 of the states 89 leas from consideration in determining whether the remaining leas met the 25 spending disparity requirement if implemented based on expenditures only the leas noted that new mexico would not have qualified as an equalized state the case went to the supreme court which ruled that the procedures used by ed to determine whether educational expenditures were equalized across leas were appropriate37 35 34 cfr pt 222 subpt k app 1 example 36 education week supreme court backs ed depts interpretation of impact aid act april 25 2007 37 zuni public school district 89 v
