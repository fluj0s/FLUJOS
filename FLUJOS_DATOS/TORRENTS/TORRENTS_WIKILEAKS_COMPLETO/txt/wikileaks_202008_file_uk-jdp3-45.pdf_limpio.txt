content of jdp 3451 media operations is set at the joint tactics techniques and procedures jttps leve l and is aimed at those responsible for media operations media ops specifica lly the commander media adviser the media spokesman and the media ops staff this publication is promulgated in advance of joint influence doctrine which remains under development and supersedes jwp 345 media operations it will be useful to mod media officials permanent joint headquarters pjhq and front line commands flcs media ops and down through the component media ops staffs to units although the document holds relevance for all servic personnel who might encounter the media in the course of their duties on operations it is the key document in the delivery of media ops doctrine in the joint environment and expl ains the ends ways and means of media ops jdp 3451 should be in r ead in conjunction with jwp 380 information operations 3 and the mod green book4 2 context key tenet of the comprehensive approach is that all her majestys government hmg departments must act in coordinated fashion to achieve the governments strategic aim critical to this is the mainte nance of political and popular support for hmgs strategic obj ectives and any military activity in support of it the mod working with other gov ernment departments ogds achieves this through the information strategy info strategy dynami c and coordinated matr ix of themes and messages targeted at specific audiences us ing all communications channels media ops are considered key enab ler in the promulgation of the themes and messages that emanate from the info strategy within the mod media ops the ways are delivered at the strategic level thro ugh the director general media and communication dgmc at the operationa l level by pjhq and at theatre level through the joint task force headquarters jtfhq and the compone nt headquarters the media is key body the means by which opinion is shaped with theatre national and international udiences and is therefore consideration during the prosecution of military operations it suppor ts joint action therefore commanders at all levels must seek to engage with the media to convey their key messages and themes and to support the wider info strategy 3 structure jdp 3451 comprises five chapters chapter 1 chapter 1 explains the need for an info strategy and where media ops is placed within the wider cont ext of defence it explains why the 3 review of jwp 380 information operations resulted in decision by the uk to adopt nato doctrine developed under the auspices of ajp 310 allied joint doctrine for information operations where uk policy diverges from that of nato this will be reflected in national section under the same cover green pages 4 mod working arrangements with the media for use throughout the full spectrum of military operations jdp 3451 vi uk conducts media ops and the principl and factors that determine the importance of media ops in supporting the commanders intent b chapter 2 chapter 2 sets out to define the target audiences of media ops by breaking them down into 5 categories c chapter 3 chapter 3 details the char acteristics of the media as profession it explains the commercia l interests and imperatives behind the actions of journalists and provides analysis of the different forms of media that can be used d chapter 4 chapter 4 discusses the pla nning and execution of media ops at the strategic level it explains the crossgovernment info strategy and the interaction of media ops and informati on operations info ops the chapter includes the external relationships th at the mod has with other government departments ogds and nongovernmental organisations ngos it details the progression of information directiv from the government through mod and down to the operational level chapter 5 chapter 5 sets out the mech anisms for the planning and execution of media ops at the operational vel it concentrates on the delivery of media ops and focuses on the part played by pjhq and the jtfhq in the delivery of media ops at the operational level in the joint operations area joa it explains the interactions of the media ops staff and the commanders and the tasks and responsibilities of the various staff appointments 4 assumptions for the purpose of this publication deployed operational headquarters will be referred to as the jtfhq although it is acc epted that it could in combined operation be the national contingent commanders headquarters ncchq similarly the ployed force commander will be referred to as the joint task force commander jtfc although th commander may we ll be the national contingent commander ncc 5 allied doctrine mc 457 is the endorsed nato policy on public information p info however the uk

conflict is becoming increasingl complex interstate conflicts fought by national forces within defined and often geographically contiguous area such as the gulf war are largely being re placed by intrastate conflicts or asymmetric attacks by transnational groups these usually involve wide variety of actors and parties often in loose or ad hoc alliances frequently operating outside the geographic area in dispute or even gl obally the causes of these c onflicts are equally complex religion ethnicity politics poverty and perceived oppression are among the many factors behind them military action alone cannot resolve such situations but it can set the conditions for resolution by other actors therefore there is need for coherent activity crossgovernment approach from all instruments of national power of which the military is but one and where possible with concerned international organisations io 102 the impact of the media 1 virtually all crises are conducted under the spotlight of the media international dia reach has increased this has been brought about by advances in technology in radio and television such as satellite broadcasting by the increasingly porous natu re of international borders and by the availability of relatively cheap printing or copying equipment that has brought newspapers and other printe d material to much wide r audience many people now have the ability to access information directly via the internet and without necessarily knowing its pedigree and source place consider able credence on it this is particularly so in societies without free press the in ternet can be used to spread or circulate information and opinion including rumour with speed inconceivable few years ago all this reinforces the need for proactive information stance with global reach consequently there is need to be proactive in ensu ring that the presentation of our actions is positive accurate and credib whilst at the same time countering the adversarys2 or detractors attempts to undermine public support 103 information strategy 3 consequent to the sp read of media access and technology vital aspect of the uks cohere nt crossgovernment response to crisis will be the proactive presentation of governme nt activity in the form of an information strategy info strategy it is essential that the government seizes the initiative with respect to information sends clear stra tegic messages mainta ins public confidence 1 the media is defined as the means of mass communication print radio television and internet 2 throughout this publication the term adversary includes potential as well as actual adversary 3 the information strategy was previously known as the information campaign the use of the term information strategy is aligned with current nato practice and recogni ses that doctrinally there can and should only be one campaign plan the information st rategy is an integral part of the strategic plan which informs and is informed by the commanders campaign plan see footnote 11 to ddcdscpolicy papersinfo ops information operations policy update dated 17 feb 06 jdp 3451 12 and vitally is seen as being in control if not of events then at the very least of the uks response to those events the info strategy recognises that all activity has an effect from which deductions are drawn and actions determined by friendly and adversary audiences it ensures that th message put out by all parts of the uk government is the intended ssage the message most likel to lead to the adoption of the preferred courses of action coa s by the targeted audiences the info strategy incorporates both the management of information in the form of audiences themes and messages as well as specific actions conducted with the intention of promoting desired message ends ways and means section ii definitions 104 the info strategy is defined as information activity coordinated ac ross government that influences decisions opinions and outcomes in order to support the national strategic aim and associated policy objectives4 105 the aim of the info strategy is to secure popular and political s upport for the uks policy objectives within the info strategy information operations info ops are defined as coordinated military activity undertaken to affect decisionmakers in support of political and military obj ectives by influencing their will attacking their decisionmaking processes and shaping their understanding while protecting our own 5 106 joint action is defined as the deliberate use and orchestration of the full range of military capabilities and activities to realise effects 6 its aim as conceptual frame work is to aid the synchronisation of mutually supporting influence activities and fires in order to affect will understanding and capability of groups and where necessary specific indivi duals in order to reach desired outcome in particular situation 107 media operations media ops are defined as 4

within the operational environment whilst maintaining operations security 7 108 the aim of media ops is to provide factual information to number of audiences via the media to support the aims of the uk information strategy 109 the main effort of media ops in any military operation is to communicate the principal themes and messages to the appropriate audiences in pursuit of the desired effect whilst remaining sensitive to media intere sts this is an integral part of any military operation media ops are primarily focused on the need to maintain public and political support and henc freedom of action and ma noeuvre media ops will have an influence on adversarie s allies and neutrals and it is therefore essential that media ops staff and info ops staff work cl osely together to ensure that the right message is put across to the right audiences this is particularly important with respect to local and regional media within the joint operations area joa and to other media sources that are influential within the joa medi ops emphasise the benefits of positive and proactive approach rather than defensive and reactive one to avoid giving the impression that the dia are being manipulated in any way distinction must be maintained between info ops and media ops they are distinct but closely related activities section iii media operations factors 110 public and political support military operations undertaken by nations in pursuit of their national and international interest pend on public and political support for their success co mmanders at all levels should contribute to building and sustaining this support through positive ngagement and effective media handling for number of related reasons deployed forces must continually demonstrate their accountability to their democratically elected governments b public support from the uk audi ence enhances commanders freedom of action making him less vulnerable to external inte rference and overly restrictive rules of engagement roe support from international and regional audiences tends to enhance fr eedom of manoeuvre through consent 7 jwp 0011 uk glossary of joint and multinational terms and definitions 7th edition jdp 3451 14 c positive media coverage of deployed military opera tions sustains morale and promotes an image of the armed fo rces as relevant professional and valued by the nation d public support assists in maintain ing cohesion between allies andor coalition partners positive portrayal of the military particularly when operational success is achieved supports the longert erm justification for resources as well as aids recruiting and retention f to provide rebuttal of inaccurate or untrue stories 111 strategic operational and tactical levels the divisions between strategic operational and tactical levels are becoming increasingly blurred through the media spotlight minor tactical events can escalate to have strategic ef fect and generate need for strategic leaders such as governme nt ministers to respond quickly clear command and control structures wellunders tood areas of delegated responsibility and effective militarymedia relations are required at all levels on occasions in order to get tactical details straight to the strategi c level and vice versa without delay it may be necessary to short circuit the primary co mmand and control channe ls for the flow of information when this ccurs immediate efforts will be required to bring all those circumvented up to date section iv media operations principles 112 the military approach to the media while it is important that the media is encouraged to develop an understanding of the military and military operations direct control of the media output should not be ttempted the media should not be overtly exploited and similarly wholly prot ective approach would undoubtedly be considered as defensive the media comprises many elem ents each with different agendas and requirements some will be generally supportive of the military others will not some may be supportive of the milit ary but wish to expose any flaws in its political leadership an understanding of the characteristics of the media is important for everyone involved in military operations it is essential that media ops staff treat all media evenhandedly 113 all communications with the media must be properly authorised in addition media ops staff and those service personne l who encounter the media in the normal course of their duties should be awar of the key media ops principles force protectionoperations security as far as possible information released to the media must not provide anything of value to the adversary particularly where it may put lives at risk and must comply with mod jdp 3451 15 information release policies8 when specifically requested by the media information cleared for release should not be classified or otherwise withheld purely to protect the force from criticis m or embarrassment notwithstanding the requirement closely to preser ve operations security opsec occasionally it might be advantageous fo r the benefit of accurate reporting to allow the media to be taken into conf idence and for future intentions and operations to be revealed in advance but with release time limitation b focus on the desired effect as key element of the wider info strategy media ops should derive its objectives from the strategic aim of campaign or operation accordingly dia ops are an integral part of the joint task force comma nders jtfc campaign plan and support the achievement of campaign success c effectsbased media operations the media is another dimension of the operating environment and in comm on with other aspects of military operations the planning and conduct of media ops must remain focussed upon the overall effects to be achieved it is info strategy outcomes not specific media outputs such as individual artic or broadcast pieces that are important in achieving the overall effect media ops strive to ensure that all media reporting is balanced and accura rather than measuring success by comparing the amount of g ood news and bad news d truth all communication with the media must be truthful deliberately misleading the media must be avoided matte r how tempting or tactically advantageous it may appear credibility media ops staff must be cr edible both with the military and the media those working directly with the media should not be double hatted particularly with the info ops function9 media ops staff should think positively and be proactive they shoul d be candid avoid jargon and treat the media with respect f timeliness the globalisation of communications and the accelerating demand for information have turned newsgathering by the media into an unrelenting 24hour activity commanders and their staff must expect the media to be omnipresent and demanding on operations media interest in an operation is likely to be intense at the outset and thereafter when there are step changes in the tempo of operations accordingly media ops staff should engage with the media at the earliest opportunity they must be prepared to react swiftly to breaking news and mainta in mechanisms to verify correct and 8 see paragraph 411 9 including psychological operations psyops staffs that plan psychological activities designed to influence attitudes and behaviour affecting the achievement of political and military objectives jdp 3451 16 rebut stories as well as to pass news worthy information to all levels of command as soon as possible g preparation the conduct of media ops i nvolves building relationships with journalists and within staff orga nisations consultation with commanders and conducting training exercises so that those involved are fully prepared in advance of any deployment strong relationships are re quired to cope with the inevitable tensions that will occur on operations the effective conduct of media ops therefore requires expe rienced personnel proper training involvement in the pla nning process and trust h openness key function of media ops is to explain in clear unambiguous terms the military perspectiv of an operation what may seem obvious to the military may appear confus ing or even arcane to many members of the public and the media positive engagement with the media at all levels is key to setting the context of operati ons events and issues the media ops plan as part of the wider info stra tegy should contain clear objectives and messages list target audi ences and the means by whic h these audiences should be reached every media ops plan s hould take account of the language and culture of the respective target audien ces including particularly the host nation population and any minorities xperience has shown that an ability to address these audiences in their nativ tongues as well as being sensitive to cultural aspects is highly beneficial proactive approach will mitigate the longerterm effects of adverse news nd place events in the wider context i countering disinformation during military operations it must be assumed that adversaries will use disi nformation to attempt to undermine the will and cohesion of the deployed for ce and widen public support for their own cause media ops staff must estab lish effective credible and timely rebuttal procedures to counter the effe cts of inaccurate and unbalanced media stories jdp 3451 21 chapter 2 the audience 201 the aim of media ops ways is to provide information to number of audiences ends via the media means in support of the aims of the uk info strategy successful media ops convey accura and timely information as well as the right message to the right udiences it must be appreci ated that audiences are not homogenous and their opinions will vary depending on the nature of their location political preferences culture and ethnicity as well as on the operation what is considered priority audi ence may differ between mod the operational commander and the tactical commander and the media itself in effect audiences can be categorised in 5 distinct groups that each require specific media ops actions uk audiences secure and maintain domestic political and public support b international audiences secure and maintain wider international support c joint operations area regional audiences secure and maintain regional support d joint operations area local audiences secure and maintain local support internal audiences maintain force morale 202 in broad terms the uk audience comprises the domestic audience at the strategic level the uk population is usually considered to be the principa l target audience for uk media ops and comprises number of overlapping bsets across the spectrum of uk society however the most influen tial target audience for media ops to address is fairly limited group of pe ople who hold disproportionate influence on the direction of government and pub lic thinking and policy development this group comprises politicians and st atesmen members of thinktanks and professional bodies special political advisers newspaper columnists academics analysts and journalists who are increasingly voicing opinions on current affairs issues nevertheless the impact of general public opinion on political decision making shoul d never be underestimated b the dependant audience critical subset is the dependant audience which consists of families partners service personnel civil servants colleagues and friends even though they may not be involved directly in an operation they are likely to take mo re intense interest in and probably be more affected by events than the ge neral uk population families are key jdp 3451 22 audience for media ops they have di rect effect on th morale of the deployed force while th chain of command will at tempt to keep dependants fully informed the reality is that tv news and the print media are major source of information for many service families it must be borne in mind that the uk dependant audience is relativel small in terms of size and media influence 203 the international audience comprises the coalition audience the uk is unlikely to conduct mediumscale warfighting operations without coalition of allies and partners success may well depend on continuing political support among friendly audiences abroad which will necessarily form key target audience for the info strategy indeed it is usually the case that th strategic centre of gravity for such operations is the cohesion of the alliancecoalition b the wider intern ational audience the ubiquity of modern media means that groups within the wider audience are likely to have access to many of the same sources of news and information as the home or adversary audiences via satellite and internet this will also be true of neutral third parties who may be relevant to an operation for peace support operations pso or smallscale operations where the uk is the sole participant support from the wider international community will continue to be important 204 joint operations area regional audiences at the operational level the regional population is usually considered to be the principal audience for uk media ops the regional audience tends to incl ude the principal tactical level audience operational regional audiences depending on the nature of the operation the audience in countries ne ighbouring the joint operations area joa could be considered either as the adversarys allies or part of the coalition audience or the wider interna tional audience therefore careful consideration must be given to the medi output that will reach this audience b other audiences within the region there w ill be countries or sections of population that are not aligned to any of the factions involved this group will be watching listening and reading media product that conveys both sides of the story and whether it is intenti onal or not their opinions will be based largely on what the media produces ther efore it is important that the media ops plan directs effort to placing the themes and messages of the overall info strategy before this group 205 joint operations area local audiences at the operational level the local audience tends to be the principal target fo r info ops but media ops also address local jdp 3451 23 audiences at the tactical level this will almost certainly be the key target audience for deployed commanders for whom effective media ops will be key in securing local consent and thus freedom of manoeuvre close coordination of media ops and info ops activity is particularly important at the tactical level whilst maintaining distinction between the two the adversary modern media present opportunities directly to address the leadership armed forces and population of an adversary similarly the effect of the adversary s media should never be underestimated and will need to be countered b the adversarys allies the adversary will seek support from all available sources in an effort to wide n legitimacy for its actions this could be in the form of regional support built on established treaties religious belief ethnicity shared values or other links alternatively there could be allies of convenience ie those which might pport the adversary due to their traditional opposition to the uk or sp ecific members of any coalition 206 the internal audience on operations deployed service personnel become avid news watcherslistenersreaders tuni ng in to satellite tv bbc world service and the internet media ops staff should be sensitive to the effect s of media coverage on the service personnel in the joa th importance of internal communications cannot be overemphasised wh ether it be through the chai n of command defence and singleservice information briefs the publica tion of theatre newsletters official or unofficial or the use of established mean s such as the british forces broadcasting service bfbs jdp 3451 24 intentionally blank jdp 3451 31 chapter 3 characteristics of the media 301 the media business the majority of the news media are involved in commercial competition for audiences wh ile individual journalists may have favourable personal view of events their loya lty will often be to their editors agenda and to their news agencys or newspapers commercial imperatives therefore their primary goal is to produce newsworthy cove rage and to produce it fast they may appear to be sympathetic but their bottom line is the production of information which is commercially attractive and in line with editorial policy therefore the military must not presume that the media is favourab to their cause and must understand the pressures journalists are under in or der to assist them properly 302 limited knowledge many correspondents will have only limited understanding of military operations and military issues this means that stories may be set out of context or be overgeneralised this lack of experience of defence means that there can be unrealistic expectations about what can be done misinterpretations about what is being done and ndency to jump to conclusions 303 the medias perspective the medias perspective in any given situation will be different from that of the litary the media accepts that in fast flowing situations such as military operations it is virtually impossible to provide product that can be both fast and wholly accurate divide s developed between journalists working for the major news corporations who are required to provide information that is relevant topical accurate comprehensive and substantial1 and those working for the more sensationalist companies where accuracy can be traded for speed and exclusivity or at the very least with special angle if th media is to report br eaking stories that are going to sell or attract audiences they mu st contain elements that generate human interest therefore the journalistic trend is to generalise from the particular when explaining complex world2 the media will also require coverage of story at different levels eg national versus region they will want interviews from military personnel at the strategic level dow nwards to the tactical level 304 media independence there will be corres pondents both national and international who work i ndependently throughout the jo int operations area joa equipped with their own communications facilities and transport these correspondents will undoubtedly attempt to cross the front line and report on the activities of both sides in real time 1 bbc guidelines reported in the times 23 june 2005 2 laity 2000 the media the military and policymaking whos calling the shots rusi journal december 2000 pages1520 jdp 3451 32 305 embedded journalists 3 there are now very few aspects of military operations that are not covere d in some way by the media one approach is to embed journalists with units to enable reporting direct from the front line in some circumstances embedding may be the only way to gain access to the story4 embedding may also be conducive to more accurate and balanced reporting of the situation local to the embedunit but not nece ssarily to the wider circumstances of the operation 306 deadlines in general the main stream media is under pressure to meet tight and fleeting deadlines where their overriding im perative is to be first with the news the breaking story is allimportant sometime s this can be at th expense of depth completeness or accuracy staffs must be aware that these drivers can have tangible effect on staff activity because productio n of copy for key morning and evening broadcast slots might have to be factored in to the daily headquarters staff rhythm an example of this was the timing of the th eatre hq battlerhythm especially press conferences during operations in iraq in 2003 2004 to meet timings of the breakfast news channels on the east coast of the ited states staffing timeliness for rebuttal will also need to be mindful of these deadlines 307 visual imagery visual component can he lp make story which would otherwise fail the quality or dramatic impact of the tv footage or photograph can determine whether story is given airtime or not likewise radio stories require background noise to underline the theme of th piece and to add authenticity in terms of grabbing attention and helping to shap perceptions picture can be defining image and is an area wher photography from military s ources can help inform the debate 308 initiative in order to get the story they want the media may be prepared to take risks and to stretch any agreements to the limit on occas ions this may cause friction with deployed military forces in these cases the media ops staff should endeavour to maintain the initiative by gene rating constant fl ow of positive and accurate newsworthy material to meet the medias search for st ories and images information vacuums should be avoided as they can hand the initiative to the media and may lead to the highlighting of negative aspects of the campaign 309 specific characteristics the different sections of the media have specific characteristics these characteristics affect their reporting their interests and how the military should best deal with them 3 journalists attached to the force under the terms of the green book and subattached into unit or hq rather than held as group and attached to press information centre pic 4for example noticeable decrease in the number of international journalists prep ared to operate independently in iraq from mid 04 to at least early 05 jdp 3451 33 310 nature of different nations media the uk media tends to be more confrontational more c ynical and less deferentia l than many others nowhere in europe are the debates so heated the boundaries of taste so stretched or the journalists so irreverent two cheers then for british democracy 5 it is widely recognised that there are di fferences in approach between media from different countries this is of partic ular note in multinational operations where cohesion of the nato alliance or other coa lition is often identified as the strategic centre of gravity cog it is importa nt to ensure that multinational personnel involved in the operation understand the diffe rences between the approaches used by different national media in order that none ar surprised or respond in an inappropriate fashion to questioning 311 national broadcast media for the purposes of this publication the broadcast media is divided into television and radio television in the uk television remain s the main platform for news consumption6 digitised technology has radica lly altered tv newsgathering known as electronic newsgathering ng an individual journalist can broadcast via satellite direct from joa with dependenc on the military communication infrastructure beyond th is news documentaries and dramas make significant impact on the longe r term perception of the military and their actions in the minds of the wider p ublic in order to gain lead in the eternal competition for ratings increa singly tv news is as much about comment and entertainment as it is about comprehensive reporting satellite tv news channels are gaining increas ing importance among the audiences in nonwestern countries where the appetite for news in relentless the acceptance of presented television pict ures can give tv journalists news excessive power to influence bot h public and political opinion b radio radio is often less sensationalist medium but the influence of the bbc world service current affair s and news programmes should not be underestimated in the developing world radio is often the primary source of news and information for media ops sta ff local radio is an excellent way of developing relationships between ployed service personnel and the local public in many less devel oped countries radio may offer the primary source of news for local population particul arly where literacy rates are low and localregional newspapers are less establ ished consideration should be given to the utility of such media through interpreters 5 matthew kaminski wall street journal 29 october 2004 6 an ofcom discussion document new news

source of news and information engagement with online media has become important particularly as adversaries seek to dominate this medium the difficulty of identifying the origin of website is for many of we bbased journalists the internet s greatest advantage it should always be remembered that the inte rnet is unregulated and access is open to anyone with terminal and telephone line 313 national print media unlike broadcast media in the uk the print media are not obliged by law to be unbiased all nati onal print media have agendas including political stance for the purposes of this p ublication the print media is divided into national broadsheet and tabloid red top res earch has shown that in the print media there is marked contrast between the r eadership and writers of the tabloids as opposed to the broadsheets7 people will buy newspaper that will make th em feel safe in their own opinions 8 and that the more intellectual papers the broadsheets merely inform readers who had already established their own opinion on matters tabloid journalists often appear to be more subjective in th eir articles in broad terms therefore broadsheet newspapers in the uk the broadsheet press is less widely read than the tabloids but ar more likely to influence principal decisionmakers and opinion formers for this reason their content will include considerable commentary as well as factual news reporting b tabloid newspapers the tabloid press is widely read by significant majority of the uk population dramatic headlines and short pithy pieces are more likely to affect wider

issue or activity fo r the purpose of informing the public interest is stimulated for example by press advisories news releases personal contacts press conferences or ot her forms of public presentation b semiactive media operations profile the semiactive media ops profile is profile which seeks to info rm the mediapublic without intending to expand or intensify media public interest the aim is to prevent uninformed speculation by voluntarily providing factua l information about military units or activities which the commander believes are of legitimate interest to the media and public semiactive approach us ually entails news release media advisory statement or interview to pr ovide basic information media ops staffs must then be prepared to res pond to possible subsequent queries but to guard against pursuing an overt or proactive media ops approach jdp 3451 43 c passive media operations profile the passive dia operations profile is profile which dictates that attempts will be made to generate mediapublic interest about an issue or act ivity even when passive profile is in effect staff must still be prepared to respond to media queries about the issue or activity and to make brief stat ements to avoid confusion speculation misunderstanding or rumours that may pr evail if media queri go unanswered the media ops profile will be determined by the overall profile hmg wishes to adopt and informed by the level of media interest in the situation and the profile hmg wishes to adopt for example an operati on predominantly involving special forces will necessitate

likely scenario for military action by uk forces at the medium or largescale of operations will be as part of coalition9 in these cases not only is it important to main tain common media line at national level but also it is equally important to ensure cohesion and present unified message recent campaigns have highli ghted the need to coordina key media themes and messages and to avoid exposing differences and so prevent their exploitation in the first instance this will be achieved at the strategic level by close liaison between governments but media ops staff at each level are
