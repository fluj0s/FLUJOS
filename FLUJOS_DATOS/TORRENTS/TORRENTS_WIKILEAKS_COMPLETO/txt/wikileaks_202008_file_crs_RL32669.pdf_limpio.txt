counternarcotics efforts1 beginning with legislation originally enacted in the mid1980s congress required the president to certify annually subject to congressional review that drug producing or drugtransit countries had cooperated fully with the unite d states in drug control efforts during the previous year to avoid suspension of us aid2 mexico was fully certified in following years but congress closely monitored these certifications and resolutions of disapproval to reverse the presidential certifications were introduced in 19961999 following the election of opposition candidate vicente fox as president of mexico in july 2000 severa l members called for modification of the certification procedures or exemption of mexico from the process but legislative action was not completed president bush certified mexico as fully cooperative on march 1 2001 and resolutions of di sapproval were introduced in 2001 in april and september 2001 the senate foreign relations committee reported out two measures s 219 and s 1401 that would have suspe nded the certification requirements for three years but fi nal action was taken by congress on the measures in december 2001 congress passed the foreign operations appropriations act for fy2002 hr 2506 pl 107 115 that waiv ed the drug certification requirements for fy2002 for ll countries and instead required the president to designate only countries that had demonstrably failed to meet international counternarcotics obligations in september 2002 congress enacted the foreign relations author ization act for fy2003 hr

see testimony of assistant customs commissioner john c varrone before the subcommittee on crime of the house judiciary committee march 29 2001according to the department of states bureau for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs mexico is the pr incipal transit country for south american cocaine entering the united states the leading foreign source of marijuana and principal source of heroin it is also major producing and transit point for methamphetamine and ot her synthetic drugs4 agency experts agree that mexicos share of illicit traffic in the various areas has remained high over the years although there are some variations in the estima tes the methodolog for making the estimates whether derived from seizures or some other means is not regarded as entirely adequate and the estimates may be affected by changing trafficking patterns and demand as much as enforcement efforts with regard to cocaine the major dr ug of concern the state departments incsr report covering the year 2003 states that an estimated 70 percent of the us bound cocaine shipments pass through mexican territory the drug enforcement administrations country profile for 2003 for mexico states that an estimated 70 percent of all cocaine originating from south america destined for the united states transits the mexicocentral america corridor5 these estimates appear to be higher percentage than reported in previ ous years the incsr covering 2002 stated that approximately 65 percent of cocaine reaching the united states passes through mexico and waters off the pacific and gu lf coasts and the incsr covering 2001 stated that mexico was the transit point for more than one half of the cocaine sold in the united states with respect to heroin the incsr report covering 2003 states that mexico produces less than five percent of the worlds opium poppy but because of the geographical proximity to the united states it is the supplier of some 30 to 40 percent of the us heroin market esp ecially in states west of the mississippi this appears to be slightly higher estimate than in the past the incsr report covering 2002 stated simply that geographi cal proximity to the united states allows cultivators and processors in mexico to supply disproportionately large share of the us heroin market us custom s official stated in march 2001 hearings that 14 of the heroin seized in the united states comes from mexico while an independent study indicated that mexico is the source of 29 of the heroin used in the united states6 in other areas the incsr covering 2003

section 332 this is the state of the nation report in spoken and written form that mexican presidents deliver to congress on september 1st of each year it is somewhat quivalent to the us state of the union report and addressmajor producing and transit point for meth amphetamine and other synthetic drugs moreover the report says that mexican drug traffickers have steadily increased operations in all illicit drug sectors in the united states and have come to dominate most of the distribution centers mexico continues to be major moneylaundering center in which trafficking organizati ons exploit mexican banks and financial institutions to transfer significant amount s of illicitly obtained currency through the global financial system fa vored money laundering met hods include the smuggling of us currency into mexico and the move ment of the funds back into the united states via couriers wire tran sfers and armored vehicles in short mexicos share of illicit traffic has remained high over the years and seemed to increase in 2003 in major areas especially in the supply of cocaine and heroin to the us market mexicos role as base for drug traffickers and as center for moneylaundering persisted and perhaps increased as well mexicos efforts to control illicit drug activities the following three tables show state department estimates of mexican drug control efforts in three areas seizur arrests and eradication from 1998 to 2003 supplementary information covering the first six months of 2004 is also provided as reported in the written version of president foxs fourth report of the government7 caution should be exercised in c onsidering the changes in the various areas as an indication of mexicos seriousness in controlling drug trafficking the trends may also be affected by the mand for the drugs the amount of drugs produced or available the sophistication of the drug traffickers the intelligence and capabilities of mexican counte rdrug agencies the effectiveness of reporting and monitoring methods the effect of weathe r conditions on eradication efforts and competition from alterna tive drug suppliers seizures of drugs turning to mexican seizures of drugs in 2003 the results portrayed in table 1 as reported by the state department monstrate mixed result compared to 2002 and compared to the average of the prev ious five years 19982002 that have been calculated to minimize the eff ects of annual variations the results generally show negative results in the seizures of cocaine opium and heroin while showing positive results in the seizures of

crimes committed abroad be prosecuted in mexico however the zedillo administration broke new ground by extraditing seven mexican nationals and one dual usmexi can national to the united states between 1996 and 2000 on grounds that this was per mitted under the usmexico extradition treaty and mexican extradition law in exceptional cases despite this stance mexican courts continued to be reluctant to approve extradition of mexican nationals even when recommended by the mexican foreign ministry and they freed several alleged drug traffick ers after raising questions about the constitutionality and appropriateness of extraditions especially where capital punishment or life sentences might be applied in january 2001 the mexican supreme c ourt ruled that mexican citizens may be extradited to the united states for pr osecution on drug charges provided that they are sentenced under mexican guidelines th is seemed to clear one legal hurdle but the incsr report in 2001 noted that advers lower court decisions on other issues particularly the question of life imprisonment and cap ital punishment continued to impede the extradition process10 in october 2001 the mexican supreme court ruled that life imprisonment is unconstitutional in mexico and bar to extradition for fugitives facing that penalty in anothe r country although extradition may take place if the requesting country provi

surprising in part because the total area under cultivation and the potential harvest area has been expanding considerably in part because of favorable growing conditions so that even where there are
