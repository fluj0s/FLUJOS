insurance program jointly funded by the federal government and the states although states have considerable flexibility to design and administer their medicaid programs certain groups of individuals must be covered for certain categories of services generally eligibility is limited to lowincome children pregnant women parents of dependent children the elderly and people with disabilities the federal governments share of medicaid costs for most services is determined by formula established in statute states must contribute the remaining portion of costs in order to qualify for federal funds 1 g22g145g142g561g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g15g142g141g146g140g138g149g561g3g156g156g146g156g157g138g151g140g142g561g18g142g155g140g142g151g157g138g144g142g561 the federal governments share of most medicaid service costs is determined by the federal medical assistance percentage fmap which varies by state and is determined by formula set in statute 2 certain medicaid services receive higher federal match including those provided through an indian health service facility to certain women with breast or cervical cancer for family planning or under the qualifying indi viduals program that pays medicare part b premiums on behalf of certain medicaid beneficiaries for medicaid administrative costs the federal share does not vary by state and is generally 503 an enhanced fmapnot discussed in this reportis provided for both services and administration under the state childrens health insurance program schip subject to the availability of funds from states federal allotment for schip when state expands its medicaid program using schip funds the enhanced fmap applies and is paid out of the states federal allotment until it is exhausted at which point the regular fmap applies and is paid out of federal medicaid funds 4 g10g152g160g561g8g15g3g18g156g561g3g155g142g561g5g138g149g140g158g149g138g157g142g141g561 the fmap formula compares each states per capita income relative to us per capita income and provides higher reimbursement to states with lower incomes with statutory maximum of 83 and lower reimbursement to states with high er incomes with statutory minimum of 50 the formula for given state is fmap state 1 per capita income state2per capita income us2 x 045 the use of the 045 factor in the formula is designed to ensure that state with per capita income equal to the us average receives an fmap of 55 ie state share of 45 in addition the 1 for broader overview of financing issues see crs report rs22849 medicaid financing by april grady 2 the fmap is also

belowaverage incomes than they would otherwise receive and vice versa5 the department of health and human serv ices hhs usually publishes fmaps for an upcoming fiscal year in the federal register in the preceding november thus fmaps for fy2008 the federal fiscal year that began on october 1 2007 were calculated and published in 2006 and fmaps for fy2009 were calculated and published in 2007 this time lag between announcement and implementation provides an opportunity for states to adjust to fmap changes but it also means that the per capita income amounts used to calculate fmaps for given fiscal year are several years old by the time the fmaps take effect table 1 shows the fmap for each state the distri ct of columbia and the territories for fy2003 fy2009 it also shows the number of states with an fmap decrease from the previous year which will fluctuate for reasons described in the appendix at the end of this report t able 1 fy2003fy2010 fmaps b state state fy03 first 2 quarters

produces an fmap of 5039 in state b with belowaverage per capita income of 38000 compared to us per capita income of 40000 the fmap formula produces an fmap of 5939 if the formula did not include squaring of per capita income it would instead produce fmaps of 5275 for state higher than current law and 5725 for state b lower than current law

specified in section 1905b of the social security act the per capita income amounts used in the fmap formula are equal to the average of the three most recent calendar years of data available from the

of economic analysis bea in september 2008 the use of threeyear average helps to moderate fluctuations in states fmap over time bea revises its most recent estimates of state per capita personal

computing enhanced fmaps for schip although it was described as hold harmless for katrina impact in dra the language of the katrina provision requires evacuees to be disregarded even if their inclusion would increase states fmap due to lags in the availability of data used to calculate fmaps fy2008 is th first year for which the provision applies in 2007 hhs proposed and then finalized methodology for implementation of the provision that would prevent the lowering of any fy2008 fmaps and increase the fy2008 fmap for one state texas the methodology takes advantage of data timing issue that will not apply after fy2008 although hhs had initially expressed concern that some states could see lower fmaps in later years as result of the dra provision the final methodology indicates that there is reliable way to track the number and income of evacuees on an ongoing basis and therefore basis for adjusting fmaps after fy2008 see 72 federal register 3391 january 25 2007 and 72

the component parts of personal income as defined in beas national income and product accounts or nipa these components include earnings wages and salaries employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds and proprietors income dividends interest and rent and personal current transfer receipts eg government social benefits such as social security medicare medicaid state unemployment insurance etc12 as result of these annual and comprehensive revisions it is often the case that the value of states per capita personal income for given year will change over time for example the 2004 state per capita personal income data published by bea in september 2006 used in the calculation of fy2008 fmaps differed from the 2004 state per capita personal income data published in september 2007 used in the calculation of fy2009 fmaps it should be noted that the nipa definition of personal income used by bea is not the same as the definition used for personal income tax purposes among other differences nipa personal income excludes capital gains or losses and includes transfer receipts eg government social benefits while income for tax purposes includes capital gains or losses and excludes most of these transfers g8g138g140g157g152g155g156g561g22g145g138g157g561g11g151g143g149g158g142g151g140g142g561g8g15g3g18g156g561 several factors influence state fmaps the first is the nature of the state economy and its ability to respond to economic changes ie downturns or upturns the impact of national economic downturn or upturn will be related to the struct ure of the state economy and the business sectors causing the upturn or downturn for example national decline in automobile sales while having an impact on automobile sales and all state economies will have larger impact in states that manufacture automobiles as production is reduced and workers are laid off second the fmap formula relies on per capita personal income to reflect state economies and their response to economic changes in relation to the us average per capita personal income the national economy is basically the sum of all state economies as result the national response to an economic change is the sum of the state responses to economic change if more states or larger states experience an economic decline the national economy reflects this decline to some extent however the national decline will be lower than the state declines because the total decline has been offset by states with increases ie states with growing economies the us per capita personal income because of this balancing of positive and negative has only small percentage change each year the fmap formula compares state changes in per capita personal income which can have large changes each year to the us per capita personal income which has very small changes each year this comparison can result in significant state fmap changes 12 employer and employee contributions for government social insurance eg social security medicare unemployment insurance etc are excluded from personal income and earnings are counted based on residency ie for individuals who live in one state and work in another their income is counted in the state where they reside httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32950g15g142g141g146g140g138g146g141g497g561g22g145g142g561 g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g15g142g141g146g140g138

comprehensive nipa revisions undertaken every four to five years may also influence fmaps for example because of changes in the definition of personal income the im pact on state fmaps will depend on whether the changes are broad affecting all states or more selective affecting only certain states or industries as noted earlier statutory changes may also affect fmaps

quarters of fy2003 and the first three quart ers of fy2004 were held harmless from annual declines and were increased by an additional 295 percentage points so long as state did not restrict eligibility after specified date none did and met certain other requirements13 to accommodate the fmap increase caps that apply to federal medicaid spending in the territories were raised by 59 jgtrra

calculations and prevent alaskas fy2006fy2007 fmaps from falling below the states fy2005 level were included in the defi cit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 other provisions that would have temporarily increased fmaps for states affected by hurricane katrina limited fy2006 fmap reductions for all states and disregarded employer contributions toward pensions in the calculation of fmaps if they exceeded certain threshold were debated but not included in the final bill15 in the 110th congress number of bills that would affect medicaid fmaps have been introduced most recently debate has

medicaid fmap increase was introduced earlier in 2008 s 2586 hr 5268 s 2620 s 2819 the recent house and senate stimulus bills contain different medicaid provisions s 3604 would hold all states harmless from any decline in their medicaid fmaps for fy2009 and the first quarter of fy2010 see table 1 for scheduled declines and provide all states and territories with an additional increase of four percentage points s 3689 is similar except that it would provide an increase of eight percentage points instead of four hr 7110 would hold all states harmless for fy2009 and the first two months of fy2010 provide all states and territories with an additional increase of one percentage point and provide qualifying states with an additional increase of up to three percentage points based on employment food stamp and foreclosure data although some details vary all of the bills would apply the temporary fmap increase to medicaid only 20 temporarily raise federal medicaid spending caps in the territories require states to maintain medicaid eligibility as of specified date in order to be eligible for the increase and require states to ensure that local governments do not pay larger percentage of nonfederal expenditures than otherwise would have been required21 the senate bills would also prohibit states from using the additional federal funds paid as result of temporary fmap increase to increase any reserve or rainy day fund that they maintain separate from the temporary medicaid fmap increase the house bill includes provision that would exclude certain employer pension and insurance fund contributions in the calculation of medicaid fmaps beginning with fy2006 22 fmap increases would reduce the amount of state funding that is required to maintain given level of medicaid services for states that are cont emplating cuts in order to slow the growth of or reduce medicaid spending eg by lowering income eligibility eliminating coverage of certain benefits freezing or reducing provider reimburse ment rates increasing costsharing or premiums for beneficiaries increased federal funding could enable them to avoid those cuts23 for others the state savings that result from an fmap increase could be used for variety of purposes that are not limited to medicaid24 in sfy2008 and sfy2009 many states have implemented or 19 executive office of the president office of management and budget statements of administration policy on non appropriations and appropriations bills at httpwwwwhitehousegovomblegislativesapindexhtml 20 except for medicaid dsh payments which are subject to federal spending caps 21 some states require local governments to finance part of the nonfederal ie state share of medicaid costs since temporary fmap increase would reduce states nonfederal share local government whose required contribution is specified dollar amount or some other amount that is not fixed percentage of the nonfederal share could pay larger percentage of the nonfederal share than it otherwise would have without the fmap increase 22 see crs congressional distribution memorandum estimated medicaid fmaps under proposal to disregard certain employer pension

from the previous year for two reasons annual revisions to per capita personal income and the replacement of the oldest year of data for per capita personal income with the most recent year of data fo r fy2006 fmaps there were three reasons for the change from fy2005 1 comprehensive nipa revisions 2 annual revisions to per capita personal income for years 2001 and 2002 which are in common for the calculations of fy2005 and fy2006 and 3 the replacement of the oldest year of data for per capita personal income 2000 with the most recent year 2003 some states found that fmap changes between fy2005 and fy2006 were larger than expected as result questions were raised about the causes of the changes and about whether the changes are unusual an analysis of the change in state fmaps over the years shows that the range of fmap changes between fy2005 and fy2006 is not unusual figure a1 contains graphic representation of the annual change in fmaps since fy1990 showing the largest positive and negative changes and the average change in state fmaps each year while the range of change in fmaps was not unusually large the 055 average change between fy2005 and fy2006 represented the only time during the 16year period that the average change exceeded plus or minus onehalf of percentage point over the period the average change in state fmaps was positive half of the time and negative half of the time in addition there were eight years when the number of states with fmap increases exceeded the number of states with fmap decreases and eight years when the opposite was true the pattern varies by state with some states having negative annual change between years for all years and other states having positive annual change for most years the most recent comprehensive nipa revisions were undertaken in 1999 and 2003 and state fmaps for the first years calculated using this revised data fy2002 and fy2006 show larger range of changes compared to other years for example state fmap changes between fy2000 and fy2001 ranged from 284 to 113 with an average change of 012 state fmap changes between fy2001 and fy2002 the first year calculated after the 1999 comprehensive nipa revision ranged from 249 to 263 with an average change of 026 this indicates that recent comprehensive nipa revisions may have had an impact on state fmaps but the range of fmap changes associated with the latest 2003 comprehensive nipa revision is not substantially different from the range associated with the 1999 revision another way to examine fmaps over the 16year period is through the median the median represents the fmap at which half of the states have higher values and half of the states have lower values as shown in figure a2 during the fy1990fy2006 period the median state fmap declined only slightly by less than 1 percentage point and the change between fy2005 and fy2006 was very small twotenths of percentage point in figure a2 the solid line connects median state fmaps for each year the dotted line connects median state fmaps resulting from temporary increases granted by pl 10827 the decline in the median state fmap since fy1990 is not result of more states being subject to the statutory minimum fmap of 50 over time in fy1990 there were two more states at the statutory minimum than in fy2006 instead the decline in the median state fmap reflects the decline in the number of states with fmaps of 70 or more in fy1990 12 states d an fmap of 70 or more by fy2006 only five states had an fmap of 70 or more

transfer payments this means that all other things being equal during an economic downturn as more people in state receive transfer payments eg unemployment or medicaid benefits the personal income in the state increases at the same time since capital gains or losses are not included in personal income if significant portion of the economic downturn is the result of declines in the equity stock market the capital losses do not result in corresponding decline in personal income the economic downturn of 2001 has been attributed to the impact of the september 11th attacks and the decline in the equity stock market as result states may have experienced decline in personal income tax revenues without corresponding reduction in per capita personal income which is used to calculate fmaps population is also major component in the calculation of per capita personal income if for example two states have the same aggregate personal income the state with the largest population will have the lowest per capita personal income and the highest fmap of the two states according to published bea document on the highlights of the 2003 nipa revision27 measurement changes improved estimates of propertycasualty insurance services provided by banks without charge and investment in nonresidential structures while these changes would have an impact on personal income for example the changes for services provided by banks without charge and propertycasualty insurance would affect personal interest income larger impact may be attributable to the use of updated and more comprehensive data sources these include updated bea inputoutput tables more recent annual surveys of business government and the economy by the census bureau tabulations of business returns for 2000 and 2001 by the internal revenue service and tabulations of wages and salaries for 2001 and 2002 27 available on the bea website at httpwwwbeagovbeanewsrel2003cr_faxpdf httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32950 g561
