statistics introduction this report is written in response to num erous requests for war casualty statistics and lists of war dead it provides tables compiled by s ources at the department of defense dod indicating the number of fatalities and numbe rs of wounded among american military personnel serving in prin cipal wars and combat actions from the revolutionary war to the current opera tion iraqi freedom oif and operation enduring freedom oef operations in afghanistan and rela ted conflicts review of the composite data reveals the following during the period between the re volutionary war and the present it was the civil war that produced the most american fatalities when union statistics and confederate estimates are taken into account world war ii was the first war in which there were more battle deaths than deaths from other cause s such as accidents disease and infections with total of 382 intheater deaths 147 of which were battle deaths the persian gulf war was the least costly in terms of fatalities see table 1 the ongoing operation iraqi free dom to date has produced more than ten times the number of intheater deaths than the persian gulf war which lasted seven months the casualty statistics for wars long ended are updated pe riodically sometimes yearly this almost always reflects the identification of remains of persons previously listed as missing in action nd those persons recla ssification as dead other reasons much rarer include the disc overy of errors in casualty records for individuals or categories of
