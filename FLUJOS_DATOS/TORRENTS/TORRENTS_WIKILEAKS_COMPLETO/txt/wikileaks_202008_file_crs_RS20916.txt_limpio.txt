fundamentals ruth ellen wasem specialist in social legislation domestic social policy division summary congress typically considers wide range of immigration issues and now that the number of foreign born residents of the united states 325 million in 2002 is at the highest point in us history the debates over immigration policies grow in importance as backdrop to these debates this report provides an introduction to immigration and naturalization policy concepts and statistical trends it touches on range of topics including numerical limits refugees and asylees exclusion naturalization illegal aliens eligibility for federal benefits and taxation this report does not track legislation and will not be regularly updated introduction four major principles underlie us policy on legal permanent immigration the reunification of families the admission of immigrants with needed skills the protection of refugees and the diversity of admissions by the country of origin these principles are embodied in federal law the immigration and nationality act ina first codified in 1952 congress has significantly amended the ina several times since most recently by the enhanced border security and visa reform act of 2002 pl 1071731 an alien is any person not citizen or national of the united states and is synonymous with noncitizen it includes people who are here legally as well as people who are here in violation of the ina noncitizen is generally used to describe all foreign born persons in the united states who have not become citizens the two basic types of legal aliens are immigrants and nonimmigrants immigrants are persons admitted as legal permanent residents lprs of the united states nonimmigrants such as tourists foreign students diplomats temporary agricultural 1 other major laws amending ina are the immigration amendments of 1965 the refugee act of 1980 the immigration reform and control act of 1986 the immigration act of 1990 and the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 congressional research service the library of congress crs2 workers exchange visitors or intracompany business personnel are admitted for specific purpose and temporary period of time nonimmigrants are required to leave the country when their visas expire though certain classes of nonimmigrants may adjust to lpr status if they otherwise qualify2 the conditions for the admission of immigrants are much more stringent than nonimmigrants and many fewer immigrants than nonimmigrants are admitted once admitted however immigrants are subject to few restrictions for example they may accept and change employment and may apply for us citizenship through the naturalization process generally after 5 years numerical limits and preference categories immigration admissions are subject to complex set of numerical limits and preference categories that give priority for admission on the basis of family relationships needed skills and geographic diversity these include flexible worldwide cap of 675000 not including refugees and asylees discussed below and percountry ceiling which changes yearly numbers allocated to the three preference tracks include 226000 minimum for familybased 140000 for employmentbased and 55000 for diversity immigrants ie formulabased visa lottery aimed at countries that have low levels of immigration to the united states the per country ceilings may be exceeded for employmentbased immigrants but the worldwide limit of 140000 remains in effect in addition the immediate relatives of us citizens ie their spouses and unmarried minor children and the parents of adult us citizens are admitted outside of the numerical limits of the per country ceilings and are the flexible component of the worldwide cap the largest number of immigrants is table 1 fy2001 immigrants by category admitted because of family relationship to total 1064318 us citizen or immigrant of the immediate relatives of citizens 443964 1064318 legal immigrants in fy2001 family preference 232143 64 entered on the basis of family ties employment preference 179195 immediate relatives of us citizens made refugee and asylee adjustments 108506 up the single largest group of immigrants diversity 42506 other 58495 as table 1 indicates family preference immigrants the spouses and children of immigrants the adult children of us citizens and the siblings of adult us citizens were the second largest group additional major immigrant groups in fy2001 were employmentbased preference immigrants including spouses and children refugees and asylees adjusting to immigrant status and diversity immigrants3 the bureau of 2 nonimmigrants are often referred to by the letter that denotes their section in the statute such as h2a agricultural workers f1 foreign students or j1 cultural exchange visitors crs report rl31381 us immigration policy on temporary admissions by ruth ellen wasem 3 the largest group in the other category are the 18926 nicaraguans who adjusted to lpr status through special legislation the nicaraguan and central american relief act of 1997 crs3 citizenship and immigration services bcis in the department of homeland security dhs is the lead agency for immigrant admissions4 refugees and asylees refugee admissions are governed by different criteria and numerical limits than immigrant admissions refugee status requires finding of persecution or wellfounded fear of persecution in situations of special humanitarian concern to the united states the total annual number of refugee admissions and the allocation of these numbers among refugee groups are determined at the start of each fiscal year by the president after consultation with the congress refugees are admitted from abroad the ina also provides for the granting of asylum on casebycase basis to aliens physically present in the united states who meet the statutory definition of refugee5 exclusion and removal all aliens must satisfy state department consular officers abroad and dhs bureau of customs and border protection inspectors upon entry to the us that they are not ineligible for visas or admission under the socalled grounds for inadmissibility of the ina these criteria categories are healthrelated grounds criminal history national security and terrorist concerns public charge eg indigence seeking to work without proper labor certification illegal entrants and immigration law violations lacking proper documents ineligible for citizenship and aliens previously removed some provisions may be waived or are not applicable in the case of nonimmigrants refugees eg public charge and other aliens all familybased immigrants entering after december 18 1997 must have new binding affidavit of support signed by us sponsor in order to meet the public charge requirement the ina also specifies the circumstances and actions that result in aliens being removed from the united states ie deported the category of criminal grounds has been of special concern in recent years and the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 expanded and toughened the deportation consequences of criminal convictions the category of terrorist grounds has also been broadened and tightened up by the usa patriot act of 2001 pl 10777 4 other agencies with primary responsibility for immigration functions are the bureau of customs and border protection and the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement both in dhs see crs report rs21504 immigrationrelated funding in the presidents fy2004 budget

aliens th the peaks of the early 20 century the bcis data present 600 only those admitted as lprs or 400 those adjusting to lpr status the growth in immigration after 200 1980 is partly attributable

presentation of bcis data aliens legalizing through the immigration reform and control act of 1986 are depicted by year of arrival consisting of immigrants entering through preference system as well as immediate relatives of us citizens that was augmented considerably by legalized aliens6 in addition the number of refugees admitted increased from 718000 in the period 19661980 to 16 million during

other hand include all residents in the population counts and the census asks people whether they were born in the united states or abroad as result the census data also contain longterm temporary nonimmigrant residents and unauthorized residents 6 the immigration reform and control act of 1986 legalized several million aliens residing in the united states without authorization crs5 the percent of the population that is foreign born depicted in figure 2 resembles the trend line of annual admissions data presented in figure 1 it indicates the proportion of foreign born residents is not as large as during earlier periods but is approaching historic levels at the turn of the last century figure 2 illustrates that the sheer number 325 in 2002 has more than doubled from 141 million in 1980 and is at the highest point in us history naturalization another tradition of immigration policy is to provide immigrants an opportunity to integrate fully into society under us immigration law all lprs are potential citizens and may become so through process known as naturalization to naturalize aliens must have continuously resided in the united states for 5 years as lprs 3 years in the case of spouses of us citizens show that they have good moral character demonstrate the ability to read write speak and understand english and pass an examination on us government and history applicants pay fees of 310 when they file their materials and have the option of taking standardized civics test or of having the examiner quiz them on civics as part of their interview the language requirement is waived for those who are at least 50 years old and have lived in the united states at least 20 years or who are at least 55 years old and have lived in the united states at least 15 years special consideration on the civics requirement is to be given to aliens who are over 65 years old and have lived in the united states for at least 20 years both the language and civics requirements are waived for those who are unable to comply due to physical or developmental disabilities or mental impairment certain requirements are waived for those who have served in the figure 3 naturalization

overstayed the term of their nonimmigrant visas eg tourist or student visas many of these aliens have some type of document either bogus or expired and may have cases pending with bcis the former ins estimated that there were 70 million unauthorized aliens in the united states in 2000 demographers at the census bureau and the urban institute estimated unauthorized population in 2000 at 87 and 85 million respectively but these latter estimates included quasilegal aliens who had petitions pending or relief from deportation7 eligibility for federal benefits noncitizens eligibility for major federal benefit programs depends on their immigration status and whether they arrived before or after enactment of pl 104193 the 1996 welfare law as amended by pl 10533 and pl 105185 refugees remain
