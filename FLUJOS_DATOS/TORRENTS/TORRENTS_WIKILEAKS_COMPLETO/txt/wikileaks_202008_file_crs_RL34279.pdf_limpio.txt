united stat 277 us 438 1928 but later held that intangible things such as conversations were also protected in its 1967 decision in katz v united states 389 us 347 353 359 n 23 1967 the court overturning its previous holding in olmstead v united states held that the fourth amendment covered electronic surveillance of oral communications without physical intrusion the katz court stated however that its holding did not extend to cases involving national security in united states v united states dist rict court 407 us 297 31314 1972 the keith case the court regarded katz as implicitly recognizing that the broad and unsuspected governmental incursions into conversationa l privacy which electronic surveillance entails necessitate the application of fourth amendment safeguards mr justice powell writing for the keith court framed the matter be fore the court as follows the issue before us is an important one for the people of our country and their government it involves the delicate question of the presidents power acting through the attorney general to authorize electronic surveillance in internal security matters without prior judicial approval successive presidents for more than onequarter of century have authorized such surveillance in varying degrees without guidance from the congress or definitive decision of this court this case brings the issue he re for the first time its resolution is matter of national concern requiring sensitivity both to the governments right to protect itself from unlawful subversion and attack and to the citizens right to be secure in his privacy against unreasonable government intrusion 407 us at 299 the court held that in th case of intelligence gathering involving domestic security surveillance prior judicial approval was required to satisfy the fourth amendment justice powell emphasized that the case before it required judgment on the scope of the presidents surveillance power with respect to the activ ities of foreign powers within or w ithout the country id at 308 the court expressed opinion as to the issues which may be involved with re spect to activities of foreign powers or their agents id at 32122 however the guidance which the court provided in keith with respect to national security surveillance in domestic context to some degree presaged the approach congress was to take in foreign intelligence surveillance id at 32324 continuedthe foreign intelligence surveillance act an overview of selected issues introduction the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 pl 95511 92 stat 1783 october 25 1978 50 usc 1801 et seq hereinafter fisa was enacted in response both to the committee to study g overnment operations with respect to intelligence activities otherwise known as the

nom ivanov v united states 419 us 881 1974 concluded that warrantless electronic surveillance was wful violating neither section 605 of the communications act nor the fourth amendmen t if its primary purpose was to gather foreign intelligence information in its plur ality decision in zweibon v mitchell 516 f2d 594 61314 dc cir 1975 cert denied 425 us 944 1976 the district of columbia circuit took somewhat different view in case involving warrantless wiretap of domestic organization that was not an agent of foreign power or working in collaboration with foreign power finding that warrant was required in such circumstances the plurality also noted that an analysis of the policies implicated by foreign security surveillance indicates that absent exigen t circumstances all warrantless electronic surveillance is unreasonable and therefore unconstitutional for more information on the background of fisa see crs report rl30465 the foreign intelligence surveillance act an overview of

effective against all who seek to do us harm the bill must not require court approval before urgently needed intelligence collection can begin against foreign target located overseas the delays of court process that requires judicial determinations in advance to gather vital intelligence from foreign targets overseas can in some cases prevent the rapid gathering of intelligence necessary to pr ovide warning of threats to the country this process would also require in prac tice that we continue to divert scarce intelligence experts to compiling these court submissions similarly critical

suggested to meet this need and limitations of liability for those electronic communication rvice providers who furnish aid to the federal government in its foreign intelligence coll ection this report briefly examine these issues and sets them in context tension between national security and civil liberties two constitutional provisions in particular are implicated in this debate the fourth and first amendments the fourth amendment to the us constitution provides the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and warrant shall issue but upon probable cause s upported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be arched and the persons or things to be seized the first amendment to the us constitution provides congress shall make law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for redress of grievances as the fourth amendment protects the peoples privacy rights so the first amendment reflects recognition of the value of free expression of ideas and lawful political dissent to the preservation of free society in introducing s 1566 the bill that became the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 pl 95511 nator edward kennedy addressed the challenge of striking an appropriate balance between the legitimate government needhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34279crs5 8 report of

foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1977 95th cong 1st sess 23 1977to safeguard the nation against the intelligence activities of foreign agents and the concomitant need to protect civil liberties stating the complexity of the problem must not be underestimated electronic surveillance can be useful tool for th governments gathering of certain kinds of information yet if abused it can so constitute particularly indiscriminate and penetrating invasion of the privacy of our citizens my objective over the past six years has been to reach some ki nd of fair balance that will protect the security of the united states without infringing on our citizens human liberties and rights8 this sentiment was echoed in hearing before the senate judiciary committee on s 1566 when attorney general griffin be ll testified for the carter administration in favor of the measure i believe this bill is remarkable not only in the way it has been developed but also in the fact that for the fi rst time in our society the clandestine intelligence activities of our government shall be subject to the regulation and receive the positive authority of public w for all to inspect president carter stated it very well in announcing this bill when he said that one of the most difficult tasks in free society like our own is the correlation between adequate intelligence to guarantee our nations security on the one hand and the preservation of basic human rights on the other it is very delicate balance to strike but one which is necessary in our society and balance which cannot be achieved by sacrificing either our nation s security or our civil liberties 9 in providing background for its report on hr 7308 the house fisa bill then under consideration the house permanen t select committee on intelligence noted the history and law relating to electroni c surveillance for national security purposes have revolved around the competing demands of the presidents constitutional powers to gather intelligence deemed necessary to the security of the nation and the requirements of the f ourth amendment the us supreme court has never expressly decided the issue of whether the president has the constitutional authority to authorize warrantless electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes whether or not the president has an inherent power to engage in or authorize warrantless electronic surveillance and if suchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34279crs6 10 report of the house permanent select committee on intelligence to accompany hr 7308 the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 hrept 951283 part i 95th cong 2d sess 15 1978 11 see srept 95604 at 8 1978 usccan 39093910 the senate judiciary committee noted that in summarizing its conclusion that surveillance was often conducted by illegal or improper means the church committee wrote since the 1930s intelligence agencies have frequently wiretapped and bugged american citizens without the bene fit of judicial warrant past subjects of these surveillances have included united states congressman congressional staff member journalists and newsmen and numerous individuals and groups who engaged in criminal activity and who posed genuine threat to the national security such as two white house domestic affairs advisers and an antivietnam war protest group vol 2 p 12 the application of vague and elastic standards for wiretapping and bugging has resulted in electronic surveillances which by any objective measure were improper and seriously infringed the fourth amendment rights of both the targets and those with whom the targets communicated the inherently intrusive nature of electronic surveillance moreover has enabled the government to generate vast amounts of information unrelated to any legitimate government interest about the personal and political lives of american citizens the collection of this type of information has in turn raised the danger of its use for partisan political and other improper ends by senior administration officials vol 3 p 32 the senate judiciary committee observed further also formidable although incalcul able is the chilling effect which warrantless electronic surveillance may have on the constitutional rights of those who were not targets of the surveillance but who perceived themselves whether reasonably or unreasonably as potential targets our bill of rights is concerned not only with direct infringements on constitutional rights but also with government activities which effectively inhi bit the exercise of these rights the exercise of political freedom depends in large measure on citizens understanding that they will be able to be publicly ac tive and dissent from official policy within continuedpower exists what limitations if any rest rict the scope of that power are issues that have troubled constitutional scholars for decades10 electronic surveillance can provide vital information needed to identify those who are acting or preparing to act against us interests for the benefit of foreign powers including those engaged in espiona ge sabotage or terrorist acts or who otherwise pose threat to the nation or its citizens and to uncover their plans or activities this information may not be readily uncovered by other investigative means thus surveillance can provide valuable tool for protecting the security of the nation and its citizens however this investigative technique by its nature can intrude into the privacy of both the target of the surveillance and those with whom the target communicates it also has the potential of chilling political discussion and lawful dissent11 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34279crs7 11 continued lawful limits without having to sacrifi ce the expectation of privacy that they rightfully hold arbitrary or uncont rolled use of warrantless electronic surveillance can violate that understanding and impair that public confidence so necessary to an uninhibited political life see also keith 407 us at 391321 where ju stice powell observed that national security cases often reflect convergence of first and fourth amendment values not present in cases of ordinary crime though the investigative duty of the executive may be st ronger in such cases so also is there greater jeopardy to constitutionally protec ted speech historically the struggle for freedom of speech and press in england was bound up with the issue of the scope of the search and seizure power marcus v search warrant 367 us 717 724 1961 fourth amendment pr otections become the more necessary when the targets of official surveilla nce may be those suspected of unorthodoxy in their political beliefs the danger to po litical dissent is acute where the government attempts to act under so vague concept as the power to protect domestic security 12 see eg james risen and eric lichtblau bush lets us spy on callers without courts ny times december 16 2005 at 1 22 citing anonym ous government officials to report that

security agency described by the president us department of jus tice january 19 2006 this may be found at httpwwwusdojgovagreadingroomsurveillance9pdfthe framing of the current debate on this issue flows in part from questions arising with respect to the terrorist surveillance program tsp first revealed in press accounts in december 200512 while little information regarding the details of this nsa program is publicly available the president has indicated that since shortly after september 11 2001 he had au thorized the national security agency nsa to intercept international communications into and out of the united states of persons linked to queda or related terrorist organizations the purpose of the intercepts is to establish an early warning system to detect and prevent another catastrophic terrorist att ack on the united states13 concerns surrounding the tsp have led to continuing c ongressional oversight and num ber of legislative proposals focused upon providing the intelligence community with the tools it needs for foreign intelligence collection to protect the united states and its citizens while also protecting the civil liberties of those impacted by such collection the current level of complexity and sophistication of global communications technology can provide both increased opportunities for lawful private communications and public debate and increased means for communications between those engaged in criminal wrongdoing or plans or actions which pose threat to us national security while this presents challenges to intelligence collection

which will allow the necessary speed and agility all surveillance previously occurring under the terrorist surveillan ce program tsp woul d now be conducted subject to the approval of the fisc he indicated furthe r that under these circumstances the president had determined not to reauthorize the tsp when the then current authorization expired the attorney general also noted that the intelligence committees had been briefed on the highly classified details of the fisc orders and advised chairman leahy and nator specter that he had directed the acting assistant attorney general for the office of legal counsel and the assistant attorney general for national security to provide them classified briefing on the details of the orders because the conten ts of these orders remain

be made on both sides with respect to whether retroactive immunity should be granted telecommunicati ons providers who are alleged to have assisted the government in such progra ms for example the cooperation of such providers is critical to the governments capacity to pursue electronic surveillance to gather foreign intelligence information nd is also essential for collection of communications records for pattern analys is if the telecommunication providers who responded to the governments requests or demands for assistance did so in good faith reliance upon assertions by the government that th demand was lawful and that court order was not required it may be argued that the providers should be immunized from ill effects flowing from such good faith reliance some have argued that the unique factual context militates in favor of such relief from liability to the extent those who responded to the governme nts requests for assistance in the wake of 911 did so in response to government assertions that their cooperation was necessary to protect against further attacks in many of the suits filed the government has asserted states secrets privilege with respect to the programs involved and the role of any of the telecommunications carriers with respect thereto this is common law evidentiary privilege which may only be asserted by the government that protects information from discovery when its disclosure would be inimical to the national security the privilege can come into play in three ways if the very subject matter of the case is state secret an assertion of the privilege can cause the case to be immediately dismissed and the action barred if however this prong of the state secrets privilege does not apply the privilege may operate to bar admission into evidence of information which will damage the security of the united states the plaintiff then goes forward on the basis of evidence not covered if the plaintiff cannot prove prima facie case with nonprivileged evidence then the case may be dismissed34 on the other hand if the privilege deprives defendant of information that would otherwise give the defendant valid defense to the claim then the court may grant summary judgment to the defendant35 in the current context to the extent that defendant telecommunica tions providers may have valid claim of immun ity under 18 usc 25112a but for the application of the state secrets privilege to the identities of any providers who may have furnished aid to the government an argument may be made that the telecommunications

may be the only means by which those who may have been adversely impacted by such government activities may obtain any remedy for any injuries incurred these injuri may have impacted first and fourth amendment protected interests and ther may be other means of vindicating those rights in addition the telecommuni cations providers provide the front line of defense of those rights against governme ntal abuse if the government demand or request is unlawful in some instances it may be argued that telecommunications provider has statutory obligation to protect customer records from unlawful access36 such arguments militate against affording relief from liability to any providers who may have permitted unlawful access in addition to these arguments some have argued that because the administration has not shared information repeatedly sought by some committees of jurisdiction with respect to the role of the telecommunications providers in the tsp or other pertinent intelligence
