william h cooper specialists in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division trade promotion authority tpa issues options and prospects for renewal summary on july 1 2007 trade promotion authority tpa formerly known as fast track expired tpa is the authority congress grants to the president to enter into certain reciprocal trade agreements ftas and to have their implementing bills considered under expedited legislative procedures provided he observes certain statutory obligations in negotiating them tpa allows congress to exercise its constitutional authority over trade while giving the president added leverage to exercise his authority to negotiate trade agreements by effectively assuring us trade partners that final agreements are given swift and unamended consideration tpa reflects years of debate cooperation and compromise between congress and the executive branch in finding pragmatic accommodation to the exercise of each branchs respective authorities the core provisions of the fast track legislative procedures have remained unchanged since first enacted in 1974 although congress has expanded trade negotiation objectives oversight and presidential notification requirements while early versions of fast tracktpa received broad bipartisan support renewal efforts became increasingly controversial as fears grew over real and perceived negative effects of trade and as the trade debate became more partisan in nature culminating in largely partyline vote on the 2002 renewal any debate on tpa renewal would likely center on the broad effects of trade on the united states with an emphasis on numerous specific issues that may be given greater weight in the future labor environment and public health provisions stricter enforcement of trade agreements enhanced trade adjustment assistance programs and revisions to the role of congress in trade policy making bilateral agreements with panama peru colombia and south korea were signed in time to be considered under the 2002 tpa the house and senate passed implementing legislation for the peru fta which president bush signed into law on december 14 2007 the president sent implementing legislation for the colombia fta to congress on april 8 2008 but the house passed rule suspending the application of parts of the expedited legislative procedures for this bill alone the protracted world trade organization wto doha round of multilateral negotiations are still incomplete and may yet result in the remaining key trade agreement that could compel congress to consider extending or renewing tpa some observers also suggest that tpa is important to support future bilateral fta negotiations particularly given that many countries appear ready to continue pursuing ftas irrespective of us trade policy key members of the house and senate however have signaled that tpa renewal is not at the top of the legislative agenda and will require considerable deliberation before it can be passed congress has many options in dealing with tpa take action extend temporarily revise and renew grant permanent authority or devise some hybrid solution how this issue plays out depends

options and prospects for renewal on july 1 2007 trade promotion authority tpa formerly known as fast track expired and with it the authority that congress grants to the president to enter into certain reciprocal trade agreements and to have the legislation needed to implement them considered under expedited legislative procedures although the president has the authority under the constitution to negotiate free trade agreements ftas typically implementing legislation and thus congressional action are required to bring them into force the united states trade representative ustr completed bilateral trade agreement negotiations with peru colombia panama and south korea prior to tpa expiration congress approved the peru fta the president sent implementing legislation for the colombia fta to congress on april 8 2008 but the house passed rule suspending the application of parts of the expedited legislative procedures for this bill alone and has taken further action on it see footnote 19 on p 12 doha round agreement and any future bilateral ftas cannot be considered under tpas expedited procedures unless those procedures are renewed by congress for over 30 years congress has granted the president tpafast track agreeing to consider trade implementing legislation expeditiously and vote on it without amendment provided the president meets certain statutory negotiating objectives and consultation requirements tpa strikes delicate balance by allowing congress to exercise its constitutional authority over trade while giving the president additional negotiating leverage by effectively assuring trade partners that final agreement will be given swift and unamended consideration by congress earlier incarnations of tpa although controversial were adopted with substantial bipartisan majorities over time however trade negotiations have become more complex congress has insisted on tighter oversight and consultation requirements and the trade debate has become more partisan in nature making congressional renewal of tpa if anything even more controversial the democrats assumption of control in the 110th congress may also affect prospects for tpa renewal by shifting trade policy priorities as seen in the new trade policy for america bipartisan position crafted jointly by congressional leadership and the bush administration1 the new trade policy framework incorporates important changes some with broad social implications that have already altered the language of recently signed ftas with peru colombia panama and south korea among important changes from previous ftas signatories must now adopt as fully enforceable commitments the five basic labor rights defined in 1 the may 10 2007 compromise is available on the websites of the

1998 declaration adhere to numerous multilateral environmental agreements meas and accept pharmaceutical intellectual property rights ipr provisions that could hasten that countrys access to generic drugs the expiration of tpa raises the central question of whether when and in what form tpa should be renewed including to what degree if any provisions of the new trade policy america might be incorporated some have argued that tpa should be renewed to cover at minimum the world trade organizations wto doha development agenda dda round multilateral agreement if it can be concluded and perhaps also potential future bilateral ftas the dda negotiations however are bogged down and pending fta negotiations appear dormant in addition the house democratic leadership has signaled that tpa is not at the top of its legislative agenda indicating that quick resolution to the tpa debate seems unlikely to occur this report presents background on the development of tpa summary of the major provisions under the recently expired authority and discussion of the issues that have arisen in the debate over tpa renewal it also explores the policy options available to congress and will be updated as the congressional debate unfolds brief history of tpa tpa is the product of many years of debate cooperation and compromise between congress and the executive branch at its foundation lie the respective constitutional powers granted to congress and the president as well as the pragmatic realization that certain cooperative flexibility is needed if the united states is to negotiate trade agreements credibly the evolution of tpa to date shows among other things that the congressionalexecutive partnership on trade policymaking can be strained as it adjusts to evolving political and economic conditions and shifting priorities of the two branches the us constitution and foreign trade the us constitution assigns express authority over foreign trade to congress article i section 8 gives congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises in contrast the constitution assigns specific responsibility for trade to the president2 under article ii however the president has exclusive authority to negotiate treaties and international agreements and exercises broad authority over the conduct of the nations foreign affairs both legislative and executive authorities come into play in the development and execution of us trade agreements and trade policy 2 destler i m american trade politics fourth edition institute for international economics washington dc 2005 p 14 crs3 the evolution of the congressionalexecutive partnership for roughly the first 150 years of the united states the congress exercised its authority over foreign trade by setting tariff rates on all imported products the tariff was the main trade policy instrument and primary source of federal revenue early congressional trade debates pitted members from northern manufacturing regions who benefitted from protectionist tariffs against those from largely southern raw material exporting regions who lobbied for low tariffs during this period the presidents primary role in setting trade policy was to use his foreign affairs authority to negotiate bring into force and implement with the advice and consent of the senate general bilateral treaties of friendship commerce and navigation these treaties provided mostfavorednation mfn treatment to the goods of the parties to those treaties with united states that is reductions in tariffs on imports from one trade partner would apply to imports from all other countries with which the united states had such trade agreements3 two legislative events occurred in the 1930s that radically changed the shape and conduct of us trade policy the first was the smoothawley tariff act of 1930 pl 71361 which set prohibitively high tariff rates in response to us producers seeking protection during the height of the great depression the tariffs led to retaliatory tariffs from the major us trading partners severely restricting trade thus deepening and prolonging the effects of the depression the damaging effects of smoothawley inspired the second major trade legislative event in the 1930s congress with the guidance and encouragement of secretary of state cordell hull himself former senator developed and enacted the reciprocal trade agreements act of 1934 rtaa pl 73316 the rtaa authorized the president to negotiate reciprocal agreements that reduced tariffs within preapproved levels the tariffs were applied on an mfn basis under the rtaa congress authorized the president to implement the new tariffs by proclamation without additional legislation the rtaa is important for several reasons for the first time congress expressly delegated to the president major trade negotiating authority in so doing it is argued congress aimed to lessen the protectionist pressure on itself4 the smoothawley tariff was the last general tariff legislation passed by congress while still on the books the smoothawley tariffs are only applied to imports from those few countries namely 3 shapiro hal and lael brainard trade promotion authority formerly known as fast track building common ground on trade demands more than change the george washington international law

7980 crs4 cuba and north korea not receiving mfn status now called normal trade relations status ntr in us trade laws while delegating some authority congress in way surrendered its trade authority congress subjected the tariff negotiating authority to periodic review congress renewed presidential reciprocal trade authority eleven times until 1962 through trade agreement extension acts general tariff levels declined and their significance as trade barrier lessened5 in addition with the establishment of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt in 1948 the major forum for trade negotiations shifted from bilateral to multilateral negotiations and trade negotiations were eventually expanded beyond tariffs6 under the trade expansion act of 1962 congress granted the president authority for five years to negotiate the reduction or elimination of tariffs and expanded its role in the process by requiring the president to submit for congressional review copy of each concluded agreement and presidential statement explaining why the agreement was concluded it allowed the president to negotiate the gatt kennedy round 19631967 the last round in which tariff reduction was the primary focus of trade negotiations along with number of tariff reduction agreements which congress authorized the president to implement by proclamation the gatt countries reached agreements in two areas related to nontariff barriers ntbs that is laws and rules other than tariffs that are used to restrict imports the first was customs valuation agreement that would have required the united states to eliminate the american selling price method of pricing goods at the border the second was an antidumping agreement that would have required changes in us antidumping practices7 because us adherence to these agreements required changes in us law or regulations beyond tariff modifications many in congress concluded that the president had exceeded his authority in fact congress passed resolution in 1966 opposing nontariff commitments made by the johnson administration that had not been approved by congress setting up the debate that would eventually be resolved with the creation of the fast track authority for trade agreements8 5 shapiro and brainard trade promotion authority formerly known as fast track p 11 6 the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt went into effect in 1948 as set of rules governing international trade over time the number of gatt signatories grew and the body of rules were expanded in series of negotiations called rounds during the uruguay round the signatories agreed to establish the world trade organization wto to administer the gatt and other multilateral trade agreements the wto now has 149 members 7 destler i m renewing fasttrack legislation institute for international economics washington dc september 1997 p 6 8 destler i m american trade politics pp 7172 crs5 the creation of fast track trade authority the results of the kennedy round made evident that nontariff barriers would increasingly dominate the agenda of future multilateral trade agreements and would require changes in us law if the united states were to adhere to them congressional concern over presidential encroachment on its legislative authority prompted congress to seek legislative remedy after the expiration of the tariff modification authority in the trade expansion act of 1962 the administration sought new authority to negotiate the tokyo round in the gatt which congress granted in the trade act of 1974 pl 93618 as before the act provided the president with the authority to negotiate and implement the reduction and elimination of tariffs within certain parameters to address the issue of agreements that required changes in us law beyond tariff modifications the act stipulated that nontariff barrier agreements entered into under the statute could only enter into force if congress passed implementing legislation it was argued that subjecting implementing legislation to ordinary congressional debate and amendment procedures would defeat the purpose for delegating trade negotiating authority to the president in the first place to reduce the parochial pressures implicit in trade policymaking many members also recognized that trade partners would not be willing to negotiate agreements that would be subject to unlimited congressional debate and amendments as stated in the senate finance committee report accompanying the trade act of 1974 the committee recognizes that such agreements negotiated by the executive should be given an upordown vote by the congress our negotiators cannot be expected to accomplish the negotiating goals if there are reasonable assurances that the negotiated agreements would be voted upordown on their merits our trading partners have expressed an unwillingness to negotiate without some assurances that the congress will consider the agreements within definite timeframe9 as solution congress agreed that each chamber would suspend its ordinary legislative procedures and give trade agreements expedited treatment which became known as fast track the relevant committees would be given limited time to consider implementing bills once they reached the floor the implementing bills would be subject to timelimited debate and amendments in exchange congress required the executive branch to consult with relevant committees during the negotiations and to notify congress 90 calendar days before signing an agreement the act also provided for the accreditation of 10 members of congress as advisers to the us delegation of negotiators the trade act of 1962 had provided for five such advisers thus fast track for trade agreements was born 9 us congress senate committee on

other options by vladimir n pregelj crs6 with the trade negotiating authority and the fast track provisions of the trade act of 1974 the united states participated in the tokyo round 19731979 as expected this round resulted in number of agreements on ntbs such as government procurement practices product standards customs regulations and rules for administering antidumping and countervailing duty procedures the trade agreements act of 1979 pl 9639 was the first trade agreement bill implemented by congress under fast track procedures subsequent renewals of fast track trade authority the core provisions of the fast track procedures have remained virtually unchanged since they were first enacted the next section of this report examines fast track procedures and the trade agreements authority in more detail these provisions are ensconced in sections 151154 of the trade act of 1974 as amended and are not subject to sunset provisions the ability to use them however is subject to time limits and congress has revised them over the years the initial grant of trade negotiating authority and the authority to enact tariff modifications by proclamation under the trade act of 1974 were in effect for five years ending on january 2 1980 residual presidential authority to proclaim tariff modifications expired january 2 1982 the trade agreements act of 1979 along with implementing the tokyo round agreements the trade agreements act of 1979 extended for eight years until january 2 1988 the presidential authority to enter into agreements on nontariff barriers but made other changes to the original authority the act did not extend presidential tariff modification authority the trade and tariff act of 1984 this act amended the trade act of 1974 to provide for the negotiation and implementation of bilateral free trade agreements that both reduce or eliminate tariffs and address nontariff barriers congress was taking into account the usisrael and uscanada ftas that were under consideration the legislation waived for the usisrael fta the requirement of 90 day notification to congress prior to entering the agreement however for negotiations with other countries it required the president to notify the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee of his intention to begin fta negotiations 60 days prior to entering the negotiations and provided for denial of fast track consideration if either committee disapproved of the negotiation within 60 days after receiving the notification the act also required that agreements that lead to tariff modifications beyond certain threshold be subject to congressional approval via implementing legislation omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 otca the otca extended the presidents authority to enter into trade agreements before june 1 1993 but extended the application of fast track procedures only for agreements entered into before june 1 1991 legislation for agreements entered into after that date but before june 1 1993 could be approved under fast track procedures if the president requested an extension of such authority and it was not disapproved by either the house or the senate the president requested the extension which survived proposed house and senate resolutions of disapproval the otca also provided that congress could withhold trade agreement from fast track crs7 consideration by passing resolutions of disapproval if it determined that the ustr had failed to consult with congress adequately during the trade negotiations under the otca provisions congress passed implementing legislation for the north american free trade agreement nafta in 1993 pl 103182 however negotiations under the uruguay round of the gatt were not going to finish in time to meet the june 1 1993 expiration deadline congress therefore passed hr 1876 signed by the president on july 2 1993 pl 10349 extending the authority and implementing procedures until april 16 1994 for the uruguay round agreements the votes reflected strong congressional support for extending the authority in the house 295126 and in the senate 7616 the law did not change any other aspects of the fast track authority hiatus after the fast track authority expired on april 16 1994 congress did not approve new authority until the trade act of 2002 hr 3009 pl 107210 the eightyear period was the longest hiatus since fast track was initially approved in 1974 in 1997 both the senate finance and the house ways and means committees reported out legislation to renew fast track house republican leaders pulled it before floor vote at the request of the clinton administration because it lacked sufficient support in the house in september 1998 the house voted on fast track authority legislation but the bill failed to pass 180243 several reasons may explain the failure of the clinton administration and congress to get fast track procedures reauthorized for one although both the republican congressional leadership and the clinton administration wanted fast track authority the two sides could not agree on how labor and environmental issues should be addressed in trade agreements negotiated under renewed authority republicans wanted limited coverage while the clinton administration and many democrats in congress preferred broader coverage in addition the wto failed to launch new round of negotiations at the 1999 ministerial meeting in seattle and therefore major trade negotiations were underway that might have made the adoption of fast track statute political priority the bipartisan trade promotion authority act of 2002 in 2001 president bush requested renewal of fast track authority which was renamed in the legislation trade promotion authority tpa in part to counter negative connotation associated with the fast track name the renewed authority is contained in the bipartisan trade promotion authority act btpaa of 2002 which was enacted as title xxi of the trade act of 2002 pl 107210 the structure of tpa is consistent with previous negotiating authority it includes environmental and labor provisions as principal negotiating objectives but does not mandate the inclusion of minimal enforceable labor standards in trade agreements10 the lack of mandate to include such standards was the source of much of the opposition from labor groups and many members of congress the act 10 devereaux charan robert z lawrence and michael d watkins case studies in us trade negotiation volume 1 making the rules institute for international economics washington dc september 2006 p 229 crs8 also created new mechanism for congressional consultation the congressional oversight group cog to operate in addition to the congressional trade advisors that have been appointed under previous versions more detailed discussion of the notification and consultation requirements appears in the next section the original house version of the btpaa hr 3005 passed by one vote 215 214 largely along party lines with republicans mostly supporting the bill and democrats largely opposing it the legislation was combined in the senate with the renewal of trade adjustment assistance taa the andean trade preference act atpa and the generalized system of preferences gsp it passed 66 to 30 the conference report on the final bill hr 3009 the trade act of 2002 was adopted by the house 215212 and senate 643411 under the 2002 version of tpa congress approved implementing legislation for ftas with chile singapore australia morocco the dominican republic the central american countries bahrain oman and peru in addition the united states signed ftas with colombia panama and south korea just before tpa expired on july 1 2007 the united states is also interested in fta negotiations with malaysia thailand the united arab emirates and the members of the south african customs union sacu which are currently suspended and would have to be taken up under some future tpa authority for legislation to considered under expedited procedures the united states and more than 150 other members of the wto are also engaged the doha development agenda dda protracted round of multilateral negotiations set to revise and expand rules for conducting trade in agriculture manufactured goods and services with an emphasis on meeting the needs of developing countries12 although many argue that tpa is necessary for the us bargaining position to remain credible others note that tpa is not required to complete the negotiations as the example of the uruguay round discussed above suggests should breakthrough be made on an agreement that the us congress would approve congress could extend tpa exclusively for the doha round at any time most observers acknowledge that the doha round probably makes the most compelling argument for tpa extension at this time the elements of tpa through tpa in its various iterations congress has sought to achieve four major goals in the context of supporting trade negotiations 1 to define its trade policy priorities and to have those priorities reflected in trade agreement negotiating objectives 2 to ensure that the executive branch adheres to these objectives by requiring periodic notification and consultation 3 to define the terms conditions and procedures under which trade agreement implementing bills will be approved 11 for details on votes on this legislation see crs report rs21004 trade promotion authority and fast track negotiating authority for trade agreements major votes by carolyn c smith 12 for more information on current us trade negotiations see crs report rl33463 trade negotiations during the 110th congress by ian f fergusson crs9 and 4 to reaffirm congresss overall constitutional authority over trade by placing limitations on the trade agreements authority these four goals and some important procedural precedents that fall outside the formal legal tpa process are examined below negotiating objectives congress exercises its trade policy role in part by defining trade negotiation objectives in tpa legislation in the 2002 tpa congress made clear that trade is an important aspect of us foreign economic and security policy because it generates broad benefits for the united states and the global economy to take the fullest advantage of these benefits congress drawing on its constitutional authority and historical precedent defined the objectives that the president is to pursue in trade negotiations although the executive branch has some discretion over implementing these goals they are definitive statements of us trade policy that the administration is expected to honor if it expects the trade legislation to be considered under expedited rules for this reason trade negotiating objectives stand at the center of the congressional debate on tpa congress establishes trade negotiating objectives in three categories 1 overall objectives 2 principal objectives and 3 other priorities these begin with broadly focused goals that encapsulate the overall direction trade negotiations are expected to take such as enhancing us and global economies principal objectives are far more specific and provide detailed goals that congress expects to be integrated into trade agreements such as reducing barriers to various types of trade eg goods services agriculture electronic commerce protecting foreign investment and intellectual property rights encouraging transparency fair regulatory practices and anticorruption ensuring that countries protect environment and labor conditions and rights providing for an effective dispute settlement process and protecting the us right to enforce its trade remedy laws objectives also include an important obligation to consult congress discussed in detail below in the past language defining trade negotiating objectives has been highly contested contributing to the 2002 renewal controversy in which tpa passed virtually along partisan lines and by only the narrowest of margins13 this controversy reflects the importance of tpa negotiating objectives as template for future trade agreements negotiated under these guidelines for example if the language of tpa objective is highly contentious it stands to reason that the same issue may prove even more acerbic when specific trade agreement is brought before congress for approval the labor provisions which are emphasized repeatedly in all three groups of negotiating objectives provide the best illustration in particular the decision not to include minimal enforceable standards anywhere in tpa caused acrimonious debate over both tpa and the ftas that later adopted the tpa language on labor this issue was perhaps most evident in the debate on the dominican republiccentral americaunited states free trade agreement caftadr 13 for summary of bills authorizing tpa and trade agreements approved under its provisions see crs report rs21004 trade promotion authority and fasttrack negotiating authority for trade agreements major votes by carolyn c smith crs10 because the structure of trade agreements mirrors tpa objectives and highly disputed agreements based on those objectives brought before congress under tpa have so far survived often narrowly all challenges from opponents the vote on renewing tpafast track is among the most critical trade votes congress takes in part for this reason key members of the 110th congress have indicated preference for proceeding cautiously in pursuing tpa renewal notification and consultation the trade agreements authority is extended to the president provided he consults regularly with congress including the congressional oversight group cog created in the 2002 trade act whose members are accredited as official advisors to the trade negotiation delegations notification and consultation requirements have been expanded in each renewal of authority most of these requirements are found in their own section within the tpa statute the timing of these notifications is detailed in the time line presented in appendix first the president must conduct certain notifications and consultations before negotiations begin that include 1 notifying congress in writing of his intention to enter into negotiations at least 90 calendar days prior to commencing negotiations 2 consulting with the house ways and means senate finance other relevant committees and the cog on the nature of the negotiations and 3 providing special consultations on agriculture import sensitive agricultural products fishing and textile industry tariffs and other issues the president must also conduct specific notifications and consultations before and after agreements are entered into signed to include 1 notifying congress in writing of his intention to enter into an agreement at least 90 calendar days prior to doing so 2 consulting with house ways and means senate finance other relevant committees and the cog with respect to the nature of the agreement how it achieves the purposes defined in tpa and any potential effects it may have on existing laws 3 notifying the revenue committees at least 180 calendar days prior to entering into the agreement of any potential changes to us trade remedy laws that may be required 4 submitting private sector advisory committee reports to congress the president and the ustr later than 30 calendar days after notifying congress of his intention to enter into an agreement14 14 the private sector advisory system was established by congress in 1974 to ensure that us trade policy and negotiations benefit from and reflect broad array of private sector continued crs11 5 providing the us international trade commission usitc with trade agreement details at least 90 days before entering into an agreement and 6 presenting the usitc report on the impact of the agreement on the us economy to congress later than 90 calendar days after the president enters into the agreement the congressional consultation process is an important part of tpa it reflects congresss ongoing interest in ensuring that trade policy remains under the purview of the legislative branch by establishing in law opportunities to affect the nature and direction of trade negotiations the effectiveness of the consultation process however has been questioned the government accountability office gao evaluated this process based on multiple interviews with current and former congressional staff and executive branch employees it found that from 2002 to 2007 the ustr had conducted extensive consultations with members and staff of congress on all ftas that were to be presented to congress for approval under tpa15 majority of congressional staff however indicated that despite the frequency and high quality of information conveyed the meetings with ustr officials often did not allow for sufficient time to provide input into the negotiation process were often cast more as briefings than true consultations that imply an exchange of views and did not always include last minute changes to draft fta texts in short there was ongoing concern expressed that the congressional consultation process may need to be amended to allow for greater congressional input into the crafting of ftas16 trade agreements authority and implementation as discussed above when the statutory authority to negotiate trade agreements was limited to reducing tariffs the trade agreement was implemented by presidential proclamation and without further congressional action provided the tariff rate reductions were within legislatively preapproved limits this process changed when trade negotiations were expanded to include nontariff barriers ntbs these more complex agreements led congress to tighten its control over trade policy by establishing fast track trade negotiating authority as set out in the trade act of 14 continued us interests it consists of 27 committees and over 700 advisors coordinated by the office of the united states trade representative ustr 2006 trade policy agenda and 2005 annual report of the president of the united states on the trade agreements program

with passage of implementing legislation17 at the heart of what is now called tpa are the expedited rules for moving such trade implementing legislation through congress which have been used for nearly all reciprocal trade agreements18 importantly the fast track procedures are rules of the house and senate either house may change them at any time with majority vote19 congress makes these expedited procedures available for trade implementing bill provided the president uses the trade agreements authority granted to him to the satisfaction of congress first by entering into agreements that meet tpas overall and principal negotiating objectives and second by satisfying the notification and consultation requirements in addition under the trade agreements authority section congress requires that the president 1 as mentioned above at least calendar 90 days prior to signing the agreement notify congress of his intention to do so to provide opportunity for congressional input before the agreement is signed at which point it can longer be changed 2 within 60 calendar days of signing the agreement provide congress with list of required changes to us law needed for the united states to be in compliance with the agreement and 3 on day congress is in session send copy of the final legal text of the trade agreement draft implementing bill statement 17 under tpa reciprocal ftas and multilateral ntb agreements that go beyond tariff reductions are treated as congressionalexecutive agreements which require the approval of both houses of congress such approval expresses congress consent to bind the united states to the commitments of the agreement under international law this type of agreement is distinguished from both the executive agreement requiring only presidential action and the treaty requiring twothirds vote of the senate because reciprocal trade agreements typically result in tariff rate revenue changes the house of representatives is necessarily involved for more detailed legal discussion see crs report 97896 why certain trade agreements are approved as congressionalexecutive agreements rather than as treaties by jeanne j grimmett and shapiro hal s fast track legal historical and political analysis ardsley ny transnational publishers 2006 p 22 18 the usjordan free trade agreement is the exception 19 indeed the house actually did just that on april 10 2008 when it approved 224195 h res1092 that measure states that sections 151 e1 and section 151 f1 of the trade act of 1974 would not apply to hr 5724 the implementing legislation for the us colombia fta section 151 establishes the expedited fasttrack procedures section 151e1 establishes the time limits for committee and floor consideration of the implementing bill section 151f1 establishes the procedures for consideration of motion in the house for consideration of the implementing bill other elements of the expedited procedures for example the prohibition on amendments to the implementing bill section 151 d would still apply to hr 5724 also hres 1092 only applies to the us colombia fta implementing bill and not to implementing bills for other ftas such as panama and south korea if and when the president submits them to congress crs13 of administrative action proposed to implement the agreement and supporting statements on how the agreement meets congressional objectives changes existing agreements and serves the purpose of us commercial interests as an important caveat the tpa expedited procedures are extended only to implementing bills with provisions limited to those necessary or appropriate to implement the trade agreements either repealing or amending existing laws or providing new statutory authority this requirement presumably limits the implementing bill to provisions related to the pending trade agreement although the meaning of necessary or appropriate has been subject to debate should these requirements be fulfilled to the satisfaction of congress it has agreed to follow certain expedited legislative procedures in effect these rules require that congress must act on the bill sent over by the white house and in other ways represent significant departure from ordinary legislative procedures the rules are defined below see appendix b for greater detail and involve 1 mandatory introduction of the implementing bill in both houses of congress and immediate referral to the appropriate committees house ways and means senate finance and possibly others20 2 automatic discharge from house and senate committees after limited period of time 3 limited floor debate and 4 amendment meaning that congress must vote either up or down on the bill which passes with simple majority congressional procedures outside tpa in addition to the expedited procedures defined in tpa congress with the effective consent of the executive branch has followed certain procedures during the consideration of trade agreement implementing bills that although not formally defined in tpa have been integrated into the process of congressional approval of trade agreements three in particular stand out side agreements and letters outside of formal tpa statutory requirements congress has insisted on additions or clarifications to trade agreements this insistence has resulted at times in side agreements and letters side agreements are additional obligations accepted by all parties after the original trade agreement has been signed the most notable examples are the environment and labor side agreements of nafta21 side letters serve as clarifying devices 20 additional referrals depend on whether there are provisions in the agreement that require changes in law under the jurisdiction of other committees 21 interestingly while congress authorized funding for us contributions and for continued crs14 usually applied to very specific issue and that can be used to assuage particular congressional concern side letters are typically addressed from and to the top trade negotiating representative eg the ustr trade minister or equivalent side agreements and letters accompany the agreement but neither changes its text and both require official signatures of all the negotiating parties to come into force hearings and mock markups congress has insisted on reviewing the negotiated trade agreement prior to the implementing bill being introduced this is done first in hearings before the house ways and means and senate finance committees as well as possibly other interested committees the ways and means and finance committees typically follow with an informal or mock markup on an informal draft version of the implementing bill which is sent over by the white house along with draft of the final text of the trade agreement the informal mockup is in effect test run of congressional response to the trade bill because it is only an informal draft bill there is real legislation to mark up but the meetings afford committee members an opportunity to comment on the draft trade agreement as well as the informal draft implementing legislation and offer amendments that serve as important signals to the administration of changes to the implementing bill they would like to see made the two revenue committees may also decide to hold mock conference to reconcile any differences in their mock markups although the agreement at this point has already been concluded clarification or translation of key points that do not alter the basic agreement can be made in the final implementing bill22 the administration however can exercise discretion in accepting suggested changes from congress for example while the committees offered many changes to the caftadr agreement that the bush administration tried to accommodate the administration declined to include the language of an amendment unanimously supported by the senate finance committee with respect to the usoman fta implementing legislation citing tpas own requirement that only legislation necessary or appropriate to implement the agreement be included the oman bill passed but new bipartisan call for better consultation prior to the president entering into trade agreement arose because of dissatisfaction with both the oman fta and the tpa process23 informal agreements some members of congress have also relied on promises from the administration to address issues raised in mock markups these often relate to special interests and concerns and their fulfillment relies on measure of good will between congress and the administration in the case of the cafta 21 continued participation in the administrative bodies created by the nafta side agreements it did not expressly approve the agreements themselves see 19 usc sections 34713472 22 this idea is elaborated in vangrasster craig is the fast track really necessary journal of world trade vol 31 2 april 1997 p 106 23 inside trade grassley presses ustr to improve consultations on ftas july 7 2006 crs15 dr implementing bill for example the bush administration made accommodations to sugar textile and labor interests to secure congressional support24 limiting trade agreements authority congress adopted tpa rules on pragmatic grounds as selflimiting conditions to prevent trade implementing bills from being delayed or obstructed by congressional procedures that can either keep bill from moving out of committee or delay it on the floor of the house or senate with extended debate trade agreements can also be the product of fragile consensus between trade partners and tpa procedures were designed to protect such consensus from unraveling due to congressional amendments that would change the basic agreement in crafting tpa however congress did not agree to surrender its constitutional authority over trade matters and wrote into tpa number of provisions that can limit the use of the expedited procedures sunset provision each renewal of the trade agreements authority has provided the use of expedited procedures for trade agreement implementing bills for limited time the 2002 statute made these procedures available for trade agreements entered into before july 1 2007 importantly however the act provides deadline for submitting implementing legislation for the agreement if it is entered into before the july 1 deadline extension disapproval tpa legislation requires that the president request an extension of the tpa authority after certain period of time the extension is granted unless either house of congress adopts disapproval resolution such resolution of disapproval may not be considered unless it is reported out of either the house ways and means or senate finance committee although such resolutions have been reported out of committee in the past none has been passed in either house of congress this process is reminder to the executive branch that the availability of expedited legislative procedures is congressional prerogative that can be denied if congress becomes dissatisfied with how the president has conducted trade agreement negotiations procedural disapproval the requirement that the president fulfill consultation and reporting obligations also helps preserve the congressional role on trade agreements by giving congress the opportunity to influence the agreement before it is finalized should congress determine that the president has failed to meet these requirements it may decide that the implementing bill is not eligible to be considered under tpa rules it would implement this decision by adopting joint procedural disapproval resolution in both houses of congress withdrawal of expedited procedures the trade act of 1974 as amended provides that the expedited procedures for consideration of trade implementing bills are enacted as rules of procedures for each house with the full recognition of the constitutional right of either house to change the rules so far as 24 for details see crs report rl31870 the dominican republiccentral americaunited states free trade agreement caftadr by j f hornbeck crs16 relating to the procedure of that house at any time25 that is congress reserves its constitutional right to withdraw or override the fast track rule which can take effect with vote by either house of congress26 this summary suggests that in addition to binding rules the longterm success of tpa rests on cooperative spirit and partnership between the legislative and executive branches of government and by extension between the two major political parties27 many have noted that the sense of such cooperation was absent under the previous tpa placing strain on the trade legislative process in recent years in fact bipartisan agreement on tpa has been absent since at least 1993 as evident in the eightyear lapse during the clinton administration and the highly partisan passage of the 2002 tpa renewal the current dissatisfaction with tpa results from philosophical differences that have developed in part along partisan lines and raises the distinct possibility that tpa now lapsed once again may not be renewed issues for congress tpa expired on july 1 2007 and is currently not available for the potentially most important trade agreement still under negotiation the wto multilateral doha development round as well as any future bilateral ftas president bush formally requested tpa renewal on january 31 2007 and the congressional response ranged from immediate support to deferred consideration of approval and outright opposition currently the democratic leadership has signaled that tpa renewal is not priority for the immediate legislative agenda28 reluctance to take up tpa renewal rests with number of concerns first increasingly congress is focused on addressing the negative effects of trade policy and more broadly globalization job displacement falling wages the growing income gap in the united states and developing countries and the us trade deficit all reinforce an overall sense that the costs and benefits of trade are not being distributed equally and that legislative policy responses in this area should be paramount congress has responded by insisting on significant changes to bilateral ftas and introducing new trade adjustment assistance bills importantly each of the issues mentioned above has causes and potential policy responses rooted as much or 25 section 151a2 of the trade act of 1974 pl 93618 26 see shapiro fast track legal historical and political analysis p 28 27 see carrier michael all

also displeased with the perceived inadequate enforcement of trade obligations undertaken by china and other us trade partners it has been further suggested that the united states reprioritize the list of potential bilateral fta countries with perhaps new emphasis on japan the european union and other large economies insisting on linking revised trade priorities to tpa renewal may be another way for congress to exercise its authority over trade policy third the democratic leadership has indicated that tpa renewal will require lengthy deliberations to craft new model for future us trade policy one likely to incorporate the key provisions of the new trade policy of america among others there is perceived need to rush consideration of such complex issue at this time particularly given the slow pace at which the doha round is progressing the continuing debate on tpa renewal shaped by these and other factors may focus on number of specific issues reflecting unresolved concerns over the tpa process in general and trade policy issues of particular interest to congress the need for tpa recurring question is whether tpa is really necessary one way to explore this issue is to consider the alternatives first given the breadth and scope of modern trade accords executive agreements are generally an insufficient means for fully implementing trade agreements where the amendment repeal or enactment of new laws is required second the treaty approach presents two problems the high hurdle of twothirds vote of approval in the us senate and lack of house action for an agreement involving revenue30 further congress has long considered us trade agreements to be nonselfexecuting that is requiring implementing legislation if existing law is insufficient to carry out agreement obligations31 because legislative action involving both houses of congress is needed the options appear limited to either tpa approach or relying on ordinary rules of procedure to consider trade implementing legislation to date the challenge of representing the diverse interests of numerous economic stakeholders has several times led congress back to the idea of using carefully structured timelimited grant of trade agreements authority subject to implementing legislation being considered under streamlined legislative rules despite the fact that strategically important but commercially insignificant fta with jordan was approved without tpa some of the debate over the need for renewal may hinge on how important congress 29 one suggested list of domestic policy options is presented in

states to continue trade negotiations in world that will continue to integrate irrespective of us policy the role of congress if the success of tpa were to be measured simply by the number of trade agreements that have been approved and implemented under its authority then it might be argued that tpa has proven its merit many members of congress however have complained that in recent years the tpa process has failed demonstrating that binding congressional rules of procedure are not sufficient to guarantee consensus position or cooperative working arrangement on trade32 such criticism is largely but not exclusively made along partisan lines complaints point to multiple problems 1 trade negotiation objectives that do not include all key concerns of congress eg enforceable labor standards and are open to interpretation by the executive branch 2 an executive branch consultation process including the cog denounced as superficial and unresponsive to congressional input 3 the passage of widely unpopular ftas negotiated under tpa authority and 4 ineffectiveness of procedures for deterring the use of tpa eg the extension disapproval resolution and repeal of fast track rules because power has at times been held closely through partisan control of committee chairs33 in short there has been growing sense for the need to rekindle trust between the administration and congress as well as ensure greater bipartisan cooperation within congress on trade matters trade policy issues many specific trade issues are likely to emerge in the course of congressional debate over tpa renewal the current congressional debate and those over recent trade agreements point to numerous issues labor environment and public health standards trade adjustment assistance trade remedy laws and the temporary entry of service providers known as mode4 labor standards perhaps the single most contentious specific trade issue for tpa renewal particularly in the house has been the treatment of labor standards they have been included as negotiating objectives in fast tracktpa authority since the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 the partisan differences were evident in two competing bills offered during the 2002 renewal and they are still reflected today34 hr 3009 introduced by thenhouse ways and means committee chairman thomas was eventually enacted as the bipartisan

labor standards that would be enforceable with trade sanctions equal to those applied to commercial and other disputes under trade agreement replacing the does not fail to effectively enforce its own laws language with mandatory adherence to ilo core labor standards has been major difference to be resolved enforcing such adherence through trade sanctions is second major difference congressional leaders and the bush administration have attempted to bridge these differences through the mandatory framework included in the new trade policy for america the first legislative test of this compromise language was congressional implementing legislation for the bilateral fta with peru approved by congress in december 2007 language reflecting key elements of the compromise framework is also contained in proposed ftas with colombia panama and south korea the next question is whether such language might be incorporated into new tpa environment and public health the new trade policy for america also provided the basis for key changes to environment and public health commitments in bilateral ftas that may also be germane to new tpa it calls for signatory countries to us ftas to adopt and enforce multiple multilateral environmental agreements meas in support of international policies designed to address global warming and other hazards changes to patent and data exclusivity provisions in intellectual property rights chapters hold out the promise for developing countries that sign an fta with the united states to have potentially quicker access to generic medicines trade adjustment assistance major congressional response to those who do not benefit from trade liberalization is trade adjustment assistance taa in the past the program has focused primarily on workers and has been funded and administered through the us department of labor other programs also exist including small one for firms administered by the us department of commerce because the effects of globalization and particularly trade liberalization both positive and negative can be far reaching there is growing interest in developing more comprehensive and effective alternatives to taa programs which congress has not conceptually changed since created in the trade expansion act of 1962 pl87794 this concept might include expanding the program to the services sector or other groups negatively affected by globalization and has been identified as key legislative initiative in the new trade policy for america trade remedy laws congress has repeatedly expressed bipartisan interest in ensuring that trade negotiations do not hinder or restrain the use of us trade remedy laws specifically in the previous tpa congress required trade agreements crs20 to preserve the ability of the united states to enforce rigorously its trade laws including the antidumping countervailing duty and safeguard laws and avoid agreements that lessen the effectiveness of domestic and international disciplines on unfair trade it can be understood in light of the institutional responsibility congress has had toward safeguarding the interests of constituents35 despite such clear message from congress the bush administration included trade remedy laws as part of the doha round arguing that doing so was necessary to get developing countries to join the negotiations many members of congress subsequently criticized this step individual us trading partners have also demanded that trade remedy laws be part of us bilateral fta negotiations temporary entry of service providers mode 4 the temporary movement of service providers to the home country of the buyer of the services known in the wto as mode4 has been contentious issue in various trade negotiations particularly the doha round negotiations on services several developing countries especially india have criticized the united states for not providing greater latitude in the temporary movement of professional services providers to the united states mode4 is also an issue of congressional jurisdiction in july 2003 during congressional consideration of the implementing bills for the uschile and us singapore free trade agreements some members of the house and senate judiciary committees objected to the inclusion of changes in us visa policies to allow increases in the quotas of workers entering the united states they argued that changes in visa rules must be separate from trade legislation that is considered by congress under expedited fast track procedures compromises were reached to allow the two bills to be voted on but not without bipartisan warnings from both committees that changes in visa policy should longer be part of bilateral or multilateral trade agreements36 options for congress with the expiration of tpa on july 1 2007 congress has number of options with respect to its possible renewal four that span the spectrum are discussed below tpa renewal congress at present does not appear ready to extend or renew tpa although the lack of tpa may delay action on future reciprocal trade agreements many sector specific and other more narrowly targeted agreements have been concluded in the past without tpa the united states has also launched trade negotiations prior to 35 pastor congress and the politics of us foreign economic policy 19291976 pp 5658 36 for more information on immigration issues and trade agreements see crs report rl32982 immigration issues in trade agreements by ruth ellen wasem crs21 having tpa authority in place both situations suggest that the conduct of us trade negotiations can continue in some form without tpa still trade partners may be reluctant to negotiate with the united states without tpa since the agreement would be subject to ordinary legislative procedures and amendment by congress therefore one question that congress faces is whether there are potential trade agreements outstanding that may compel consideration of tpa extension or renewal extend tpa temporarily congress could extend the current tpa with few or revisions long enough to allow the united states to complete specific agreement this approach might be favored by those who are reluctant to renew the authority but do not want to hinder the completion of agreements that they view as potentially beneficial to the united states for example congress extended the authority for 10 months in 1993 to complete the uruguay round agreements and could do so again for the doha round37 in as much as labor and environment provisions are not being contemplated as part of the doha negotiations congress could extend tpa for the sole purpose of concluding the multilateral agreement perhaps without compromising the concerns of those members who support stronger labor environment public health and other provisions in bilateral ftas renew tpa authority under this option congress could grant the president new authority with or without major changes in its structure and without restricting it to specific agreement negotiations such an approach would give more time to complete pending trade negotiations and allow for the opportunity to launch new negotiations in so doing this option would provide the president with the flexibility to implement complex trade negotiating agenda congressional action on this approach implies however that political agreement could be struck on the overall framework of trade agreements objectives and negotiating priorities among majority in congress and between congress and the president grant permanent tpa authority some trade policy experts have suggested that congress could grant the president form of permanent fast tracktpa38 the proponents of this option envision twotier procedure 1 congress would enact into law permanent fast track procedures and 2 before specific negotiations can begin both houses of congress would have to pass resolution approving the negotiations and objectives designed for the specific set of negotiations step 2 is designed to satisfy those who might be concerned that congress could be surrendering its authority permanently 37 some have argued that the circumstances at that time were different from what they are now because the trade authority had more support in congress 38 see for example destler i m renewing fasttrack legislation institute for international economics washington september 1997 pp 4143 and mastel greg and hal shapiro fast track forever the international economy summer 2006 pp 5455 crs22 supporters argue that the permanent authority would signal to trade partners that the united states is committed to trade liberalization over the long term the prior approval procedure for specific negotiations might address the concern that this option could result in giving the president blank check to negotiate ftas with any country he chooses one criticism of this approach is that congress might not be willing to give permanent authority even with the required preapproval process prospects for tpa renewal the 110th congress began the tpa renewal debate early but then shifted focus to addressing the key issues of pending bilateral ftas with peru panama colombia and south korea each was signed in time to be considered under the 2002 tpa authority the remaining outstanding case for nearterm renewal of tpa is the doha round although the ustr continues to argue that the lack of tpa could delay future bilateral negotiations as well and in any case other countries will continue to negotiate trade agreements irrespective of us policy it falls to congress to weigh the costs and benefits of when and if to consider tpa renewal as part of the us trade policy agenda the tpa decision will also have significant implications for defining the future of the congressionalexecutive relationship for the rest of the bush administration and perhaps beyond the outlook is far from clear however given the many controversies that surround tpa and the numerous factors that may influence congresss decision of how or if to act crs23 appendix timeline for negotiation congressional consultation and legislative implementation of trade agreements under tpa crs24 appendix b short guide to the expedited legislative procedures for passage of trade implementing bills under tpa39 i before the formal tpa expedited procedures come into play the house ways and means and senate finance committees typically hold mock markups on informal drafts of the implementing legislation voting to approve or disapprove the vote and any amendments to the draft legislation however are not binding on the administration these meetings provide the last opportunity to make recommendations to the administration before it sends final implementing legislation to congress which initiates the expedited procedures ii the president sends final legal draft text of the trade agreement and draft implementing bill with supporting materials to congress on day that it is in session the draft bill may or may not reflect some or all of any amendments adopted by committees in the mock markup iii identical bills are subject to mandatory introduction in each house of congress on the day received the bills are referred to the house ways and means and senate finance committees jointly with others if jurisdiction warrants40 iv each committee has 45 in session days to report the bill or it is automatically discharged and the bill is placed on the appropriate calendar41 an implementing bill subject to tpa procedures is likely to be revenue bill in which case the constitution requires that the senate ultimately act on the house bill under these conditions the senate finance committee has until the later of the 45th day of session after the senate bill is introduced or the 15th day of session after the senate receives the house bill v in each house after the implementing bill is reported or discharged any member may offer nondebatable motion to consider it debate is limited to 20 hours evenly divided between those for and against the measure cannot be amended and motion or unanimousconsent request to suspend this restriction is not in order if the chamber has not completed floor action by the 15th day after the bill is reported or discharged any member may bring it to vote vi bill passes by simple majority under the statute whichever house acts second typically the senate assuming the bill is revenue bill considers and debates its own bill but takes its final vote on the bill received from the other 39 title xxi of the trade act of 2002 pl 107210 and section 151 of the trade act of 1974 as amended 40 for example the uschile free trade agreement implementing bill contained provision affecting immigration law requiring the bill to be referred to the house and senate judiciary committees 41 cumulatively the whole process can take as long as 90 in session days potentially lasting many months crs25 house typically the house of representatives42 this procedure ensures that both houses will ultimately act on the same measure thereby clearing it to be presented to the president without the need for conference once the implementing bill is signed under its terms the agreement enters into force for the united states by presidential proclamation 42 in fact the senate can act and has acted on its own bill before receiving the house bill in the case of the chile fta implementing bill the senate finance committee reported out first when the house bill which was identical came over it was put on the senate calendar directly for the caftadr bill the senate actually voted first on its own bill necessitating later procedural vote to substitute the identical language of the senate bill into the housepassed bill when received these proceedings in the senate permitted final action to occur on the house measure as constitutionally required for other versions of this document see
