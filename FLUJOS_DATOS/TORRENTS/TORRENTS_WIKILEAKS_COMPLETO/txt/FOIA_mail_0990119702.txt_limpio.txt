say is of course true but we have to start somewhere step 1 is producing reconstruction without some reasonable estimate of uncertainty reconstruction isnt very useful in my opinion step 2 is producing some reasonable estimate of uncertainty in my mind this is based on looking at the calibration residuals seeing if they pass some basic tests for whiteness normality etc looking at the verification statistics and seeing if this continues to hold up in an independent sample it is important to use the longest instrumental records we have for independent verification where possible of course there may be additional biases in the predictors that are difficult to identify even in relatively long verification interval eg ultra lowfrequency problems w fidelity step 3 is trying to evaluate this as best we can looking at the frequency domain structure of the predictors themselves seeing if there is loss of variance at very long timescales looking at the robustness of longterm trends to standardization issues etc etci see this as successive series of diagnostics and selfconsistency checks that iterate towards getting reasonable handle on the uncertainties this is the approach that we have taken and i think it is the most appropriate i firmly believe that reconstruction w out some reasonable estimate of uncertainty is almost useless if the community wants to use paleodata for signal detection model validation etc i believe that this is absolutely essential to do whether or not we can do perfect job i would be very surprised if hans would disagree w my statement above anyways my two cents on the matter mike at 0950 am 51701 0400 ed cook wrote hi juerg ive done an admittedly quick read of your paper extending nao reconstructions back to ad 1500 and find it to be fine overall one slight correction on pg 3 concerning the cook et 1998 recon the treering records used also included some from england as well as the eastern us and northern fennoscandia on pg 10 sentence 89 in conclusions the wording is little confusing you say including station pressure of gibraltar and reykjavik as predictors in 1821 lead to decrease of the confidence estimates this almost sounds like you are doing worse when adding in gibraltar and reykjavik when i know you mean the opposite so change in wording to something like lead to increased confidence in the estimates of monthly nao also in table 1 is the cullen r4 nao reconstruction the one with instrumental data in it if so it has used some of the same data as yours i dont recall if r4 is the one with instrumental data but if it is you ought to mention that on thematic note that doesnt have much direct bearing on the paper as it stands now but which may be of interest to keith phil and mike as well i have growing doubts about the validity and use of error estimates that are being applied to reconstructions such as those you have applied in fig 3 first as you say at the end of the paper there is clear frequency dependence in the strength of relationship between the actual and proxyestimated data that is not being considered ie the become smaller when considering lowpass filtered time series pg 10 the assumption of the error estimates as now estimated and applied is that the error variance is truly white noise ie equally distributed across all frequencies that is surely not the case this is different from questions about autocorrelated residuals which tell you nothing about the frequency dependence of the quality of the estimates this is where classic regression theory falls down it is based on the notion that each observation is random sample with time history or frequency domain structure when we use long time series of observations climate or proxy to reconstruct some climate variable we are also using predictors that have time series structure and history that cannot vary in completely random fashion even if the data could be completely resampled this is because they represent series of prior observations of climaticenvironmental conditions this lack of randomness of the observations used for reconstructing past climate again causes to doubt the validity of the error estimates being applied the degree to which the reconstruction can actually vary from year to year within the prescribed error limits is itself constrained by the time history of the observations themselves used for reconstruction in contrast the 2se limits in your fig 3 prior to 1821 contain almost all of the estimates this result could be used to claim that there is effectively useful time history of variation in the nao reconstruction prior to 1821 because each estimate may fall with equal probability anywhere in the error envelop i would regard this interpretation as completely wrong thus i would say that the decadal period of aboveaverage winter nao in your reconstruction around ad 1700 is real assuming that the predictors used are providing unbiased estimates even though it is fully enclosed by the 2se limits that intersect zero this is getting towards the debate with von storch over most probable estimates i am probably not explaining myself well here and undoubtedly need to think more about it but i really think that error bars as often presented may potentially distort and unfairly degrade the interpreted quality of reconstructions so are the error bars better than nothing im not so sure cheers ed hello ed thanks very much for your nice mail i hope these little comments were useful for you and yes of course we hope too that we can merge the data base sometime later on this would be great do you think that you could send some comments on our paper by tomorrow is your paper for the orense book many greetings and till later juerg dr edward r
