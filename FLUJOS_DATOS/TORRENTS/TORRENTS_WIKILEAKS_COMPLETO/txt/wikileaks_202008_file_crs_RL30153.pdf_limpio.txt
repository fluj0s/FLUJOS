policy resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30153critical infrastructures background policy and implementation summary the nations health wealth and security rely on the production and distribution of certain goods and services the array of physical assets f unctions and systems across which these goods and services move are called critical infrastructures eg electricity the power plants that generate it and the electric grid upon which it is distributed the national security community has b een concerned for sometime about the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to both physical and cyber attack in may 1998 president clinton released presidential d ecision directive 63 the directive set up groups within the federal government to develop and implement plans that would protect governmentoperated infrastruct ures and called for dialogue between government and the private sector to velop national infrastructure assurance plan that would protect all of the nation s critical infrastructures by the year 2003 while the directive called for both physi cal and cyber protection from both man made and natural events implementation focused on cyber protection against man made cyber events ie computer hacker s however given the physical damage caused by the september 11 attacks physical protections of critical infrastructures has received increased attention following the events of september 11 the bush administration released executive order 13228 signed october 8 2001 establishing the office of homeland security among its duties the office shall coordinate efforts to protect the united states and its critical infrastructure from the consequences of terrorist attacks in november 2002 congress passed legislation creating department of homeland security among its responsibilities is overa ll coordination of critical infrastructure protection activities in december 2003 the bush administration released homeland security presidential dir ective 7 reiterating and expanding upon infrastructure protection policy and re sponsibilities in june 2006 the bush administration released national infrastructure protection plan this plan presents the process by which the depa rtment of homeland security intends to identify those specific assets most critical to the united states across all sectors based on the risk associated with their loss to attack or natural disaster and then to prioritize activities aimed at maximizing the reduction of those risks for given investment this report discusses in more detail the evolution of national critical infrastructure policy and the institutional structures established to implement it the report highlights five issues of congressi onal concern identifying critical

july 17 1996 pp 37473750 concern about the security of the nations information infrastructure and the nations dependence on it preceded the establishment of the commission 8 given the growing dependence and interconn ectedness of the nations infrastructure on computer networks there was concern that co mputers and computer networks presented new vulnerability and one that was not receiving adequate attention 9 presidents commission on critic infrastructure protection critical foundations protecting americas infrastructures october 1997together these entities will assess those assets vulnerabilities to the threats facing the nation natural or manmade ie ll hazards determine the level of risk associated with possible attacks or the impacts of natural events on those assets and identify and prioritize set of measures that can be taken to reduce those risks primary responsibility for protection response and recovery lies with the owners and operators5 however the federal government holds open the possibility of intervening in those areas where owners and operators are unable or unwilling to provide what it the federa l government may assess to be adequate protection or response6 the reader who is not interested in the evolution of this policy and the organizational structures that have evolved to implement it can proceed to the policy implementation andor issues sections of this report the presidents commission on critical infrastructure protection this report takes as its starting point the establishment of the presidents commission on critical infrastructure protection pccip in july 19967 its tasks were to report to the president the scope and nature of the vulnerabilities and threats to the nations critical infrastructures focusing primarily on cyber threats8 recommend comprehensive na tional policy and implementa tion plan for protecting critical infrastructures determine legal and policy issues raised by proposals to increase protections and propose statutory nd regulatory changes necessary to effect recommendations the pccip released its report to president clinton in october 19979 examining both the physical and cybe r

inherent vulnerabilities of common protocols in computer networks the easy availability of hacker tools available on many websites and the fact that the basic tools of the hacker computer modem telephone line are the same essential technologies used by the general populati on indicated to the commission that both threat and vulnerability exist the commission generally recommende d that greater cooperation and communication between the private sector nd government was needed the private sector owns and operates much of the nations critical infrastructure as seen by the commission the governments primary ro aside from protecting its own infrastructures is to collect and disseminate the latest information on intrusion techniques threat analysis and ways to defend against hackers the commission also proposed strategy for action facilitate greater c ooperation and communication between the private sector and appropriate government agencies by setting top level policymaking office in the white house establishing council that includes corporat executives state and local government officials and cabinet secretaries and setting up information clearinghouses develop realtime capability of attack warning establish and promote comprehensive awareness and education program streamline and clarify elements of the legal structure to support assurance measures including clearing jurisdictional barriers to pursuing hackers electronically and expand research and developmen t in technologies and techniques especially technologies that allow fo r greater detection of intrusions the commissions report underwent intera gency review to determine how to respond that review led to presidentia l decision directive released in may 1998 presidential decision directive 63 presidential decision directive 63 pdd6310 set as national goal the ability to protect the nations critical infrastructure from intentional attacks both physical and cyber by the year 2003 accordin g

agencies engaged in counterterrorism activities the office of the national coordinator was established to inte grate and coordinate these activities the white house released fact sheet on pdd62 on may

national coordinator for security infrastructure protection and counterterrorism12 the national coordinator reported to the president through the assist ant to the president for national security affairs13 among his many duties outlined in pdd63 the national coordinator chaired the critical infrastructu re coordination group this group was the primary interagency working group for deve loping and implementing policy and for coordinating the federal gove rnments own internal security measures the group included high level representatives from the lead agencies including the sector liaisons the national economic council and all other relevant agencies each federal agency was made res ponsible for securing its own critical infrastructure and was to designate critical infrastructure assurance officer ciao to assume that responsibility the agencys current chief information officer cio could double in that capacity in those cases where the cio and the ciao were different the cio was responsible for assuring the agencys information assets databases software computers while the ciao was responsible for any other assets that make up that agencys critical infrastructure agencies were given 180 days from the signing of the directive to develop their plans those plans were to be fully implemented within tw years and updated every two years the pdd set up national infrastructure assurance council the council was to be panel that included private opera tors of infrastructure assets and officials from state and local government officials and relevant fe deral agencies the council was to meet periodically and provide reports to the pres ident as appropriate the national coordinator was to act as the executive director of the council the pdd also called for national infrastructure assurance plan the plan was to integrate the plans from each of the sectors mentioned above and should consider the following vulnerability assessment including the minimum essential capability required of the sectors infrastructure to meet its purpose remedial plans to reduce the sectors vulnerability warn ing requirements and procedures response strategies reconstitution of services education and awareness programs research and development needs intelligence st rategies needs and opportunities for international coope ration and legislative nd budgetary requirements the

technical feasibility were at issue by the end of the clinton administration fidnet as distributed intr usion detection system feeding into centralized analysis and warning capability was abandoned comparable capability has been developed called the einstein program that addressed the privacy concerns of fidnet under einstein participating agenci retain complete control of network data in strict

turn dhs prepares strategic crossagency assessment which is then shared back with all federal civilian agencies according to the dhs fy2009 budget justification documents additional fu nds were requested to expand the einstein program to include all federal agencies and to use improved sensors to monitor network traffic this was part of broader cyber s ecurity initiative aimed at better securing federal information systemsdeveloping their internal plans helped coordinate national ducation and awareness programs and provided legislative and pub lic affairs support coordinating the development of and maintaining the national plan is now part of the department of homeland security infrastructure protec tion and information security ipis program most of the directive established po licymaking and oversight bodies making use of existing agency authorities and expertise however the pdd also addressed operational concerns these dealt primarily with cyber security the directive called for national capability to detect and re spond to cyber attacks while they are in progress although not specifically iden tified in the directive the clinton administration proposed establishing federal intrusion detection network fidnet that would together with the federal computer intrusion response capability fedcirc established just prior to pdd63 meet this goal14 the directive explicitly gave the federal bureau of investigation the authority to expand its existing computer crime capabilities into national infrastr ucture protection center nipc the directive called for the nipc to be the focal point for federal threat assessment vulnerability analysis early warning capability law enforcement investigations and response coordination all agencies were required to forward to the nipc information about threats and act ual attacks on their infrastructure as well as attacks made on private sector infrastructures of which they become aware presumably fidnet15 and fedcirc would feed into the nipc according to the directive the nipc would be linked elect ronically to the rest of the federal government and use warning and response expertise located throughout the federal government the directive also made th nipc the conduit for information sharing with the private sector through an equivalent information sharing and analysis centers operated by the private sector wh ich pdd63 encouraged the private sector to establish later many of these functions were transferred to the department of homeland security the us computer emergency response team us cert and

subcommittee on technology and terrorism october 6 1999 this effort was transferred to the department of homeland securityquite independent of pdd63 in its origin but clearly complimentary in its purpose the fbi established program called infragard to private sector firms the program facilitates information exchange between fbi field offices and the surrounding business communities its initia l focus was network security after september 11 its focus includes both cybe r and physical security infragard is geographicallyoriented rather than secto roriented each fb i field office has special agent coordinator who gathers inte rested companies of various sizes from all industries to form chapter any company can join infragard local executive boards govern and share information within the membership chapters hold regular meetings to discuss issues threats and other matters that impact their companies chapters may also engage in contingency planning for using alternative systems in the event of successful large scale attack on the information infrastructure the program was transfe rred to the nipc before it was absorbed by the department of homeland security th program is now managed by the fbis cyber division it should also be noted that the fbi had since the 1980s program called the key assets initiative kai the objective of the kai was to develop database of information on key assets within the jurisdiction of each fbi field office establish lines of communications with asset owners and ope rators to improve physical and cyber protection nd to coordinate with othe r federal state and local authorities to ensure their involvement in th protection of those assets the program was initially begun to allow for contingency planning against physical terrorist attacks according to testimony by former director of the nipc the program was reinvigorated by the nipc and expa nded to include the cyber dimension16 the department of homeland secu rity is now responsible

incoming bush administration spent the first eight months reviewing its options for coordinating and overseeing critical infrastructure protection during this time the bush administration continued to

for coordinating critical infrastructure protec tion ie the national coordinator came from the nsc was unclear richard clar ke himself wrote memorandum to the incoming bush administration advocating th at the function should be transferred directly to the white house17 second there was continuing debate about the merits of establishing governmentwide chief information officer cio whose responsibil ities would include protection of all fe deral nonnational s ecurityrelated computer systems and coordination with the private sector on th protection of privately owned computer systems shortly after assuming office the bush administration announced its desire not to create separate fede ral cio position but to recruit deputy director of the office of management and budget that w ould assume an oversight role of agency cios one of the reasons cited for this was desire to keep agen cies responsible for their own computer security18 third there was the continuing debate about how best to defend the country against terrorism in general the us commission on national security21st century the hartrudman commission proposed new national homeland security agency the recommendation built upon the current federal emergency management agency fema by adding to it the coast guard the border patrol customs service and other agencies the commission recommended that the new organization include directorate responsib for critical infra structure protection while both the clinton and bush administration remained cool to this idea bills were introduced in congress to establish ch an agency as discussed below the bush administration changed its pos ition in june 2002 and proposed new department along the lines of that pr oposed by the hartrudman commission and congress postseptember 11 soon after the september 11 terrorist ttacks president bush signed two executive orders relevant to critical infrast ructure protection th have since been amended to reflect

of homeland security released national strategy for homeland security the strategy covered all gove rnment efforts to protect the nation against terrorist attacks of all ki nds it identified protecting the nations critical infrastructures and ke assets new term differe nt as implied above by the fbis key asset program as one of six critical mission ar eas the strategy expanded upon the list of sectors considered to posse ss critical infrastructure to include public health the chemical industry and hazar dous materials postal and shipping the defense industrial base and agriculture and food the strategy also added continuity of government and continuity of operations to the list although it is difficult to see how the latter would be considered sector it also combined emergency fire service emergency law enforcement and emergency medicine as emergency services and it dropped those functions that primarily belonged to th federal governments eg defense intelligence law enforcement it also reassigned some of the sectors to different agencies including making th then proposed depa rtment of homeland security lead agency for number of sect ors postal and shipping services and the defense industrial base it also introduced new class of assets calle d key assets which was defined as potential targets w hose destruction may not endanger vital systems but could create cal disaster or profoundly ffect national morale such assets were defined ter to include national monuments and other historic attractions dams nuclear facilities and large commercial centers including office buildings and sport stadiums where large numbers of people congregate to conduct business personal transactions or enjoy recreational activities23 the strategy reiterated many of the same policyrelated activities as mentioned above working with the private sector and other nonfederal entities naming those agencies that should act as liaison with the private sector ssessing vulnerabilities and developing national plan to deal with those vulnerabilities the strategy also mentioned the need to set priorities ac knowledging that not ll assets are equally critical and that

organizations but assumed that department of home land security would be established see below the strategy was update d in october 200724 with the exception of somewhat greater recognition of the role improving resilience can play in reducing the nations risk the strategy related to critical infrastructure saw little change on december 17 2003 the bush administration released homeland security presidential directive 7 hspd7 hspd essentially upda ted the policy of the united states and the roles and responsibilities of various agencies in regard to critical infrastructure protection as outlined in previous documents national strategies and the homeland security ac t of 2002 see below for example the directive reiterated the secretary of homeland securitys role in coordinating the overall national effort to protect critical infrastructure it also reiterated the role of sectorspecific agencies ie lead agencies25 to work with their sectors to identify prioritize and coordinate protec tive measures the directive captured the expanded set of critical infrastructures and key assets and sectorspecific agencies assignments made in the national strategy for homeland security the directive also reiterated the relationship between the department of homeland security and other agencies in certain areas for example while the department of homeland security will maintain cyber security unit the directive stated that the director of the office of management remains res ponsible for overseeing governmentwide information security programs and for suring the operation of federal cyber incident response center within the depar tment of homeland security also while the department of homeland security is responsible fo r transportation security including airline security the department of transportation rema ins responsible for control of the national air space system the only organizational change made by the directive was the establishment of the critical infrastructure protectio n policy coordinating committee which will advise the homeland s ecurity council on interagenc policy related to physical and cyber infrastructure security the directive made few other noticeable changes or additions for example the department of homeland security was assigned as lead agency for the chemical and hazardous materials sect or it had been the environmental protection agency the directive required lead agencies to report annually to the secretary of homeland security on their efforts in working with the private sector the directive also reiterated that all federal agencies must develop plans to protect their own critical infrastructure and submit those plans for approval to the director of the office of management and budget by july 2004 the bush administration policy and approach regarding critical infrastructure protection can be described as an evol utionary expansion of the policies and approaches laid out in pdd63 the funda mental policy statements are essentiallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30153crs13 26 computer security advocates have sought to highlight cyber security issues by maintaining separate organization high within the burea ucracy there now exists both an assistant secretary for cyber security and telecomm unications and an assistant secretary for infrastructure protection both reporting to th undersecretary for national protection and programs while the latter is concerned with both physical and cyber security issues the former is focused on cyber security issuesthe same the protection of infrastructures critical to the people economy essential government services and national security national morale was added to that list also the stated goal of the governments efforts is to ensure that any disruption of the services provided by these infrastruct ures be infrequent of minimal duration and manageable the infrastructures identified as critical were essentially the same although expanded and with an emphasis placed on targets that would result in large numbers of casualties finally the primary effort is directed at working collaboratively and voluntarily with the pr ivate sector owners and operators of critical infrastructure to identify critical assets and provide ppropriate protection organizationally there remains an in teragency group for coordinating policy across departments and for informing the white house homeland security council supported by the critical infrastructure pr otection coordinating committee certain agencies have been assigned certain sectors with which to work sectors are asked to organize themselves to assist in coor dination of effort and information sharing council made up of private sector executives academics and state and local officials was established to advise the pres ident certain operational units eg the critical infrastructure assurance office ciao and elements of the national infrastructure protection center at the fbi were initially left in place though later moved to and restructured within the department of homeland security dhs where now the undersecretary for nationa l protection and prog rams is responsible for coordinating the implementation of polic ies and programs see below however dhs takes much more active role in identifying critical assets assessing vulnerabilities and recommending and s upporting protective measures than did these earlier operational units also the manpow er and resources devoted to these activities have greatly increased one major difference between pdd63 and the current administrations efforts is shift in focus pdd63 focused on cybersecurity while the postseptember 11 effort is still concerned with cybersecurity its focus on physical threats especially those that might cause mass casualties is greater than the preseptember 11 effort this led to some debate and organizational instability initially the early executive orders discussed above segregated cyber security from the physical security mission with the formation of the office of home land security and the presidents critical infrastructure protection board dissolu tion of the board and the subsequent establishment of the critical infrast ructure protection policy coordinating committee responsible for advising the homeland security council on both physical and cyber security issues would appear to reunite these two concerns within single white house group26httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30153crs14 27 the nisac was established in the usa patriot act pl 10756 section 1062 the center builds upon expertise at sandia nati

protective and support measures to develop comprehensive nationa l plan for securing key resources and critical infrastructures to administer the homeland security advisory system to work with the intelligence community to establish collection priorities and to establish secure communication system for receiving anddisseminating information in addition the act provided number of protections for

asking competing industries to cooperate this cooperation not only raises issues of trust among firms but also concerns regarding antitrust rules over time sector coordinators were selected for most of the sectors identified under pdd63 typically representative fro m relevant trade organizations was chosen to act as sector coordinator for example the environmental protection agency selected the executive director of the association of metropolitan water agencies to act as sector coordinator for the water sector in the case of the law enforcement sector longer identified as separate sector the national infrastructure protection center helped create emergency law enforcement services forum consisting of senior state local and nonfbi law enforcement officials in the case of ba nking and finance the sector coordinator was chosen from major bankingfinance institution who doubled as the chairperson of the financial services sector coordinating council an organization specifically set up by the industry to coordinate critical infrastructure protection activities with the federal government in december 1999 number of the sectors formed partnership for critical infrastructure security to share information and strategies and to identify interdependencies across sectoral lines the partnership was private sector initiative the federal government was not officially part of the partnership but the department of home land security and ciao before that acted as liaison and provided administrative support for meetings sector liaisons from lead agencies were considered ex officio members the partnership helped c oordinate its members input to number of the national strategies released to date and were to provide input into the national plan called for in pdd63 while initially working with this organizational structure the bush administration promoted new critical in frastructure protection partnership model resembling the financial services sector coordinating council pproach this newer model expanded the sector liaison and s ector coordinator model of pdd63 into government coordinating councils and sector coordinating councils for each sector the primary objective was to expand both owneropera tor and government representation within all sectors now for example the water sector coordinating council consists of two ow neroperator representatives along with one nonvoting association staff from each of the following participating organizations the association of metropolitan water agencies the american water works association the american water work

directive required every agency to develop and implement such plan subsequent informa tional seminar on pdd 63 held on october 13 1998 identif ied two tiers of agencies the first tier included lead agencies and other primary agencies like the central intelligence agency and veterans affairs these agencies were he ld to the directives 180day deadline second tier of agencies were identified by the national coordina tor and required to submit plans by the end of february 1999 the s econdary agencies were agriculture education housing and urban development labor interior general services administration national aerona utics and space administration and the nuclear regulatory commission all of these primary and secondary agencies met their initial deadlines for submitting their internal plans for protecting their own critical infrastructures from attacks and for responding to intrusions the critical infrastructure assurance office ciao assembled an expert team to review the plans the plans were assessed in 12 areas including schedulemilestone planning resource requirements and knowledge of existing authorities and guidance the assessment team handed back the initial plans with comments agencies were given 90 days to respond to these comments of the 22 primary and secondary agencies that submitted plans 16 modified and resubmitted them in response to first round comments initially the process of reviewing agency plans was to continue until all concerns were addressed over the mmer of 1999 however review efforts slowed and subsequent reviews were put on hold as the efficacy of the reviews was debated some within the ciao felt that the plans were too general and lacked clear understanding of what constituted critical asset and the interdependencies of those assets as result of that internal debate the ciao redirected its resources to institute new program called project matrix project matrix is three step process by which an agency can identify and assess its most critical assets identify the dependencies of thos assets on other systems in cluding those beyond the direct control of the agency and prioritize ciao offered this analysis to agencies including some not designated as prima ry or secondary agencies such as the social security administration and the securities and exchange commission participation by the agencies was voluntary41 in

first step in the process and plans to review the sectors annual progress reports as required by hspd7 it should be noted that some sectors nd agencies have performed already some or all of these risk

center isac pdd63 envisaged single isac to be the private sector counterpart to the fbis national infrastructure protection center nipc collecting analyzing and sharing incident and response informa

from sector coordinating councils in that isacs were to be 247365 operations where incidents experienced by owneroperators as well as threat information from the government could be reported analyz ed and shared many were conceivedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30153crs25 52 see httpwwwisaccouncilorgsites this site was last visited on january 15 2008originally as concentrating on cyber secur ity issues and some still function with that emphasis however others have incorpor ated physical security into their missions isacs were formed around two prima ry models one model involved isac members legally incorporating and establishing either their own isac operations or contracting operations out to security fi rm the banking information water oil and gas railroad and ma ss transit sectors followed this approach the other model involved utilizing an ex isting industry or governmentindustry coordinating group and adding critical infrastructure protec tion to the mission of that group the electric power which uses north american electricity reliability council nerc and the telecommunications sector which uses the national coordinating center ncc followed this model the emergency fire services sector incorporated isac functions into the existing operations of the us fire administration which has interacted w ith local fire departments for years different federal financia l support models were deve loped for isacs too in some cases isacs received start up funding from their lead agency eg drinking water received funding from epa in some cases that support continues in some cases the support has not continued eg doe longer supports the energy isac other isacs have always been selfsuppor ting the individual isacs have formed group called the isac council52 their formation and function experience some of the same variation as the coordinating councils for so of the same reasons while pdd63 envisioned isacs to be primary conduit for exchanging critical infrastructure information between the federal government and specific sectors the department of homeland security has veloped number of other information sharing systems and mechanism for example uscert the us computer emergency readiness team which took over many of the nipc functions publishes information on the late st computerrelate d vulnerabilities and threats and information on how to respond to specific incide nt uscert also accepts incidents reports it also manages the national cyber alert system to which any organization or individual can subscribe the department also has developed

protection priorities b will build comprehensive database to catalog these critical facilities systems and functions and c will also maintain comprehensive uptodate assessment of vulnerabilities and preparedness across critical sectors furthermore these efforts will help guide nearterm protective actions and provide basis for longterm leadership focus and informed resource investment following september 11 2001 ownersope rators of critical infrastructure assets to varying degrees began identif ying critical assets assessing their vulnerabilities to attack and developed security plans or beefed up protections for example the federal transit authority assessed the vulnerabilities of the nations largest mass transit systems the freight rail companies developed additional security measures to coincide with the level of threat identified by dhss color coded national alert system drinking water authorities through the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness act pl 107188 were required to conduct vulnerability assessments and to develop security plans based on those assessments port facilities and maritime vessels were required by the maritime transportation

reviewing the progress and ffectiveness of dhss efforts identifying critical assets functions and systems there has been some debate about th progress and effectiveness of dhss efforts at identifying high priority assets for example when developing the initial list of priority sites during operation liberty shield certain utility operators when presented list of what dhs considered to be critical electric power assets noticed that some of the entries were not currently in use57 according to the dhs inspector general dhs itself determined that its early list of priority sites was unreliable58 over time according to the dhs inspector general this in itial priority list evolved into what became the national asset database which as of january 2006 contained over 77000 entries while dhs apparently ma progress on the reliability of the information contained in the database it continued to draw criticism for including thousands of assets that ma ny believe have more local importance than national importance there is some confusion as to what the national asset database is meant to be critics of the database assume it is continuation of dhss list of high priority sites dhs asserts th at it is an inventory of assets from which critical assets may be drawn59 perhaps in response to these criticisms the national asset database is evolving into what is called the infrastructure data

grown62 implementation of the national infrastruct ure protection plan nipp is suppose to contribute to the identification of assets that are most critical to the nation also the fy2009 ipis budget justification document mentions the intention to begin conducting highrisk infrastructure clus ter vulnerability assessments these assessments would focus on high priority sites identified through the

performance budget overview as the infrastructure protection program and apparently referring to the noncyber and noncommunications related activities of the infrastructure protection and information security program in the budget has three performance measures listed the percentage of high priority s ites at which bzpps have been implemented the percentage of highpriority sites for which vulnerability assessments have been conducted and corresponding res ource allocations made and the percentage of high priority sites at which at least two prot ective measures have been implemented the targets and actual percentages for each of these measures are listed in the table below64 according to this performance base d budget review by fy2007 nearly all highpriority sites have had

taken from the dhs annual performance report fy 2007 fy2009 there is twoyear lag in reporting data allocating resources it is matter of policy as articulated in the documents discussed above that federal resources should focus on those critical infrastructure assets that if attacked pose the greatest risks to the nation risk in the context of critical infrastruct ure and terrorism can be defined as the potential consequences associated with par ticular kind of attack or event against particular target discounted by the likelihood that such an attack or event will occur threat and the likelihood that the target will sustain certain degree of damage vulnerability threat includes not only the identification of specific adversaries but also their intentions and capabilities both current and future consequences include lives and property lost short term financ ial costs longer term economic costs environmental costs etc given this finition risk is not threat nor vulnerability to threat nor the estimated consequences associated with specific attack but some integration of the three65httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30153crs32 66 dhss solution was establish multiple tiers with urban areas competing for funds within their tier tier 1 urban areas are those considered to have greater likelihood of being targeted or have large number of proba ble targets including number of people 67 for detailed discussion of the risk assessm ent process used to allocate grant funds to urban areas see crs report rl33858 the department of homeland securitys risk assessment methodology evolution issues and options for congress by todd masse siobhan oneil and john rollinsaccording to the nipp the allocation of resources is to be two step process first those critical assets which pose the gr eatest risk to the nation if attacked ie those assets that score highest when integrating threat vulnerability and consequences are to be given the highest pr iority the second step is to identify and support those protective measures that are lik ely to provide the greatest risk reduction for any given investment federal resources are spent in number of ways including agencies internal budgets for operations and programs grants to states and localities and research and development funding for unive rsities and industry the most publicized debates on the allocation of federal resources focuses primarily on grants to states and localities the formulabased state ho meland security grants mentioned above has been criticized by some for allocating more dollars per capita to states that some perceive as having lower risks than other states congress has been at odds on if or how to modify the allocation of those funds the other grant programs mentioned above ie urban area security initiative grants and the sector specific grants are discretionary according to dhs allocati on of these funds are based on calculation not only of risk but also on need with the allocation of fy2006 urban area security initiative grants some cities which perceive themselves as having greater risk or at least being more at threat or could suffer greater losses received less funding than they did the previous year wh ile other cities percei ved as having lower risks saw their funds increase d dhs stated that one reason for this was the way it determined the unmet needs of the area nd the programs proposed by the areas to address those needs faced with criticism from those cities and states that received drop in funds dhs stated it would rework its grant review process66 in addition congress has requested that the govern ment accountability office review the validity relevance reliability timeliness and availability of the risk factors used by dhs in its discretionary grant programs67 meanwhile congress continues to set its own priorities by specifying the am ount of funds that go to each of these grant programs also it is not clear to what extent the nipp process influences the allocation of resources to states and localities dhs states that information contained in the national asset database is reviewed in making these grant allocation decisions however these grant programs are manage d by the office of grants and training which apparently assesses risks independent of the nipp similarly port security grants while managed by the office of gran ts and training are influenced largely by the review of vulnerability assessments and security plans performed by the coast guardhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30153crs33 68 see also crs report rl32366 terrorist identification screening tracking under homeland security presidential directive 6 by william j krouseinformation sharing information sharing in the context of homeland security encompasses very complex network of proposed connections there is information sharing between federal agencies especially between intelligence agencies and between intelligence and law enforcement agencies there is information sharing between federal agencies and their state and local counterparts there is information sharing between federal state and local agencies and the private sector there is information sharing within and between the private sectors and there is information sharing between all of these entities and the public multitude of mechanisms have been established to facilitate all of this information sharing while the multitude of mechanism may cause some concern about inefficienci highly connected in some cases redundant network may not be bad thing primary concern is if these mechanisms are being used and are effective in the past information flow between all of these stakeholders has been restrained or nonexistent for at least th ree reasons natural bureaucratic reluctance to share information technol ogical difficulties associated with compatibility and legal restraints to prevent the misuse of information for unintended purposes however in the wake of september 11 gi ven the apparent lack of information sharing that was exposed in reviewing events leading up to that day many of these restraints are being reexamined and there ppears to be general consensus to change them some changes have resulted from the usa patriot act including easing the restrictions on sharing of information between national law enforcement agencies and those agencies tasked with gaining intelligence of foreign agents the legislation establishing the department of homeland security also authorizes efforts to improve the ability of agencies within the federal government to share information between themselves and other entities at the state and local level the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act pl 108458 reorganized the entire intelligence community in part to improve the level of communication and coordination between the various intelligence organizations68 the legislation also required the president to establish an information sharing environment ise for the sharing of terrorism information among all appropriate federal state local and tribal entities and the private sector while the federal government is trying to increase the amount of information shared among appropriate stake holders it is also trying to maintain tight control short of classification on who gets to see what information variety of designations have been given to informati on the federal government wishes to control critical infrastructure in formation see below homel and security information terrorism information sensitive security info rmation catchall term for these and other designations of c ontrolled information is sensitive but unclassified since much of what is considered to be critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector critical infrastructure protection relies to large extent on the ability of the private sector and the federal government to share informationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30153crs34 69 in

sensitive but unclassified information not only science and technology information but other types of information held by or given to the federal government see crs report rl33303 sensitive but unclassified information and other controls policy and options for scientific and technical information by genevieve j knezohowever it is unclear how open the private sector and the government have been in sharing information the private s ector primarily wa nts from government information on specific threats which the g overnment may want to protect in order not to compromise sources or investigations in fact much of the threat assessment done by the federal government is considered classified for its part the government wants specific information on vulnerabilities and incidents which companies may want to protect to prevent adverse publicity or to keep confidential company practices the private sector too is concerned about whether providing this information might lead to future regulatory action or other liabilities ccessful information sharing will depend on the ability of each side to demonstrate it can hold in confidence the information exchanged sharing information between government and the private sector is made more complex by the question of how the information will be handled within the context of the freedom of information act foia in particular the private sector is reluctant to share the kind of informati on the government wants without it being exempt from public disclosure under the existing foia statute the homeland security act pl 107296 sec 214 exempts information defined as critical infrastructure information from foia as well as providing other protections similar foia exemptions are offered in ot her legislation for example the public health security and bioterrorism pr eparedness act pl 107188 sec 401 see below exempts certain securityrelated information from foia even with these protections in statute it is uncertain how much information on assets vulnerabilities incidents etc is being shared with dhs or how useful it is69 the foia exemptions for critical infrastructure information cii and other types of sensitive but unclassified informa tion is not without its critics the non governmentorganizations that actively oppose government secrecy are reluctant to expand the governments ability to hold more information as classified or sensitive these critics and others feel that the protections offered to cii and other types of sensitive but unclassified information is too broad and believe that controls are stifling public debate and oversight as well as impedin g technological advances that could benefit both secu rity and the economy70httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30153crs35 regulation as general statement of policy owners and operators of critical infrastructure are to work with the federal government on voluntary basis sharing information with the federal government about vulnerability assessmen ts risk assessments and the taking of additional protective actions is meant to be voluntary however the degree to which some of the activities are mandated varies across sectors in some cases sectors are quite regulated nuclear power plants must meet very specific standards for assessing their vulnerabilities to very specific types of attacks and to take the necessary actions to address those vulnerabilities the nuclear regulatory commission enforces these regulations the maritime transportation security act pl 107295 requires facilities at ports and certain vessels to conduct vul nerability assessments and to develop and imple ment security plans including naming security officer who is responsible for developing and implementing these plans the vulnerability assessments and security plans are reviewed by the coast guard the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness act pl 107188 requires community drinking water systems to conduct vulnerability asse ssments and to incorporate th results of those assessments into their emergency response plans the vulnerability assessments must be submitted to the environmental protection agency epa the epa must also receive certification that the emergency response plans have been appropriately modified to reflect the vulnerability assessments this same act also amended the federal food drug and cosmetic act to require all f acilities engaged in manufacturing processing packing or holdi ng food for consumption to register with the department of health and human services in ddition the food and drug act was amended to require re gulations specifying the types of information these facilities needed to keep on record for specified amount of time to assist the secretary in determining if food product has been adu lterated and represents public health problem the fy2006 dhs appropriation bill pl 109295 sec 550 authorized the secretary of homeland s ecurity to issue inte rim final regulations requiring vulnerability assessments and security plans for certain chemical facilities except those covered by the maritime transportation and security act other relevant acts affecting drinking water authorities or those operated by the department of energy the department of defense or the nuclear regulatory commission at the other end of the spectrum are sectors such as information

protection mission area taken from the fy2009 budget analysis much of this funding is spent by agencies to protect their own critical infrastructure it also includes funds that agencies may spend working with states local governments and private owners operators to reduce their respective vulnerabilities dhs activities include both of these as well as activities associated with coordinating th national effort other mission areas include activities that might also be considered part of the effort to protect critical infrastructure for instance the intelligence and warning mission area includes threat analysis risk analysis and the sharing of that information with other stakeholders including states localities and the private sector each of which factor into critical infrastructure protection border and transportation security includes activities ssociated with protecting airports sea ports and other tran sportation modes in many cases funding for homeland security and critical infrastructure protection is buried within number of different account s activities programs and projects it is not possible to track budg et requests or cong ressional appropriations in each of these
