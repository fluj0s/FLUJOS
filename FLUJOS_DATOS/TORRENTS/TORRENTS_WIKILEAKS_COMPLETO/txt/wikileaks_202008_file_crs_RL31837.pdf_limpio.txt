policy background when the effects of the 1929 depression be gan to be felt by the rest of the nation rural residents had been struggling for several years with low incomes and low standards of living the federal emergency relief administration began aiding rural families in 1932 later the farm security administration and the work projects administration provided much needed assistance to rural families and farm households in the postworld war ii era widespr ead rural poverty most notably among farmers continued to dominate ru ral policy concerns the eisenhower administrations undersecretary for agricu lture true d morse began rural development program in 1955 to assist wincome farmers because agriculture was the major economic activity in many rural areas of the time focus on farms and farm households became facto rural po licy the war on poverty during the 1960s continued the focus on rural poverty as cen tral policy issue with the continued decline in agriculture as rural americas dominant economic activity policy attention shifted to rural revitalization the 1980s farm financial crisis and economic dislocation in rural america brought the impor tance of rural structural change to the forefront of policy concerns the further d ecline of farming to less than 8 of rural employment and the loss of many manufacturing jobs during the past decade have highlighted the growing gap between many rural areas and the nations urbansuburban areas while overarching framework guides rural policy at the federal level ade quate housing employment crea tion and business retention human capital concerns poverty issues medical car and infrastructure development remain key foci of federal rural policy today nearly 90 of total farm household income comes from offfarm sources manufacturing now accounts for about 25 of rural private sector earnings and about 12 of all rural jobs the rvice sector as with the us domestic economy as whole now dominates rural job opportunities

vehicle for addressing many rural development issues2 while other legislation has significant implications for rural areas and rural residents eg transportation initiatives environmental regulation finance and taxation medicare social security congress has used periodic farm bills to address emerging rural issues as well as to reauthorize wide range of rural programs administered by the various usda rural development mission agencies as the role of agriculture has continued to decline in many rural economies however some rural policy anal ysts are raising questions about the effectiveness of linking agriculture and rural policy while the extent of overlap between federal agencies and programs targ eting rural areas has been of concern to some rural policy observers legislation enacted since 1990 reflects an effort to address rural issues more comprehensively3 major authorizing legislation for usda rural development programs usdas rural development mission is to enhance rural
