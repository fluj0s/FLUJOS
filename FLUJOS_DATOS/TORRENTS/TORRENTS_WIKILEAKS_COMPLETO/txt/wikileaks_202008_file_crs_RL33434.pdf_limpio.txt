nations in the proportion of 24yearolds who earn degrees in natural science or engineering 2005 study by the government acc ountability office found that 207 distinct federal stem education pr ograms were appropriated nearly 3 billion in fy2004 nearly threequarters of those funds and n early half of the stem programs were in two agencies the national institutes of health and the nati onal science foundation still the study concluded that these prog rams are highly decentralized and require better coordination thou gh uncovering many fewer individual programs 2007 inventory compiled by the american comp etitiveness council also put the federal stem effort at 3 billion and concurred with many of the gao findings regarding decentralization and coordination stem education and compe

of students teachers and professionals in the ar eas of science technology engineering and mathematics stem1 although the most recent national assessment of educational progress nae p results show improvement in us pupils knowledge of math and science th large majority of students still fail to reach adequate levels of proficiency when compared to other nations the achievement of us pupils appears inconsistent with the nations role as world leader in scientific innovation for exam ple among the 40 countries participating in the 2003 program for international stude nt assessment pisa the us ranked 28th in math literacy and 24th in science literacy some attribute poor student performance to an inadequate supply of qualified teachers this appears to be the case with respect to subjectmatter knowledge many us math and science teachers lack an undergraduate major or minor in those fields as many as half of those t eaching in middle school math indeed post secondary degrees in math and physical sc ience have steadily decreased in recent decades as proportion of all stem degr ees awarded although degrees in some stem fields particularly biology and computer science have increased in recent decades the overall proportion of stem degr ees awarded in the united states has historically remained at about 17 of all postsecondary degrees awarded meanwhile many other nations

government accountability office gao found 207 distinct federal stem education programs that were appr opriated nearly 3 billion in fy20042 more recent study by the newly establishe d academic compe titiveness council acc found 105 stem education programs that were appropriated ju st over 3 billion in fy20063 the acc report attributed the diffe rence between the number of programs found by the two inventories to 1 progra mmatic changes 2 differing definitions of what constitutes program and 3 gaos reliance on unverified agency reported data4 apart from these differences both reports came to similar conclusions both found that federal stem education pr ograms had multiple goals provided multiple types of ssistance and were targeted at multiple groups but that the bulk of this effort supports graduate and postdoctoral study in the form of fellowships to improve the nations resear ch capacity both studies concluded that the federal effort is highly decentr alized and could benefit from stronger coordination while noting that the creati on of the national sc ience and technology council in 1993 was step in the right direction5 the acc study also contained an evaluative portion and concluded that the re is general dearth of evidence of effective practices and ac tivities in stem education6 several pieces of legislation ve been introduced in the 110th congress that would

report one report th at has been of particular influence in the stem debate is from the national academy of sciences nas rising above the gathering storm this influence is perhaps due to the clear targets and concrete programs laid out in the report the nas reports five recommendations to improve stem education are to quadruple middle and highschool math and science coursetaking by 2010 recruit 10000 new math and sc ience teachers per year strengthen the skills of 250000 curre nt math and science teachers increase the number of stem baccalaureate degrees awarded and support graduate and earlycareer research in stem fields to enlarge the pipeline of future stem degree reci pients nas sets goal of quadrupling the number of middle and hi gh school students taking advanced placement ap or international baccalaureate ib math or science courses from the current 11 million to 45 million by 2010 nas fu rther sets goal of increasing the number of students who pa ss either the ap or ib tests to 700000 by 2010 to enlarge the pipeline nas also supports the expansion of programs such as statewide specialty high schools for stem immersion and inquirybased learning through laboratory experience summer internsh ips and other research opportunities to recruit 10000 new stem teachers nas advocates the creation of competitive grant program to award meritbased scholarships to obtain fouryear stem degree in conjunction with certification as k12 mathematics or science teacher these 10000 to 20000 awards could be used only for educational expenses and would require fiveyear service commitment an additional 10000 annual bonus would be awarde d to participating teacher s in underserved schools in inner cities and rural areas in further support of this scholarship program nas recommends that fiveyear 1 million matchi ng grants be awarded to postsecondary institutions to encourage the creation of programs that integrate the obtainment of stem bachelors degree with teacher certification nas proposes four approaches to achieving the goal of strengthening the skills of 250000 current stem teachers first nas proposes that matching grants be awarded to support the establishment of state and regional summer institutes for stem teachers modeled after the merck in stitute for science education second nas proposes that additional grants go to postsecondary institutions that support stem masters degree programs for curre nt stem teachers with or without stem bachelors degrees modeled after the univ ersity of pennsylvania science teachers institute third nas proposes that programs be created to train current teachers to provide ap ib and preap or preib instruction modeled after the advanced placement initiative and the laying the foundation programs fourth nas proposes the creation of national panel to collect evaluate and devel op rigorous k12 stem curricula modeled after project lead the way to increase stem bachelo rs degree attainment nas proposes providing 25000 new scholarships each year thes undergraduate scholar awards in science technology engineering and mathematics usastem would be distributed to each state in proportion w ith its population and awarded to studentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33434crs29 45 the education commission of the states keeping america competitive five strategies to improve mathematic s and science

creation of 5000 new fellowships each year to us citizens pursuing doctoral degrees the fellowships would be administered by the national science foundation which would also draw on the advice of several federal agencies in determining the areas of need an nnual stipend of 30000 would be accompanied by an additional 20000 annually to cover the cost of tuition and fees these fellowships would also be portable so that students could choose to study at particular institution without the infl uence of faculty research grants legislation action on stem education policy in recent years several pieces of legi slation have been introduced with the purpose of improving stem education in the united states as has been noted many of the proposals in these bills have been influenced by the recommendations of several reports recently issued by leading academic scientific and business organizations45 these recommendations partic ularly those from the business community are not limited to the educational system this report does not discuss these noneducational policy recommendations eg immigra tion policies that affect the supply of foreign workers to fill us demand in stem occ
