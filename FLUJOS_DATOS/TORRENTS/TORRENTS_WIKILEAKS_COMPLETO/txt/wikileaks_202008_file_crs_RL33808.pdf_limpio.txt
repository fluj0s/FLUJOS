been the strongest influence on its policy in the middle east and key factor in its cooperation w ith the united states in th region however debate surrounding israels august 2006 request for german ground troop participation in united nations mission on the isr aelilebanese border increasing german advocacy for more proactive european union eu role in the middle east and shifting perceptions of israel in the germ an public have brought attention to what many consider changing role for germ any indeed the october 2006 deployment of german naval contingent off the lebanese coast marks the first time german troops have been stationed so close to israeli soil and german leaders have announced their intention to work toward reviving european and international engagement in the israelipalestinian peace process during germanys eu presidency in the first half of 2007 given germanys longstanding support of israel and close ties to the united states israeli and bush administration officials have generally welcomed the idea of increased german engagement in the middle east for some analysts germanys leading role in the eu and consistent commitment both to israel and us involvement in the peace process suggest that germany will become an evermore important partner for israel and the unite d states on the other hand the presence of german troops in lebanon

1965 however german policy towards israel during the preceding 13 years beginning with the luxem bourg reparations agreement of 1952 set the tone for what continues to be wide ly considered special relationship after taking office in 1949 west germanys firs t chancellor konrad adenauer pursued foreign policy rooted in the belief that the legitimacy of the young german state depended largely on its willingness to atone for atrocities perpetrated by the national socialist nazi regime of adolf hitler accordingly his policies were motivated by perceived moral obligation to support the je wish state the co rnerstone enshrined in the luxembourg agreement was longterm commitment to provide unprecedented financial reparations to th state of israel and restitution and compensation to individual vi ctims of nazi persecution in the luxembourg agreement west germany agreed to pay 3 billion deutschmark 715 million to the state of israel and 45 million dm 110 million to jewish organizations represented by the conference on jewish material claims against germany claims conference which were helping resettle jews outside of israel germany subsequently enacted legislation mandating direct compensation to individual victims of nazi crimes the german government continues to make payments to individuals mostly by way of pension contributions and estimates that some 40 or over 25 billion euros pproximately 325 bi llion of german reparations and compensation ve gone to the state of israel or individuals living in israel2 in 1992 two years after german uni fication the government expanded its compensation laws to include individuals previously denied compensation by the former german democratic republic east germany according to historians while the ited states supported the idea of german reparations american offici als were unwilling to impose additional financial burdens on the young german state so soon after wo rld war ii and urged israel to negotiate directly with germany3 indeed reparations to israel were neither required by the international community nor wholeheartedly endorsed by the german and israeli people most agree that german support for israel arose largely due to the individual efforts of adenauer and israeli prime minister david bengurion beginning in 1957 the two leaders enhanced relations by establishing military ties avoiding considerable domestic and international opposition by keeping arms shipmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33808crs3 4 the eec was the precursor to toda ys european union gardner feldman op cit ch 7 5 gardner feldman op

suspended the shipments ho wever both to make up for this loss and to address increasing public and political pressure adenauer offered to establish formal diplomatic relations with israel in march 1965 until this point he had resisted renewing an initial 1952 offer of di plomatic ties fearin g retaliation from the arab world normalization of relations the decades following the 1965 establis hment of diplomatic relations were marked largely by german desire to be seen as neutral actor in the middle east providing balanced rather than special support to israel simultaneously and away from the public eye successive german leaders sought to fulfill greater moral commitment to israel as had been initiated in adenauers policies publicly however leaders tended to speak increasin gly of german neutrality and beginning in the 1970s avoided pressure to take sides in conflicts involving israel by advocating common european econo mic community eec positions4 although germany opposed 1956 ussupported initiative to impose sanctions on israel following the suez cr isis germany did not openly support israel in the 1967 war and resisted calls to come to israels aid during the early stages of the 1973 yomkippur war at least publicly cl aiming neutrality in the conflict after the ensuing arab oil embargo german policy increasingly reflected its dependence on arab states both as destination for german exports and more importantly as the source of 85 of german oil5 nonetheless germany appears to have successfully maintained its strong relations with israel by providing subs tantial economic assistance continuing to nurture defense and intelligen ce cooperation and by working to soften or even oppose eec positions after having claimed neutrality during the yomkippur war it was revealed that germany had been allowing the united states to use its bremerhaven port to resupply israel although germ any supported 1973 eec resolution urging israel to retreat to pre1967 borders in the late 1970s it abstained from votes on the right of palestinian selfdefense and on granting observer status to the palestinian liberation orga nization plo in 1980 though west germany signed the eecs venice declaration endorsing palestinian selfd etermination german officials are reported to have successfully blocked initiatives to include direct reference to the plo6 while the

seeking to gain increased us engagement and the backing of european countries that tend to be less sympathetic toward israel than germany and the united states38 since hamass victory in january 2006 palestinian legi slative elections germany has remained steadfast in its public commitment to the conditions for relations with hamas outlined by the quartet39 however german officials have also supported palestinian president mahmoud abbass effo rts to form national unity government with hamas and some american commentators worry that europeans may be more willing than the united states to work with such government40 merkel and steinmeier have demonstrated desire to broaden the peace process to include more neighboring states with stake in the outcome on several occasions steinmeier has voiced an interest in expanding the quartet to include egypt or other arab states arguing th at any sustainable ag reement must involve syria steinmeier met with president bashar asad in damascus in

reacted skeptically to steinmeiers proposal for german assistance for such an initiative52 israeli prime minister olmert has opposed the idea of including the israelipalestinian conflic t on the agenda of broader international conference saying the best way to advance our relations with the arabs is by means of bilateral negotiations53 transatlantic implications the united states and germany share several national security interests and policy priorities in the middle east germanys commitment to israels sovereignty and security remains the strongest influence on its policy and key factor in its cooperation with the united states as noted above the two countries are widely considered israels closest allies and both share commitment to twostate solution to the israelipalestinian conflict and to preventing iran from developing nuclear weapons moreover both the us and ge rmany consider terrorism radical islamic fundamentalism and the pro liferation of weapons of ma ss destruction particularly to iran the primary threats to national security at times however germany tends to favor different policy approaches to realizing these objectives in the middl east germanys emphasis on diplomatic engagement and dialogue over military measures and isolation suggests greater willingness to engage traditional adversaries of the united states and israel such as syria and iran in search of diplomatic so lutions merkels call for comprehensive diplomatic initiative indicates desire to link discussion of the israelipalestinian and israellebanon conflicts to discussion of

stability in lebanon and coopera tion from hamas and can only be achieved throug h constructive dialogue although merkel has joined europan lead ers in advocating dialogue with syria and iran and increased eu engagement in the israelipalestinian conflict germany and most eu member states remain dedicated to securing robust us engagement in any peace proposal numerous analysts ssert that germany is unlikely to assume leadership role in the peace process wit hout strong us backing however calls for euled initiatives from spain france and italy indicate ongoing european frustration with perceived us inattention to the peace process this leads many analysts to predict that germany will be hardpressed to forge european and transatlantic consensus during its eupresidency let alone lead revived quartet initiative accordingly german diplomats are careful to dampen expectations of germanys ability to drive the peace process55 merkel has shown signs of deviatin g from germanys traditional support for israel and if anything has displayed tende ncy to be less critical of israeli policies than her predecessor gerhard schröder nonetheless growing criticism within the german media and germanys political classe s and high public di sapproval of israeli action during its july 2006 incursion into lebanon suggest growing willingness to challenge israeli policies furthermore the presence of german troops in the region has significantly raised germanys interest in seeing peaceful resolution to israeli arab conflicts these factors and germanys commitment to stronger eu foreign policy are taken by some as indications of increasing potential for divergence between german policy on the one hand and us and israeli policies on the other on the other hand german officials and politicians c onsistently assert that germanys commitment to israel and common transatlantic approach to the arab israeli peace process will conti nue to remain the paramount drivers of german policy in the region56 indeed historical perspective on germanys relationship with israel indicates that german leaders have consistently chos to support israel whether militarily financially or politically despite periods of public po litical or even international opposition this support however has often been carried out secretively in fact hist orical accounts suggest that german success in maintaining relatively positive relations on both sides of the arabisraeli conflict has depended largely on its ability to avoid highpro file leadership role in the region

palestinians members of congress have rep eatedly called on the european union to classify hezbollah as terrorist organization in march 2005 both the house and senate pa ssed resolutions hres 101 nd sres 82 urging the eu to add hezbollah to its list of terrori st organizations in july 2006 as fighting between hezbollah and israel escalated 200 members of the house signed letter to eu high representative for common foreign and security policy javier solana reiterating their request the eu has not designated hezbollah as terrorist organization because some member states view it as playing an important social and economic role in lebanon or as legitima political entity represented in the lebanese parliament and cab inet eu and german officials indicate that such designation is unlikely as long as eu member states are negotiating with the lebanese government as part of the unifil force currently maintaining ceasefire in southern lebanon unlike some eu member states such as the united kingdom which has placed hezbollah on its terrorist list germany doe s not maintain an independent national list of terrorist organizations choosing instead to adopt the common eu list composition of the eu list is agreed on unan imously and deliberations remain secret although most observers assert that the fr ench government has been the strongest european opponent to classifying hezbo llah as terrorist organization german officials indicate that they would likely support such designation members of congress also remain concer ned about eu aid to the palestinians congress has enacted series of measures to restrict us funding for the palestinian authority57 as noted previously germany has been one of the largest donors to the pa and has provided direct assistance to the palestinian people through the eus temporary international mechanism tim since july 2006 after hamass victory in parliamentary elections in january 2006 chancellor merkel was one of the first european leaders to back quartet cond itions for the provision of eu aid and negotiations with hamas nonetheless some observers have voiced concern that germany and other european states may be more willing than the united states to show flexibility in their commitment to these requirements particularly in exchange for hamas cooperation in pot ential national unity governme nt or in peace talks in response to such allegations german offici als consistently cite steadfast german commitment to the quartet principles
