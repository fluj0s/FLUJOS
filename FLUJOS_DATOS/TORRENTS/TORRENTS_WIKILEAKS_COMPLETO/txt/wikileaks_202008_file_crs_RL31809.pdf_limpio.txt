president transmits proposed federal budget to congress he must forward th judicial branchs proposed budget to congress unchanged that process has been in operation since 1939 the total appropriation for the judiciary in fy2003 including supplemental appropriations was 492 billion the judiciary budget consists of more th an 10 separate accounts two of these accounts fund the supreme court of the

more of the courts justices appear be fore either house or senate ppropriations subcommittee to address the budget require ments of the supreme court for the upcoming fiscal year focusing primarily on the courts sala ry and operational expenses subsequent to their testimony the architect of the capitol submits request for the courts building and grounds account although it is at the apex of the

including judg of the territorial courts of the united states but also those of retired justices and judges us court of federal claims bankruptcy and magistrate judges and all other officers and

expenses for the courts of appeals distri ct courts and other judicial services which funds most lowe r court operations hereafter referred to as the salaries and expenses account at march 27 2003 hearings before th house appropria tions subcommittee on cjs judiciary spokesman said that n early twothirds of the requested increase was required to maintain current operations with pa and benefit adjustments inflationary adjustments increases in general services administration space rental costs an increase in filled article iii judgeships and continued security measures the remaining onethird he said was primarily to pr ovide for programmatic and workload related needs such as highprof ile terrorist trials an unprecedented number of bankruptcy filings and significant increases in the workload for probation and pretrial services officers in october 2003 chief justice william h rehnquist wrote to the chairs of the house and senate appropriations committees asking for higher total appropriation for the judiciary than provided for in the cjs appropriations bills pending in the house and senate his lette r focused on the judiciarys salaries and expenses account which as noted above received 379 billion in direct appropriations in fy2003 for fy2004 the housepassed cjs bill appropriated 40 billion for this account while the senate appropriations committ ee recommended 389 billion the chief justice stated that if enacted the amount provided for fy2004 in the senatereported bill could have significant adverse impact on our judicial system the courts he said likely would be forced to reduce probationpretrial services and clerks offices personnel by an estimate d 2900 or 13 percent below current onboard staffing levels as fo r the housedpassed f unding level he saidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31809crs37 staffing reductions might not require future layoffs or furloughs nonetheless the end result will still be fewer court staff available to handle the historic growth in bankruptcy filings the continuing increase in criminal cases and higher levels of released felons under superv ised release with an understanding that congress was likely not in position to provide for our full request the chief justice respectfully requested an appropriations for the salaries and expenses account of 406 billion this he said represente d 73 increase over fy2003 funding and was the amount we believe is necessary to fund our mandatory expenses and allow the courts to continue to ope rate at fy2003 staffing levels subsequently on january 23 2004 an fy2004 budget for the judiciary was signed into law by president bush as part of the consolidated appropriations act for fy2004 pl 108199 housesenate confer ees had reached agreement on the act on november 2 2003 and the act was agr eed to by the house on december 8 2003 although the senate declined to act on the bill before the final adjournment of the first session of the 108th congress it later agreed to the conference report on january 22 2004 by 6528 roll call vote pl 108199 provides total budget aut hority for the judiciary of 517 billion 50 over fy2003 funding including s upplemental appropriations for fy2003 for the salaries and expenses account the act appropriates 399 billion 54 above fy2003 funding however the act also includes two rescissions resulting in 1055 reduction in the discretionary spending appropriated for each judiciary budget account in december 2003 in anticipation of th enactment of the fy2004 consolidated appropriations bill the judiciary prepar ed final financial plan for fy2004 the plan according to judiciary officials left many court units with alternative but to cut staffing and curtail services formulated by the executive committee of the judicial conference th plan was based upon 47 increase over fy2003 funding for the salaries and expenses account and on 50 increase over fy2003 funding for the federal judiciary as whole thes percentage increases the judiciary noted reflected the two acrosstheboard rescissions affecting the judiciary which were included in the consolidated appropriations act in budget facts and figures synopsis on its internet web site at http wwwuscourtsgov the judiciary said that the 47 increase provided 4 billion for th salaries and expenses account which the judiciary said was 129 llion below the amount needed to maintain court staffing levels also it said funding to make payments to private panel attorneys representing indigent defendants in federal criminal cases appropriated in the judiciarys defender services account was inadequate and would run out three weeks before the end of fy2004 on january 1 2004 in his 2003 yearend report on the federal judiciary chief justice rehnquist commented that th fy2004 budget process for the judiciary had been difficult one the delay in congress in enacting an appropriations bill he said had disrupted the judiciary and fo rced it to operate at inadequate levels of funding under continuing resolutions so he said many cour ts in the remainder of fy2004 might face hiring freezes furloughs or reductions in force the chief justice expressed his hope that cong ress would soon pass fy2004 appropriation for the judiciary and that in future year s the judiciarys budget would be enactedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31809crs38 prior to the beginning of the fiscal year

hous epassed cjs bill 554 million for the courts salaries and expenses account 178 increase over fy2003 funding instead of 594 million as recommended by the senate appropriations committee conferees for the consolidated bill said that as described in the senate appropriations committee report s rept 108144 at p 116 the cour t was expected to report to the two appropriation committees on the savings associated with hiring systems accountants to replace contractors the conferees also adopted by reference house report language h rept 108221 at p 114 whic h had expressed cerns about minority hiring and diversity among law clerks at the supreme court and urged the court and the judicial conference to continue to make progress in this matter for the courts second account care of the

capital projects and budget amendmen t the phrase used by the judiciary in its fy2004 budget submission of 122 million for continuation of the supreme court building modernization program from fy1998 through fy2003 congress appropriated total of 1101 million fo r the multiyear supreme court modernization project the first major renovation of the court building since its opening in 1935 the 122 million originally requested for the project in fy2004 have brought the total for the modernization project up to its final projected cost of 1223 million however the court subsequen tly reduced its fy2004 request for the modernization project from 122 million to 6 million to reflect the funding amount actually expected to be obligated during fy2004 the target date for completion of the project is the summer of 2008 the consolidated appropriations act for fy2004 includes 264 million for the building and grounds account the 264 million consists of an appropriation of 106 million within the judiciary title of the act transfer to this account of 160 million from division h section 106 of the act and an fy2004 rescission of 206000 the 106 million appropriation is in keeping with that appropriated in the housepassed cjs bill hr 2799 the 106 million appropriation is almost equal to the sum of 47 million reco mmended by the president for traditional building and grounds operations and ne w capital projects and the 6 million most recently requested by the court for its building modernization project the senatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31809crs39 appropriations committee had reco

supplemental appropriations the consolidated appropriations act for fy2004 provides 6045 million for defender services 95 in crease over fy2003 the amount of 6045 million is exactly halfway between 6139 million for this account in the house passed cjs bill hr 2799 and 5950 million recommended by the senate appropriations committee the requested amount included 26 million for an increase in the hourly pay rate for panel attorneys in capital cases cases where the department of justice is seeking to impose the death penalty the funding would have increased the maximum hourly pay rate in such cas from 125 to 157 effective on april 1 2004 the 125 maximum hourly rate of co mpensation in capital cases has been in place essentially since 1989 nd subsequently was statut orily set as the maximum by the antiterrorism and effective deat h penalty act of 1996 pl 104132 the request also included 104 million for an incr ease in the hourly pay rate for panel attorneys in noncapital cases from 90 to 113 also effective on april 1 2004 the 90 hourly rate was implemented on may 1 2002 the consolidated appropriations ac t for fy2004 however does not provide for any increases in panel attorney hourly pa rates instead conferees for the act adopted by reference house and senate re port language discusse d below concerning budget requests for panel attorn ey pay rate increases the conferrees stated that they expect the judiciary to address these cerns before requesting pay increases above the rate of inflation the earlierpassed house cjs bill h r 2799 had included funding for an inflationary increase in the noncapital pa nel attorney rate from 90 to 92 per hour and in the capital panel ttorney rate from 125 to 128 per hour effective april 1 2004 however the house appropriations committee in its report h rept 108 221 at p 117 explicitly rejected the judici arys request for pay raise in noncapital panel attorney rates to 113 per hour the house committee said it expected the judiciary to document the impact of 45 million increase provided to defender services in fy2002 and fy2003 on the judi ciarys ability to attract and retain adequate panel attorney representations further the committee questioned why the judiciary continues to propose single hour ly rate to be imp lemented nationally when the committee said it understood that there continue to be disparities throughout the country in the costs to attract and retain counsel httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31809crs40 for its part the senate appropriations committee declined to recommend any increase in either panel attorney rate in its report s rept 108144 at p 120 the committee noted that it had provided for significant increase in panel attorney hourly rates in fy2002 the committee said it had not seen any empirical evidence from the judiciary to support the latters re quest for an additional increase in the hourly rate from 90 to 113 for noncapita l cases and from 125 to 157 for capital cases the committee asked that in future budget submissions the judiciary include such data as an accompaniment to its request and it urged the administrative office of the us courts to surve appropriate judges and report as soon as practical to the committee statistical data supporting the issues as reported by the judges court security the judiciary requested 3112 million for this account 167 increase over 2677 million enacted fo r fy2003 court security conferees for the fy2003 bill in hrept 10810 d noted is unique account appropriated to the judiciary but primarily managed by the department of justice the fy2003

service the consolidated appropriations act for fy2004 include s 2775 million for court security 41 increase over fy2003 funding and an amount halfway between 2889 million passed earlier by the house

2003 judiciary spokesman referred to the 106 supervisory deputy marshal positi ons approved by congress in fy2002 and transferred to the department of justi ce in fy2003 as linchpin to effective security of our courthouses and he asked for congresss support to ensure that they will continue to be dedicat ed to courthouse security in response the house appropriations committee in its report h rept 108 221 at p 117 noted that its recommenda tion under the us marshals service usms account in title i of the cjs bill provided funding for the 106 supervisory deputy marshal positions however the committee said it remain ed concerned about the administration of court security by the usms and the administrative office of the us courts the committee noted that the statement of managers accompanying the fy2003 cjs act had directed that fu ture budget requests clearly display the level and types of c ourt security equipment and systems requested compared with the current year this information the co mmittee said was not provided in the fiscal year 2004 budget justifications nor was it provided in timely manner after the submission of the budget request like wise the senate ppropriations committee in its report s rept 108144 at p 121 noted that it had not received the study on the management of this program and the unique rela tionship between the us marshals service and the federal j udiciary as requested last year most recently conferees for the cons olidated appropriations act for fy2004 expressed their concern about the delay in submitting the management study the united states marshals service was direct ed to conduct in fiscal year 2003 the conferees said they hope this study w ill provide recommendati ons to improve the administration of this program by the usms and the judiciary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31809crs41 in evident response to the judiciarys c ourt security concerns expressed at the march 27 2003 hearings discussed above the consolidated

justment for judges and justices effective january 2004 in fe bruary 2003 judges received 31 costof living increase in their salaries re troactive to janua ry 1 2003 the fy2003 adjustment followed other upward adjustments in judges and justices salaries which congress approved in fi scal years 2002 2001 20 00 1998 and 1993 congress however declined to authorize such adjustments for fy1999 or for fiscal years 1994 through 1997 the congressional reaction to the judiciarys request for fy2004 costofliving salary adjustment at first was mixed but ultimately was favorab in january 2004 upon enactment of the consolidated ppropriations act for fy2004 salaries of federal judges and justices increased by 22 earlier the housepasse d fy2004 cjs bill hr 2799 did not include funding for pay adjustment the senate appr opriations committee however recommended both costofliving and 165 salary in crease for federal judges the senate reported bill s 1585 appr opriated 360 million to fund th

federal judges and justices also were incr eased retroactively by 22 the judiciarys fy2004 request came on the heels of the 2002 yearend report on the federal judiciary of chief justice william h re hnquist in that report the chief justice maintained that more than costofliving adjustment was needed in the way of judicial salary increase we cannot continue to use an arrangement for setting pay the chief justice declared that simply ignores the need to raise pay until judicial and other highlevel government salaries are so skewed that large and politically unpopular increase is necessary the chief justice ex plained that i am not suggesting that we match the pay of the private sector but the large and growing disparity must be decreased if we hope to continue to provide our nation capable and effective federal judicial system in his 2003 yearend report on the federal judiciary released on january 1 2004 chief justice rehnquist commented that c ongress had failed th is year to raise judicial salaries significan tly nevertheless he tha nked all of those who worked so hard during the last year to get congress to increase the pay of judges beyond modest costofliving adjustment the
