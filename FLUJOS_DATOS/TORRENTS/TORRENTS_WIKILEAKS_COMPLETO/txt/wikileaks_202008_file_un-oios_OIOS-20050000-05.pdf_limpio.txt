containers for air traffic control servic at pristina airport it also deals with an annex agreement for additional office accom modation lunchroom and showers for the kfor multinational force the value of the main contract was 9303349 and the annex agreement 49970 allegation 1 it is alleged that there were procedural irregular ities concerning the award of the main contract for the supply and construction of of fice containers for air traffic control services due to the fact that only one bid was received and there was gap of two months between the selection of the winning bidder and signature of the contract 9 on 26 september 2002 bid evaluation exercise t ook place for contract to supply and construct office containers for air traf fic control services at pristina airport thirteen companies appear as having been s ent bidding documents however only one bid was received for the contract from the vendor this gave rise to procedural concerns by the itf as to whethe r the contract should have been retendered due to the absence of sufficient offers 10 following evaluation of the bid contract was signed two months later in december 2002 by official 3 and the deputy to the d ivisional manager of the kta on behalf of atcs with the vendor in the sum f 9303349 11 the procurement officer having conduct of the t ender was asked in interview why there was gap of two months between the tende r and the signature of the contract heshe replied that the difference betwee n the date of the evaluation in october 2002 and the contract signature date of dec ember 2002 was due to the fact that initially decision was taken that the m ain contract be postponed after only one offer had been received airport engineer 3 had indicated that heshe could find cheaper second hand containers however airport engineer 3 was 4 unsuccessful in doing so with the result that the need for the containers had become urgent decision had therefore been ta ken to accept the offer from the vendor 12 this explanation was also given by the atcs off icial in meeting with the itf the atcs official added that the decision to accept the offer from the vendor had been taken by airport engineer 3 and the kta di visional manager 13 having regard to the fact that the office conta iners were urgently needed the fact that bids were issued to 13 companies and the dela in the signature of the contract resulted from an attempt to source the off ice containers more cheaply the itf makes adverse finding concerning the all egation of procedural irregularity due to the acceptance of the only bid or due to the delayed signature of the contract allegation 2 it is alleged that routing slip dated 13 january 2003 created misleading impression by stating that the lowest evaluated bid has been recommended when only one bid was received for the main contract 14 routing slip from the kta procurement officer to the then deputy srsg and the deputy to the kta divisional manager states tha t the lowest evaluated bid has been unanimously recommended for contract award this implies that more than one bid was received and evaluated 15 when asked about this apparent inconsistency t he procurement officer stated that it was due to hisher insufficient knowledge f english which led him to follow the normal wording used in the routing slip for indicating the winning bid heshe added that the evaluation report would have been attached to the routing slip and would have indicated that 13 companies d been issued with tender documents 16 in view of this explanation the itf does not t ake the view that the statement was intended to create misleading impression allegation 3 it is alleged that single source contract was ad ded less than two months after the award of the main contract 17 request was made from the new lead nation at the airport iceland for additional office accommodation lunchroom and show ers for the kfor multi national force at meeting between the kta divisio nal manager kfor and unmik on 7 january 2003 18 further note from the commander of the icelan d crisis response unit icru to the atcs official and the kta divisional manager dated 21 january 2003 indicates that the supplementary works were urgent 19 the kta divisional manager signed justificat ion for the supplementary works on 29 january 2003 and an annex agreement dated 7 f ebruary 2003 was signed by the kta divisional manager on behalf of tcs pristina airport and the 5 vendor for the supplementary work to be carried out by means of single source contract in sum of 4997000 20 concerns were raised due to the fact that sup plementary single source contract was added for additional office accommodation lunc hroom and showers less than two months after the main contract for office containers for the air traffic control services when asked about this issue the kta divisional manager indicated that the issue had arisen due to the tran sfer of kfor management in march 2003 from the italian air force to multina tional force led by iceland 21 the accommodation that had been used by the ita lian air force belonged to the british army who decided to remove it therefore an urgent need had arisen to provide accommodation for the multinational kfor s taff both for skeleton emergency overnight crew for medical evacuations an d for lunchroom and kitchen during the daytime 22 this response is confirmed in the notes of eting dated 7 january 2003 which record that request was made to unmik air traff ic control services to provide accommodation offices and lunchroom for kfor st aff providing overnight emergency evacuation cover and second note dated 21 january 2003 which requests that the work be expedited so as to comple the work by the end of february the notes detail points of agreement at the meeting on 7 january 2003 allegation 4 the value of the single source annex agreement exc eeded the permitted authorisation limit for the kta divisional manager to sign and approve contract which deviated from the normal procurement procedur under article 63 of unmik finance administrative instruction 19992 on public procurement using kosovo consolidated budget funds and allegation 5 capital expenditure approval for the annex agreeme nt was sought after completion of the contract 23 capital expenditure approval dated 4 march 20 03 indicates that the kta divisional manager authorised the annex agreement t proceed as single source contract in spite of the fact that the contr act exceeded hisher authorisation limit of 25000 24 in addition the capital expenditure approval i ndicates that the additional office accommodation lunchroom and showers had already be completed by the time that financial approval was sought for the exp enditure 25 the kta divisional manager was asked in intervi ew why the capital expenditure approval was sought after the work had been complet ed in view of the fact that the work had been proposed in january 2003 heshe replied that it was due to pressure from kfor to complete the required work fo r the transition from italy to the kfor multinational force coupled with the slo w pace of clearance for contract through the kta which heshe attributed t queries raised by the kta auditor the kta divisional manager added that verb approval for the work was given in january by the deputy to the kta divisiona l manager but the work had 6 to be done to enable the transfer from the italian air force to the kfor multinational force to take place vi conclusions 26 having regard to the fact that the office conta iners were urgently needed the fact that bids were issued to 13 companies and the dela in the signature of the contract resulted from an attempt to source the off ice containers more cheaply the itf makes adverse finding concerning the all egation of procedural irregularity due to the acceptance of the only bid or due to the delayed signature of the contract 27 in the light of the response by the procurement officer to the itf the itf does not conclude that the routing slip drafted by the p rocurement officer dated 13 january 2003 was intended to create misleading im pression by stating that the lowest evaluated bid has been recommended when onl one bid was received for the main contract 28 the single source annex agreement for additiona l office accommodation lunchroom appears to have been justified by the urg ency of the kfor accommodation requirements however the kta divisi onal manager should not have been the signatory for it since it exceeded h isher financial authorisation limit to sign and approve contract which deviate d from the normal procurement procedure under article 63 of unmik finance admini strative instruction 19992 on public procurement using kosovo consolidated bud get funds in view of the urgency to complete the works an emergency procure ment procedure would have been the appropriate course of action 29 in addition capital expenditure approval for t he annex agreement was sought by the kta divisional manager after completion of the additional office accommodation lunchroom and showers thereby creat ing contractual obligation to pay the contractor before capital exp enditure had been approved vii recommendations 30 it is recommended that given the kta divisional manager has left the employ of the kta unmik should ensure that the dsrsg pillar iv is provided with this report so that copy can be placed on hisher pers onnel file for future reference iv0427901 31 it is recommended that the dsrsg ensure that s taff in pillar iv and the kta are aware of the necessity to follow established proced ures in contract management iv0427902
