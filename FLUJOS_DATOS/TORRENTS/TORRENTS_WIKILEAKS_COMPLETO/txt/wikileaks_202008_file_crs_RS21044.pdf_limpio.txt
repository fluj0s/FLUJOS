g21g157g142g150g561g5g142g149g149g156g561 human embryonic stem cells are often described as master cells able to develop into any other type of cell in the human body1 potential sources for human embryonic stem cells include embryos created via in vitro fertilization for either research or reproduction five to nine week old embryos or fetuses obtained through elective bortion and embryos created through cloning or somatic cell nuclear transfer stem cells which are derived from adult tissues such as umbilical cord blood or bone marrow are distinct from em bryonic stem cells and do not naturally exhibit the same developmental characteristics or behaviors in 1998 researchers at the university of wisconsin isolated cells from human embryo early in the developmental cycle and developed the first human embryonic stem cell lines2 controversy surrounds the removal of stem cells from human embryos and fetuses because most techniques require the destruction of the embryo during the removal process however human embryonic stem cells are regarded as possibly having more therapeutic potential than stem cells derived from adult tissue whereas embryonic stem cells are classified as either totipotent3 or pluripotent4 stem cells found in adult sources may only have the capacity to differentiate into few types of cells5 recent discoveries may lessen the demand for embryonic stem cells in 2007 researchers in japan and the united states published reports that they had successfully induced human somatic cells to exhibit pluripotent characteristics6 this advancement notwithstanding many stem cell researchers continue to argue that embryonic stem cell procurement is necessary in order to provide among other things the gold standard against which other means of pluripotent stem cell procurement are measured 7 research utilizing human embryonic stem cell lines has focused on the potential that these cells can offer to treat or mitigate diseases and conditions and to generate replacement tissues for disfunctioning cells or organs8 examples of research efforts include spinal cord injury multiple 1 in contrast differentiated somatic cells which perform the day to day functions of the body are not thought to give rise to other types of cells absent human intervention see eg infra footnote 6 and accompanying text 2 natl inst of health us dept of health hum services stem cells scientific progress and future research directions 4 2001 available at httpstemcellsnihgovin foscireport2001reporthtm 3 the earliest embryonic stem cells are called totipotent cells as they can develop into an entire organism producing both the embryo and tissues required to support it in the uterus p resident s council on bioethics alternative sources of human pluripotent stem cells at 5 n 2005 available at httpwwwbioethicsgov 4 pluripotent stem cells can develop into almost any type of cell in the body but these stem cells cannot form the supporting tissues necessary for gestation as seen with totipotent cells id 5 for example hematopoietic stem cells found in adult bone marrow and umbilical cord blood only appear to naturally give rise to various types of blood

implicating human embryonic stem cells 1 research on human embryonic tissue that produces stem cells and 2 research using those stem cells to study human development or illness as the state of scientific knowledge and expertise has advanced the federal government has taken various positions regarding the propriety of federally funding research at each stage currently the use of federal funds in both phases is subject to certain restrictions the scope of these restrictions will be discussed below

president clinton through an executive directive prohibited federal funding of such research11 subsequently in 1996 congress enacted legislative ban in the funding measure of the national institutes of health and has continued to pass similar ban annually since that time 12 known as the dickey amendment13 the congressional ban prohibits federally appropriated funds from being used for either the creation of human embryos for research purposes or for research in which human embryo or embryos are destroyed di scarded or knowingly subjected to risk of injury or death14 the ban defined human embryo or embryos to include any organism not protected as human subject under 45 cfr 46 human subject protection regulations that is derived by fertilization parthenogenesis cloning or any other means from one or more human gametes 15 despite the absence of federal funding embryonic research has continued with other sources of funding in 1998 after the inclusion of the dickey amendment

privately funded human embryonic stem cell lines questions arose as to whether federal funds could be used in subsequent research involving these cell lines in january of 1999 hhss general counsel concluded that the prohibitions against the use of hhs appropriated funds for human embryo research would not apply to research using stem cells because such cells are not human embryo within the statutory definition 17 hhs concluded that nih could fund research that uses stem ce lls derived from the embryo by private funds however because of the language in the dickey amendment nih could not fund research that derived the stem cells from embryos some members of congress strongly opposed hhss interpretation and believed that the legislative ban covered and prohibited funding such research in response to this opposition hhs secretary shalala stated in letter that the finition of embryo used in the hhs legal opinion relied on the definition of embryo in the statute and that the ban applied only to research in which human embryos are discarded or destroyed but not to research preceding or following on such projects18 nih published draft guidelines for funding of stem cell research in the federal register in december of 1999 and final guidelines were issued in august of 200019 based upon hhss interpretation the guidelines stated that funds could not be used to extract or derive stem cells from an embryo thereby destroying it however studies utilizing pluripotent stem cell lines derived from human embryos could be conducted using nih funds provided that the cells were derived 1 without federal funds 2 from human embryos that were created for the purposes of fertility treatment and 3 were in excess of the clinical need of the individuals seeking such treatment nih initiated the applications process but that process was overtaken by events and new administrations policy was set forth

when president bush took office in january of 2001 he announced the conduct of review of the stem cell research issue and ordered hhs to review the nih guidelines issued by the previous administration during this transition period nih suspended its review of applications from researchers seeking federal funds to perform embryonic stem cell research subsequently on august 9 2001 president bush announced that federal funds would be available to human embryonic stem cell research on restricted basis the new policy would provide federal funds to be used for research only on existing stem cell lines that were already in existence as of the date 16 james thomson et embryonic stem cell lines derived from human blastocysts 282 s cience 1145 1998 17 letter from hhs gen counsel harriet rabb to harold varmus director nih january 15 1999 general counsel rabb determined that the statutory ban on human embryonic research defined an embryo as an organism that when implanted in the uterus is capable of becoming human being the opinion stated that pluripotent stem cells are not and cannot develop into an organism as defined in the statute 18 letter from secretary shalala to rep jay dickey

support resear ch that utilizes human embryonic stem cells without regard to the date on which the stem cells were derived from human embryo to be eligible for use in research conducted or supported by the secretary the stem cells would have been required to meet certain conditions for example only stem cells derived from human embryos that were donated from in vitro fertilization clinics were created for the purposes of fertility treatment and were in excess of the clinical need of the individuals seeking such treatment would have been eligible for use 26 vote to override the veto was
