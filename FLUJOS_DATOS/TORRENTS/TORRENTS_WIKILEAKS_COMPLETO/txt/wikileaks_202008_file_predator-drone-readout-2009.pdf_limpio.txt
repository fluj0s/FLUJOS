reading mission control data out of predator drone video feeds by kingcope introduction there have been recent reports 1 of insurgents in tercepting unencrypted us predator drone video feeds in iraq and afghanistan the predator d rone video feeds were sent in some cases from the predator drones without any encryption tec hnology so the insurgents were in rather simple situation to intercept the video feeds and s ave them to hard disks and share them among each other wsj 1 states that software ca lled skygrabber was used to read the video feeds the intention of this software is to r ead images and videos off the air by using satellite antennas after doing some research on the issue we found tha t in the predator video feeds aside from image data there is also mission control data carri ed inside the satellite signal to the ground control stations it is theoretically possible to r ead off this mission control data both in the intercepted video feed and saved video data on hard disks technology used by the drones there is control and command link to communicate from control station to the drone further there is data link that sends mission trol data and video feeds back to the ground control station here one has to distinguish betwee n lineofsight communication paths and beyond lineofsight communication paths the opera tion of the lineofsight link is limited to approx 81138 miles this operating range can be xtended by for example using mobile ground control stations which are locally deployed lineofsight links are critical for takeoffs and landings of the drone these links uti lize cband communication path beyond lineofsight communication links operate in the kuband satellite frequency this allows the uav unmanned arial vehicle to cover ap prox 1500 miles of communication capability figure cband and kuband communication so this explains somewhat why the insurgents were ble to intercept the predator video feeds when they were sent unencrypted to the ground stati on the only thing needed is cband or kuband antenna which can read traffic sending tra ffic to satellite for example is not needed in this case the drones normally use mpegts mpeg transport str eam to send video and data to the ground station motions imagery standards board sb 2 has developed several standards on how to embed the control data into mpe g streams figure excerpt of metadata sent with the mpeg tran sport stream taken off public misb standard docum ent an important note is that our research shows that m ost if not all metadata inside the mpeg stream is for its own not encrypted if the mpeg str eam itself is not encrypted how to read the control data with publicly availabl tools during our research we found suitable tool to rea d the mission control data off the air video feeds and also off saved video feeds the tool is p rogrammed by leadtools 3 and is capable of reading klv metadata out of mpegts ins ide the leadtools multimedia sdk package programmer finds source code and bina ries of the needed tool the following screenshot shows the tool in action the loaded file is saved mpegts uav video with private metadata embedded references 1 insurgents hack us drones wall street journa l httponlinewsjcomarticlesb126102247889095011 html 2 misb httpwwwgwgngamilmisbstdpubshtml 3 leadtools httpleadtoolscomsdkmultimedia mpeg2transportstreamhtm
