1970 pl 91518 which was implemented by th department of transpor tation john volpe then secretary of transportation asserted dur ing amtraks creation that it could eventually be profitable on some occasi ons he said it coul d achieve profitability after three years1 however in these statements he attached two conditions to that prediction that the federal government provide significant capital funding to produce highspeed trains in shorthaul corridors where profitability was possible as well as providing other improve ments in service and that the size of the passenger network would be cut back to the point th at the profits from the successful corridors would be sufficient to subsidize the remaining routes intercity passenger rail serv ice was running deficit be fore amtrak was created and there were doubts expressed in congre ss and elsewhere that amtrak would ever be profitable the ra il passenger service act of 1970 created amtrak as for profit corporation but in section 101 th congressional findings and statement of purpose it found that fe deral financial assistance as well as investment capital from the private sector of the economy is needed to provide modern efficient intercity rail passenger service in their floor statem ents about this legislation several members of congress either expressed skepticism that amtrak would ever be profitable or echoed volp conditions that amtrak w ould have to provide high speed trains or cut back its route mileag significantly to achieve profitability otherwise one member all congress w ould have accomplished by creating amtrak would be to change the name on the annual debt incurred by provi ding passenger rail service and make the federal g overnment responsible for it amtraks fastest train in 2002 the acela averages 85 mph between washington dc and new york city comp ared to the metroliner which averaged 80 mph over the same route before amtrak was created amtraks route mileage in 2000 was 23000 miles its route mileage in 1971 was 23000 miles thus neither of the two conditions specified by thos who initially predic ted profitability for amtrak has been achievedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31473contents

congressional expectations at amtraks creation most discussions of amtrak refer to mtraks status as forprofit company and have noted that amtrak was inte nded by congress to be profitmaking enterprise in fact amtrak is not now forprofit company it was originally created as such but in the amtrak improveme nt act of 1978 pl 95421 amtraks authorizing statute was amended to read amtrak shall be ope rated and managed as forprofit company 49 usc 24301a2 the conference report noted that the bill removed amtraks forprofit status but required that the corporation be operated and managed as forprofit corporation hcr 951478 neve rtheless amtraks continuing need for federal financial assistance is seen by some as evidence that amtrak has failed to live up to congress expectations for the organization this report examines the statements of congressional and nixon administration leaders at the time of amtraks creation regard ing the financial prospects of amtrak amtrak originally called the national railroad passenger corporation was created by the rail passenger service ac t of 1970 pl 91518 and began operation on may 1 1971 it was created because th railroad companies which had long subsidized their moneylosing passenger service with profits from their freight service were now losing money overall nd wanted to be free of the responsibility and cost to provide passenger service at that time railroads were required to provide passenger service in return for th opportunity to haul freight although they could petition the interstate commerce co mmission icc to drop individual money losing passenger routes congress had noted the financial difficulties of private sector passenger rail service since at least 1958 when it had passed legislation allowing railroads to petition the icc to discontinue individual routes each year after that the icc heard appeals from railroad companies petitioning to discontinue passenger routes and was granting these requests resulting in rapid decline of the availability of passenger ra il service the impending failure in 1970 of the penn central railroad the largest ra ilroad in the country and th largest single provider of passenger rail service focused congress attention on the immediate threat to passenger rail service c ongress believed that if some thing were not done passenger rail service would disappear as railroad co mpanies either went bankrupt or divested all of their passenger service passenger rail service deficits prior to amtrak passenger rail service had been unprofitable for many years before 1970 just how long and how unprofitable depende d on how one measured the costs ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31473crs2 providing passenger service passenger trains and freight trains were operated by the same companies ran over the same rail networks and were guided serviced and repaired by many of the same employees this made the task of separating the costs of passenger service from freight service difficult there were two basic ways of measuring the cost 1 assuming that railroad company would continue to operate freight trains even in the absence of passenger service so attribute most of the companys overhead costs to freight and measure only the additional costs incurred by the company to operate passenger trains or 2 dividing all the costs of the company proportionally between passenger and freight servi ce the first approach known as solely related passenger costs was considered by the icc as the more realistic measure of the cost of providi ng passenger service and was used in evaluating requests to discontinue moneylo sing passenger trains it produced lower expense figure for passenger service the second approach known as full passenger cost was used by the railroads in prot esting the costs imposed on them by having to provide passenger service it produced higher expense figure for passenger service the differences produced by these two thods can be seen in table 1 in 1941 and 1950 railroads made prof it on passenger service accordin g to the solely related cost measure while they lost hundreds of millions of dollars according to the full cost measure during wwii with gaso line rationing passenger railroad ridership was artificially increased to its highest level since 1929 in 1945 even the full cost measure produced profit but by 1955 even the solely related cost measure showed passenger service to be moneylosing operation the railroad companies reduced this deficit by discontinui ng many passenger routes after 1958 but it rose again

transportation gpo 1977 p 311 by 1970 it was generally accepted that ra ilroad companies were losing money on passenger service why this was so was subject of debate opinion divided generally into two camps the discourag ement hypothesis held that the railroad companies wanted to drop pa ssenger service in favor of the more profitable freighthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31473crs3 2since the beginning of the interstate hi ghway program in 1956 significant portion of federal spending on highways has come from the federal excise tax on gasoline in light of this many argue that federal highway spendi ng should not be viewed as subsidizing highways but rather as selffin anced program based on user fees 3traffic world december 14 1970 p 77 4railway age february 8 1971 p 12 5traffic world december 14 1970 p 77service so they deliberately undermined their passenger business by offering poor service little marketing and decrepit trains according to this view if the railroad companies had truly been committed to maki ng passenger rail service success it would have been profitable the other hypothesis which might be called the transportation efficiency view argued th at passenger rail serv ice had gotten fair market test and failed that as great er proportion of the population was able to afford private cars people preferred the convenience of their cars for shorter trips and for longer trips the airplane was so much faster than the train that it attracted those who could afford to pay high rates for travel in this view passenger rail service was stateoft heart transportation t echnology in the early 20th century but it had been superseded by the superior speed of aviation and the superior flexibility of the automobile there was subgroup of the economic efficiency group who argued that passenger service had not gotten fair test economically because the market was tilted against passenger rail service by the federal government which subsidized the building of highways throughout the nation which made the car more attractive for wouldbe passengers and also gave boos t to the trucking firms which competed with the railroads for freight service and subsidized the construction of airports and air traffic control systems as well as aviation research2 some in this group argued that if the federal government assisted passe nger rail service as it did auto travel and aviation the passenger rail market would be healthy original expectations fo r amtrak administration in speech in december 1970 secretary of transportation volpe asserted that amtrak would be profitable3 in february of 1971 he aborated on that assertion saying that amtrak would break even within three years and be profitable thereafter4 however this expectation was based on two assumptions 1 that amtrak would provide better service and 2 that it w ould operate reduced number of routes volpe claimed that fast clean economical and safe tr ains could attract enough riders to make profit5 at the same time he was drawing up route system for amtrak that was great reduction from th extent of service being provided by railroad companies but when he declared that amtraks profitability would depend in part on reduced number of routes he did not mean simply amtraks original route network he said that after amtrak had been in operation for few years the unprofitable routes would be cut back to th point that their losses could be covered by the money earned on the profitable routeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31473crs4 6sunset for railpax new york times january 26 1971 p a32 7cited in frank wilner the amtrak story simmonsboardman books omahanebraska 1994 p 43 8congressional record v 116 1970 october 13 p 36594some have asserted that there was another perspective in the nixon administrations expectations for amtrak while some sincerely wanted amtrak to succeed others in the administration expected amtrak to disappear after few years the new york times quoted an unnamed high offi cial in the department of transportation the purpose of this bill creating amtrak is to get passenger service off the backs of the railroads run the wheels off the existing equipment and then put an end to passenger trains in this country6 original expectations for amtrak congressional daniel oneal majority counsel for the senate transportation subco mmittee during the time that the amtrak legislation was drafted recalled we added the forprofit clause because we thought this new entity should have high aspirations it would be wonderful if such service could be selfsustaining but nowhere in the world has any nation been able to avoid subsidizing rail passengers7 remarks on the rail passenger service act of 1970 in the congressional record and newspaper accounts durin g its consideration shed light on the view that amtrak was expected to be profitma king enterprise the remarks in the congressional record indicate hope that amtrak might be profitable this hope was based on secretary volpes predictions of how passenger rail service would change under amtraks leadership that there woul d be significant government investment in improving service including the deve lopment of highspeed rail lines and that unprofitable routes would be pruned for example the comments of representative harley staggers west virginia chairman of the committee on interstate and foreign commerce which was the authorizing committee for railroads reflect the improved service assumption the bill will create corporation which will be private forprofit corporation and we hope that it will be profitable organization and i believe that it will in the long run we know that in starting off they are going to have some trouble but i expect that after very few years it will be prosperous organization because we have begun to develop high speed trains better railroad cars with more commodious service that people will use as has been exemplified by the metroliner that runs between washington and new york now8 representative j j pickle of flor ida member of the subcommittee on transportation and aeronautics the authorizing subcommittee reiterated the promise of new highspeed train tec hnologies

jet turbine engines he argued that the legislation was necessary to preserve the rightsofway now until these new technologies could be implemented9 he was followed by representative dan kuykendall of tennessee another member of the subcommittee on transportation and aeronautics if anyone asks do you think that with the present equipment can this passenger corporation be profitable the answer is absolutely not it cannot be profitable with the present equipment but by starting with equipment like the metroliner and going rapidly ahead into th really sophisticated equipment of the future it can be and will be profitable operation10 representative richard ottinger of new york summed things up the corporation will hopefully make profit through its operationsnevertheless the corporation will be requi red to run passenger trains over some unprofitable routes when necessary in the public interest so it is possible that this new program will have to be funded by the congress on an annual basis hopefully new developments in high speed rail technology will enable the national railroad passenger corporation to eventually become solvent 11 the pruned service assumption was reflected in the remarks of representative william springer of illinois the ranking member of the committee on interstate and foreign commerce it has become apparent that saving th entire nationwide network of passenger trains is impossible federal subs idies of astronomical proportions would be necessary to keep all those empty longhaul trains operating there do remain areas of the country where rail service should be useful and economically sound at the same time the example which usually comes to mind is the northeast corridor but it is not the only place this will not as i have already intimated be nationwide network as we have known it in the past it will necessarily concentrate upon corridors of high density travel although it is intended to be corporation run for profit the hars h realities indicate massive infusion of money from the government to make it go12 early returns on amtraks progress toward profitability amtraks initial funding was 40 milli on for operations with 100 million loan guarantee for new equipment and imp roved roadbeds it also received about 195 million in cash or equipment from the ra ilroads who turned over their passenger service responsib ilities to amtrak congressional leaders objected that this would not be enough money to sustain amtrak but administration officials declined to askhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31473crs6 13amtrak plea is

for the next two years hearings on amtraks unexpectedly large deficit will give house and senate members forum for their questions and complaints about service to their districts but even those who have been complaining the loudest have long considered amtraks losses inevitable and expect to approve the new appropriation13 by the oneyear mark the optimists hopes for amtraks profitability were dimming in its first year amtrak lost 50 percent more money than its founders predicted the vision of its fathers in the nixon administration of amtrak operating as forprofit company has all but eva porated many people close to amtrak believe that it has little chance of survival without huge and probably endless and ever increasing federal subsidiesor as an alternative radical cutback in the amount of service it provides14 that article quoted senate comme rce committee staffer who noted that amtrak was getting killed because its co rridor trains were too slow to compete with cars and planes the metroliner15 the fastest train weve got only averages 80 mph and it was built to do 150 until we get the equipment and the roadbed to compete with buses cars and planes in th corridors we wont know if amtrak can compete16 thirty years later amtraks ne w acela trains built to do 165 still only average 85 miles per hour over the same route because the roadbed still cannot support high speeds over its entire length and other corridors have ever been upgraded even to the level of the northeast corridor the remarks of senator lowell weicker of connecticut at the opening of the senate subcommittee on surface transporta tions hearing on the administrations first request for additional funding for amtrak october 26 1971 highlighted many of the themes which have run through congressional debate over amtrak since its creation he excoriated the department of transportation for understating how much money amtrak needed to improve passenger rail service and requested that

have enough money to make the significant improvements needed to make passenger rail service economica lly viable all that would have been accomplished would be to have changed the name on the passenger rail deficit and congress will take on the role of making up the difference between amtraks revenues and expenditures as an annual exercise17 have the original preconditions for amtrak profitability been met at the time of its creation those cong ressional and administration leaders who forecasted amtrak achieving profitability based that fo recast on two preconditions federal investment to produce fast safe trains and cu tback of the rail network so that the losses from unprofitable routes would be covered by the pr ofits of profitable routes those arguing that these pre conditions were neve r met point out that amtraks train speeds and route mileage are virtually the same now as when it was created amtrak has received 242 billion in suppor t from the federal government since its creation in 197118 this is significant sum of money it is also to put it in one perspective less than the federal govern ment spent on highways in fy2001 should amtrak have been able to velop fast safe trains with that amount of funding to determine that one would need to know how much amtrak would require just to maintain its overall status quo since maki ng significant improvements would require enough money to first maintain its exis ting capital and then finance improvements amtrak has received on average 760 million year in federal assistance of that amount 330 million year was for capita l improvements total of 99 billion over amtraks life that average ceals some wide swings in actual annual funding swings which complicated th implementation of capital improvement programs which by their natu re are dependent on predicta ble levels of funding over period of several years in 2001 amtrak estimated that it would need about 750 million year in capital spending just to maintain its current services19 that is over twice the 330 million average annual funding amtrak has received for capital investment amtrak had to borrow money to finance the purchas of its acela trains and thus increased its longterm debt because it did not ve enough capital funding to purchase them outrighthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31473crs8 20report from the international

funding amtrak has been provided ce its inception it may also seem an unrealistic amount for perspective one can look at western europe which over the past three decades has significantly upgraded its level of train service by creating true highspeed trains on dedicated tracks in just the 10y ear period of 1980 1989 western european governments provide d 101 billion in assistance to their railwaysfour times the amount that the federal government provided to amtrak between 1971200220 for comparison western eu rope has about 90 million more people than the us 380 million to 287 million in the us on much less than half the land area 14 million square miles to 37 million square miles in the us passenger train ridership in europe while higher than in the us has also been declining in recent decades except where highspeed routes have been created as for the second precondition that mtraks route mileage would be cut back to the level that could be supported by mtraks profitable trains it has been argued that since amtrak did not receive the inve stment to produce fast er more profitable trains it would not have been fair to passengers to cut back the mileage to what could be supported by the system as it existed at amtraks creation since amtrak had statutory mandate to provide nationa l network of passenger service from its founding until the amtrak reform and accountability act of 1997 amtrak supporters assert that it wa s virtually required to opera number of routes around the nation which are not profitable moreove r it is not clear how the department of transportation or amtrak would have responded to the idea of eliminating significant number of routes amtrak s been dependent on th federal government for its survival since its creation cong ress which provides the appropriations to maintain amtraks existence has members who have argued since amtraks founding that their constituents deserve rail rvice even if they are in areas where demand for rail service is relatively low and that if amtrak did not provide service to their constituents they did not see how they could support funding for amtrak since its inception amtrak has cut some routes and added ot hers but its overall route mileage has not varied great deal it was 23000 m iles in 1971 nd 23000 miles in 200021 critics of amtraks performance assert that amtrak was intended by congress to be profitmaking enterprise and therefore its need for federal assistance each year is evidence of its failure to meet the expectations congress had of it but there is little evidence to support that contention in the legislative history of amtraks creation expectations of mtrak profitability such as they were appear to have been premised on significant federal support for the development of faster trains andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31473crs9 cutbacks in the route mileage served since neither of those conditions were met amtrak supporters argue that amtraks lack of
