susan et i had also seen the forster et paper and was glad to see he had followed up on work and ideas we had discussed some years ago when he was at reading and from the exeter workshop at the time i had done some simple research on whether the stratosphere could affect the tropical troposphere possibly through convection modification or radiative cooling id done simple timeseries regression of t2ltatsurfbt4c and got some regression coefficients out that suggested an influence now this was with old and now discredited data and the fu et technique has since superseded it to some extent or at least cast considerable doubt upon its efficacy it would certainly be hard to prove in regression what was cause and effect with such broad weighting functions even using t2lt which still isnt really independent from t4 but one thing i did do to try to prove the regression result was real is take the composite differences between qbo phases on 45 years of detrended cant remember exactly how but i think i took differences from decadally filtered data data from radiosondes hadat1 at the time this showed really very interesting result and suggested that this communication if it was real went quite far down in to the troposphere and was statistically significant particularly in those seasons when the itcz and qbo were geographically coincident i attach the slide for interest i think this is the only scientifically valid part of the analysis that i would stand by today given the rather massive developments since i doubt that raobs inhomogeneities could explain the plot result as they project much more onto the trend than they would onto this type of analysis the cooling stratosphere may really have an influence even quite low down if this qbo composite technique is good analogue for cooling startospheres impact and timeseries regression analysis supports it in some obs it would be interesting to repeat such an analysis with the newer obs but i dont have time counter however is that surely the models do radiation so those with ozone loss should do good job of this effect this could be checked in bens ensemble in poor mans sense at least because some have ozone depletion and some dont the only way this could be real factor not picked by the models i concluded at the time is if models are far too keen to trigger convection and that any realworld increased radiative cooling efficiency effect is masked in the models because they convect far too often and regain cape closure as condition on another matter we seem to be concentrating entirely on layeraverage temperatures this is fine but we know from ccsp these show little in the way of differences the key and much harder test is to capture the differences in behaviour between layers levels the amplification behaviour this was the focus of santer et and i still believe is the key scientific question given that each model realisation is inherently so different but that we believe the physics determining the temperature profile to be the key test that has to be answered maybe we need to step back and rephrase the question in terms of the physics rather than aiming solely to rebutt douglass et in this case the key physical questions in my view would be 1 why is there such strong evidence from sondes for minima at c 500 is this because it is near the triple point of water in the tropics or at the top of the shallow convection or simply an artefact i dont have any good ideas how we would answer the first two of these questions 2 is there really stratospheric radiative influence if so how low does it go what is the cause are the numbers consistent with the underlying governing physics or simply an artefact of residual obs errors 3 can any models show trend behaviour that deviates from salr on multidecadal timescales if so what is it about the model that causes this effect physics forcings phasing of natural variability is it also true on shorter timescales in this model it seems to that trying to do an analysis based upon such physical understanding questions will clarify things far better than simply doing another set of statistical analysis im still particularly interested if 2 is really true in the raobs its not possible to do with satellites i suspect but if it is true it means we need to massively rethink fu et type analysis at least in the tropics and would be interested in helping someone follow up on that i think in the future the forster et paper may be seen as the more scientifically significant result when douglass et is longer cared about
