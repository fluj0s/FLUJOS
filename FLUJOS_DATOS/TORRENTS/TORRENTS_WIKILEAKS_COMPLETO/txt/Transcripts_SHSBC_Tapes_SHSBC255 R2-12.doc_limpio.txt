r212 lecture given on 10 january 1963 all right this is what the 10th of january audience yes ad 13 saint hill special briefing course lecture one little bulletin hereaussies hang your head in shame all through the commonwealth with the greatest of ease i was able to slow down this government raid on the church in washington but not in australia you see the lines go straight from australia to the united states and back and forth and the whole rigged government release in washington landed scram bang into the press in australia so australia is seething mess of god elp us now and somebody from the australian syndicate is coming down to see tomorrow and they want to know all about it im not going to tell them very much beyond fascist government raided church ill tell them be very very careful though because apparently theres million dollars in the offing to fight this in the united states they actually got all kinds of leads and money pouring in like mad from all directions and the situation looks very dark for the united states you should really understand this little bit you see theyve done everything they could do theyve shot all the women and children you see and kicked the dogthere isnt any more they can do theyve shot their bolt and having lied to federal judge and done few other things like this all they can do now is stand and take it and man wewere loading up the guns you shouldnt expect the situation to deteriorate anyplace actually well handle this in australia with the greatest of ease but isnt it interesting that australia takes orders from the us to that degree only commonwealth country that has published line interesting well regardless of all that lets get down to something importantsomething important such as why your pc arc breaks you knucklehead ah this is very interesting all this cost us today was the bulletin i was going to write on the subject thats the second one that has cost us but theres some very very important data here some extremely important data 212 210 the routine 2 has liability and this is very very very important liability its one that you must not lose sight of otherwise youre going to lose pcs like mad and scientologys going to lose people like mad instead of gaining them im not joking now somebody can be put off but good if you miss an item now what is missed withhold its nearlyfoundout isnt it all right now you just apply anything you ever heard of to missed withholdsto this other activity and boy missed withhold of the size of missed itemwhen it turns up and comes to view and isnt picked up by the auditor is really grim and i do mean grim because not all the pulling missed withholds in the world are going to straighten it up youve got to get that missed withholdwhich is the missed item now you think i mean one that isnt opposed i mean one that isnt put on the list you stopped listing too soon and this is under the whole subject of incomplete lists now fortunatelyfortunately you can bypass items and incomplete list and maybe 60 percent of the time 70 percent something like that get away with it this is on one pc not 70 percent of the pcs you see most of the time you get away with it id say even higher than that85 percent 90 percent you get away with it and the time you dont makes up for the whole lot you can go ahead and do sloppy job of routine 2 and incomplete lists and oppose them and have ball endlessly list and so forth nothing catastrophic occurs and then on one particular listthere is telling which list this might be you didnt need to finish all the lists and you could abandon some of them and so forthbut on this one list that youre doing you grab the item before its been put on the list after that your pcs unauditable your pc becomes unauditable right there right now and you as an auditor get your head knocked off and say im tired of auditing and the pc natters and screams around and says hes tired of being audited and that ends the whole thing if you dont know what it is so this becomes the most important single piece of routine 2 how to patch that one up is very important yeah you can be reasonable and you can say yes ive made goof yes ive goofed yeah i goofed so therefore of course hes arc broke or hes got missed withholds maybe he was one time or another member of the us government see some other scurrilous action maybe has taken place on the part of the pc and you say if i just sit there and pull missed withholds well ill be all right because obviously its missed withhold hes been sort of dopey in sessions and hes been this and hes been that now all right is there anything i nearly found out about you and the funny part of it is the pc doesnt know what it is he doesnt know why he will give you missed withholds and if you go on with pulling missed withholds to cure this arc break then you will drive him around the bend then you compound the felony why because the missed withhold is the item he didnt put on the list now give any ten lists see on the same pcwere not now talking about an odd pc that behaves this way were talking about every pc you will ever auditand you have ten lists and like complete chump you didnt complete any of the tenany of these nine lists they werent completed they werent the right item your opposes were all wrong everythingnothing ghastly happens but undeterminedly and just for some reason because of the peculiarities of that list thisone of those lists out of that ten you dont complete that one and thats heading right for the center of the bank and you dont complete the list you get to an item odd bod and it must be it because only five items before that rsed and you say thats your item odd bod big mass immediately appears in front of him and he says well i ii yeah i guess i can see how this is iit adds up yes iti guess thats right it adds up i guess it packages up all right ehehwhat are you wiggling your pencil for all the time you sit there wiggling your pencil ive been trying totrying to tell you for some time the motion bothers uhyeah well you say were going to have another session tomorrow im actually going to be pretty busy uhwell all right ill come in for the session and you know what he does the only place you can really detect thisi dont mean to be sarcastic like interjecting such comments as even you can detect this and so i wont put it in there but therell be fee now listen very carefully his session goals the very next session will not be as brisk and bright as his session goals have been in the past and as you continue to oppose this wrong item which youve found on this tenth listyoure now doing an opposition list to ithis goals will get worse and worse and worse and the way you patch this upthe way you patch this up is you look over session goals and you find what set of goals for session did this pc set that were less optimum than his previous goals and then if the auditor has been very clever and if hes heard rumor that you should write things on auditors reportslike what list you were listing whats the name of the list youre listing in other words other pertinent information or dated the lists if he did that dated the lists all of which hes supposed to doall you have to do is get the list he was listing on immediately before and complete that list you understand it is notnot eight days before you understand its the list that he completed in the session before he set the goals for the next session you understand or the list which was abandoned you got it and you watch those session goals and itll tell you every time now actually youll also see him looking darker blacker older looking like hell all these other manifestations go right along with it and hes very arc breaky and when he was given an item or not given the item from that point on why he is arc broke in other words the list was abandoned or it wasnt complete or he was given an item off the list but it was something wrong with that list and thats what causes that deterioration and that arc break now now listen to this very carefully that he arc breaks or is upset because you tell him to complete that list doesnt have anything to do with it because you go back very often and try to complete that list and he natters and screams and tears his hair and bites his fingernails and says to hell with it and bashes the cans but hell go on and complete the list and then all of sudden youll get his item on the list and there itll be wrongwayto list actually doesnt act this way it doesnt act this way on the pc the pcjust under strain and looking older and so forthbut he isnt arc break wrong source very oftenwrong source actually doesnt cause arcbreaks like this so this is peculiar manifestation having to do with completeness of lists and your indicated actionyour indicated action is to watch pc like mad when you abandon list and to watch pc like mad when you give him an item and watch for that arc break that may follow within the next few minutes or certainly at the beginning of the next session you understand because pcs are sometimes quite propitiative and they dont blow up in your face they just go out the bottom but you can see it reflected in goals thats the easiest place to see it reflectedright in goals now you get this as single indicated repair item now lets say somebody has been listed against one of these things setting sour goals for the last eighteen sessions well all right it was eighteen sessions ago eighteen sessions ago that was when it happened and if youve got his auditors reports nineteen sessions ago youll find brightyou know good goals you know work hard get in and pitch find this do that you know bangbang get better snap to get the tone arm down find my goal get clear see next session to see if i cant improve my case single goal set huhhuhhuhhuhhuhhuh well what was he working on at that time see what happened and youll find out in that last one that has the bright session goaljust before the bad one see the bright session goal oneeither list was abandoned or it wasnt completed before the item was given to him and it just all comes under the heading of you missed withhold theres missed item and thats all it amounts to the missed item right there bang you missed the itemmaybe you didnt notice at the end of that session or the rest of the session and so forth maybe this pc is so propitiative you didnt reallyreally notice or you werent on the ball that day or something and you didnt see this or you felt your auditing was bit off that day and youre prone to blame your auditing or something like this see you adjudicate well i better pull his missed withholds well the first thing you better pull when you pull missed withhold is to go find the item and pull the item that was missed and that is paramount in missed withholds this all comes under the heading of missed withholds and it all is incomplete list because naturally if he was given the wrong item on the list the list was probably incomplete of course you could grab the wrong item off listthe item on the thirteenth page was slamming like the devil but the auditor thought that some other item looked better and you know did something like that but that werewere looking at goofs there that are too magnitudinous to even be included in the perimeter of auditing you just understand thats just ylaah thats just auditing goofs were talking about 212 goofs see so something happened that had to do with an item being missing thats all you got to know because believe therell be many ways that items can be missedmany ways id hate to try to invent all the ways items will get missed between now and the year 2000 you see and theyll probably be multitudinous youre going to find some new and original ways yourself now you understand if the list was backwards that he was listing you wont get quite the same thing youll just get continuous strain and he wont necessarily arc break because you missed an item on the backwards list because thats all missed you see youre not going in the direction of it closely enough to cause it near miss so backwards listed thing wont give you the same manifestation it gives you another variety of strain on the case now you can always tell backwards listalways tell backwards list with the greatest of easebecause the rock slams get more frequent the frequency of slam increases as you keep listing there are more and more slams and theoretically if you went to hundred pages theyd all be slamming everything would be slamming you get the ne plus ultra ill give you an idea theres two slamming items on the first page theres three slamming items on the second page theres four on the third page theres five on the fourth page you see theres fifteen on the fifth page and then the whole rest of the list slams now thats an exaggeration of it but just count your rock slams as youre coming down the line those end rock slams if there are more than there were onper page than there were on just the preceding page you can figure out theres something wrong here thats backwards toothat list is backwards too because the bank is beefing up and the bank is beefing up indicated by these gratuitous rock slamstheres more and more rock slams of course youthe pc might be wearing two rings of certain magical constituency that gives you rock slam on everything did you know that some pcs with ring on each hand holding the cans will rock slam for phantom slam all the time its quite remarkable we had an audia pc here that was doing that few months ago but the crux of the situation is that slams are becoming more frequent as you list but on right way to list the slams are becoming less frequent as you list always less frequent so that youll see maybe three slams on the first page and then he could have four or five slams on the second page because hes just warming up you see but on theon the third page why hes got two slams and on the fourth page hes got one slam and now heres one for you that joins right inand why im talking about thisit joins right in to the missed withhold situation and this you can shudder in your boots about ill let you quietly shudder in your boots about this one the next rock slam on that list may be as much as six pages away from the last rock slam on the early pages you can list six pages in other words with relatively clean needle and then all of sudden get slam and thats the item and thats on particularly one of these hot lists but sometimes as an auditor youre going to be knocking your brains out or youre going to be supervising whole bunch of coaudits and youll see some of theseone of these coauditors knocking his brains out the pc is going yap yap yap yap yap yap yap yap howl howl howl and youre going to sit down to try to pull the missed withhold haha hahahahaha youre not going to repair with auditing whats been done wrong with routine 2 let tell you youll find out ordinarily that few minutes before the pcs been told he had an item and was apparently satisfied with it or the session before something was abandoned the list was abandoned as not being complete or something like that something of this sort has happened in there you look over the routine 2 and you raise hell with people who dont put the pcs name date and page number on the list sheets the pcs name the date and the list heading that theyre getting the list from sheet i have said not page each separate sheet of paper has got to be so marked otherwise you can never trace this back now when theyre doing auditor reports for gods sakes make them mark in what they are listing who or what would catfish oppose ww wd catfish op is the way its usually written doesnt take any time to write it down why leave everybody in mystery because that may someday become of the greatest importance three days later pc yow yow yow yap yap or just total apathy oh i dont know whats gonna happen or whats gonna happen to i always felt all right before scientology came along well you set it back and lets look at the day beforethe pc set bright goals then it happened yesterday pc set bright goals day before yesterday but not yesterday ah well then it was day before yesterday get the idea itll be in the session that the pc set the last bright goals for you got it it wont creep up it wont sneak up on you its not on gradient this thing is about as gradient as dropping all the crockery in the house two stories see it happens now and your cycle of action on the thing is you say well here we are weve got an upchuck thats right weve got this item an upchuck and does that sound like its the right item to you oh yes yes ive always been vitally interested in that well do you have any mass never have had any mass all right upchuck upchuck rses very nicely yes i suppose it does all right well thats that wellglad we found an item for you and so forth now did you make any part of your goals for this session oh yes i guess so and so forth is there anything youd care to ask or say before i end this session well yes has your meter been plugged in during the session you say what the hells happening here see i mean this would even be propitiative pc one who is less propitiative just takes your head off and throws it up against the wall but itll be something like this its just offbeat they really havent had time maybe to really get this going now the next session you start to oppose it the pc sets some sour goals like to get well i guess to get through the session somehow and youll say all right now were going to list who or what would oppose an upchuck that all right with you oh yes yes all right well who or what would oppose an upchuck oh bad auditor an emeter auditing room criminal criminal negligence do you have an arc break i feel fine and itll just go from there on man itll just keep going from worse to worser this pc will be violent about three sessions from then or just go into complete apathy huuuhhh and the goals will continue to deteriorate and thats all there back there on that list that you got upchuck off of now the funny part of it isthe funny part of it is youll occasionally say to pc all right this list here who or what has been agonizing in present time or whatever it is that we got the upchuck off of you see now were going to complete this list oh the hell you are i just dont see anything its complete you already gave the item didnt you i cant think of anything more well were going to get the rudiments in on this list and were going to continue it anyway but i just cant think of anything more quite ordinary youll get that kind of response they wont complete the list its incomplete theyre now getting even with you sort of thats the whole motive you talk to them little bit and persuade them they say for while there arent any more items there arent this something then all of sudden why they go brrrrrr bangbang justalmost in the middle of the time when theyre telling you they cant add to it see why they start adding to the list and they add to the list and add to the list and add to the list and add to the list and add to the list and add to the list and youre liable to go four five six seven eight pages without single rs on it and then all of sudden theres crashing big rs well null it down in case you missed an rs just by reading them pocketapocketapocketa hey we mayi really got one on you talk about nulling of listsfor week for list you know i clocked myself the other night on aon sixpage list and it took ten minutes i wasnt wasting any time marking ts and things down you understand i had it clean enough so i could just write page xed out before i turned it see and you dont have to wait any time to see if an rs is going to develop if it isnt an instant rs it only takes you something on the order of about tenth of second of lingering glance still on the meter to see nothing is happening and what do you mean you take your eye that far from meter just to read the next line you see you can really null these things down if you get in the groove bow bow bow bow almost that fast see so you dont care how much you null and its just on the off chance you might have missed one or something was up something like that sometimes one that you cant really tell which one rsed or something like thatthere was just big rs going on during the time anyway you get down here to the end and bow you see there it is and its tigerbat wasnt an upchuck at all you know there it is tigerbat all this time the pc has been very cheerful where was the arc break wheres the hopelessness all the time you were listing all the time youre nulling and you get down and you say well weve got tigerbat here tigerbat tigerbat yes it rses very nicelyand the pc says couldve told you that all the time actually hes been swearing you see all the time that the thing was baseball but actuallyyeah he could have told you its tigerbat and hes all perfectly happy and you oppose the thing and hes happy and what happened to all this goingtocommitsuicidetomorrowmorning and all that kind of stuff that all just evaporated now heres another test you can make sometime and thats quite interesting i dont say to do this intentionally but sometime when you find you have done it mark this very carefully you say to the pc well got your item here its an upchuck and the pc does that sound like its real to you and so forth you think thats it oh yes yeah that sounds quite real and then the pc starts to kind of scrape at you little bit one way or the other and just watch the pc do tone curve just watch that curve go down if you knew damn well it wasnt the item and you did that youd see that curve down im not telling you to do it intentionally but sometime or another youll do it accidentally and you might as well sit there and watch thewatch the thing curve and then do this well did mass show up and the pc says yes some mass showed up and so forth and you say fine now you say well im sorry but i dont believe that was your item see you watched the curve he didnt know you watched him start to arc break and some mass showed up what more do you want see and you say well i didnt think thats your item were going to have to continue the list and watch the pc bright upbrighten up right now bang oh well are you yes oh is that so all right okay matter of fact i got couple right now its very funny the pc apparently has bought it you see to some degreeno cognition or anything sometimes hell even cognite little bit you know because it is lock on the real item and you kind of watch him go down and if youif you just held off giving him the good news about the fact that you were going on anywhere up there to thirty seconds you can start to watch that arc break you can start to watch that thing if you let it go the pc will be tearing up the auditing room see thats missed withhold of an item thats an item that is missed and thats all that it takes that is all that it takes thats interesting isnt it well this has much more farreaching potentials than you would think there are few pcs aroundthey are very very rare up at hasi london we know of four or five of them i think in all the years of operation up therewho just are arc breaky as hell and have been for two or three years they come back and get audited but its absolutely gruesome you know some of their names its gruesome man every time they get audited i get letters too its horrible you know what ill bets wrong with themevery single one of themill bet you somebody left an unflat repetitive process years ago perhaps that interesting they didnt put the answer on the list you understand there wasnt even list they didnt put the answer on the list list they never enunciated it somebody didnt flatten the process somebody was runningsomebody was running something on the order of what would knock down bodybuilder you know way back well theyve assessed something like bodybuilder or something all right what would knock down bodybuilder thank you what would bodybuilder knock down thank you what would knock down bodybuilder thank you what would bodybuilder knock down and then the auditor for some reason or other was changed or got tired or got bored or something of this sort or something new came out on telex the next day and nobody flattened that process and that pc hasnt been auditable since now that rarelybut i think those cases do exist here and there that isnt every case by one awful long ways but there are some of those cases around now problemsintensivetype approach would handle that very well just search it out to find out when they were happy about auditing and pinpoint it down help with the meter see you wouldnt even need the guys auditor reports only they very often are available and pinpoint it on the meter when was that help the guy out run little bit of suppress you know on auditing or something and keep finagling around trying to get this period you can fish the command with some care and running suppress and so forth and careful of something like thatjust the suppressor buttonsyou all of sudden the pc comes up with what process it was now you theoretically could prepcheck it out and i say theoretically because in actual fact i havent seen one of these missed item arc breaks mended by auditing alone why not let him complete the process see you understand now that doesnt mean this answers burning question for some of you guys would it be best to go back and complete every process that had been left unflat on the pc well this gives youthis gives you an index and very very neat nice index it is only those processes that left the pc in complete state of bedraggled arc break with the auditor or the organization should be picked up because theyve got missing item on it theres some item answer that the pc didnt give something happened it was probably some very significant session to the pc like from where could you communicate to foot and he just didnt put the answer that was the completed list you understand theres missing answer there he never flattened it and theres possibly maybe more than one of these on any scientologists case line i mean you as pc sometime in the past audited over the years have undoubtedly had nonflattened process on you but not in all cases would this necessarily have admitted missed withhold but you get somebody who is pretty upset about auditing and rather arc breaky well find time when they were not arc breaky about auditing flatten that process and theyd smooth right out actually it should turn up on opposing auditing or something like that if auditing rock slammed but im giving youand im giving you something here now this is not necessarily something that would be done on case you understand unless this case had long history thereas i say i think there are either five or six through the hgc of hasi london over all these years but those five or six actually ought to be looked over on this basis of the missing answer on the question sequence they should be looked over from that basis rather than try to do new list on them see itd be freak that repetitive process of some kind or another actually left an unanswered question that was severe enough to cause them to severely arc break about auditing from there on but that can exist and ifs something that you should be aware of just as pro you just should be aware of it as condition that can exist now as far as routine 2 is concerned this can happen on every case you audit its not selective case condition you can do this to every case you audit you get some kind of manifestation like this case is improving and improving and in beautiful shape and youve got two packages now and then you go for the third package and youre getting the first item of the third package and ifs just all running wonderfully and the pc comes in and sayssets some goals like this to get through it to see if i cant get well after all you say what the hells happened here well what happened here is that third list that you were doing that you were working on just the day before whatever it was that thing wassomething wrong something wrong but it all added up to missed item whatevers wrong with it it had to add up to missed item thats the common denominator of all these mistakes now all you have to do to square this up is not necessarily to go back and get the earliest list that ever got earlied on the case or get the earliest complete that ever got uncompleted and go back to china patch this upno its yesterday and you just watch those goals the big indicator is goals and catch that one right there the onethe one they set good goal for that session and then bad goal for the next session what was done in that goodgoal session right there achieved missing item whatever it was it achieved missing item now theres another source for missing items is failure to oppose and the basic rule of failure to oppose is this here and there in organizations and field and so forth people were only getting the first item off list one you see getting it opposed and then leaving it and then everything crumpled up like scrap paper for the pc because they didnt oppose what they had now found you see actually theyd taken it from locked package the rule is simply this that anything that keeps on rsing after you try to package it has to be opposed now that could give you four oppositions it could give you only two real routine 2 that is perfectly done perfect source perfect everythingthe real thingactually blows up into whoosh and you cant find any trace of anything but one thats bit done offthe source wasnt quite right something like this theyou took the source off of an arbitrary list let us say something like that and what you wind up with is something that has still got dr on it and the other side of it is still slamming why id look it over awfully carefully to make sure that we didnt have incomplete lists is what resulted in all this but for sure youre going to have to do something about that slamming item unless the slamming item came from rock slamming item by represent if youyou know you never represent rock slamming item and you can actually get pc in the soup this is delicate this is delicate you can get pc in the soup by taking rock slamming item represent list and getting rock slamming item and then opposing it if it is real reliable item itll be the only one that occurred on the list and itll be an oppositiontype thing or it was on there but it would constitute missed dumbbell half of the dumbbell is missing ill give you an example under old 3gthis is wrongold 3ga criss cross we get an item groups and it slams like mad and the auditor did represent list on it so he could have something to find goals with and he got rotarians and rotarians slammed like crazy and that was seven six months ago or five months ago or something like that and it is still slamming like crazy well you just let it go on slamming itd be very wrong to oppose that because its in an incomplete list actually the only action you can take is to oppose groups you see theres that great big constantlyslamming item staring you in the face and you say boy we better do something about it ah but if groups was slammingif groups is slammingah well thats different proposition because you can pull something proper with groups so you have to look at an items source the source of an item has everything to do with an item and you take an item that comes from wrong sourceyes itll go on slamming for quite while till somebody straightens the source out but an item from right source if it continues to slam its off completed list everything is fine you examine those little elementary things is it from the right source is it right way to was the list complete was it the last and only rs on the list yes yes and the thing is still slamming oppose it man and if you dont youll get another arc break situation oddly enough you can abandon this crashing slam on rotarians and the pc is relieved if anything pc says oh yes im very interested in that im very very interested in rotarians yeah oh yes id really like to know what opposes rotarians the first time you try to oppose rotarians the pc will arc break bit because theres something wrong there you see its not really an item its just held there because it was taken between two other items its actually some kind of lock item on an improperly opposed item groupgroups see then when you get groups and get that all straightened out and that list is totally complete youll find out rotarians will probably mysteriously vanish and wont rock slam anymore you see how that would be now r212 is something that is very easily done right from scratch if its right from scratch and it goes along right all the way see man youve got winner like mad the only thing thats going to cause you trouble is where you did something wrong as you were carrying it along and now youve got pacea casepatchup situation or its somebody elses case that has been run wrong and youve got to put it back together again and those are the difficulties you run into now thats why ive been trying to find indicators indicators indicators by the ton been trying to find all the ways you can tell if its running right see and ive been picking up new ones every time i turned around there are lots of indicators now and theyre more clearcut as indicators now another thing thatabout this is there is doubt about this that it can do some really marvelous things there is doubt about it it can do some marvelous things but it has enough boot to it that if you run it off the rails itll wrap somebody around telephone pole its something like driving racing car you know he can really get there in that racing car you know but it isntit isnt well as matter of fact the only thing thatll get you there is racing car dont you see but by god those curves you know every time it comes to an unbanked curve why it leaves several dollars worth of rubber on the concrete and you can very easily wrap it around telephone polevery easily now this makes an auditor have to have two skills not just the skill of driving racing car but the skill of putting one back together again after hes wrapped it around telephone pole so youre not only an auditing pro you see youre also case artisan and at time has artisanship on cases repair ever been as important as it has right now if youre going to take these cases and get them out of the woods and square them up and head them on the right road if youre going to do that be fully prepared that all of sudden you hit this unbanked curve pc has just been going marvelous the pc isnow looks fifteenlooked seventyfive beforepc looks fifteen pc is doing beautifully rave notices to the family everything is going along fine you see and my god there you hit one of these unbanked curves you know pc comes into the next session and saysyou say all right what goals would you like to set for this session and the pc says to get through it all right any others well for heavens sakes be alive dont try to repair this from last july see the time is readable on your wristwatch it was just two clock winds ago that that unbanked curve connected with the wheels now you sometimes will tend to say well it must be my auditing because afterive been little bit crude lately and the pcs been fighting the mid ruds and theres probably some various things here which iso on so on so ill be reasonable about the whole thing and ill try to pull the missed withholds which are causing this pc to arc and now you want to really see an arc break because the pc sort of conceives youre asking for the item and boy it just keeps restimulating and restimulating and restimulating only of course hes got way to give you the item youre not listing so every time you ask him causes another missed withhold on top of the thing you know he gets very upset the only way to patch up routine 2 is to patch it up with routine 2 thats the way you patch it up and you just go back there and you say well thats sour set of goals now instead of trying to tie the pc even more thoroughly around the telephone pole you take look at the pc and you say all right now lets see we said we werent going to continue listing that list last session but ive changed my mind about this haha and were going to continue listing that were not going to abandon that one were going to continue that one and the pc is liable to say aw are you really or something and then all of sudden brighten up its very often the pc will tell you they cant very often theyll tell you what are you doing trying to invalidate this beautiful item an upchuck i mean it explains my whole life except i havent been explaining it and you say well were just going to continue that list sometimes youll be horrified to find out how many pages you can go without single rs on it before all of sudden the vital item goes blang blang thats about the only discouraging thing about all this i know but youjust be sure its there just be sure you get that item on the list you understand thats the criterion be sure you get it on the list now knowing 212 and knowing other things about it and being able to run it in the first place thats the only one you can go headfirst into the snowdrift on see now any auditor can make this mistake and can happen to any pc so this is very very interesting as datum isnt it and you can do it and youll pull the pc right out of it and so forth if you know exactly what it is and if you dont know what it is and you try to take some heroic or auditing measure to correct the thing and boy youre going to be in awful shape trying to figure out this see but i finally studied this down to its commonsimplest common denominator its just right there in the session goals is where youll find it and you can trace it back and i dont care how ridiculous it seemed as an action dont let anything like that get in your road you understand you say but my god the thing is actually what we were listing in that session was just brandnew consistofpresenttime list how thethe pc was going around the bend trying to add items to it and there hadnt been rock slam on it for you know at all there were apparently rock slams on it at all and couldnt be vital to the pc and must be something else sir what ive just told you takes precedence over all the something elses its right there thats it its that one where the pc shifted and itll be big shift now if you know that one if you study up that way if you keep good auditors reports and you make very sure they are kept you make darn sure that you keep an eye on these session goals as you go along and do straight routine 2keep it as straight as you possibly can its by the way been getting straighter ive been working with you and watching what youve been doing and so forth and working also myself to make it easier to recognize what it is removing all possible things that might be going astray grooving downits getting there but thatthis error ive been telling you about in this lecture is something that you can make you can you can have this happen to you it can happen to it can happen to anybody you understand for some reason or other we missed the item now heres one that you must remember on missed items if there were two rock slams on the list it might be when you went over it one didnt slam pc might have been distracted or something so therefore you say theres one item on the list and because its the last item on the list that slammed youand because it came after page or something like that of slams you say oh well thats obviously it you pick it upno sir never unload an item on the pc without great careand this is my last message on this basis when you tell the pc that it is his item go ahead and tell him so with hope and enthusiasm and anything else we dont care how you tell him as long as you dont do anything else immediately afterwards you want to be real chump or real knucklehead and practically spin the pc in do something else at once say well your item is an upchuck now were going to test for the next one consider committing overts against an upchuck consider an upchuck committing overts agai whats the matter with you hell be halfway around the bend if its the wrong item because youve given him distraction of attention hes already trying to grip this situation hes already trying to cope with more mass than he had before youve hit right into the center of his bankyou might as well have hit him with sixteeninch shell dont you seeand then distracted his attention ill give you another method of doing it well ive got an rsing item here uha tigerbat and uhhere it is and so forth and now well go on finishing erthe list uha waterbuckbat catfishbat klughflat klu whats the matter with you even if it was the right item man hes going to be having time see you gave him the item and then you shifted his attention and you just mustnt do that that you said tigerbat rsed has practically presented him with the item dont you see or sometimes youre writing out here with your pencil in very clear view and he sees you mark the rs down late on the list and he says haha thats it its tigerbat and you go right on to the next one and you just pull him through the hawsepipe see brrrrr you understand youve shifted his attention badly thats why i say that the meter in line with the pcthe list in line with the meter face in line with the pc and all obscured on what that pencil is doing is actually your best action ive been adopting rather slippy one of making strike noiseless strike after an rsing item which before when i close the page i go back and write rs on it theres so few rses you see when nulling anyhow use red pencil you know and make strike on it just single strike and mark nothing else im trying to get this down to speed im not advising you to do that its just method that im testing out i find it works very wellas long as you dont miss marking the strike and marking in afterwards rs thats the crime well what im saying here is dont give the pc something and then distract his attention because itll aggravate the arc break if its the wrong item itll really aggravate the arc break itll tie him up in knots you say tigerbat and all of sudden he has new hat on his head hed never heard of before you see and its out this big and kind of furry ears up here and he can feel wings out in back of them and where the helld all this come from you see and you say well have you made any part of your goals for this session he says waggllaglugh you could say squeeze the cans or something he just wont know what the hell to do see you give him hell of discombobulation now that will catalyze the arc break if its the wrong one hell go right into that arc break you can throw him completely into apathy you put him in screaming fit right now if you pull that trick see what you want to do is make darn sure from where you sit that its the right item then you check it and you tell the pc thats the item thats your item when you say thats your item or your item is tigerbat dont you look back at the meter dont you look at your auditors report dont you look at another damn thingyou keep your eye right on the pc why you want to see what effect this thing had because you just whats the matter with you you fire sixteeninch shell into somebodys midriff and you dont want to see the explosion all right so youve got guilty consciences from other things youre doing in the past you give the pc the itemyou give the pc the item you keep your eye right on the pc because actually if the item is wrong you can see his face go dark you can see him age right in front of your eyes and you can see the arc break and the uncertainty even though its very tiny youll see all of that and then ask him do you now have markedly more mass than you had before or do you havedo youare you sensible oflot more than you were moment ago yeah he says theres this big thing out in front of my face i never realized it was there before well does that seem like your item does it make sense to you is that real to you oh oh yes yes yeah that is lthwas your emeter plugged in during this session lth well youve got all the signs there man for wrong item you see as second by second the time he has that thing as an item is increased his tone curve will be going down down down you can watch it descend by the second i mean its thatits that rapid and you just see this is for the birds as far as youre concerned and then boy dont use the fact that it can be wrong item to invalidate right one this is touchy business see and you say well if its all right with you id like to list on this list bit longer because i dont think thats your item and you see the pc pick right up and get brighter or if its the right one hell tear your head offbut you can take that what the hell do you mean its my item whats the matter with you sometimes in desperation when they are so nervous and upset and so forth theyll sometimes protect false item for short time and you say well were going to list little bit longer just to make sure if it is all right with you what is the next item for this list who or what would derogate present time well you put it that way and hell give you some perfectly nice items right away do you understand this this is the art of presenting the item and the art of detecting whether or not list was left incomplete or an item more pertinentlyan item had been missed by an auditor in the immediate past history of the persons auditing if you can do that you can repair any case because by and large you can get lot of wrong sources and abandon them or finish them or list them or package them nothing happens to the pc but he improves but on this one list in ten on any pc if that one isnt completed cut my throat that ones really going to go to hell he comes back dragging inhahahahaha i think we have one person here who had wrong item on the 21st of december or an incomplete list or something and then went to the 7th of january to the next session sounds little roughsounds little rough told that the item was abandoned or that list was abandoned on the 21st of december and has evidently been sitting in this ever since then because as far as i can make out from the auditing reports thats apparently the day the last day cheerful audiset of goals was set by this pc so it must have been all right well theres atheres brandnewa brandnew look at this theres some better indexes theres way to really see this and so on and itll alsoits also good thing to keep your eye on the pc and do nothingand do nothing right after youve given him the item anyway so you might as well be observing the pc as doing that because otherwise if you shift his attention and its the wrong item youll practically cut him in half man you just presented him with bunch of gruesome mass that he hasnt had before and hes very doubtful and hes sort of lost and half spinny on this thing and its going down wrong way to and all that sort of thing now if you shift his attention in the middle of that hell have screaming arc break and you just wont know what the hell to do with him but there as far as im concerned is the basic dangerlet not minimize itthe basic danger in routine 2 thats the basic danger in routine 2 and right along with it there are the indicators to tell you if you run into it and there as well are the cures for having done this thing of missing the wrong item on the pc okay right thats it
