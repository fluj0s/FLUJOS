working families march 15 1999 thomas gabe bob lyke and karen spar specialists in social legislation domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress abstract to help working parents with child care expenses congress has authorized both federal grants and tax provisions grants are provided through consolidated child care and development fund ccdf and the tax provisions are the child and dependent care tax credit dctc and the dependent care assistance program dcap the latter allows families to exclude from their gross income employer assistance for child care this report describes these federal provisions including their histories and policy justifications and examines the subsidies that families might receive under the combination of the ccdf and dctc the more common tax benefit the report concludes by identifying potential issues for further analysis this report will not be updated for information on the current status of child care legislation see crs report rl30021 child care issues in the 106th congress regularly updated child care subsidies federal grants and tax benefits for working families summary most parents with minor children are employed and for many child care is significant but necessary expenditure for poor families it can consume onesixth of their income while for middle income families it can sharply reduce the returns from working some parents do not use child care arranging work schedules around the school day or leaving children home alone while others rely on unpaid care by relatives these arrangements sometimes reflect parental choice but other times they indicate that paid child care is not affordable congress has authorized both federal grants and tax benefits to help working families with child care expenses however these provisions were not explicitly designed to complement one another the principal grants are made to states from the child care and development fund ccdf program that helps provide child care assistance to welfare and lowincome working families through certificates vouchers or direct purchase the principal tax benefit is the child and dependent care tax credit dctc which allows working families to claim federal income tax credit for child care expenses in addition for families with participating employers the dependent care assistance program dcap allows working families to exclude from their gross income employer assistance for child care together these provisions represent federal budget commitment of more than 6 billion annually these child care subsidies are aimed at different populations with the grant program primarily intended for lowincome families and the tax provisions primarily benefitting middle and higher income families there are gaps in coverage within states for lower middle income families and instances in which slight differences in income can result in large differences in benefits moreover because ccdf eligibility and costsharing rules vary from state to state similar families may be treated very differently in one state versus another these patterns may suggest that the federal government lacks cohesive policy of child care subsidies for working families however the ccdf and tax provisions were developed independently of one another and have been justified on different grounds the grant program reflects public welfare arguments that welfare and low income families need child care assistance to enter the workforce and remain employed while the tax provisions reflect traditional tax principles regarding recognition of workrelated expenses though an objective of the ccdf is to make some form of care affordable to lowincome families to enable them to work neither it nor the tax provisions are intended to make child care affordable for all families recently the administration and members of congress have proposed legislation to expand both the ccdf and the dctc these proposals may offer an opportunity to consider the extent to which the subsidy gaps and inconsistencies should be eliminated congress might also wish to examine whether child care should be generally affordable and the relationship of subsidies to the supply and type of child care that families can actually obtain contents introduction 1 child care and development fund ccdf 4 current law 4 income

the authors would like to thank evelyne parizek of the congressional research service crs for her help in compiling state plan information under the child care development fund this report benefitted from the comments of vee burke gene falk melinda gish jane gravelle sharon house richard rimkunas tom ripy and allen talley of crs angela smith helped prepare the report child care subsidies federal grants and tax benefits for working families introduction child care is familiar issue to most american families because majority of parents with minor children including parents with preschool children are employed in 1997 both parents worked in 65 of married couple families with children under age 18 and in 58 of married couple families with children under 6 mothers worked in 69 of singlemother families with children under 18 and in 61 of those families with children under 61 for many of these parents child care is necessary expense of going to work it can be significant expenditure particularly for lower income families for example the latest available data show that in 1993 poor families who purchased child care devoted 18 of their family income to such care and non poor families devoted 72 not all working parents use or pay for child care some twoparent families arrange their work schedules so that at least one parent is home when the children need care some parents take their children to work while others work at home some families rely on relatives who typically are not paid or on older siblings in 1993 the most recent year for which data are available only 51 of child care arrangements for preschoolaged children with working mothers actually required cash payment3 although some families choose not to use or pay for child care others settle for unpaid arrangements with friends or relatives because more formal child care is not affordable sometimes leaving children in situations that are not desirable for example latchkey children may be left alone before or after school inability to afford child care may cause some parents to choose jobs primarily for convenience or because they can work parttime some decide not to work at all lack of affordable child care is frequently cited as an impediment for families receiving welfare to 1 current population survey bureau of labor statistics httpwwwblsgovnewsreleasefameet04htm 2 what does it cost to mind our preschoolers current population reports p7052 us census bureau september 1995 3 ibid crs2 become selfsufficient even for families with more income the cost of child care may sharply reduce the returns from working in recognition of these problems congress has authorized federal grants and tax benefits to help working families with child care expenses the principal grants authorized under the child care and development block grant and section 418 of the social security act go into the child care and development fund ccdf program that helps states provide child care assistance through certificate voucher and direct purchase programs the principal tax benefits are the child and dependent care tax credit dctc which allows working families to claim federal income tax credit for child care expenses and the dependent care assistance program dcap which allows working families to exclude from their gross income employer assistance for child care together the ccdf and the two tax benefits represent substantial federal budget commitment that currently exceeds 6 billion annually the federal government provides additional assistance for child care activities through the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant head start education and job training programs nutrition and child welfare programs military and employee benefit programs among others and there are other important tax provisions that generally benefit families with children4 but the ccdf and the two tax benefits comprise the core of direct federal child care assistance to working families they are the principal source of public subsidies explicitly designed to assist families with child care expenses the ccdf and the two tax benefits are aimed at different populations the former primarily assists poor and nearpoor families while the latter primarily benefit middle and higher income families with different target populations the ccdf and the two tax benefits generally do not overlap one another but the ccdf is administered by states among which eligibility criteria and benefit levels vary widely while the tax benefits are based on uniform standards that do not vary by place of residence as consequence some families lower middle income families generally potentially could fall in both target populations or in neither moreover individual families are not entitled to assistance under the ccdf so that families within the target population have guarantee of help with their child care expenses this report examines the subsidies that families might receive under the ccdf and the dctc the more common of the tax benefits and the subsequent outof pocket costs they might bear depending on their income and the state in which they live it looks to see if there are gaps in coverage for families in the same state and how differences in incomes might affect the level of benefits it looks at how similar families are treated in one state versus another it asks whether lower middle income families may find it difficult to afford the same types of child care that are subsidized for the poorest families under ccdf 4 for information about these other programs see crs report 98541 child care the role of the federal government by molly forman and karen spar crs3 most of the detailed analysis in this study focuses on one type of family single parent with one child in fulltime centerbased child care and it makes other assumptions that preclude its findings from being considered representative of all families with child care expenses moreover the study is not an economic analysis it does not attempt to estimate the actual effect of the subsidies on either the purchase of child care or the decision to go to work nonetheless the benefit patterns studied raise policy issues about the way in which the ccdf and the tax subsidies come together or fail to come together for families for whom child care may be pressing need among these issues are the following whether all working parents should receive some federal child care subsidy whether federal child care subsidies should be equitable for similar families both within and across states and whether federal child care subsidies should have goal of making child care affordable congress may explore some of these issues as it continues to consider proposals to expand either or both of the ccdf and dctc in his fy2000 budget package president clinton again proposed major child care initiative that would substantially expand these subsidies5 similar initiative was offered in 1998 however the administrations current proposal would also allow families with an athome spouse to benefit from the dctc this report is divided into four sections the first two describe the ccdf and the two tax provisions the dctc and dcap summarize their legislative histories and discuss their policy justification these sections show that the grant and tax policies developed largely apart from one another and serve different purposes included in the ccdf section is detailed analysis of ccdf eligibility payment rates and benefit levels for each state the third section shows the effect of state rules on hypothetical family to determine how its share of child care costs might vary under both the ccdf and dctc at different income levels and in different states short conclusion ties the discussion together and explores potential issues this report will not be updated for current status of legislation see crs report rl30021 child care issues in the 106th congress by karen spar regularly updated 5 other components of the administrations child care initiative include new early learning grant program to states business tax credit for employersponsored child care funding for activities to upgrade child care quality and increased spending for head start and after school activities crs4 child care and development fund ccdf current law the child care and development fund ccdf is single unified program administered by the states and overseen at the federal level by the department of health and services hhs the program receives funding from two sources the child care and development block grant ccdbg act and section 418 of the social security act the ccdbg act authorizes discretionary funding for block grants to states to help subsidize the child care expenses of lowincome families these funds are provided annually through the appropriations process in addition section 418 of the social security act preappropriated 6 years worth of entitlement funding for child care in 1996 as component of welfare reform at the state level funds provided under section 418 of the social security act are transferred to the lead agency that administers the ccdbg and are spent in accordance with ccdbg rules in fy1999 total of 32 billion is available for the ccdf of which 22 billion was appropriated directly by section 418 of the social security act and 1 billion was appropriated under the authority of the ccdbg act6 slightly more than half of such funds appropriated under the social security act are allocated among states on the basis of historical state expenditures for previous welfarerelated child care programs and the balance of these funds are allocated according to each states population of children under 13 funds appropriated under the ccdbg act are allocated among states generally according to each states population of lowincome children and children under 5 states may use their ccdf funds to subsidize child care in one of two ways all states must operate certificate programs in which eligible families are offered certificates or vouchers to purchase child care from provider of the familys choice including forprofit and nonprofit child care centers including sectarian providers family child care homes and relatives in addition states may arrange directly with child care providers to purchase slots on behalf of eligible families families are then referred to these providers in either case the state must establish payment rates for child care that are meant to approximate the actual cost of care available in the community these payment rates are the amounts that participating child care providers will receive to serve eligible children states must establish payment rates at levels that are sufficient to ensure that families receiving subsidies will have equal access to comparable child care services available to families who are not eligible for assistance the states also must establish sliding fee scale so that parents contribute to the cost of their child care on the basis of their income the difference between the payment rate established by the state and the fee paid by the family represents the net child care subsidy provided under the ccdf program providers may choose not to accept children at the stateestablished payment rate although parents also have the option 6 the discretionary portion of the ccdf is forwardfunded so that 1 billion was appropriated in fy1998 for expenditure in fy1999 in fy1999 12 billion has been appropriated for expenditure in fy2000 crs5 of supplementing the payment rate if necessary to enroll their children with particular provider federal law establishes eligibility parameters for determining which children and families may receive ccdf subsidies however ccdffunded child care is not an entitlement to individuals and states are free to establish their own eligibility criteria within these parameters federal law generally limits eligibility to children under age 13 although regulations allow states to assist children up to age 19 who have special needs or are in protective care including foster care federal law also provides that parents must be working or attending job training or educational program in order to qualify for the program in addition federal law limits child care assistance under ccdf to families whose income does not exceed 85 of the state median income for family of the same size states receiving block grant funds must establish child care licensing standards although federal law does not dictate what these standards should be or what categories of providers should be covered by them in addition states must have health and safety requirements that apply to all providers receiving ccdf subsidies these requirements must address prevention and control of infectious diseases building and physical premises safety and caregiver training again however federal law does not dictate the specific contents of these health and safety requirements all providers receiving ccdf funds must comply with any standards or regulations that apply to them under state or local law income limits and priorities as mentioned federal law limits child care assistance under ccdf to families whose income does not exceed 85 of the state median income smi for family of the same size subject to this overall limit states may set their own restrictions referred to in this report as their basic income limits states are not required to aid all eligible applicant families thus those whose income qualifies them for child care subsidy are not guaranteed to receive one state basic income limits vary considerably figures 1 and 2 on pages 7 and 8 show the current limits for two types of families single parent with one child and married couple with one child the limits are derived from state ccdf plans and plan amendments on file at hhs on august 14 1998 the state basic income limits are represented by the horizontal bars that extend to the right of each state name as can be seen in figure 1 the basic income limit for single parent with one child is lowest in west virginia the state listed first and highest in massachusetts fourth from the bottom the figures also show the overall federal limit 85 of smi represented by the heavy line sloping downward at the far right the figures list states in order according to their overall limits figure 1 shows that 10 states set their basic income limit for single parent with one child equal to their overall limit reading from the top mississippi new mexico oklahoma etc figure 2 shows that nine states do so for married couple with one child mississippi oklahoma etc but most states set income eligibility for ccdf below the level allowed by federal law the state basic income limits in the figures reflect the income level up to which applicant families can be eligible for ccdf subsidies some states allow recipient crs6 families to rise above this limit and remain eligible for the program in case may family be eligible if its income exceeds the states overall limit7 federal law requires states to give priority for ccdf subsidies to very low income families the level for the very low income limit is left to the states to determine in the two figures the very low income limits chosen by the states are represented by the darkly shaded portion of the horizontal bars in figure 1 it can be seen that north dakota and delaware have the lowest limits for single parent with one child while north carolina and massachusetts have the highest both figures show that 18 states among them mississippi and florida set the very low income limit at or very near the federal poverty line8 indicated by the vertical line on the left while 11 states among them west virginia and montana set their very low income eligibility limits well below the federal poverty line all states set their basic income limits above the poverty line while not illustrated in the figures states must also spend at least 70 of their mandatory child care funds funds provided under section 418 of the social security act on three groups of families families receiving temporary assistance for needy families tanf families attempting to transition off of tanf through work activities and families atrisk of welfare dependency federal law does not define atrisk families conceivably they could have income up to the states basic income limit if the state chose federal regulations also allow states to establish additional priorities for service figures 1 and 2 include two additional vertical reference lines both refer to the dependent care tax credit dctc which is discussed in detail later in this report one line the middle of the three vertical lines marks the income threshold above which family with qualified child care expenses could effectively begin to receive tax savings from the dctc while the other the vertical line to the right marks the income level at which the family could effectively receive the maximum tax savings from it9 figure 1 shows that the very low income limit for single parent with one child reaches the dctc lower income threshold in 10 states among them oklahoma and texas figure 2 also shows that the very low income limit for married couple with one child reaches the dctc lower income threshold in 10 states among them texas and north carolina in the remaining states some families with incomes above the very low income limit would not be given priority for ccdf nor would 7 for example kentucky sets initial income eligibility for ccdf at or below 133 of poverty once families receive assistance their incomes can rise to 150 of poverty before losing eligibility in addition working parents in kentucky who had their tanf grant discontinued within the last 12 months may receive assistance during the 12month period as long as their income does not exceed the overall limit after 12 months they remain eligible as long as their income does not exceed 150 of poverty 8 the poverty line is based upon us bureau of the census poverty income thresholds in 1998 the poverty thresholds were 11235 for single parent with one child and 13120 for married couple with one child 9 effective dctc benefits are the additional tax savings that families with qualified child care expenses can obtain in addition to tax savings from the child credit see appendix for further discussion of the assumptions used to calculate families tax liabilities crs7 they be eligible for dctc savings these families have incomes that are too high for federal child care grant subsidies but too low for federal child care tax subsidies it should be remembered that families whose incomes make them eligible for child care grants

service crs based on states ccdf plans on file with hhs as of august 14 1998 very low income limit and basic income eligiblity limit are the same very low income limit not shown very low income limit varies within state crs9 payment rates as stated earlier federal law requires states to establish payment rates that will be paid to participating providers which approximate the actual cost of child care in the community final hhs regulations stipulate that payment rates are to be based on local market surveys conducted every 2 years to reflect current market conditions10 payment rates vary according to the childs age eg infant toddler preschooler the length of time that care is provided during the day eg fullday halfday hourly the type of child care setting eg centerbased care home other than the childs and whether care is provided for second or additional child payment rates typically vary among areas within state hhs regulations suggest that states set child care payment rates at the 75th percentile based on the market survey the 75th percentile marks the payment level at which 75 of child care providers charge less it is assumed that this payment rate will give participating families access to reasonable range of child care providers in the community however states are not required to use the 75th percentile as the minimum payment standard rather it is intended to serve as benchmark to assess whether families eligible for ccdf subsidies have the same access to care as families that are not eligible as required under the federal law based on state plans and plan amendments on file at hhs on august 14 1998 30 states indicated that they use the 75 th percentile as the basis for establishing their ccdf payment rate most of the remaining states all but three did not indicate in their state plans how they established their payment rates although the ccdf regulations require states to update their payment rates every 2 years some states had not yet done so for example two states arizona and missouri had not updated their child care payment rates since 1990 according to plans on file with hhs in august 1998 as an example figure 3 on the following page shows state annual payment rates for 3year old child in centerbased care on fulltime basis because payment rates may differ across areas in state the rates for the most populated area of each state were selected the figure shows that this particular payment rate ranges from high of 10500 per year in alaska anchorage to 2868 in west virginia the statewide rate the median for this rate is 4432 or what the rate is in arizona this means that half of the states pay child care providers less than 4432 per year for 3year old in fulltime centerbased care and half pay more payment rates tend to be higher for infants than those shown in the figure and less for children in settings other than centerbased care eg family day care although figure 3 shows the rate which state and local agencies will pay providers for specific type of child care the extent to which child care is actually available at that rate is not known 10 the payment rate data shown in this report reflect state plans on file with hhs as of august 14 1998 the first set of plans was to be submitted to hhs by july 1997 covering the 2 year period beginning on september 30 1997 therefore many states submitted their ccdf plans before the final rules took effect on august 24 1998 for full discussion of state child care plans under ccdf see crs report 98875 child care state programs under the child care and development fund by evelyne parizek gene falk and karen spar crs10 sliding fee schedules in addition to setting income eligibility limits and payment rates states must establish sliding fee schedules which determine the share of child care costs ie the share of the payment rate that eligible families are expected to pay out of their own pocket the difference between the payment rate and this fee reflects the net government child care subsidy to the family as explained earlier providers may refuse to accept child at the stateestablished payment rate and the parents may supplement the amount paid to the provider by paying more than the sliding fee schedule would require figure 3 child care payment rates to providers under the child care development fund annual payment for 3year old

that states set their sliding fee scales for child care so that low income family would not be required to pay more than 10 of its income for child care11 however this is not mandatory additionally hhs encourages states to structure their fee scales so that small wage increase does not trigger large increase in copayments states establish their sliding fee schedules in different ways in some states the schedules reflect the percentage of child care costs that participating families with different income levels are expected to assume in other states the schedules reflect the percentage of income that families with different income levels are expected to pay elsewhere sliding fee scales simply reflect copayment amount that families with child in particular type of care are required to pay some states require families to make minimal payment for child care regardless of their income while other states dont require families to pay for child care until their income exceeds specified level all states sliding fee schedules are progressive with higher income families paying more for child care than lower income families however they are based on variety of different philosophies regarding the appropriate way in which government should help lowincome families pay for their child care and the way in which parents should eventually assume full responsibility for these costs as their incomes increase legislative history the ccdbg act was enacted as component of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 pl 101508 and authorized through fy1995 the laws passage culminated 4 years of debate over what role if any the federal government should play in addressing the adequacy affordability and quality of the nations child care supply congress had hotly debated these issues periodically during the 1960s and 1970s although consensus was reached and comprehensive child care grant program existed prior to the 1990 law12 the ccdbg authorized child care subsidies for lowincome working families which could include families receiving welfare at the states option in addition the 1990 law created another grant program for states to provide child care assistance specifically for very lowincome families who were at risk of becoming dependent on cash welfare in the absence of subsidized child care this program was known as atrisk child care and was authorized under title iva of the social security act at that time title iva also authorized aid to families with dependent children afdc the federal governments primary cash welfare program for poor families with children afdc recipients and former afdc recipients for up to 12 months 11 child care and development fund final rule federal register v 633 142 july 24 1998 p 39960 12 the federal government supported child care programs during the depression and during world war ii first as jobcreation efforts to alleviate unemployment and then to care for the children of women who entered the work force while their husbands went to war however these programs ended after world war ii in 1971 congress passed comprehensive child care program as part of the economic opportunity amendments which were vetoed by president nixon primarily because of the child care provisions crs12 after leaving the program were entitled to child care assistance under provisions enacted in 1988 pl 100485 these programs were referred to as afdc child care and transitional child care for former afdc recipients in 1996 congress passed welfare reform legislation that amended and reauthorized the ccdbg through fy2002 and repealed the legislative authority for the three afdcrelated child care programs then existing under title iva of the social security act ie atrisk child care afdc child care and transitional child care this action ended the individual entitlement to child care assistance for current and former welfare recipients the 1996 legislation the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act pl 104193 repealed and replaced the entire afdc program with block grant to states called temporary assistance for needy families tanf the statutory location for tanf is title iv of the social security act the 1996 welfare reform law also preappropriated 6 years worth of child care funding intended to replace the amounts that had previously been available to states under the three afdcrelated child care programs as stated earlier these child care funds which are authorized by section 418 of the social security act are transferred at the state level to the lead agency that administers the ccdbg and spent in accordance with ccdbg rules thus while the 1996 welfare reform law established two funding streams for child care assistance for lowincome and welfare families the law also provided that single set of federal rules would apply to these consolidated funds13 justifications for current law the ccdbg legislation enacted in 1990 reflected series of compromises between those who wanted strong federal role in determining the adequacy affordability and quality of child care and those who advocated local flexibility and parental choice the consolidated ccdf as created in 1996 continues the multiple goals of the original 1990 program the foremost goal of the original ccdbg was to make child care more affordable for lowincome families to enable them to work while allowing parents to select their own child care to the maximum extent possible in addition the program was structured as block grant consistent with the goal of providing flexibility to the states in designing their own systems upgrading the quality of child care was also an aim of lawmakers but congress decided against the establishment of mandatory federal quality standards instead requiring the states to develop their own licensing provisions in compromise designed to balance the competing goals of upgrading quality and providing state flexibility congress established three health and safety areas in 13 this program is often described as actually having three funding streams because appropriations under section 418 are divided into two components guaranteed funds provided to states without matching or maintenanceofeffort requirements and matching funds that are subject to state matching and maintenanceofeffort rules crs13 which states were mandated to develop requirements applicable to all child care providers however the federal law did not dictate the specific content of these requirements finally while the majority of ccdbg funding was intended for the direct provision of child care subsidies consistent with the programs primary purpose the law also required each state to use portion of its block grant funds for activities to improve the quality of child care and to increase the availability of specific services such as child care for schoolaged children it is noteworthy that the original ccdbg was enacted at the same time that certain families with children ie current and former welfare recipients were individually entitled to child care assistance under separate federal programs in addition congress created the atrisk child care program as capped entitlement to states to ensure that very lowincome families also would have separate source of child care funding thus at the time the ccdbg was enacted it was not seen as safety net program for the populations most in need but rather an additional source of funding for states to expand child care services to lowincome working families who were not necessarily connected to the welfare system during the debate that resulted in the 1996 welfare reform law congress saw child care as an essential component of the effort to promote selfsufficiency through work however separate from the context of welfare reform the 1996 child care provisions were also intended to address concerns about the effectiveness and efficiency of the existing programs specifically lawmakers hoped to create seamless child care system to replace the fragmentation that had resulted from having four separate federal programs ie ccdbg atrisk child care afdc child care and transitional child care these four programs had all come into existence in either 1988 or 1990 and had different rules regarding eligibility time limits on the receipt of assistance and work requirements consistent with other block grant proposals considered in the 104th congress including tanf the child care provisions in welfare reform were intended to streamline the federal role reduce the number of federal programs and conflicting rules and increase the flexibility provided to states by consolidating federal funding for child care under single stateadministered umbrella congress transferred important decisions to the state level states now must grapple with questions of coverage and equity in distributing child care benefits among welfare families who are trying to achieve selfsufficiency and lowincome working families who have never been connected to the welfare system while federal law contains some provisions intended to ensure balance of services between these two populations congress intended that the bulk of the decision making rest with the states specifically states must define the population eligible for child care subsidies within the federal parameters and determine whether any subgroups eg welfare recipients former welfare recipients families with very low incomes etc will receive guarantee or priority for services further states must establish payment rates and sliding fee scales that provide access to the same quality of services available to the general population but these decisions are also affected by the total amount of resources available to the state the states eligibility criteria and the states goals regarding the number or percentage of eligible families it hopes to serve finally crs14 states must consider the impact of their licensing and other regulatory requirements on the costs of providing child care in the open market which ultimately affects the payment rate established for subsidized care tax allowances for child care 14 current law current law includes two tax allowances explicitly targeted for child care the dependent care tax credit and the dependent care assistance program savings from other family tax allowances such as the recentlyenacted child credit and the earned income tax credit might also be used for this purpose though they were enacted for different reasons ability to pay for child care is also influenced by tax provisions affecting families generally such as the amount of the standard deduction and dependent exemption the level of the statutory tax rates and the width of the statutory tax brackets for the discussion that follows some readers may wish to refer to the federal income tax formula that is included in appendix the dependent care tax credit dctc is available to individual taxpayers for employmentrelated expenses incurred for the care of dependent child under age 13 or of spouse or dependent who is physically or mentally incapacitated the taxpayer must keep up home in which both the taxpayer and the qualifying individual live the stated maximum credit is 30 of qualifying expenses up to 2400 for one individual ie 720 and 4800 for two or more individuals ie 1440 the credit rate is reduced by 1 percentage point for each 2000 of adjusted gross income agi or fraction thereof above 10000 until it reaches 20 for taxpayers with agis over 28000 14 this section discusses federal tax provisions however most states with income taxes also allow an exclusion for employer dependent care assistance programs and 25 states and the district of columbia as of

not refundable taxpayers whose entire tax liability is eliminated by their standard deduction and their personal and dependent exemptions do not benefit from it in 1999 single parent with one child

families with one or two qualifying children the dctc may reduce the amount of the new child credit described below that they otherwise would be entitled to receive since the sum of these two credits and any other nonrefundable personal credits cannot exceed the taxpayers tax liability larger dctc sometimes results in smaller child credit dollar of one supplants dollar of the other16 as practical matter families with one or two children do not gain additional tax savings from the dctc until their income exceeds the sum of their standard deduction their personal 15 with an income of 16010 the single parents regular tax liability would be 624 ie 16010 11850 x 15 which would be completely offset by the credit with less income the tax liability would be lower and so would the credit with income over 18000 the credit rate would be less than 26 16 the offset occurs only in the case of one or two children since the child credit may be partly refundable in the case of three or more

would be offset by these factors their largest effective dctc benefit 960 ie 4800 x 20 credit rate would be available if their income were 31267 or higher eligibility for the dctc has income ceiling though the credit for some middle and higher income taxpayers may be limited by their tentative minimum tax17 qualifying expenses cannot exceed the earned income of the taxpayer or in the case of married couples the earned income of the lesserearning spouse if the latter is fulltime student or incapacitated he or she is deemed to have some earned income for purposes of this rule the joint committee on taxation jct tax expenditure estimate for the dctc for fy1999 is 25 billion18 the dependent care assistance program dcap allows individual taxpayers to exclude from gross income up to 5000 year in employer dependent care assistance up to 2500 for married individuals filing separate returns when determining their income tax liability excluded amounts are also not subject to employment taxes of either the employer or the employee the exclusion applies not only to care provided by employers but also to arrangements that reimburse employees for their own qualifying expenses which are more common frequently both are funded through salaryreduction agreements that allow employees to make dependent care expenditures on pretax basis as with the dctc dependent child must be under age 13 similarly the exclusion cannot exceed the earned income of the taxpayer or in the case of married couples the earned income of the lesser earning spouse unless the latter is fulltime student or incapacitated in which case there is deemed income the jct tax expenditure estimate for the dcap for fy1999 is 04 billion 17 under section 26 of the internal revenue code the limit on nonrefundable personal tax credits is the excess of the regular tax liability over the tentative minimum tax the tentative minimum tax generally is zero for taxpayers with incomes less than the alternative minimum tax exemption amount 33750 for single taxpayers including heads of household 45000 for married taxpayers filing jointly and 22500 for married taxpayers filing separately thus for these families the limit on nonrefundable credits usually is their regular tax liability however families with incomes above these thresholds are likely to have positive tentative minimum tax and in some cases the difference between their regular tax liability and their tentative minimum tax may exceed their total credits nonrefundable personal credits were exempted from the tentative minimum tax limitation in 1998 and president clinton has proposed extending the exemption to 1999 and 2000 18 united states congress joint committee on taxation jct staff estimates of federal tax expenditures for fy 19992003 jcs798 december 1998 table 1 other tax expenditure estimates cited in this report are also from this table crs17 for families with one child the dcap can yield substantially larger income tax savings than the dctc since the limit on qualifying expenditures is 5000 rather than 2400 higher income families also benefit since the value of the exclusion which is determined by the taxpayers marginal tax rate is greater than 20 tax credit for families in the 28 or higher tax brackets for lower income families in the 15 tax bracket whether the dcap yields greater tax savings including reductions in employment taxes depends upon the level of their child care expenses for single parent with one child and an income of 19184 the lowest income for obtaining the largest dctc the dcap would result in more tax savings once child care expenses exceed 2649 families may benefit from both the dctc and the dcap in the same year however the ceiling on qualified expenses that can be taken into account for the former 2400 or 4800 is reduced by the amount of the dcap exclusion families might also use savings from other tax provisions to help pay child care costs the five identified below were not explicitly designed to offset child care expenses but they can help families meet basic living costs which often include those expenses together the allowances can provide substantial savings to families that fully qualify for them for further analysis of the interaction of these provisions see crs report 98655 the marriage penalty and other family tax issues by jane gravelle as mentioned above the maximum child credit in 1999 is 500 times the number of qualifying children under age 17 it is refundable for taxpayers with three or more qualifying children depending on the social security taxes they pay and the eitc they receive it is phased out for families with modified agi starting at 110000 for married joint filers 55000 for married separate filers and 75000 for others the maximum earned income tax credit eitc in 1999 is 2312 for taxpayers with one qualifying child under age 19 and 3816 for taxpayers with two or more qualifying children the credit is proportionally reduced as earned income falls below 6800 in the case of one child and 9540 for two or more children it is also proportionally phased out starting at agi of 12460 and is completely eliminated for agis at or above 26928 for one child and 30580 for two or more children it is refundable taxpayers are allowed itemized or standard deduction whichever is greater the standard deduction depends on filing status for 1999 it is 7200 for married joint filers 6350 for heads of household 4300 for singles and 3600 for married separate filers19 taxpayers are allowed dependent exemption for individuals for whom they provide more than half support and who meet certain other tests in 1999 the dependent exemption is 2750 times the number of qualifying dependents taxpayers regular tax liability is determined by multiplying their taxable income determined after exclusions exemptions and deductions by their 19 an additional standard deduction is allowed taxpayers who are legally blind or age 65 or older reduced standard deduction applies in the case of taxpayers who can be claimed as dependent on anothers tax return crs18 statutory tax rate there currently are five statutory rates for ordinary income ranging from 15 to 396 in 1999 the 15 rate applies to taxable incomes up to 43050 for married couples filing joint returns while the next lowest rate 28 applies to taxable incomes of 43051 up to 104050 for single parent filing as head of household the 15 rate applies to taxable incomes up to 34550 while the 28 rate applies to taxable incomes of 34551 to 89150 the figures on page

benefits from the eitc and the child credit the bottom of the three moreorless horizontal lines as well as the combined tax benefits from those two credits and either the maximum dctc the middle line or the maximum dcap the top line the assumptions used to prepare these figures are described in appendix in both figures asterisks mark the families tax entry points the income levels above which the taxpayers would incur tax liability if they claimed tax credits for example in the case of the single parent one tax entry point occurs once earnings exceed 11850 the sum of 6350 for the standard deduction and 5500 for the personal and dependent exemptions while the other occurs once earnings exceed 16850 the sum of the standard deduction personal and dependent exemptions and the excluded income from participating in the dcap the figures show that eitc provides tax benefits below the tax entry points since it is refundable credit the maximum eitc is 2312 for single parent with one child and 3816 for the married couple with two children the dotted lines sloping sharply downward show the eitc phasing out as earnings increase from 12460 to 26928 for the single parent with one child and from 12460 to 30580 for the married couple with two children families with incomes just above the tax entry points are eligible for the 500 per child credit in addition to the eitc the combined benefits are shown in the bottom of the three lines beyond the point where the eitc phases out families may continue to receive the child tax credit alone until it too phases out over the 75000 to 85000 earnings range for the single parent with one child and over the 110000 to 130000 earnings range for the married couple with two children families with qualified child care expenses might claim the dctc in addition to the eitc and child credit the combined benefits assuming the families have the maximum qualified expenses are shown in the middle of the three lines in both figures the line declines sharply as the eitc phases out then it is horizontal until the child credit phases out and then it continues level across higher levels of income reflecting the fact that the 20 dctc rate has income ceiling if families instead participate in an employer sponsored dcap they would receive tax savings from the income exclusion the combined benefits for them assuming they have maximum

authorized in 1954 when congress enacted comprehensive revision of the internal revenue code number of revisions were made in the 1960s and 1970s including adoption of the credit in 1976 but few significant changes have occurred since 1981 the internal revenue code of 1954 pl 591 of the 83rd congress allowed an itemized deduction for child and dependent care expenses that enable the taxpayer to be gainfully employed the deduction was originally limited to 600 year and restricted to women widowers and men who were divorced or legally separated in the case of working wife joint return had to be filed and the deduction was phased out dollar for dollar for agis over 4500 except if the husband were incapable of selfsupport qualifying children other than older dependents unable to care for themselves had to be under 12 years of age the deduction limit was increased to 900 year by the revenue act of 1964 pl 88272 in the case of two or more qualifying dependents this legislation also raised to 6000 the income level above which the deduction was phased out in the case of working wife husbands were allowed the deduction in the case of an incapacitated or institutionalized wife the age limit for qualifying children was raised to under 13 years the deduction limit was further changed to 400 month by the revenue act of 1971 pl 92178 provided the expenses were for services within the taxpayers household expenses outside the household could be taken into account only for qualifying children for whom the age limit was further raised to under 15 years and the deduction was limited to 200 month for one child 300 month for two children and 400 month for three or more children the deduction was phased out for taxpayers generally not just households with working wife with agis over 18000 this amount was raised to 35000 by the tax reduction act of 1975 pl 9412 the itemized deduction was replaced by the dependent care tax credit by the tax reform act of 1976 pl 94455 this nonrefundable credit was originally equal to 20 of expenses that enable the taxpayer to be gainfully employed up to 2000 in expenses could be taken into account for one qualifying individual thus maximum credit of 400 and up to 4000 for two or more thus maximum credit of 800 new rule was that qualifying expenses taken into account could not exceed the earned income of the taxpayer or in the case of married couples the earned income of the lesserearning spouse if the spouse was fulltime student or incapacitated he or she was deemed to have earned income of 166 month for one crs21 qualifying individual 333 month for two or more for purposes of this rule the credit was not phased out for higher income taxpayers the change from an itemized deduction to credit was explained by the house report on the legislation treating child care expenses as itemized deductions denies any beneficial tax recognition of such expenses to taxpayers who elect the standard deduction your committee believes that such expenses should be viewed as cost of earning income for which all working taxpayers may make claim one method would be to replace the itemized deduction with credit against income tax liability for percentage of qualified expenses while deductions favor taxpayers in the higher marginal tax brackets tax credit provides more help for taxpayers in the lower brackets20 the economic recovery tax act of 1981 pl 9734 changed the credit rate in place of the flat 20 rate it established the current schedule that provides higher rates to taxpayers with agis of 28000 or less the limit on expenses that could be taken into account was increased to 2400 for one qualifying individual and 4800 for two or more deemed income for spouse who is fulltime student or incapacitated was increased to 200 and 400 month respectively dependent care centers serving six or more individuals must meet state legal requirements in order for taxpayers to take expenditures at them into account the economic recovery tax act of 1981 also authorized the dcap exclusion initially there was dollar limit on the exclusion but the tax reform act of 1986 pl 99514 capped it at 5000 the age limit for qualifying children was reduced from 15 to 13 years for both the dctc and the dcap by the family support act of 1988 pl 100485 justifications for current law over time both the dctc and the dcap have been designed to meet conflicting objectives they strike balance between allowing taxpayers to recognize cost of earning income in determining their tax liability but not recognizing personal expense they give equity to taxpayers who do not benefit from the exclusion of imputed income of athome parents and they provide subsidy to lower income taxpayers both provisions reflect compromises in part for administrative simplicity that can be criticized from the standpoint of one objective but that may be an appropriate integration of several21 20 united states congress house committee on ways and means tax reform act of 1975 report to accompany hr 10612 hrept 94658 november 12 1975 p 147 21 in addition to the justifications discussed here committee reports have off and on advanced other reasons for the dctc and dcap such as encouraging the hiring of domestic workers and encouraging the care of incapacitated persons at home rather than institutions the design of the tax benefits does not always reflect these ancillary justifications crs22 the principal argument for both the dctc and the dcap is that child care is cost of earning income that taxpayers should be allowed to recognize both provisions in fact restrict qualifying expenses to those incurred so the taxpayer can work or look for work expenses when the taxpayer is home ill or on vacation generally cannot be taken into account the work must be gainful employment volunteer work even for nominal wage does not qualify as previously mentioned the first statutory provision regarding child care made expenses deductible as are employment expenses generally if child care were solely an employment expense the proper treatment under an income tax generally would be deduction not credit since deductions usually result in more accurate measurement of net income22 net income the sum upon which taxes are levied is determined by reducing gross income by the costs incurred in earning it in contrast tax credits typically reduce tax liability without close regard to the costs of earning income 20 tax credit for example would overcompensate taxpayers for these costs if they were in the 15 bracket it would reduce their final tax liability by more than the tax increase they would incur if the expense were not recognized and undercompensate them if they were in the 28 or higher brackets but child care is also widely considered to be personal expense this view was the basis for 1939 board of tax appeals ruling prior to the enactment of the statutory deduction that child care expenses are nondeductible in their entirety23 in disallowing deduction for nursemaid costs claimed by married couple both of whom were employed the board said that we are not prepared to say that the care of children like similar aspects of family and household life is other than personal concern the board admitted that some expenses normally classified as personal may become deductible when there is an intimate connection with an occupation carried on for profit citing entertainment traveling expenses and the cost of an actors wardrobe but for other expenses the relationship is only indirect and tenuous and so the board reasoned that deduction is not warranted the underlying issue here is how to reconcile two tax principles one that allows deductions for the cost of earning income and one that disallows deductions for personal expenses many expenses associated with employment have both characteristics in addition to child care employed people often incur extra costs for commuting meals clothing travel moving their households and so on the internal revenue code does not treat these mixed expenses in consistent manner some are largely deductible eg moving expenses some are deductible only in fixed part eg meals for which only 50 of the cost can be taken into account and some are largely not deductible eg commuting expenses since it is difficult to distinguish expenses that are essentially costs of earning income from expenses that are essentially personal at least by objective criteria the code falls back on compromise rules that are administratively feasible 22 if child care were solely an employment expense it might also be argued that the deduction should not be limited by dollar cap provided the expenses were reasonable in addition income ceilings on taxpayer eligibility which some have proposed might be questioned 23 smith v commissioner 40 bta 1038 crs23 for child care the code strikes middle ground between the two principles it allows some expenses to be recognized as cost of earning income but expenses beyond certain point cannot be taken into account even if incurred because of employment as noted above the present limits on recognized expenses for the dctc are 2400 for one child and 4800 for two while for the dcap it is 5000 uniform limits may not be appropriate for some families if employed parents would not otherwise choose child care they might not derive much personal benefit from it arguably they should be allowed to recognize most of its cost even beyond the current limits alternatively if parents would willingly choose child care even if they were not employed then arguably they should not recognize any of its cost however uniform limits might be justified on the grounds of administrative simplicity even if they penalize some families and reward others on the basis of this standard some aspects of the current limits on recognized expenses might be questioned for one thing the limits have not been increased in 17 years as result the economic value of the maximum credit and exclusion has fallen by over 40 if these ceilings were appropriate in 1981 they arguably cannot be so today second for the dctc taxpayers can take 2400 of expenses into account if they have one child and 4800 if they have two but the limit is not increased for additional children larger families thus might not get benefits that are proportional to their costs allowing larger credit for families with three or more children would not be very complicated though it could be challenged by those opposed to subsidizing larger families24 third for the dcap qualified expenses do not vary by the number of children at all for parents with single child the exclusion can provide substantially more tax savings than the credit if the parents were in the 28 tax bracket the exclusion could be worth up to 1400 in income tax savings alone ie the 5000 ceiling on qualified expenses x 28 while the maximum credit would be worth only 480 ie 2400 x 2025 some would argue that it seems inequitable that parents could have such different benefits simply because some work for employers with dcap while the others must use the credit the inequity is likely heightened when parents arrange and pay for child care on their own and simply use the dcap as way of receiving tax benefits tax theorists sometimes justify child care tax allowances by noting that parents who stay at home are not taxed on the imputed income from child care that they 24 as noted previously the revenue act of 1971 allowed deduction for expenses of child care outside the household of 200 month for one child 300 for two children and 400 for three or more children however it should be noted that the current qualifying expense limit of 4800 in the case of two or more qualifying individuals does not have to be divided equally among them family apparently could have qualifying expenses of 4500 for one child and 300 for another which might be seen as inequitable by family with only one child allowing larger credit for three of more children might increase this disparity unless limit of 2400 were applied to each child the latter ceiling however would add complexity and might be difficult to enforce 25 in 1999 married couples filing joint return would generally pay 28 on taxable income over 43050 but not over 104050 person filing as head of household generally would pay 28 on taxable income over 34550 but not over 89150 crs24 provide themselves26 this exclusion gives them tax benefit that working parents who pay for child care with aftertax dollars do not have to provide equity it is argued that employed parents ought to be allowed tax allowance for expenses they incur so they can work deduction for example would allow employed parents to escape taxation on the income they earn to obtain child care just as stayathome parents are exempt from tax on the income they implicitly receive in providing child care deduction would remove any tax penalty for parents who choose to work at activities in the marketplace rather than in the house27 it is not clear however why consideration of imputed income should be restricted to child care expenses taxpayers generally must choose between taxable employment income and other work housecleaning and yard work for example which is exempt from taxation if done themselves but for which others must be paid some might argue that it would be easier and more equitable if all employed taxpayers were allowed limited deduction to offset the expenses they pay with aftertax income because they do not have as much time for chores28 on the other hand current public policy gives child care expenses special treatment it is more important that children have good care when their parents are at work than it is for houses to be vacuumed and lawns mowed the change from an itemized deduction to credit in the tax reform act of 1976 provided an additional subsidy to lowerincome families see the house report language quoted previously congress could have taken different approach an alternative would have been to allow deduction for child care expenses in determining adjusted gross income agi which would not have been restricted to itemizers29 some employment expenses such as moving expenses in fact are deductions for agi and while deductions result in larger tax savings to taxpayers in higher marginal tax brackets this is simply consequence of progressive tax rates 26 imputed income generally is noncash income or income in kind for families it typically arises outside of ordinary economic markets imputed income is included in comprehensive definitions of income that are used to assess the equity and efficiency of statutory tax provisions for one discussion see edward j mccaffery taxing women university of chicago press chicago 1997 p 120126 27 thus deduction for child care costs of employed parents would make the income tax neutral with respect to whether parents should stay home or work whether the income tax should be neutral on this issue of course is debatable and arguments can be advanced for either side however from the standpoint of comprehensive definition of income it would appear to be equitable to provide deduction or credit for employed parents but not stayat home parents 28 thus tax theorists might note that parents who stay at home have more available time than parents who are employed and that it would be equitable for the tax system to recognize the importance of this difference by allowing the latter an offsetting deduction 29 this is sometimes called an abovetheline deduction the prior law restriction to itemizers might have been justified under the view that nonitemizers receive even larger tax savings from the standard deduction crs25 to recognize costs of earning income accurately deduction should reflect marginal rates30 the deduction provided benefit to families otherwise without tax liability even if they could itemize their deductions but the credit since it is not refundable also does not help these families as shown on page 15 the credit gives benefit to individuals who offset all their income with the standard deduction and personal and dependent exemptions which are all indexed for inflation unlike the credit or to some others who are eligible for the new child credit for lower income taxpayers who can benefit the maximum credit rates longer are as generous for the single taxpayer with one child the maximum rate is 25 not 30 for married couples with two children the maximum rate is 20 the same as for higher income taxpayers tax credits particularly if refundable often are used to provide subsidies to families for personal expenses that would not otherwise be recognized under an income tax in this respect they are analogous to public subsidies that are generally available to all taxpayers nonetheless some might question whether there should be income limit on subsidies for privatelymade decisions about child care some might also question whether public subsidies for personal expenses as opposed to employment expenses should be denied taxpayers who choose not to be employed the dctc can be considered progressive except for lowincome families who do not benefit because it is nonrefundable since the tax savings it generates generally decline as proportion of income nonetheless higher middleincome families receive disproportionate share of these savings the joint committee on taxation jct estimates that about 51 of returns claiming the credit have incomes over 50000 they receive 55 of the total credit dollars about 22 have incomes under 30000 they receive 20 of total credit dollars31 analysis of combined ccdf and dctc subsidies this section examines combined ccdf and dctc benefits in order to illustrate the variation in subsidies families might receive and the outofpocket costs they might bear depending on their income and state of residence specifically it shows that there are significant differences in the amount of child care subsidies in child care subsidies as percent of costs in net outofpocket child care expenses and in outof pocket child care expenses as percent of net aftertax income 30 deduction that reflects marginal tax rates exempts from taxation the income that is necessary to pay the expense in question if the deduction exempted lesser amount for example if taxpayers with 36 marginal tax rate were allowed only 15 deduction for the cost of earning income they would be taxed on more than their net income from the activity 31 united states congress joint committee on taxation jct staff estimates of federal tax expenditures for fy 19992003 jcs798 december 1998 table 3 for this table the measure of income is agi plus various types of excluded income such as tax exempt interest and employer contributions to health plans crs26 considered separately ccdf and dctc subsidies generally are progressive with respect to family income but in combination their progressivity is less evident our analysis identifies gaps in coverage in some states familys income may be too high to qualify for ccdf benefits but too low to reap any dctc tax savings in some cases onedollar difference in family income may result in large difference in the amount of child care subsidy family may be eligible to receive resulting in large inequities between families of similar income moreover while the analysis focuses on the subsidy that families might be eligible to receive under the ccdf it does not address the fact that subsidies are not necessarily guaranteed this report does not address the extent to which eligible families actually receive subsidies under this program according to hhs the program served an average of 125 million children monthly in fy1998 compared to an estimated 10 million children who were eligible32 the section also raises the question of what constitutes affordable child care though the answer is not explored in this report our analysis suggests that some lower income families may find it difficult to afford the same types of child care that are subsidized for to the poorest families under ccdf most states ccdf programs conform to the 10 of family income guideline suggested by hhs as the maximum amount poor families should be expected to pay for child care see the earlier discussion on page 11 however to purchase the same type of child care that is subsidized for poor families under ccdf some families with incomes just above poverty would be required to spend substantially greater shares of their income our analysis is based on the ccdf and dctc rules explained earlier as they apply to single parent working fulltime with 3yearold child in centerbased care the findings should not be considered representative of all families with child care expenses nonetheless the findings do illustrate how there can be wide variations in the combined subsidies as result of state decisions regarding ccdf income eligibility rules payment rates and sliding fee schedules the analysis assumes that the single parents sole source of income is from employment and that the parent claims only the standard deduction and personal and dependent exemptions in determining taxable income tax liability and credits are calculated for tax year 1999 assuming current law as of january 1 1999 however the analysis is based on effective dctc benefits as discussed on page 15 for more detail on tax assumptions see appendix it also assumes that the actual cost of child care purchased by the family is equal to the ccdf payment rate for fulltime centerbased care for 3yearold child the rates for each state are shown in figure 3 on page 10 ccdf income eligibility thresholds are applied as if the family were new applicant as noted earlier states may treat recipient families differently than applicant families finally the states sliding fee schedule rules are applied to the family to determine the outofpocket child care costs the family might bear and 32 the administrations figure of 10 million is actually the number of children under age 13 whose family income is less than 200 of poverty this is intended as proxy for the number of children who would be eligible in each state under the federal threshold of 85 of state median income although most states set their eligibility thresholds at lower level

prepared by the congressonal research service 33 an exception shown in the figure is between 10000 and 11000 where the subsidy continued crs28 in at least one state as represented by the line depicting the minimum for family with as little as 13000 in annual earnings but then increases around 15000 as the dctc takes effect turning to table a3 page 42 upon which figure 6 is based it can be seen that three states nebraska south carolina and west virginia provide subsidy to an applicant family with annual income of 13000 these families incomes are also too low for them to qualify for child care tax allowance under the dctc family with slightly lower income of 12000 would qualify for an annual child care subsidy of 4635 in nebraska 3702 in south carolina and 2086 in west virginia although new applicant families would not be eligible for ccdf subsidies in these three states if their annual earnings were 13000 or higher families might be eligible at this earnings level if they were in transition from tanf or if they had initially qualified for ccdf when their earnings were lower notice that the five lines in figure 6 all connect to common single line depicted at the bottom of the figure this common line represents the dctc subsidy alone apart from any subsidy provided under ccdf the figure shows the dctc phasing in over the 15184 to 19184 income range 19184 marks the minimal annual income at which the depicted family could receive the maximum 600 dctc 25 credit rate applied to the maximum allowed child care expenses of 2400 at the 15000 annual income level just below the effective dctc lowerincome threshold in 1999 the depicted family would be ineligible for ccdf in 10 states see table a3 in these states the familys income would be too high to qualify for ccdf subsidy and too low to receive any tax benefits from the dctc34 note earlier in the discussion of ccdf incomeeligibility limits figure 1 showed that eight states basic incomeeligibility limits were below the dctc lower income threshold after applying states slidingfee schedule rules the hypothetical family with 15000 in earnings would receive subsidy in two more states nebraska and maryland than those shown in figure 1 at the 19000 income level just below the maximum dctc threshold of 19184 the depicted family would be eligible for subsidy through ccdf in 24 states families with 22000 in annual earnings would be eligible for ccdf in just 13 states see table a3 33 continued appears to be rising with income this is because the family with 10000 in earnings is assumed to be working less than full year ie 10000 annual earnings reflects less full time fullyear employment at the current minimum wage of 515 per hour accordingly the child care subsidy has been prorata reduced to reflect less than fullyear employment for the family with 10000 in earnings 34 in one additional state south dakota the depicted family would be eligible only for minimal subsidy of 8 crs29 child care subsidies as percent of costs by family income figure 7 depicts child care subsidies as percent of child care costs by family income across states the figure is similar to figure 6 except that the subsidy is shown as percentage of the cost of child care ie the ccdf payment rate shown in figure 3 the figure shows that for single parent family with annual income of 11000 just below the poverty level in 1998 states subsidize between 65 minimum and 100 maximum of the cost of child care for 3year old in fulltime care one state oklahoma subsidizes 65 of child care costs for family near poverty whereas three states california hawaii and vermont subsidize the full cost of child care see table a4 half the states subsidize 86 or more ie the median value of the cost of child care for single parent with one child having income near poverty at the 15000 annual income level just below the effective dctc lower income threshold in 1999 one quarter of the states subsidize 79 or more of the cost top quartile of child care half the states subsidize 61 or more of the cost median of child care and one quarter of the states subsidize less than 34 of the cost bottom quartile figure 7 combined

percent of net aftertax income by state lower income families who are ineligible for ccdf or who are eligible but dont actually receive ccdf assistance may find that child care priced at the ccdf payment rate is unaffordable even considering the tax savings offered by the dctc figure 9 depicts child care expenses as percent of family net income after federal income taxes including adjustment for the eitc and fica taxes for the hypothetical family who contracts for child care at the ccdf payment rate in each state as noted earlier hhs has suggested that states set their sliding fee scales for child care so that lowincome family would be required to pay more than 10 of its income for child care figure 9 shows that most states ccdf sliding fee scales conform to this 10 income guideline for family with earnings near the poverty level the figure shows for example that families in half the states are required to pay more than 4 of their net income for child care if they earn 11000 per year ie just below poverty level at this earnings level outofpocket child care expenses would be more than 7 of net family income in one quarter of the states in six states colorado nevada new hampshire north dakota oregon wisconsin and the district of columbia child care expenses would amount to 10 or more of net aftertax income see table a6 figure 9 outofpocket child care costs as percent

3 1 family earnings child care subsidy is prorata reduced at the 10000 earnings level to reflect partyear work at minimum wage source figure prepared by the congressonal research service figure 9 also shows that in at least one state family with earnings as low as 13000 would have child care expenses that amount to as much as 39 of net income if the family were to contract for fulltime centerbased care at the established payment rate in this case the family living in nebraska see table a6 would be ineligible for any subsidy under ccdf as its income would be too high and it would also be ineligible for any subsidy under the dctc as its income would be too low crs32 similarly the family would be ineligible for ccdf if it lived in south carolina where the unsubsidized cost of fulltime centerbased care would amount to 29 of aftertax income and in west virginia where the cost would amount to 20 of net income see table a6 clearly at such low earnings level the cost of fulltime center based care at the established payment rate would prohibit most families from choosing such arrangements as it would leave the family with too little money for shelter food clothing and other necessities even at higher earnings levels child care costs at the ccdf payment rate may place great strains on the family budget even considering savings from the dctc for example figure 9 shows that child care costs would amount to 20 or more of familys aftertax income at the 20000 earnings level in half the states considering both ccdf and dctc subsidies at this earnings level the depicted family would be eligible for ccdf in only 18 states see table a6 consequently at the 20000 earnings level families in most states would receive only the dctc which amounts to savings of 600 on their federal income taxes the maximum available dctc35 the tax savings attributed to the dctc is factored in on the income side ie denominator in calculating the outofpocket child care expense percentage amount shown in the figure lower income families who are ineligible for ccdf and those who are eligible but not served by the program may be priced out of the child care market when it comes to purchasing the same quality of care that is offered to families with less income under ccdf families priced out of ccdfcomparable care may be forced to find less costly child care arrangements which may also be less convenient less reliable or of lesser quality concluding notes and outstanding issues the primary federal grant and tax subsidies for child care were developed in isolation from one another and have little in common in terms of their operation their legislative histories and their policy justifications the ccdf is administered by states so by design its eligibility criteria and benefit levels vary widely across the country the dctc is federal tax credit with uniform provisions regarding who may claim it and the amount of tax savings they receive despite years of debate the ccdf is relatively new based on programs created in 1988 and 1990 in contrast the dctc can trace its history as far back as 1954 when an itemized tax deduction for child care expenses was authorized in terms of policy justifications the ccdf is rooted in public welfare concepts welfare recipients and very lowincome families need help with their child care costs to enable them to become and remain employed and to achieve economic self sufficiency tax allowances for child care are justified on the basis of several tax concepts child care expenses are cost of earning income that taxpayers should be 35 that is the 25 dctc credit rate at the 20000 income level multiplied by the maximum qualified child care expenses under dctc of 2400 for one child equals 600 the ccdf payment rate for fulltime centerbased care for 3year old child is above the 2400 dctc qualified expense limit in all states crs33 allowed to recognize and child care tax benefit provides equity for families with workrelated child care expenses in comparison with families with an athome parent whose imputed income is not taxed our analysis of the impact of these subsidies on families child care expenses raises policy questions that congress might want to consider in evaluating proposals to expand or revise the existing grant program or tax provisions complete exploration of these questions goes beyond the scope of this report for example should all working parents receive some federal child care subsidy under current law all working parents do not receive federal child care subsidy as this report has shown ccdf eligibility criteria vary widely by state and are typically set below the federal maximum of 85 of state median income in 10 states familys income could be too high to qualify for ccdf subsidy but too low to receive any tax savings from the dctc in most states family could theoretically be eligible for both subsidies but would be unlikely to benefit from both in fact family eligible to claim even one dollar of the tax credit would fall into the ccdf very lowincome priority group only in 10 states thus in some states there is gap between the official eligibility criteria for the ccdf and the dctc and in many states there is gap between the income level at which families actually receive ccdf subsidies and the level at which they can claim child care tax credit these gaps generally affect lower income families not receiving ccdf subsidies and result from four factors the flexibility allowed states in setting eligibility criteria for the ccdf the fact that the ccdf is not an entitlement to individuals the ccdf is not funded at level adequate to serve all eligible families and the structure of the dctc as nonrefundable credit should federal child care subsidies be equitable for similar families both within and across states as illustrated in this report the dollar amount of subsidies available to families under the ccdf and dctc combined varies widely by state and by family income family at certain income level may be eligible to receive sizeable child care subsidy in one state but little or nothing in another in addition small income differences can have large consequences in the amount of familys child care subsidy in other words families with the same income are not treated the same across states and families in the same state are not necessarily treated equitably at different income levels these patterns result in part from the flexibility given to states in setting both eligibility criteria and benefit levels under the ccdf in addition eligibility criteria under the ccdf and dctc are not coordinated with one another resulting in the gaps in coverage described above thus in some states family with gradually increasing income can lose eligibility for child care subsidy under the ccdf and then receive subsidy at all until its income climbs high enough to trigger dctc savings crs34 development of more cohesive federal child care policy for all working families might not be easy regarding the ccdf it is important to remember that variation among states was specifically permitted by congress which structured the program as block grant with federal parameters instead of specific mandates regarding eligibility criteria payment rates and sliding fee schedules the most recent child care amendments were contained in and are consistent with the 1996 welfare reform legislation that transferred significant decisionmaking authority for program design to the states likewise congress did not establish ccdf subsidies as an entitlement to individuals and in fact it repealed previous child care entitlements for current and former welfare recipients it was not congressional intent that all families below certain income level or within certain category be guaranteed access to child care subsidies nor was it congressional intent that similar families necessarily be treated the same in every state at the same time while the tax credit has uniform provisions nationwide it does not reach families without tax liability and therefore does not even out differences among state ccdf programs should making child care affordable be goal of federal child care subsidies neither the grant program nor the child care tax provisions are explicitly intended to make child care affordable for all families in fact the concept of affordability is not clearly articulated for these subsidies the dctc and dcap have different qualifying expense ceilings neither of which has been adjusted since 1981 despite increases in actual child care costs neither tax benefit is adjusted for family size in the case of three or more children the ccdf addresses the issue of affordability by requiring states to establish payment rates so that participating families have access to the same types of child care as families not eligible for program subsidies however states retain final control over the payment rates and sliding fee scales that determine the outofpocket expenses of participating families more importantly states determine who actually receives ccdf subsidies families not in states priority group for ccdf assistance and lacking sufficient income to owe taxes may receive direct federal help to afford child care yet this crs analysis shows that child care priced at the levels assumed by state payment rates may be beyond the financial reach of many families who do not receive ccdf subsidies the current child care subsidies do not work together to make child care affordable for all working families because they were designed to accomplish different goals in designing the child care grant program lawmakers were primarily concerned with promoting selfsufficiency for poor families who might find the cost of child care barrier to entering or remaining in the labor force while states have the flexibility to serve families with incomes up to 85 of the state median income priority often is given to those on welfare or with the lowest incomes likewise the tax credit is not intended to make child care affordable for all families but rather to allow working families to recognize some of their child care expenses as cost of earning income thus it is possible that the ccdf and the dctc are each achieving crs35 their goals while at the same time affordability of child care remains problem for certain families numerous other issues both broad and narrow surround proposals to expand or revise existing child care subsidies questions might be raised about equity of coverage adequacy of resources quality of care complexity of benefits families with an athome parent budget cost and so on however it is difficult to analyze these issues without first answering the overarching question of what should be the federal governments primary goal in providing child care subsidies currently there are two different answers to this question reflecting the two different types of child care subsidies available as our report has shown these subsidies can be justified when examined individually but raise issues when looked at together crs36 appendix methodology the estimates of child care subsidies shown in this report are based on computer simulation of how hypothetical family might be affected under ccdf and dctc rules with some exceptions noted in the report the hypothetical family is single parent working fulltime at various income levels with 3year old child in centerbased care ccdf rules relating to payment rates to providers income eligibility limits and sliding fee schedules were derived from analysis of state plans on file at hhs on august 14 1998 the estimates assume that the parent contracts for child care at the established payment rate because payment rates may vary within state the payment rate for the most populated area of the state was chosen for the analysis these payment rates may be higher than those in other areas in state the estimates of dctc subsidies are based on tax year 1999 rules that were current law on january 1 1999 the tax analysis assumes the following earnings are the only source of family income families do not claim any deductions such as for contributions to individual retirement accounts in determining their adjusted gross income ie above theline deductions thus adjusted gross income is the same as earnings families claim the basic standard deduction and additional standard deduction for age or blindness families claim the dctc and child tax credit when permitted but they do not claim any other nonrefundable tax credits such as the credit for adoption expenses or the lifetime learning credit families count any outofpocket child care costs ie the ccdf payment rate less the ccdf subsidy towards the dctc limits on qualifying expenses ie 2400 for one child and 4800 for two or more children families claim the maximum dctc depending on their qualified expenses and agi and child tax credit 500 unless the sum of the two credits exceeds the families regular tax liability ie their tax on taxable income prior to any credits in which case the sum is reduced to that liability the tentative minimum tax limitation on credits was taken into account though it does not affect the examples shown and for estimates of outofpocket child care costs as percent of net aftertax income figure 9 and table a6 the numerator in the calculation outof pocket costs is the familys child care payment after considering any ccdf subsidy while the denominator aftertax income is family earnings less federal income taxes taking into account the dctc and the eitc and less fica taxes effective dctc benefits interactions between the dctc and the 500 per child tax credit sometimes reduce the effective tax savings that families with qualified child care expenses receive from the dctc internal revenue service irs tax forms instruct tax filers to calculate the dctc before calculating the child tax credit thus the latter is the first crs37 to be limited when the sum of the two credits exceeds the familys regular tax liability the dctc is nonrefundable as is the child credit for families with one or two children under section 26 of the code the sum of these credits and other nonrefundable personal credits cannot exceed taxpayers regular tax liability as mentioned above the tentative minimum tax does not affect the limitation on tax credits for families used in our examples for example assume that taxpayer with one child could claim 400 dctc in addition to the 500 child credit before taking into account limitation on nonrefundable credits if the taxpayers regular tax liability were 900 or more both of these credis could be claimed in full however if the taxpayers regular tax liability were 700 irs procedures would allow the taxpayer to claim dctc of 400 and child credit of 300 ie 700 400 this ordering of credits sometimes makes tax savings from the dctc appear to be larger than they actually are in the example just cited the taxpayer could have claimed the full 500 child credit had there been child care expenditures the effect of claiming credit for child care expenditures would be to increase tax savings by 200 ie 700 500 while the official dctc would be 400 the effective dctc would only be 200 note that if the taxpayer in this example had been able to claim dctc of 500 the effective dctc would still only be 200 each dollar increase in the dctc would be offset by dollar reduction in the child credit until the latter is reduced to zero the analysis in this report is based on the effective dctc it shows the additional tax savings that would result when families with one or two children for whom the child credit is claimed also claim the credit for child care expenditures federal income tax formula simplified listed below are 10 steps of the general formula for calculating federal income taxes the list omits some steps such as prepayments from withholding
