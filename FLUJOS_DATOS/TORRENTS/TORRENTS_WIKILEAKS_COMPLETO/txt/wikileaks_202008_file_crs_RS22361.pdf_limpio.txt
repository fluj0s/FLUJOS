before court decides whether venue in particular district is proper it would confront the question of who bears the burden of persuasion on the issue to what level of persuasion and whether waiver by the accused obviates the need for further inquiry it is generally agreed that the government bears the burden of establishing that venue is proper ie that the offense is being prosecuted in the district in which it was committed this obligation extends to every count within the indictment or information there is supplemental venue venue however is not substantive element of the offense and consequently the government need only establish venue by preponderance of the evidence moreover venue is not jurisdictional therefore court in an improper venue enjoys the judicial authority to proceed to conviction or acquittal if the accused waives objection if the absence of proper venue is apparent on the face of indictment or information failure to object prior to trial constitutes waiver if the failure of proper venue is not apparent on the face of the charging document and is not established during the presentation of the governments case in the main objection may raised at the close of the governments case g11g151g561g25g145g138g157g561g6g146g156g157g155g146g140g157g561g6g146g141g561g157g145g142g561g5g155g146g150g142g561g17g140g140g158g155g561 the district in which venue is proper the district in which the offense was committed the locus delicti of the charged offense must be determined from the nature of the crime alleged and the location of the act or acts constituting it in performing this inquiry court must initially identify the conduct constituting the offense the nature of the crime and then discern the location of the commission of the criminal acts which is to say the inquiry begins by identifying 1 the statutory prohibition charged 2 what acts or om issions of the accused are alleged to have been committed in violation of the prohibition and 3 where those acts or omissions occurred the words congress uses when it drafts criminal proscription will establish where the offense occurs and therefore the district or districts in which venue is proper the test endorsed by the supreme court is where did the activity or omission that satisfies the statutes conduct element occur

three parts one for continuing offenses generally another for offenses involving elements of the mails or interstate commerce and third for tax offenses

paragraph of section 3237 provides except as otherwise expressly provided by enactment of congress any offense against the united states begun in one district and completed in another or committed in more than one district may be inquired of and prosecuted in any district in which such offense was begun continued or completed although money laundering is sometimes continuing offense the supreme court has observed recently that money laundering and the crimes that generated the tainted funds do not automatically form one continuous criminal episode so as to permit trial of the laundering offense in the foreign district in which moneygenerating offense occurred united states v cabrales conspiracy conspiracy may be the most commonly recognized continuing offense although whether conspiracy is really continuing offense or merely shares the attributes of continuing offense is not clear some time ago the supreme court pointed out that conspiracy could be

declared may be tried in any district in which an overt act in its furtherance is committed at least when the conspiracy statute has an overt act requirement hyde v united states 225 us 347 36061 1912 even for those conspiracy offenses for which an overt act is not an element the court in hyde implied that prosecution might be had in any district in which an overt act in their furtherance was committed without apparent exception the lower federal appellate courts have followed hydes lead and found venue proper for trial of conspiracy charges in any district in which an overt act is committed regardless of whether the conspiracy statute in question requires proof of an overt act or not nevertheless it is interesting to note that when cabrales observed that the money launderer might have been tried as conspirator in the district where the predicate offense drug trafficking occurred it referred to the general conspiracy statute that requires an overt act 18 usc 371 rather than the equally applicable drug trafficking conspiracy statute that does not 21 usc 846 aiding and abetting those who aid and abet the commission of federal crime are punishable as principals 18 usc 2 cabrales suggests they may be prosecuted wherever the underlying offense was committed subsequent lower federal appellate courts have so held continuous offenses in armour packing co v united states the supreme court upheld conviction following trial in the western district of missouri for the offense of continuous carriage by rail of the defendants products from kansas to new york at an illegally reduced rate the court concluded that this is single continuing offense continuously committed in each district through which the transportation is received at the prohibited rate id the courts most recent venue decision confirmed the continued vitality of this view when it held that if congress so crafts criminal offense as to embed within it continuing offense as one of the conduct elements of the new crime venue over the new crime is proper wherever trial over the continuing offense may be had in united states v rodriguezmoreno it held that the constitutional right to jury trial in the state and district in which the crime occurs did not preclude trial for use of firearm during the commission of predicate offense in state and district new jersey other than that in which the firearm was used maryland the crime in question 18 usc 924c1 contains two distinct conduct elements as is relevant in this case the using and carrying of gun and the commission of kidnaping defendant commits crime and may be tried where he commits any of its conduct elements kidnaping is crime that continues from capture until release and therefore can be tried in any place from through or into which the victim is taken and the appended gun charge travels with it in addition to kidnaping the lower federal appellate courts have found venue proper based on the continuing nature of violations involving inter alia false statements 18 usc 1001 b wire fraud 18 usc1343 c mail fraud 18 usc 1341 d bank fraud 18 usc 1344 possession of controlled substances with the intent to distribute

other puzzle when is venue proper in any district in which the crimes effects are felt the court expressly declined to address the issue in rodriguezmoreno the government had argued venue may also be based on the effects of defendants conduct in another district and cited the lower court obstruction of justice nd hobbs act cases the hobbs act outlaws the

violence or extortion venue for hobbs act violation is generally considered proper in any district in which there is an obstruction of commerce yet obstruction is an element of the offense the act is drafted in such way that obstruction is arguably conduct element if so it would seem to provide little support for impact venue in the case of those crimes for whom the effect is not conduct element an earlier line of cases suggested that an obstruction of justice intimidation or bribery of witness bail jumping or the like might be tried in the district in which the proceedings were conducted even when the act of obstruction was committed elsewhere the line gave birth to suggestion that venue might be predicated upon the impact of the crime within particular district especially when the offense involved other substantial contacts with the district of victimization after rodriguezmoreno the courts continue to recognize an effects or substantial contacts test for venue but generally hold that the effect must also constitute conduct element under the statute defining the offense and that venue may not be based on elements of the offense which are not conduct elements mail and commerce cases the second paragraph of subsection 3237a expands the number of districts where prosecutions for offenses involving smuggling the mails or commerce may be brought to any district from through or into which commerce mail matter or an imported object or person moves the paragraph was added when title 18 of the united states code was revised in 1948 interstate transportation and mail cases had previously been resolved under the continuing offense language of the first paragraph discussed above professor wright has suggested that the paragraph stems from sreading of the supreme courts opinion in united states v johnson and that at its outer limits the paragraph may lie beyond constitutional expectations perhaps for this reason although the paragraph has been used under wide range of circumstances its invocation has not always been successful tax cases the tax provision subsection 3237b is in fact limited transfer provision under which the accused may opt for trial in the district in which he resided at the time when the alleged offense occurred the subsection was added in 1958 upon the view that prosecution in the district where return was received or due rather than the district in which the taxpayer resided visited inappropriate inconvenience and expense upon taxpayers their attorneys and witnesses the subsection is only available in the case of prosecutions under 26 usc 7203 willful failure to file return supply information or pay tax or if the government seeks to prosecute in district where venue exists solely because of mailing to the internal revenue

constitution recognizes that certain crimes like piracy may be committed beyond the geographical confines of any federal judicial district the application section now declares the trial of all offenses begun or committed upon the high seas or elsewhere out of the jurisdiction of any particular state or district shall be in the district in which the offender or any one of two or more joint offenders is arrested or is first brought but if such offender or offenders are not so arrested or brought into any district an indictment or information may be filed in the district of the last known residence of the offender or of any one of two or more joint offenders or if such residence is known the indictment or information may be filed in the district of columbia 18 usc 3238 there is second alternative venue statute for certain espionage related cases the trial for any offense involving violation begun or committed upon the high seas or elsewhere out of the jurisdiction of any particular state or district of 1 section 793 794 798 espionage or section 1030a1obtaining classified information by unauthorized computer access of this title 2 section 601 of the national security act of 1947

offenders residence is unknown if the offenders last address in this country is known section 3238 requires that the case be brought there or in the district in which the offender is first arrested or brought or any other district in which venue is otherwise proper but without more the option to bring an extraterritorial espionage case in the district of columbia is not necessarily available in all cases section 3239 changes that it affords the government the option to bring an exterritorial espionage case in the district columbia when it would otherwise be precluded from doing so section 3239s limited history suggests proponents may have initially had something else in mind it was enacted as section 320909 of the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 108 stat 2127 1994 the committee reports accompanying that legislation barely mention it the conference report acknowledges that it comes from the senate bill but says more there are senate reports the senate select committee on intelligence however had reported out bill with identical language the counterintelligence and security enhancements act of 1994 s 2056 the committees report indicates that the section
