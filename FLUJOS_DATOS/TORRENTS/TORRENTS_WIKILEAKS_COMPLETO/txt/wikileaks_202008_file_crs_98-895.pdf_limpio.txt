misdemeanors usconst art ii 4 the federalist papers 65 hamilton well constituted court for the trial of impeachments is an object not more to be desired than difficult to be obtained in gove rnment wholly elective the subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which pro ceed from the misconduct of public men or in other words from the abuse or violation of some public trust they are of nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated political as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself th prosecution of them for this reason will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accuse d in many cases it will connect itself with the preexisting factions and will inlist all their animosities partialities influence and interest on one side or on the other and in such cases there will always be the greatest danger that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of parties than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt t he federalist papers 39697 rossiter ed 1961 james wilsonhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98895crs2 impeachments were known in athens they were prosecuted for great and public offences by which the commonwealth was broug ht into danger they were not referred to any court of justice but were prosecute d before the popular asse mbly or before the senate of five hundred it is evident that in england impeachments could not exist before the separation of the two houses of parliament we find the commons appearing as the gra nd inquest of the nation about the latter end of the reign of edward the third they then began to exhibit accusations for crimes and misdemeanors against offe nders who were thought to be out of the reach of the ordinary power of the law in the united states and pennsylvania impeachments are confined to political haracters to political crimes and misdemeanors and to po litical punishments i works of james wilson 17901791 42526 1967 ed joseph story 785 as the offences to which the re medy of impeachment has been and will continue to be principally pplied are of political nature it is natural to suppose that they will be often exaggerated by party spirit and the prosecutions be sometimes dictated by party resentments as well as by sense of the public good there is danger therefore that in cases of conviction the punishment ma be wholly out of proportion to the offence and pressed as much by popular odium as by aggravated crime from the nature of such offences it is impossible to fix any exact grade or measure either in the offences or the punishments and very large discretion mu st unavoidably be vested in the court of impeachments as to both 796 the next inquiry is what are imp eachable offences they are treason bribery or other high crime s and misdemeanors for the finition of treason resort may be had to the constitution itself but for the definition of bribery resort is naturally and necessarily to the common law now ne ither the constitution nor any statute of the united states has in any manner defined an crimes except treason and bribery to be high crimes and misdemeanor nd as such impeachable it will not be sufficient to say that in the cases where any offence is punished by any statute of the united states it may and ought to be deemed an impeachable offence it is not every offence that by the constitution is so impeachable it must not only be an offence but high crime and misdemeanor 797 again there are many offences purel political which have been held to be within the reach of parliamentary impeachments not one of which is in the slightest manner alluded to in our statute book and i ndeed political offences are of so various and complex character so utterly incapable of being defined or classified that the task of positive legislation would be impracticable if it were not almost absurd to attempt it i story commentaries on the
