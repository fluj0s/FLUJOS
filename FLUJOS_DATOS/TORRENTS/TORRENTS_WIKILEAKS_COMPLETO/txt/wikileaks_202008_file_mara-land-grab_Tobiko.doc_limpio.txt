tobiko implicated in game reserve land grabbing scandal he is accused of defending the grabbing of 8000 acres draft article the director of public prosecutions dpp mr keraiko tobiko has been implicated in the grabbing of 8000 acres of maasai mara national game reserve and maasai mau forest along with tourist lodge in the game reserve letter by two clergymen to the local government permanent secretary mr solomon boit says mr tobiko has religiously defended the grabber livingstone ole ntutu and frustrated his prosecution for the fraudulent acquisition they are dismayed that an officer who is supposed to facilitate realisation of justice has become major impediment to the delivery of justice official records show that some 4000 acres replete with tourist lodge were irregularly hived off the maasai mara game reserve and allocated to ole ntutu under the disgraced guise of developer the allocation was subsequently annulled by the lands ministry and the narok county council was directed to rescind it that was never to be as ole ntutu with assistance of mr tobiko embarked on legal battle that close to decade has eluded judgement the clergymen rev david ole nkunun and pastor john ololmaitai dismiss ole ntutu as developer saying the grabber of the 4000 acres of the maasai mara national reserve and yet another more than 4000 acres of the maasai mau forest was not mere developer he was treasurer of the council but later sacked for this misconduct on 22nd february 2001 under minute 8 special full council committee meeting of 22nd february 2001 even after he was sacked ole ntutu never surrendered two extensive parcels of land he had grabbed the narok county council went to court to reclaim the forest land after its title was cancelled by the then commissioner of lands mr s k mwatta on instructions from the then head of the civil service mr richard leakey the case has been dragging in court since 2001 the 8000 acres make ole ntutu the biggest single grabber of public land in narok the clergymen in their letter dated april 12 2006 add though the head of the civil service had instructed the attorney general to reclaim the reserve land and the cabinet also directed on reclaiming of the forest land the effectiveness of these instructions is undermined by the presence of mr tobiko in that office he used to act for ole ntutu before he was appointed director of public prosecution on whom the onus to prosecute ntutu for fraud fell they accuse mr tobiko of making frantic efforts to improperly bail out ole ntutu from his criminal activities regarding the 4000 acres of mara game reserve they say very crucial witnesses to the prosecution of his client ole ntutu were stopped by his dpp prosecuting state counsel from testifying and the state counsel has not been made to account for the serious dereliction of duty they add that successful prosecution would have demystified the theory of first registration mr tobiko in order to cover up for the lack of it is aborting the prosecution evidence that evidence would show the grabbed land had not been adjudicated and never ceased to be public land the grabbing of the land is acknowledged by joint report of the ministries of local government and tourism and wildlife on the management of national game reserves dated april 2005 the report graphically lays bare the iniquities huge chunk of the maasai mara national reserve had been illegally curved out and dished to developer this was unprocedural as mara is gazetted entity protected by relevant statutes so should not have been encroached the council was advised to reestablish the boundaries of the reserve and acquire trust title deed to prevent encroachment local government minister mr musikari kombo subsequently directed that any lands grabbed from nationalgame reserves must be rcpossessed by respective local authorities with immediate effect as per the earlier directives issued on repossessing of public utility land the councils should reidentify the reserve boundaries and acquire trust title deeds in order to protect the reserves the ministers directive has been totally ignored the clergymens letter follows on the heels of an earlier one by the majority shareholders of olkiombo limited which owns the tourist lodge in the game reserve to the attorney general mr amos wako seeking his intervention and disclosing the intimate relationship between mr tobiko and ole ntutu the 14 shareholders say the dpp has compromised the prosecution of ole ntutu and land registrar who had been charged with fraud and forgery in connection with the grabbing of massive public land mr tobiko has been ole ntutus advocate against the protracted court cases over the grabbing of the land for almost decade the irreghular sub division of the land was hatched in 1997 by ole ntutu and the then narok principal land adjudication and settlement officer mr john oketch certificate of official search at the ministry of lands shows title deed for the land in the name of ilngina contractors limited of p box 289 narok was issued on september 9 1999 registrar generals office records show that ilngina contractors limited is owned by agnes naropil ntutu of p box 289 narok with 490 shares kiteleiki ntutu of the same address with similar number of votes and kunini ntutu with 20 shares the latter is however the boss on september 15 1999 mr tobiko wrote to narok county council regarding the allocation of land and on september 24 1999 extracted confirmation letter from then acting town clerk mr michael ole kiokai that mr tobikos client had been allocated the land the acting town clerk claimed the land was not part of any forest the speed at which the council and mr tobiko were determined to consummate the illicit grabbing surprised many and continues to generate considerable animosity between those out to protect public land and supporters of land grabbers the narok council was used to rubberstamp the grabbing by the ntutu family in may 2002 vide minute 2522002 of finance staff and general purpose committee meeting chaired by ole ntutu by proxy as treasurer the committees resolution was adopted by the full council on may 18 2002 olkiombo shareholders now say mr tobiko has joined ranks with sons of top narc ministers out to exploit the grabbed land for their own benefit along with the ntutu family at the exclusion of the local communities given the national concern over grabbed land political patronage is suspected to be in play the shareholders letter to the attorney general dated february 3 2006 expresses the deep resentment and the intrigues surrounding the grabbed land saying we are the majority shareholders of olkiombo limited which owns tourist lodge in maasai mara national reserve grabbed in circumstances stated as fraudulent by commissioner of lands in letter 224086 of october 6 2000 they further argue that olkiombos ownership is by grant no4453 of january 19 1990 accepted in hccc 5014 of 1990 land reference 13325 was granted through lawful process of setting apart the land the law says on subsequent adjudication of any such area the person for whose use and occupation it was set apart must be recorded as owner of the same the letter says the tourist lodge was fraudulently grabbed as were some 4000 acres of the game reserve without any attempt to adjudicate either the grabbed land or the lodge area resolution of narok county council dated july 12 2005 shows the grabbed land is 9 kilometres inside the reserve and is within lodges exclusivity area the grabber ole ntutu was at the time treasurer to narok county council and is brother to current narc government assistant minister ole ntutu the council declined ntutu demands in letter nccconfgrnolhii134 of september 15 2000 on may 9 2001 the head of the civil service richard leakey instructed the attorney general to ensure the grabbed land and lodge was returned ntutu and land registrar were later charged with fraud and forgery though attorney general took over the prosecution of the case the letter alleges that the office of the director of public prosecution dpp has compromised the prosecution it refers to an incident before the chief magistrate court where state counsel aborted the prosecution before seven crucial witnesses had testified the witnesses are listed as the investigation officer mr tanki and mr onyango whose signature they say was forged he was due to testify in january 2006 on return from america mr thiongo an officer who was in the district adjudication department he forwarded land adjudication records for parcels 1154 without adjudication record for the grabbed land parcel nonarokcis marai t alek155 and gave evidence in chief he was due for cross examination when case was closed allegedly for lack of witnesses and yet thiongo had been bonded to attend court on that day the other witness is mr tipapa ole sayialel who was to testify that the narok land adjudication committee chairman perjured by falsely stating the father of ntutu was member of the ranch the chairmans perjured statement was recorded by an advocate who was employed by the director of public prosecutions private chambers two police witnesses and the registrar of group representatives the latter to produce the group register of members to show ole ntutus father was not member failed to be called the letter tells the ag you may see the department of public prosecutions was hellbent to exclude any evidence which was favourable to the prosecution we see this as move by mr keriako tobiko to bail out his client ntutu the dpp acted for ntutu and his company iingina contractors ltd in transaction which involved illegal excision and registration of mau forest trust land the forest land parcel is narokcis maraololulungal9470 comprising 136170 hectares transferred by ntutu on july 13 1999 to his company iingina contractors limited owned by him his wife and mother title 9470 was subdivided into parcels no9678 to 9681 according to search dated september 9 1999 the dpp while in private practice acted for ntutu and his company in connection with subdivision narokcis maraololulunga l9678 and wrote to the council on september 5 1999 which was replied by letter ncclmvolxviiii36 september 24 1999 dpp inquired if parcel no9678 formed part of the forest land though the council seems to say it is not forest area subsequent investigations showed this was cover up to which argues the letter regrettably the dpp was deeply involved the grabbed land of the reserve was registered in circumstances similar to registration of parcel narokcis mara ololulungal9470 of the forest land the council by letter nonccconflmvol1i152 of september 11 2001 said parcel no9470 out of which parcel no9678 was curved from is part of the forest land the report of the commission on illegalirregular allocation of public land also confirms this blatant fraud the dpp and ole ntutu knew that doubt mr gathenji claims the letter had warned the prosecuting counsel not to prosecute the case that came to be in court when mr mwangi was castigated for not taking the prosecution seriously the obedience to mr gathenji order culminated in the abrupt premature closure of the prosecution case some evidence in ole ntutus criminal case have been destroyed alleged the letter original adjudication record was sold by retired chief inspector mr wafula to ole ntutu the file is on your desk for direction to prosecute one saitoti ole kiok confidant of ntutu confided the fact of purchase of the documents to one tobiko ole kiok the writers want the case to begin afresh and be prosecuted by someone not under dpp whose personal interest clash with the interest of justice they say the costs can be discussed as evidence show it is government officials that continue to be susceptible to manipulability by dpp and ntutu they argue that losing portion of the game reserve on account of official grand corruption has its local and international politics and ramifications we as owners of the grabbed land will demand the reserves adjudication and will not leave it to few powerful and strategically placed like the dpp the tourism industry will not countenance corruption making nonsense of its policy the maasai argue that nolle prosque will meet the ends of justice in view of governments assurances to punish grabbers of public land they add that neither absence of nolle prosque nor pending civil cases are an option the civil courts are not fool proof to manipulation and have been manipulated before that they are in court unmaking past manipulations says lot of the system of justice this criminal case ruling will be used to give boost to manipulation in the civil courts the letter is endorsed by samuel soitanae ole koriata shadrack koitamet ole rotiken kepeen ole sayalel partoti ole sengeny tapeet ole tira family of late njaanga ololoigero family

documentary evidence accompanying the two letters show clearly how the public land was grabbed and how several government orders to repossess it have been ignored and frustrated through the courts the authors see mr tobikos hand threading the frustration and abeting the grabbing
