protection and feeding of the segmen ts of its population that had been subjected to and fled from gross human rights viola tions inflicted by the iraqi government although iraq was still subject to

resolution 1284 1999 creating new inspections mechanism the monitoring verification and inspection commission unmovic which until 2002 had not been able to operate within iraq during this time the council did not specifically authorize the further use of force to ensure iraqi compliance with resolution 687 1991 or any of its subsequent resolutions it did however refer to previously adopted resolutions including resolution 678 1990 and resolution 687 1991 iraq and the security council 2002 on november 8 2002 after nearly two m onths of consultation negotiation and debate the security council by vote of 1500 adopted resolution 1441 20024 in this resolution the council decided 1 to give iraq which has been and remains in material breach of resolutions final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations and 2 to set up an enhanced in spection regime it decided that iraq shall providea currently accurate full and complete declaration of all aspects of its programs to develop chemical biological and nuclear weapons ba llistic missiles and other delivery systems by december 85 it decided that false statements or omissions in the declarations s ubmitted and f ailure by iraq at any time to comply with and cooperate fully in the implementation of this resolution shall constitute further material breach and will be reported to the council for assessment the council

which they wish to inspect as well as immediate unimpeded unrestricted and private access to all officials and other persons whom unmovic or the iaea wish to interview the council directed unmovic and iaea to report immediately to the council any interference by iraq with in spection activities as well as any failure by iraq to comply with its disarmament obliga tions in addition the council decided that it would convene immediately upon receipt of report relating to iraqi noncompliance and recalled in that context that it had re peatedly warned iraq that it will face serious consequences as result of its conti nued violations of its obligations on september 12 2002 president bush in his address to the general assembly had focused on iraq and its failure to comply w ith various resolutions adopted by the security council he urged th security council to act in the face of such repeated violations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21323crs5 my nation will work with the security council to meet our common challenge if iraqs regime defies us again the world must move deliberately decisively to hold iraq to account we will work with the security council for the necessary resolutions the security council resolu tions will be enforced the just demands of peace and security will be met or action will be unavoidable the question of the situation between ir aq and kuwait is still on the councils agenda the council considers the situa tion under number of topics including biannual review of conti nuation of the iraqkuwait observation mission unikom the annual report of the reso lution 661 sanctions committee the oil for food program report is requi red every 90 days and the quarterly report of the monitoring verification and inspection commission unmovic among the issues that faced council member s as they worked to draft what became sres1441 2002 in response to presiden t bushs request were the following what inspection regime will apply the preresolution 1441 2003 set of council resolutions included approval of the 1998 memorandum of understanding on access to presidentia l palaces in iraq and the 1999 establishment of unmovic that incl uded an extensive or some would say expansive timetable for the conduct of inspections iraqs september 16 2002 acceptance of inspectors wit hout conditions and us demands for inspectors to go anywhere anytime see anyone inspect anything at the time and place of the inspectors choosing would seem to require an additional resolution to revise in spection access some countries however seemed to prefer that additional council resolution be passed should deadline for iraqi compliance either with council resolutions or with unconditional inspections be set by the council before inspections start when should the council authorize actions that might be taken if iraq did not comply before or after the inspections phase some nations including the united states sought consequences authorization as part of single resolution on inspections and iraqi compliance while others preferred twostage process with specific authorization of force or its equivalence after inspections had been given chance to work iraq and the security council in 2003 during most of the first quarter of the year members of the security council continued to review the work of the unmovi c and iaea as briefe d and reported by the chief
