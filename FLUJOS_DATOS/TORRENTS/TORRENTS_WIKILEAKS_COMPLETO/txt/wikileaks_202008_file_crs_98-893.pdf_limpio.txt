blackstone the high court of parlia ment which is the supreme court in the kingdom not only for the making but also for the execu tion of laws by the trial of great and enormous offenders whether lords or co mmoners in the met hod of parliamentary impeachment as for acts of parliament to attaint particular persons of treason or felony or to inflict pains and penalties beyond or contrary to the common law to serve special purpose i speak not of th em being to all inte nts and purposes new laws made pro re nata and by means an execution of such as are already in being but an impeachment before the lords of the commons of great britain in parliament is prosecution of the alread known and establishe d law and has been frequently put in practice being presen t to the most high and supreme court of criminal jurisdiction by the most solemn grand inquest of the whole kingdom commoner cannot however be impeached befo re the lords for any capital offence but only for high misdemeanor peer may be impeached for any crime iv blackstone commentaries on the laws of england 256 1769 transliteration suppliedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98893crs2 although the phrase had apparently beco fairly common in impeachment cases by then blackstone makes reference to the phrase high crimes and misdemeanors he does nevertheless provide detailed outline of the classification of crimes in his day we are now arrived at the fourth and last branch of these commentaries which treats of public wrongs or crimes and misdemeanor for we may remember that in the beginning of the preceding volume wrongs were divided into two sorts or species the one private and the other public private wrongs which are frequently termed civil injuries were the subject of that entire book we are now therefore lastly to proceed to the considera tion of public wrongs or crimes and misdemeanors i d at 1 crime or misdemeanor is an act committed or mitted in violation of public law either forbidding or co mmanding it this general definition comprehends both crimes nd misdemeanors which pr operly speaking are mere synonymous terms though in common usage the word crimes is made to denote such offences as are of deeper and more atrocious dye while smaller faults and omissions of less consequence are comprised under the gentler name of misdemeanors only the distinction of public wrongs fro m private of crimes and misdemeanor from civil injuries seems principally to consist in this that private wrongs or civil injuries are an infringement or privation of the civil rights which belong to individuals considered merely as indi viduals public wrongs or crimes and misdemeanors are breach and violation of the public rights and duties due to the whole community considered as community in its social aggregate capacity treason murder and robbery are properly ranked among crimes since besides the injury done to individuals they strike at the very being of society which cannot possibly subsist where actions of this sort are suffered to escape with impunity in all cases the crimes include an injury every public offence is also private wrong and somewhat more it affects the individual and it likewise affects the community id at 5 the third general division of crimes after offenses against god and offenses against the law of nations consists of such as more especially affect the supreme executive power or the king and his gove rnment which amount either to total renunciation of that allegiance or at the least to criminal neglect of that duty which is due from every subject to his s overeign every offence therefore more immediately affecting the royal person his crown or dignity is in some degree breach of this duty of allegiance whether natural and innate or local and acquired by residence and these may be distingu ished into four kinds 1 treason 2 felonies injurious to the kings prerogative 3 praemunire 4 other misprisions and contempts treason imports betraying treachery or breach of faith it therefore happens only between allies faith the mirror for treason is indeed general appellation made use of by th law to denote not only offe nces against the king and government but also that accumulation of gu ilt which arises whenever superior reposes confidence in subject or in ferior between whom and himself there subsists natural civil or even spiritual relation and the inferior so abuses that confidence so forgets the obligations of duty subjection and allegiance as to destroy the life of any such his superior or lord id at 745httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98893crs3 felony in the general acceptation of our english law comprizes every species of crime which occasioned at common law the forfeiture of lands or goods this most frequently happens in those crimes for which capital punishment either is or was liable to be inflicted treason itself was antiently comprised under the name of felony id at 94 the fourth species of offences more immediately against the king and government are intitled misprisions and contempts misprisions term derived from the old french mespris neglect or contempt are in the acceptation of our law generally understood to be all such high offences as are under the degree of capital but nearly bordering thereon and it is said that misprision is contained in every treason and felony whatsoever misprisions are generally divided into tw sorts negative which consist in the concealment of something which ought to be revealed and positive which consist in the commission of something which ought not to be done of the first or negative kind is what is called misprision of treason consisting in the bare knowledge and concealment of treason without any degree of assent thereto id at 11920 misprisions which are merely positive are generally denominated contempts or high misdemeanors of which the first and principal is the maladministration of such high offices as are in public trust and employment this is usually punished by the method of parliamentary impeachment wherein such pe nalties short of d eath are inflicted as to the wisdom of the house of peers sh all seem proper consisting usually of banishment imprisonment fines or perpetual disability id at 121 lastly to endeavor to dissuade witness from giving evidence to disclose an examination before the priv council or to advise pr isoner to stand mute all of which are impediments to justice are high misprisions and contempts of the kings courts and punishable by fi ne and imprisonment the order of our distribution will next lead us to take into consideration such crimes and misdemeanors as more especially affect the commonwealth or public polity of the kingdom the crimes and misdemeanors that more especially affect the common wealth may be divided into five species viz offences against public justice against the public peace against public trade against public health and against the public police or oeconomy of each of which we will take cursory view in their order first then of the offences against public justice some of which are felonious whose punishment may extend to death ot hers only misdemeanors i shall begin with those that are most penal and descend gradually to such as are of less malignity id at 12628 16 the next offence against public justice is when the suit is past its commencement and come to trial and that is the crime of wilful and corrupt perjury which is defined by sir edward coke to be crime committed when lawful oath is administered in some judicial proceeding to person who swears wilfully absolutely and falsely in matter material to the issue or point in question subornation of perjury is the offence of proc uring another to take such falsehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98893crs4 oath as constitutes perjury in the prin cipal the punishment of perjury and subornation at common law has been various it was antiently death afterwards banishment or cutting out the tongue and th forfeiture of goods and now it is fine and imprisonment and never more to be capable of bearing testimony 17 bribery is the next species of offe nce against public justice which is when judge or other person concerned in th administration of justice takes any undue reward to influence his behavior in his office id at 13639 wooddeson in the last lecture two distinct modes of criminal prosecution were reserved for future inquiry namely proceedings on imp eachments and penal acts of parliament occasionally passed against particular offenders the former is designed to occupy our present consideration it is certain that magistrates and officers intrusted with the administration of public affairs may abuse their delegated powers to the extensive detriment of the community and at the same time in manner not properly cognizable before the ordinary tribunals the influence of ch delinquents and the nature of such offences may not unsuitably engage the au thority of the highest court and the wisdom of the sagest assembly the commons therefore as the grand inquest of the nation become suitors for penal justice and they cannot consistently either with their own dignity or with safety to the accused sue elsewhere but to those who share with them in the legislature on this policy is founded the origin of impeachments which began soon after the constitution assumed its present form in the year 1321 all the kings subjects are impeachable in parliament but with this distinction that peer may be so accused before his peers of any crime commoner tho perhaps it was formerly otherwise can now be charged with misdemeanors only not with any capital offence for when fitzharris in the year 1681 was impeached of high treason the lords re mitted the prosecution to the inferior court tho it greatly exasperated the accusers such kind of misdeeds however as peculiarly injure the commonwealth by the abuse of high offices of trust are the most proper and have been the most usual grounds for this kind of prosecution thus if lord chancellor be guilty of bribery or of acting grossly contrary to the duty of his office if the judges mislead their sovereign by unconstitutional opinions if any other magistrate attempt to subvert the funda mental laws or introduce arbitrary power these have been deemed cases adapted to parliament ary inquiry and decision so where lord chancellor has been thought to have put th seal to an ignominious treaty lord admiral to neglect the safeguard of the sea an ambassador to betray his trust privy counselor to propound or support pernici ous and dis honorable measures or confidential advisor of his sovereign to obtain exorbitant grants or incompatible employments these imputations have properly occasioned impeachments because it is apparent how little the ordinary tribunals are calcu lated to take cognizance of such offences or to investigate and reform the general polity of the state 2
