points the signing of the peace accord was preceded by two key events the departure from liberia on august 11 2003 of charles taylor who resigned from the presidency and went into exile in nigeria

presiden cy as head of caretaker government pending the swearing in of the ntgl several developments appear to have motivated taylors decision to leave these include the possibility that if he did not accept nigerias asylum offer he would have faced immediate extradition to sierra leone to answer international war crimes charges see below continuing military gains by lurd and model and lurds

the formation of lurd was motivated by its members mutual opposition to what they viewed as pers istent pattern of ethnic bias political exclusion human rights abuses and co rruption under taylor

impact on daily life and economic activities of generally rising insecurity as the conflict grew rebel forces gradually seized more territory and held it for increasingly long periods notably in 2003

combatants when the program began in middecember plans called for twostage payment of 300 to disarming combatants th first 150 installment to be paid after initial induction into the ddrr process when disarming combatants learned that they would not receive onthe spot paym ents upon surrendering their weapons they rioted and looted in and near the cap ital although the unrest was successfully suppressed and unmil announced that it would pay each disarming fighter 75 in exchange for their weapon upon entrance into the cantonment site the ddrr process was halted pending furt her planning other factor s that contributed to this outcome included series of public criticisms of ddrr plans lurds initial opposition to the establishment of ddrr camp in its territory and the publicly

second some observers fear that the former armed factions may be questering significant caches of weapons which might facilitate return to armed conflict if liberias weak political institutions fail to mediate competing interests they point to unmil s seizure of multiple weapons on several occasions as possible evid ence for such claims similar concerns have been expressed with regard to the lowerthan anticipated number of heavy weapons being surrendered there have been periodic though unconfirmed reports that former taylor loyalists may be attempting to recruit and train fighters in southern guinea possibly in order to incite rebellion ag ainst that countrys government which opposed that of taylor there have also been reports that some weapons from liberia have been smuggled out

plans call for the payment of demobilization stipends nearly three times as large as those being offered in liberia related matter of conten tion arises because although not all disarmed ex combatants

handover of arms is not presently official policy unmil is reportedly considering requiring male combatants to turn in weapon while exempting disa rming female and child combatants from such an

government detain and tran sfer him to sierra leone for prosecution ghana claimed nonreceipt of scsls request and taylor abruptly returned to liberia reportedly on ghanaian state aircraft the indictment was seen as weakening taylors stature and bargaining power the following day lurd mounted fierce assault on monrovia in an apparent bid to gain prenegotiation military superiority the attack and the initial failure of model to send delegation to ghana temporarily postponed the talks lurd threatened to withdraw from the talks if taylor who lurd labeled war criminal did not resign

law some policy makers and observers viewing the need for peace as paramount saw taylors extradition to sierra leone as less pressing objective than resolution of th war in liberia and the formation

expedient and implicitly leave the future disposition of his case subject to legal d ecisions by the special court and decisions by the nigerian government51 other observers including some members of
