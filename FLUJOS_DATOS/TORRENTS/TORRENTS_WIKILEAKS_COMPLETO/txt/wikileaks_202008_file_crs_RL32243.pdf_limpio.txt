points the signing of the peace accord was preceded by two key events the departure from liberia on august 11 2003 of charles taylor who resigned from the presidency and went into exile in nigeria

accept nigerias asylum offer he would have faced immediate extradition to sierra leone to answer international war crimes charges see below continuing military gains by lurd and model and lurds

the formation of lurd was motivated by its members mutual opposition to what they viewed as pers istent pattern of ethnic bias political exclusion human rights abuses and co rruption under taylor

impact on daily life and economic activities of generally rising insecurity as the conflict grew rebel forces gradually seized more territory and held it for increasingly long periods notably in 2003 but the military situation was often fluid belligerents territorial control was limited and transitory fighting often focused on provisioning looting and harassment raids and often targeted displaced

constitute threat to international peace and security in liberia and the re gion sres1521 banned for one year the export to liberia for any recipient of all arms military materiÃ©l and technical

having taken note of ntgl request that sanctions on libe rias timber and diamonds be lifted the security council decided to reestablish panel of experts and mandated that it assess general compliance

preparing to deploy to liberia it did authorize unamsil to provide logistical support fo r 30 days to ecowas for the purpose of fielding the force that subsequently b ecame known as ecomil the term

combatants when the program began in middecember plans called for twostage payment of 300 to disarming combatants th first 150 installment to be paid after initial induction into the ddrr process when disarming combatants learned that they would not receive onthe spot paym ents upon surrendering their weapons they rioted and looted in and near the cap ital although the unrest was successfully

other factor s that contributed to this outcome included series of public criticisms of ddrr plans lurds initial opposition to the establishment of ddrr camp in its territory and the publicly

second some observers fear that the former armed factions may be questering significant caches of weapons which might facilitate return to armed conflict if liberias weak political institutions fail to mediate competing interests they point to unmil s seizure of multiple weapons on several occasions as possible evid ence for such claims similar concerns have been expressed with regard to the

plans call for the payment of demobilization stipends nearly three times as large as those being offered in liberia related matter of conten tion arises because although not all disarmed ex combatants

handover of arms is not presently official policy unmil is reportedly considering requiring male combatants to turn in weapon while exempting disa rming female and child combatants from such an

expedient and implicitly leave the future disposition of his case subject to legal d ecisions by the special court and decisions by the nigerian government51 other observers including some members of
