and make changes to the effort passed the house1 program description the small business innovation research pr ogram is designed to increase the participation of small high technology firm s in the federal rd ndeavor congressional support for the initiative was predicated upon the belief that while technologybased companies under 500 employees tended to be highly innovative and innovation is essential to the economic wellbeing of th united states these businesses were under represented in government rd activities agency sbir programs guarantee this sector portion of the governments rd budget to compensate for what was viewed as preference for contracting with large firms current law requires that every federal department with an rd budget of 100 million or more establish and operate an sbir program set percentage of that agencys applicable extramural research and deve lopment budget originally at 125 now at 25 is to be used to support missi onrelated work in small

pilot effort to encourage commercializa tion of university nd federal laboratory rd by small companies was created by pl 102564 and reaut horized several times through fy2009 the small business

of 03 of the extramural rd budg et of departments that spend over 1 billion per year on this effort the departments of energy defense and health and human services nasa and ns f participate in the sttr program implementation the government accountability office gao formerly the general accounting office is legislatively directed to assess the implementation of the small business innovation development act as amended and has issued ries of reports documentinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96402crs3 its findings 1987 study fo und that both the ev aluation and selection processes were sufficient to reasonably insure awards were based on technical merit it was also determined that the majority of agencies were not awarding phase i grants and contracts within the sixmonth time frame required by the sba guidelines another gao report the following month surveyed the participants and noted that most were generally satisfied with the administration of sbir programs in 1989 gao reported that agency heads found th sbir effort to be beneficial and met the organizations rd needs most indicated that the sbir programs had developed new research areas placed more emphasis on the application of research results and led to wider use of small busin esses as research performers the study concluded that projects were for the most part of high quality at dod and nasa however sbir efforts stressed rd to meet agency mission requirements in contrast to other sbir programs that focused on commercia lization for private sector markets all of the departments stated that sbir projects when compared with other research activities had greater potential to re sult in new products and processes testimony presented by gao in 1991 stated that the program clearly is doing what congress asked it to do in achieving commerc ial sales and developmental funding from the private sector an sba study found that approximately one in four sbir projects will result in the sale of new commercial products or pr ocesses another gao report issued in may 1992 noted that despite s hort time frame and the fact that many sbir projects had not had sufficient time to ma ture into marketable technologies and techniques the program is showing success in phase iii activity as of july 1991 almost twothirds of the projects alread had sales or recei ved additional funding primarily from the private secto r totaling approximately 11 billion the 1992 study also identified several i ssues for possible further congressional exploration according to gao dod placed less emphasis on co mmercialization than other agencies and utilized the sbir program primarily to address the departments rd needs questions were raised about th requirements for competitive bidding when companies looked to federa l departments for phase iii contracts after ccessfully completing phases i and ii gao noted that clarification of the competition in contracting act of 1984 as am ended might be necessary in addition there was disagreement over whether the federal agency or the small firm should continue to work on technology development after the cessa tion of sbir project funding gao also concluded that firms receiving multiple phas ii awards tended to have lower phase iii sales and less additiona l developmental support the reas ons for this remained unclear but the suggestion was made that these co mpanies may have focused on securing funds through sbir awards rather than through commercialization of their rd results march 1995 gao report found that multiple phase ii funding had become problem particularly at nsf nasa and dod among the reasons cited were the failure of companies to identify identical pr oposals made elsewhere in violation of the mandatory certification procedur uncertainty in definitions and guidelines concerning similar research and lack of interagenc mechanisms to exchange information on projects several recomme ndations were made to ddress duplication gao testimony presented in march 1996 indicated that the sba had taken steps to implement these suggestions the study also determined that the quality of research appeared to have kept pace with the programs expansion alt hough it was still too early to make ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96402crs4 definitive judgment factors supporting this assessment included the substantive level of competition more proposals deemed meritorious than could be funded by agencies and appraisals by depar tmental sbir personnel indicating the high quality of submissions another gao study released in april 1998 noted that between 35 and 50 of sbir projects had resulted in sa or additional private sector investment despite earlier indications of problems associated with multiple award winners this report found that such firms have similar commerc ialization rates as single aw ardees critical technology lists were being used to determine agency solicitations and there was little evidence of participation by foreign firms while several agencies had new programs to assure continuity in funding there were indications of possible inaccuracies in defining the extramural rd budgets upon whic h the setaside is based the june 1999 gao analysis reported that sbir awards tend to be concentrated both geographically and by firm spite widespread participation in the program the 25 most frequent winners which re present fewer than 1 percent of the companies in the program received about 11 percent of th programs awards from fiscal year 1983 through fiscal year 1997 businesses in sm all number of states pa rticularly california and massachusetts were awarde d the most number of projects the study also noted that while commercial potential is considered by all agencies each has developed different evaluation approaches other goals including innovation and responsiveness to agency mission still remain important in determining awards more recent report by gao june 2005 found that it is still difficult to adequately assess the performance of the sbir program although the effort appears to be achieving its goal of enhanced participation of small business in the rd enterprise utilizing commercialization as measure may not be sufficient because other agency goals were being met such as research needs or ex panded innovation succe ss in the commercial market did not take into account the r d requirements of partments like dod or nasa in report the following year october 2006 gao noted that the agencies reporting to the sba did not always provide th necessary data in the format required by sba gao concluded that the agencies need to strengthen their efforts to improve the completeness consistency and accuracy of awards data gao also has evaluated the sttr progra m january 1996 report found that in general federal agencies fa vorably rated the quality of wi nning proposals in the first year and that most projects had commercial potentia l although the costs might be high the government had taken steps to avoid poten tial conflicts of interest between federal laboratories and depa rtmental headquarters there was indication that this pilot effort was competing for proposals with the estab lished sbir activity or reducing the quality of the agencies rd in general instead it was credited for encouraging collaborative work yet gao noted that because the prog rams are so similar there are questions whether or not separate activity is necessary any real evaluation of success in technology transfer however could not be acco mplished for several years because of the time needed to bring the results of rd to the commercial marketplace these findings were reiterated in stimony given by gao in may and september 1997 june 2001 gao study of all companies which received sttr awards between fy1995 and fy1997 noted the participants belie f that both the firms and the research institutions contributed to expanded rd althoug h the private sector was more influentialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96402crs5 in determining the direction of the res earch the companies reporte d about 132 million in total sales and about 53 million in additional developmental funding they identified 41 new patents and the creation of 12 new spinoff firms further the awardees preferred that the sttr program remain separate from the sbir activity awards from its inception in

to be reauthorized initially debate centered on the use of setaside proponents urged its use to guarantee participation of sma ll firms in federal rd contracts while opponents argued that set aside interferes with normal market effici ency and circumvents the congressional budget process used to determine progra m priorities and budg et allotments existing regulations require at least 51 ow nership by an individual or individuals however some experts argue participation by small firms that are majorityowned by venture capital companies should be permitted proponent s of this change maintain that particularly in the biotechnology sector the most innovative companies are not able to use the sbir program because they do not meet this ownership criteria opponents of altering the eligibility requirements argue that the program is designed to provide financial assistance where venture capital is not available they assert that the programs objective is to bring new concepts to the point wher private sector investment is feasible an additional concern is the extent to which program participants are mandated to report activities and results pl 106554 placed added requirements on companies to provide information it remains to be determined if these requirements have been successfully implemented other issues that might be addressed include whether the problems identified by gao associated w ith the duplication of awards has been adequately resolved are the sbir and sttr programs meeting their different mandated objectives or are they serving an identical purpose does the focus on commercialization raise concerns by those who argue that the government has role in directly supporting industrial research and development these and other questions may be explored as the 110th congress considers possible reauthoriz ation of the small business innovation research program
