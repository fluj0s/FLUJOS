cancelled all leave effective june 28 9 snf dstiaita would like to note the series of reports are consistent with other recent threat reporting indicating the possibility of insurgent groups and militias preparing to increase attacks in anticipation of troop withdrawal from urban areas it is possible that extremistaffiliated groups would seek to target the iz and the victory base complex as the venues are symbolic of the us diplomatic and military presence in iraq it is also plausible the groups may surmise that large attack against cf troops in these areas would be ideal as it would serve as propaganda for them allowing them to take credit for driving out occupying forces 10 snf dstiaita would also highlight the allegation of the existence of the weapons cache as the materials

attacks illustrate willingness and capability to target western citizens and diplomatic facilities highlighted by the brazen attack against us embassy sanaa in midseptember 2008 the lack of hostnation
