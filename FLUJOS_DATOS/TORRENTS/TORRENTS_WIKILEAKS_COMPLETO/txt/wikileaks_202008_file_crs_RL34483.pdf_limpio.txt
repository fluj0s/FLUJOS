relate to funding for the basic center program transitional living program and street outreach program requirements for grantees that receive bcp and tlp grants and accountability of programs and activities authorized under rhya funding pl 110378 authorizes fy 2009 appropriation levels for the bcp tlp and related act ivities that exceed the levels authorized for fy2004 by 35 million these are the only recent years for which congress has speci fied authorized appropriation levels the law also increases the authorized annual minimum levels of bcp funding available for states and territories it further requires hhs to reallocate unused bcp funds from one state to another the amount allocated to states for fy2009 and fy2010 may not be lower than the amount appropriated to the states in fy2008 requirements pl 110378 allows youth to remain in program funded under the bcp and tlp longer they were able to under the prior law although the law imposes additional criteria for youth who stay longer at tlpfunded programs the law also changes the definition of homeless youth to permit youth older than age 18 and 22 to stay at bcp and tlpfunde d programs respectively but only under certain circumstances another change made by the law specifies that in funding grants for research and other projects related to runaway and homeless outh hhs is to give priority to applicants that

details of these provisions funding authorization of appropriations the prior law pl 10896 to reaut horize the runaway and homeless youth act authorized funding for all parts3 of the runaway and homeless youth act except the street outreach program at 105 million for fy2004 and such sums as may be necessary for fy2005 through fy 2008 the street outreach program was authorized to receive such sums as may be necessary for fy2004 through fy2008 for all parts of rhya except the sop and the new incidence and prevalence study provisions the reconnecting home less youth act of 2008 authorizes

that have not been obligated before th end of fiscal year for state to the other states the law does not specify the criteria for reallotting the funds the new law does not change the funding structure for the transitional living program and street outreach program funds for these programs are allocated competitively by hhs to communitybased organizations requirements pl 110378 changes program requirements re lated to 1 the length of time that youth are eligible to stay in basic cent er program and trans itional living program facilities 2 the definition of homeless youth and

authorizes longer periods in which youth may stay at program funded by the bcp or tlp current regulation specifies that youth may remain at bc p shelter for up to 15 days however pl 110378 permits youth to stay at shelter for up to 21 days the new law continues to allow youth to remain at tlp projects fo r up to 540 days 18 months or longer for youth under age 18 and adds that youth ma remain in the program for continuous period of 635 days approx imately 21 months under ex ceptional circumstances this term means circumstances in which youth would benefit to an unusual extent from additional time in the program the new law further authorizes that youth in tlp who has not reached age 18 on the last day of the 635day period may in exceptional circumstances and if otherwise qualified for the program remain in the program until his or her 18th birthday definition of hom eless youth and runaway youth under the law as it existed prior to the enactment of the reconnecting homeless youth act of 2008 homeless youth for purposes of the bcp was defined as an individual younger than age 18 for whom it is not possible to live in safe environment with relative and for whom other safe alternative living arrangement exists pl 110378 amends the first clause to define homeless youth as an individual younger than age 18 or an older maximum age if the bcp center is located in state or locality with law or regulation that permits this higher age for purposes of the tlp the prior law defined homeless youth as an individual age 16 through 21 for whom it is not possible to live in safe environment with relative and for whom other safe alternative living arrangement exists pl 110378 changes the first clause of the defin ition to include an individual ages 16 through 22 or an age exceeding 22 years old on the last day the youth is permitted under law to be at the shelter so long as the participant enters the tlp project priorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34483crs5 4 it is not clear whether the language will change the way tlp applicants subcontract services for runaway and homeless youth if at all prior grant applications for the bcp tlp and sop have asked applicants to submit information about any subgrants or contracts with other entities that provide services to runaway and homeless youth 5 the law does not define how this plan s hould be carried out or what is considered adequateto reaching age 22 as mentioned above pl 110378 permits stay of 540 days or up to 635 days if the youth would grea tly benefit from being in the program finally under current regula tion runaway youth is defined as person under age 18 who absents himself or herself fro m home or place of legal residence without the permission of his or her family pl 110378 enacts similar language that defines runaway youth as an individual who leav home or place of re sidence without the permission of his or her parent or legal guardian bcp and tlp plans as required under the previous law app licants for tlp funding were required to submit plan to the hhs secretary specifying that they would provide directly or indirectly shelter and services among ot her types of assistance the

to the priority areas for awarding grants for research evaluation demonstration and service projects concerning runaway and homeless youth under the prior law hhs could prioritize projects that addressed one of nine priority areas pl 110378 modi fies the language regarding two of these priority areas for one of the priority areas regarding access to quality health care the law changes the reference from projects addressing mental health care to projects addressing behavioral health care for the other priority area regarding access to education the law adds that the project s should decrease high school dropout rates increase rates of attaining secondary school diploma or its recognized equivalent or increase placement and retention in postsecondary education or advanced workforce training programs the law also inserts as tenth priority area projects that assist youth in obtaining and maintaining safe and stable housing finally pl 110 378 makes change pertaining to
