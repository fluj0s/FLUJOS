from tom wigley wigleymeekerucaredu to mike hulme mhulmeueaacuk subject re new magiccscengen date mon 9 feb 1998 154815 0700 mst replyto tom wigley wigleymeekerucaredu cc hm_pitcherpnlgov obrownueaacuk mike thanks for the quick response responses to responses follows 1 i tried the composite ghg plus uiuc sul on norms machine in just the way you said however the results for the usa seem to be identical to those using only uiuc ghg input ill try again 2 you are right in saying one shouldnt scale ghg patterns by ghgsul dts however to be strictly consistent one should never allow ghg patterns to be used alone so you are not being consistent if you allow thiswhich you do the point then is to minimize the extent of the inconsistency it is unarguably correct that the globalmean temperature to use is the one containing all forcings ie column 6 in driveout the choice then is what patterns to use if we had sul information we would have to use ghg patterns as in the original scengen scaling these with the magicc ghg output would give both incorrect patterns and incorrect globalmean warming scaling with column 6 at least gets the globalmean warming correct within magicc uncertainties you seem to have chosen to get both things wrong instead of just the patterns i can see some logic in your method i just think strongly that it is wrong at the very least it will be confusing to the user if the user selects only ghg model patterns then wont they wonder why the globalmean temperature is inconsistent with magicc to take an extreme case suppose the full dt is 2degc and the ghgalone dt is 3degc is it better to scale an approximate pattern ie the ghg pattern by 2degc or 3degc in my view ghg scaled by 2degc would be much closer to ghgsul scaled by 2degc than ghg scaled by 3degc surely the real issue given that it is impossible to be entirely consistent in this case is to get result that is as close to the right result as possible i feel quite sure that scaling by column 6 is best on this basisespecially given that the patterns are much more uncertain than the globalmeans i think this is absolutely beyond doubt the bottom line here is that consistency is impossible if one uses only ghg patterns column 6 was included deliberately and after some thought along the lines noted above of course it is possible to get column 6 results by adding columns 2 3 4 and 5 as they now stand and as they are in the version that you have however one cannot do this with the correct raw column 3 4 and 5 output because of the nonlinear direct forcing effect it just happens that in your version i faked up column 5 as the difference between column 6 and the sum of columns 2 3 and 4 i did this simply to get the code working but as you now know i never got around to fixing it up until now in the latest version column 6 is again equal to the sum of columns 2 3 4 and 5 because i scale columns 3 4 and 5 to ensure that this is so 3 re hadcm2 again it is impossible to be consistent what i said before is that the reason for adding these results is simply to make them readily available i do not advocate using them in combination with any other model results it is i believe perfectly reasonable to scale these results with column 6 data of course this hides an assumption about the relative magnitudes of the ghg and sul componentsie it assumes that the hadcm2 relative magnitudes are okay the point of scaling however is to account for other factors that change the globalmean temperature relative to hadcm2 results such as different sensitivities i agree with you that it would not be an efficient use of time splitting the hadcm2 sul results into ghg and aerosol component patterns the whole point of the sulphate part of scengen is to look at the influence of different so2 emissions patterns splitting up hadcm2 wouldnt help here at all i also think it would be valueless to hardwire hadcm2 dt results into scengenagain this would defeat the purpose of including these results it would introduce an additional inconsistency since hadcm2 patterns change with time it would not be logical to scale the 20712100 pattern with eg 20312060 dt of course you could argue that it is illogical to scale this pattern with eg 203160 dt from magicc but this is different issue that i dont think is worth discussing at this time 4 thanks for explaining the uiuc other data problem i will ask michael whether he can provide full global fields for the other variables since it really would be valuable to include them if he can give us these data could you add them to scengen re this see below 5 i appreciate your problems with olga and mike salmon as far as i can see incorporating the revised magfor code into magiccscengen shouldnt be too difficult i can however get hold of some money to pay for some of mikes time to do other workperhaps 5000 or so can we set something up the contractual side would be easyjust matter of agreeing brief statement of work and having cru send bill if this is useful and possible then can you check it out with mike and trevor cheers tom on mon 9 feb 1998 mike hulme wrote tom got your fax and email five responses 1 uiuc sul results can be combined with any ghg pattern or combination simply click on the relevant gcms in the gcms menu you can choose all 15 ghg patterns and also the uiuc sul pattern simultaneously if you want not sure how you missed this one 2 we do not allow ghg patterns to be scaled by ghgsul dts from magicc what you call global sulphate ie we never use column 6 in the drive files we always follow the disaggregated sulphate route by using columns 2 3 4 and 5 i still maintain it is not correct to scale ghg patterns by global dt that results from ghgsul forcing the way we have designed scengen is so that the choice of what columns in drive to use is governed by what gcms are selected in the gcms menu if only ghg patterns are chosen we use column 2 if only sul patterns are chosen we use columns 3 4 and 5 with the appropriate weightings applied ie we have three uiuc sul pattern files corresponding to the three scengen regions recombined of course from schlesingers six original regions if both ghg and sul patterns are chosen then we combine the various patterns using columns 2 3 4 and 5 you will see that the global dt displayed in red on the main screen changes in keeping with these selections ie ghg only sul only or ghgsul if we allowed ghg patterns to be scaled by dts from magicc that resulted from ghg and sul forcing i believe that we break the consistency of our method column 6 is therefore redundant and serves only to check the summing of the other columns 3 this parallels an earlier discussion about using hadcm2 sul results in scengen strictly we should not use them since they are so2 pattern specific allowing the user to scale hadcm2 sul by set of dts resulting from any so2 pattern is plainly wrong compromise would be to allow hadcm2 sul to be scaled by the dt from the hadcm2 sul simulation ie hardwiring these dts into scengen and using only these if the user wants hadcm2 sul of course other gcm patterns should not then be added to this there is another way of using hadcm2 sul results more flexibly and that is by differencing hadcm2 ghg from hadcm2 sul 20712100 standardising the result according to the dts from the three scengen regions and then treating these standardised hadcm2 sul only patterns as independent aerosol patterns to be used in scengen this would be my approach but again requires more time and effort 4 we only include t and p from uiuc for the very good reason that only t and p contain complete global fields at least from the ftp site data the other variables exist only for land areas since the uiuc grid is 4 lat by 5 deg and scengen is 5 by 5 we would need to regrid and the longitudes are displaced by 05 box as well which complicates matters regridding land only grids onto different land only grid is nontrivial possible but would take some working at for example uiuc have iceland or caribbean islands so what do we give to scengen for these boxes we have to tell scengen something since we add other gcms together faking up data here is very timeconsuming if uiuc have other fields apart from t and p for full global grid but just not put them on the web site then fine the problem is quite straightfoward if not then we have messy problem on our hands 5 points about revised magicc code noted and we will have look at the new code when it is here please also note that apart from olga not being paid by now neither is mike salmon indeed mikes contract is rather uncertain again but i hope i can pursuade him and trevor to keep pace with magicc changes for all our sakes regards mike at 1923 060298 0700 you wrote dear mike some rather urgent scengen issues have arisen from my meeting with norm rosenberg hugh pitcher et at battelle while at battelle i had my first chance to look at the new scengen since i have not had time to try to get it working under nt i havent had time to try your new batch file yet the first thing is that you seem to have constrained things so that schlesingers sulphate results can only be added to his ghg results this defeats the purpose of the method the sulphate patterns appropriately scaled can be added to any or any combination of ghg ie co2 alone results i am at loss to understand why you did this because it seems to that the coding should be easier for the more general case the way it should work is this first the user selects the magicc output low mid high or user climate output this determines which file to use to get the normalized pattern weights lodrive middrive hidrive or usrdrive the user must then select whether to use global sulphate or disaggregated sulphate this determines whether to use the last column only in drive labeled sum to weight the ghg or composite ghg pattern global sulphate case or to use the second third fourth and fifth columns of drive labeled ghg eso21 eso22 eso23 to weight respectively the ghg or composite ghg region1 sulphate region2 sulphate and region2 sulphate patternsand then sum these weighted patterns what you seem to be doing now is to only allow scengen to use schlesingers ghg pattern for weighting with the ghg column it should be trivial to fix this the ghg or composite ghg pattern should be calculated matter whether the user selects the global or disaggregated sulphate case you may have switched this calculation off for the disaggregated casebut you shouldnt as i noted above the coding should be easier for the proper working of the model you may recall that i said earlier that i think there is still glitch in the sulphate pattern weights on looking at the drive outputs again i still think this is problem have look yourself and see whether you think the numbers look reasonable or not ill check this out further over the weekend the second thing that came up in the battelle meeting was the fact that the only data sets for schlesingers output seem to be temperature and precipitation battelle wants to do some sulphate cases driving crop and hydrology models with scengen output and they need the other variables they are working to tight deadline so getting these data into scengen is much higher priority that plugging hadcm2 sul into scengen this is why i am going to spend some time at last checking out the pattern weights asap i hope you can help out with these things the first should be easybut i realize the second could be both tedious and somewhat time consuming there is clearly lot of scope for using scengen to define the pattern consequences of sulphate aerosol forcing both to look at the implications of different so2 emissions scenarios and to investigate uncertainties we cant do this until ive fixed the magicc end to get the weights working properly it is something we could spend some time on ie writing something up for publication when im in cru in the summer andor earlier thanks for your help on this the people at battelle are very impressed by scengenas am i cheers tom tom ml wigley senior scientist national center for atmospheric
