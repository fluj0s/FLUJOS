missile age shortly after world war ii the devel opment and deployment of missile defenses has not only been elusive but has been one of the most divisive issues of the past generation until recent years the bush administration substantially altered the debate over missile defenses the administration requested significant funding increases for missile defense programs eliminated the distinction between national and theater missile defense restructured the missile defense progra m to focus more directly on developing deployment options for layered capability to intercept missiles aimed at us territory across the whole spectrum of th eir flight path adopted new untried development and acquisiti on strategy announced us withdrawal from the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty and has deployed an initial national missile defense capability the administration argued these steps we re necessary in response to growing concerns over the spread of weapons of ma ss destruction and their means of delivery especially on the part of handful of pot entially hostile states and terrorists in addition they asserted that us deterren ce theory has outlived its usefulness and that conventional or nuclear terrence could not be relied upon to dissuade unstable leaders in rogue states critics however take issue with assertions that the threat is increasing citing evidence that the number of nations seek ing or possessing nuclear weapons has actually declined over the past 20 years moreover they argue that the technology for effective missile defens remains immature that depl oyment can be provocative to allies friends and adversaries nd it is budgetbuster that reduces the availability of f unds to modernize and operate u s conventional military forces they argue especially that some major powers view us missile defense as an attempt at strategic domination and that other such as china will expand their missile capabilities in response this report will be updated as

administration pr esented to congress the outlines of its proposed approach to missile defense the bush administrations plan differed significantly from the approach pursued by the clinton administration the issue for congress remains whether to approve or modify the bu sh administrations proposed approach for missile defenses in genera l congress has supported the presidents approach making some adju stments in programs experi encing technical problems and reducing funding for programs that congress was not yet willing to commit to for early deployment purposeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31111crs2 in december 2002 the administration announ ced its decision to begin fielding initial missile defense capab ilities in 20042005 an initial national missile defense capability was declared with the deployment of eight interceptors in alaska and california at the end of 2004 scope of report this report provides background inform ation on the bush administrations proposed approach and discusse s key issues relating to it key issues raised in the next section include ballistic missile proliferation which countries of concern possess or are developing missiles that might threaten the united states its military forces or its friends and allies what range of missile threats might us missile defenses be required to counter in the near and midterm technology issues will the united states be able to develop and deploy missile defenses that can intercept missiles of all ranges and at all phases of their flights if not can partial system be overcome even by rogue states what are the key technological challenges when might the research and development program give way to deployment prog ram will dods acquisition policy affect the planned incremen tal deployment strategy the latter sections of the report provi background information on the various parts of the administrations proposed missile defense program it includes program and budget data and key technical challeng faced by the programs the report concludes with summary of congressional action on th missile defense budget missile defense prior to the bush administration the united states has pursued the deve lopment of missile defenses for more than 50 years since the reagan strategic defense initiative sdi was launched in fy1985 the united states has spent more than 85 billion on missile defense programs and studies missile defense s proven to be challenging and elusive endeavor moreover the question of whether the united states should deploy extensive defenses to protect against ballistic missile attack has been one of the most divisive political and national secur ity issues of this generation the demise of the soviet union and the debate over the emergence of ballistic missile threats from other nations changed the nature of the debate for many concerns about nuclear stability between the united states and russia have receded as the two nations expanded their areas of cooperation and improved their relationship especially in the us lead war on terrorism instead many now focus on concerns about possible attack from an adversary who possesses only few missiles and may not be deterred by fear of us retaliation without missile defense capability some argue the united states itself may be deterred from using its conventional forces to protect us llies and friends similarly the united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31111crs3 1 for example see lawrence f kaplan offensive line why the best offense is good missile defense new republic mar 12 2001 2025 2 george w bush remarks on missile defe nse national defense university may 1 2001might be unable to combat aggressive or provocative actions on the part of rogue states armed with chemical biological or nuclear capable ballistic missiles1 even terrorist acquisition of ballis tic missiles armed with wea pons of mass destruction is today part of the policy debate the clinton administration responded to this changing international security environment by pursuing the development nd deployment of defenses that would protect us allies and forces in the field from attack by shorter and mediumrange ballistic missiles theater ssile defense tmd it also sought to develop for deployment limited system to protect us territory from attack by longe rrange ballistic missiles national missile defense nmd its plans for nmd would eventually have c onflicted with the terms of th 1972 antiballistic missile abm treaty with the soviet union which limite d the united states and soviet union now russia to single landbased system for defense against longrange ballistic missiles the administration sought to preserve the basic framework of the abm treaty by negotiating modifications that would have permitted the deployment of limited landbased nmd site in alaska the clinton administration decided however that it would not proceed to deploy the site after failures in the flight test program and other technical concerns raised questions about the readiness of the technology bush administrations proposed approach the bush administration sharply altered the debate over missile defense in several preelection speeches president bush indicated that he would pursue the development of technologies that could be deployed on land at sea and in space to protect the united states its allies and its forces overseas from ballistic missile attacks from rogue nations president bush also stated that the united states would have to move beyond the c onstraints of the abm treaty he emphasized that russia is not our enemy and therefore russia should not be concerned about us deployment of missile defenses instead of seeking to modify the abm treaty so that the united states could deploy limited missile defenses the president said we need new framework that allows us to build missile defenses to counter the different threats of todays world2 the administration began to outline the details of its plans for missile defenses in july 2001 after submitting its amende d defense budget for fy2002 to congress in that budget the administration requested 83 billion for missile defense an increase of 31 billion or 61 percent ove r the amount congress funded for fy2001 the administration stated that it would ex plore broader range of technologies and basing modes including land air s ea and spacebased capabilities that had been previously disregarded or inadequately expl ored however as is described in more detail later in this report see table 1 the administration appears to have essentially increased funding evenly for each of the missile defense and sensor technologies already in the defense budget from f unding and programmatic perspective thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31111crs4 3 the boost phase of missiles flight occurs immediately after launch and lasts for 35 minutes for longrange missiles and 12 minutes for shortrange missiles it is the powered portion of the flight the midcourse portion oc curs after boost outside the atmosphere and for longrange missiles can last up to 20 minutes the terminal phase occurs when missile or warhead reenters the atmosphere it lasts less than minute for shortrange missiles and minute or two for longerrange missilesadministration did not appear to give increas ed priority to any particular program or introduce any major new research direc tions for fy2002 beyond what the clinton administration was already pursuing except to accelerate the process and integrate key components similar argument was made with respect to the fy2003 missile defense budget of 78 billion in its missile defense program the bush administration eliminated distinctions between theater and national missile defe nses tmd and nmd instead according to general kadish the director of mda formerly the ballistic missile defense organization bmdo the administration has developed research development and test program that focuse s on missile defense as single integrated bmd system furthermore the objective of this program is to aggressively evaluate and develop technologies for the integration of land s ea air or spacebased platforms and to develop and deploy global system of l ayered defenses capable of intercepting missiles of any range at every stage of flight boost midc ourse and terminal3 administration officials have highlighted two primary benefits of layered defenses first layered defenses would s eek to provide the united states with more than one opportunity to target an attack ing missile thus arguably increasing the chance of shooting it down critique of the layered defense concept is outlined in the section on technology and other challenges second the layers could complicate an ttackers ability to defeat the overall system this is because countermeasures which are intended to confuse or overcome defenses that might be effec tive in one phase of missiles flight might not work in other phases the bush administration has emphasized that its missile defense program will concentrate on robust research and develo pment into wide range of missile defense technologies unlike the clint on administration the bush administration has not yet identified an architecture detailed missile defense system with specific objectives and capabilities that it will seek to deploy nor established schedule for the development and deployment of any pa rticular system or element but clear underlying objective is the early deployment of defense designed against missiles aimed at us territory becau it has not identified the ty pes of technologies or the numbers of interceptors and radars that it intends to deploy the administration will not provide any costs for the missile defens program or system it emphasizes that cost estimates are premature under the new approach administration officials have stated that this research and development effort is designed to develop effective system s over time and to deploy that capability incrementally the program envisions th deployment of different combinationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31111crs5 4 us department of state cable on missile defense policy published by the carnegie endowment for international peace july 2001 5 in late august 2001 for example john bolt on undersecretary of st ate for arms control and international security held out the possi bility of invoking the withdrawal clause by november 2001 if meaningful progre ss with russia was not achievedof sensors and weapons when these technolog ies are proven through robust testing these technologies could then be replaced by more effective or advanced systems when they become available this approach is called an evolutionary acquisition strategy this strategy differs from the way in which most military acquisition programs occur it will likely be the subject of increased scrutiny an analysis of this strategy and some of its implications follows in subsequent section of this report during congressional testimony in ju ly 2001 deputy secretary of defense wolfowitz stated repeatedly that the united states would not violate the abm treaty but that the treaty stood in the wa of the administrati ons missile defense efforts he noted that some of the tests or activities could bump up against the limits in the treaty in months not years4 however the bush administration also stated that the united states would have liked to reach an agreement with russia that would allow these tests and the eventual deployment of extens ive missile defenses to proceed without concern for the treaty limits at meeting in italy in july 2001 president bush and russias president putin agreed that the two nations would hold di scussions that focused on both offensive weapons and defensive systems some inte rpreted this agreement to mean that the two nations would begin negotiations on new treaties that would limit offensive nuclear weapons and missile defenses administration officials stated clearly however that these were not negotiations but consultations they also stated at that time the administration did not plan simply to seek modifications in the abm treaty but it would not allow the treaty to prevent research and development toward deployment even if that ultimately meant us withdrawal from the treaty5 rather the bush administration sought to convince russia that the abm treaty was longer relevant and that th two nations should agree to set it aside and replace it with new framework for their relationship according to some reports the united states would share information about missile fense developments with russia but it would not accept any limits on research devel opment testing or deployment of its systems russia however did not accep t the us approach and on december 13 2001 president bush announced that the united states would withdraw from the treaty actual withdrawal from th 1972 abm treaty occurred june 13 2002 the administration announced it had specific plan for deploying an initial missile defense capability on december 17 2002httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31111crs6 6

intercontin ental ballistic missile s icbms although other countries with short nd medium range missile progra ms may aspire to join this club there are factors other than scientific and infrastructure to consider variables such as the availability of financial reso urces political will availability of foreign material and technical assi stance and the affects of non proliferation and export control regimes all play ro in missile development in this regard countries discussed here other than russia and china should be considered as potential future threats outside of their respective regions within their respective regions however these countries along with russia and china will present an ever increasing proliferation challenge to us forces friends and allies ballistic missile prolifera tion has continued steadily over the past two decades presenting variety of security challenges to the united states the number of countries with operationally deployed icb ms that could strike targets in the united states remains relatively small there is however fairly widespread and growing capability to launch shorter range missiles and slowly evolving capacity to launch medium range missiles6 these short to medium range missiles could not only threaten us forces on regional basis but could also serve as precursor for the development of longer range missiles over the course of the coming decades the transition from short to medium range missiles to icbms is more matter of technical expertise than of technology the principal hurdles to developing longer range missiles are manufacturing larger propulsion systems and designing missile with more than one stage with an existing short or medium range ballistic missile infrastructure overcoming these hurdles b ecomes an issue of having an experienced and qualified scien tific and engineering staff if country does not have this expertise domestically it can be imported the united states routinely monitors

technical issues acquisition strategy hittokill steven hildreth specialist in national defense the concept of kinetic kill or hittokill has been pr imary focus of the missile defense program since the conception of the sdi in the early 1980s previously the united states pursued missile defense concepts that em ployed nuclear weapons as interceptors more conventional explosive warheads were used to develop the pac2 system used in the persian gulf war against iraqi scud missiles advanced and exotic concepts such as various lasers were largely d eemed impractical during the late 1980s and early 1990shttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31111crs11 kinetic kill interceptor would seek to destroy its intended target through direct collision at relatively high speeds the force of the impact would then destroy the attacking missile or wa rhead render it inoperable or divert it from its intended target with such an approach nearmiss has the same practical affect as large distance miss the target is not destroyed kinetic kill as concept for destroying short and mediumrange ballistic missiles appears to be in the process of proving itself after string of failed intercept tests the thaad program began series of successful tests barring major unforseen technical or engineerin g problems it appears that kinetic kill warhead for thaad can be developed the sa is true of the pac3 system the next generation patriot interceptor seems to be proving the concept of kinetic kill for shortrange missile defenses despite the most recent st failures in february 2002 the key question remaining however centers around levels of effectiveness particularly in wa rtime under testrange conditi ons most military systems perform better than they do in an operational environment the patriot system used in desert storm is notable example prior to th war patriot successfully intercepted 17 of 17 very different targets under variety of test range conditions patriot encountered vastly different operationa l environment when deploye d and its success or failure during the war is still debatable and according to experts probably unknowable kinetic kill as concept for destroying longrange ballistic missiles is even more problematic at this stage ther is unambiguous empirical evidence to support the contention that kinetic kill for icbm defense will wor k missile defense advocates argue that since the mid1980s string of such tests have occurred with varying degrees of success some have fa iled to achieve inte rception while others were deemed successful but in almost every case posttest doubts have been raised critics have charged that test results over the past two decades have been exaggerated by false claims of success and promises of performan ce that later proved false many tests were proven to have had thei r targets significantly enhanced to ensure the likelihood of success some missile defense advocates say this may be true but kinetic kill for icbm defense is comparable to where kinetic kill was for systems such as pac3 several years ago they maintain therefore th at continued development and especially more realistic testing is needed to ensure that the kinetic kill concept for longrange missiles can eventually be deployed layered defenses steven hildreth specialist in national defense the concept of layered defense which dates back to at leas t the 1960s and was developed more systematically in the 1980s envisi ons deploying severa l missile defense systems each designed to intercept an attacking missile or warhead at different stage of its flight trajectory the concep t arguably would allow for multiple intercept opportunities although this presents the possibility that one element of the system may not work as intended proponents argu that multiple intercept opportunities significantly increase the chance that an attacking missile or warhead will be destroyedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31111crs12 35 for example suppose that missile defense sy stem consists of three independent layers each with kill probability of 90 then the probability of surviving each layer is 10 percent or 010 and the probability of surviving all three layers is 010 x 010 x 010 0001 in other words in such system only one missile in thousand will get through 36 07 x 07 x 07 0343 that is 34 of the missile s or warheads would survive this layered missile defense system 37 critique of the layered defense concept is developed by peter d zimmerman pork bellies and sdi foreign policy summer 1986 7687proponents of layered defenses argue that each layer is able to attack different vulnerability of the attack ing ballistic missile and th at because each layer is statistically independent of every other layer the pr obability of warhead getting through all of the layers 1 to n can be given by simple multiplication of the probabilities of surviving each independent attack35 this analysis would readily lead to conclusion that defense with three layers for example might let extremely few missiles or warheads get through other analysts however would argue that this is wrong conclusion in the first place there is empiri cal evidence of an air defe nse system with probability of intercept pi much greater than about 30 percen t or 03 so one might conclude more realistically that the probability that an attacking missile or warhead will survive is closer to 34 percent36 moreover it is argued37 even if one assumes that each layer is 90 percent effective the layered defense model fails because the layers are not statistically independent for at least two reasons each attacking warhead or missile must encounter each of the layers in order so the performance of one layer will affect the performance of the next layer and so on for example if the first layer underperforms because some c ountermeasure is unexpectedly successful then the second layer w ill be required to deal with more simultaneous targets than expected if one missile or warhead avoids interception that may mean that ci rcumstances are favorable for the next missile to get through also even if each layer is over designed by factor of about 2 failure of one layer can still lead to saturation of the next for example if we expect the terminal layer to have to handle 10 warheads we might desi gn it to handle 20 but if earlier layers then fail so that the terminal layer is presented with 30 targets at least 10 warheads will get through to their intended destination even if the terminal layer works perfectly the failure of an early layer would thus result in the collapse of the missile defense system the layered pyramid defense is ba lanced on its vertex rather than set firmly on its base until layered defense has been tested under realistic conditions when it must engage warheads nearly simultaneously in each layer it is unrealistic for defense planners to assume that there are problems of command and control among the layers and that unknown variables do not operate to degrade the system in unpredicted ways such test w ould be expensive and difficult tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31111crs13 38 crs report rs21195 evolutionary acquisition and spiral development in dod programs policy issues for congress by gary j pagliano and ronald orourke achieve requiring the multiple simultaneous launch of several icbms the probability of an attacking warhead surviving intercepts by three correlated layers cannot be known without making assumptions about the mechanism of the correlation and nonindependence of the yers in general critics conclude the performance of the system ma be better than the performance of the best layer and then only if that layer is not saturated by the sheer numbers of missiles warheads or countermeasures layered defense proponents are likely to understand and perhaps agree with many of these points but supporters will respond by suggesting these issues can be adequately addressed in the design of missile defense architecture and adjustments made during its deve lopment see below acquisition strategy congressional oversight gary pagliano specialist in national defense some observers particularly critics of the missile defense program have expr essed concern that the administrations overall approach for managing the program could hinder congresss ability to conduct effective oversight of it three areas of the administrations management approach are at issue the first concerns the administrations plan to use evolutionary acquisition with spiral development to develop and acquire missiledef ense systems the second concerns dod directive th at exempts the missile defense program from certain reporting requirements that are normally applied to major defense acquisition programs the third concerns decision to classify certain missile defense testing and program information the administration and its supporters argu that these three developments are needed to help the program proceed expe ditiously and to help prevent potential adversaries from learning how to evade or overcome us missiledefense systems when they are deployed critics argue that these three factors could reduce congresss ability to understand track and thereby conduct ffective oversight of the administrations missile defense program each of these three developments is discussed below evolutionary acquisition with spiral development gary pagliano specialist in national defense in presenting its new missile defense program to congress in 2001 the administration announced that missile defense systems would be developed and acquired under relatively new appr oach called evolutionary acquisition with spiral development or spir development for short as discussed in another crs report38 spiral development is an outgrowth of the defense acquisition reform movement of the 1990s and represents departure from the traditional dod approach for developing and acquiring major weapon systems spiral development is aimed at achieving certain widely accepted defenseacquis ition goals including the following 1 gettin g usable increments of weapon capability into service sooner 2 mitigating technical risk in acquisition programs involvinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31111crs14 new or emerging technologies 3 taking advantage of user feedback in terms of determining how to modify and improve the system and 4 facilitating the incorporation of new technol ogies into the system design during the systems life cycle missile defense was the first major w eapon acquisition prog ram to be publicly linked with spiral development dod offici als however have stated that they want spiral development to be the new default ie standard acquisition strategy for major weapons acquisition pr ograms and have since announced their intention to apply spiral development to other major weapon acquisition programs such as the navys ddx nextgeneration surface combatant program under an evolutionary acquisition strate gy basic version of weapon system is developed and fielded with the intent of subsequently developing and deploying more capable versions of the system as technology and requirements are further refined critical aspect of evolutiona ry acquisition is spiral development under which the various elements of weapon sy stem evolve incrementally over time in an iterative manner instead of attempting to develop system that will upon first deployment fully satisfy detaile d military requirement systems under an evolutionary acquisition strategy would be developed tested deployed and modified in cyclic process that in principl would permit weapons developers to incrementally work toward final system configuration that is eventually capable of meeting its required objectives distinct characteristic of evolutionary development is reduced ability particularly at the outset of program to define what the deployed system might look like at various points in the future ra ther than attempting to define final configuration at the outset evolutionary development cons ciously treats this issue as an open question to be addressed over time as elements of the system are developed deployed evaluated and modified in this sense the administrations proposed missile defense effort is more of an evolving concept than typical military system in development the administrations missile defense plan would apply evolutionary acquisition and spiral development to an entire family of system development efforts related to the common mission of missile defense under the administrations plan missile defense systems would be built tested deployed and evaluated incrementally the final missile defense system or architecture that is the numbers and characteristics of the land sea air and spacebased system involved would be determined gradually over the course of several years during this period systems capable of performing similar portions of the missile defense mission ie the boost phase the midcourse phase or the terminal phase would be in implicit competition with one another for places in the final system configuration the administrations plan to employ this acquisition strategy for missile defense is consistent with its view that missile defenses are urgently needed the administration argues that deploying ssile defenses sooner with less capability than later versions is desirable because any improvement in us missile defense capabilities would complicate enemy planning and thereby strengthen deterrence against ballistic missile attacks the administration also argues that the strategy ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31111crs15 appropriate for weapon acquis ition programs such as missile defense where the fundamental technologies invol ved are less technically matu re than they are for well established types of weapons such as aircraft and ships major consequence of the administrations proposed evolutionary acquis ition strategy is that the missiledefense program would not feature the familiar phases and milestones of the traditional dod acquisition system anot her consequence already reflected in dod testimony is that bmdo cannot provide congress with description of its final missile defense architecture the capabilities of any near or longerterm system the specific dates by which most elements of the emerging architecture are to be tested and deployed an estimate of the eventual total cost of the missiledefense program or estimates of the am ounts of funding that the program will require in individual years beyond fy2002 lt gen ronald kadish director of bmdo now mda stated the following to the senate in july 2001 in introducing the administrations missiledefense plan but before i proceed to describe the new program in detail i would like to make clear what this program does not do it does not define specific architecture it does not commit to procurement program for full layered defense there is commitment to specific dates for production and deployment other than for lowertier terminal defense systems first we are recommending broad flexible approach to rdte that allows us to explore multiple developm ent paths and to reinforce success based on the best technological approaches nd the most advantageous basing modes in order to hedge against the inherent uncertainty of the ballistic missile defense challenge second we are recommending an acquisition approach that is evolutionary one that will allow us to field systems incrementally once they are proven through realistic testing and third rather than committing to single architecture as we have done in the past we will deploy over time different combinations of sensors and weapons c onsistent with our national strategic objectives this robust rdte program aims to demonstrate what does and does not work those activities showing the greatest promise will receive greater resource emphasis our progress will inform an annual highlevel decisionmaking process that will steer the bmd program in the most promising direction taking into account optimal approaches and the most reliable information on costs allowing informed research pr oduction and deploy ment decisions the business of missile defense requires coping with number of technological developmental acquisition and threat uncertainties for this reason i cannot tell you today what exactly the system will look like 15 10 or even five years from now this system will take shape over time we do not intend to lock ourselves into highly stylized architecture based on either known technologies or hoped for advances in technology that will take decade or more to complete we intend to go beyond the conventional buildtorequirements acquisition process specific system choices and time lines will take shape over the next few years through our capabilitybased block approach we w ill increase our capability over time through an evolutionary process as our technologies mature and are proven through testing the block approach allows us to put our besthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31111crs16 39 statement of lt gen

particular area this comprehensive annual review process will also help us make decisions to shape the evolving systems and allocate resources to optimally support them39 the administration and its supporters argu that the use of spiral development for the missile defense program or ot her weapon acquisition programs will not prevent congress from conduc ting effective oversight and could even improve congresss oversight ability in some respect s because congress will retain its role in approving each block or segment in spiral development program and because the information that dod provides for the bl ock to be approved w ill be more reliable than the potentially speculative informa tion it might present under the traditional acquisition approach about what the tire program might look like from beginning to end critics of the administrations plan to us spiral development argue that it could reduce congresss ability to provide effective oversight by putting congress in the position of approving the start of program whose outlines are only vaguely defined because the lack of an original estimate of the programs ove rall quantities cost schedule and cost would prive congress years later of benchmark against which to measure performance of the progra m and because the builtin potential for changes in spiral development program could make funding projections for spiral development programs more volatile than funding projections for traditional development programs40 exemption from re porting requirements gary pagliano specialist in national defense in january

classified gary pagliano specialist in national defense in may 2002 the administration announ ced that certain information about the missile defense program including details about devel opmental tests will henceforth be classified and therefore would not be released to the public administration officials argue that classifying the information will help prevent potential adversaries from lear ning about the technical ch aracteristics of us missile defense systems and using that information to design ballistic missiles with features designed to evade or overcome us defenses critics of the decision argue that some of the information the administration has decided to classify such as basic details about early developmental test s would be of practical use to potential adversary and that the administrations actual mo tive in limiting access to the information is to shield the missile defense program from public scrutiny and criticism42 background on major missile defense programs boost defense segment airbased boost daniel morgan analyst in science technology and christopher bolkcom specialist in national defense the airbased boost program more commonly known as the air borne laser abl would use high power chemical laser mounted in modi fied boeing 747 aircra ft to shoot down theater missiles in their powered boost pha of flight the laser would seek to rupture or damage the missiles booster skin to cause the missile to lose thrust or flight control and fall short of the inte nded target before decoys warheads or submunitions are deployed the ab ls intended range is several hundred kilometers major subsystems include the lethal laser highprecision tracking system for keeping the laser beam on target and an adaptive optics system that compensates for atmospheric effects to keep the beam tightly focused the abl program was transferred to bmdo now the mda from the air force the mda states there is current system or architecture envisioned forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31111crs18 missile defense including specifics for the abl but the director of bmdo in congressional testimony has stated that bmdo will evaluate the most promising projects for boostphase defense to provi basis for an architecture decision between 2003 and 2005 the most recent air force concept envisioned fleet of seven aircraft five of these aircraft would deploy to theater to support two 24hour combat air patrols these aircraft would be positioned behi nd the friendly line of troops and moved closer toward enemy airspace as local air superiority is achieved the most recent cost estimate was 107 billion life cycle costs which includes an estimated 16 billion for the current program development and risk reduction phase the contractor team consists of boeing lockheed martin and trw boeing is responsible for the aircraft and fo r overall management including systems integration lockheed martin is responsible for the beam control systems including target tracking and atmospheric compensa tion trw is responsible for the lethal laser and for ground support systems there are numerous subcontractors the system currently under development will attempt its first missile shoot down test in 2005 bmdo states this lfpower abl could be available for deployment as an emergency capability immediately following lethality demonstrations scheduled fo r late 2005 if all goes according to schedule this system and the next two could provide an initial operating capability one aircraft on station one preparing to arrive on station and one on ground alert between fy2009 and fy2011 depending on the results of additional ope rational testing congressional concerns about the abl ve centered on two main issues the maturity of key technolog ies and the concept of operations first although proponents conte nd that the abl employs mature technology others characterize key aspects particularly the atmospheric compensation system as experimental critics also claim that the tests needed to reso lve this question whic h are being conducted concurrently with the deve lopment of the technology will not take place until 2005 this date is after second ai rcraft is scheduled to be or dered and just months before the first shootdown test the compressed and concurrent nature of this schedule also is an issue of concern the defense departments office of test and evaluation informed congress in its fy2000 annual report january 2001 that the 24month emd engineering manufacturing and development progra m is alarmingly shortthe schedule allows for technical problems or test fa ilures and the many integration and test activities cannot all physica lly be accomplished in the time allotted for emd however this schedule is likely to change due to the two year delay for the lethal shootdown second there is disagreement about wh ether the abl would be operationally effective even if its technology perfo rms as planned the ability of the abl to destroy enemy missiles at its intended range depends on number of factors including atmospheric conditions between the laser and the target possible enemy countermeasures and the worldwide tre nd towards deployment of longerrange missiles for theater operations possi ble technical count ermeasures includehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31111crs19 hardening the missile casing spinning the missile or applying polished finish to the missile in addition the ability to deploy abl ai rcraft during crisis or war will depend on the ability to provide relatively safe area of operations through air superiority it is not clear whether enemy forces woul d wait for this to happen and render their ballistic missile forces more vulnerable or see incentives to launch their missiles before abl systems were deployed or whether an opponent might choose to wait out crisis because force of abl airc raft probably would not be deployed on 24 hour combat patrols indefinitely spacebased boost john d moteff specialist in science technology policy the mission of the spacebased boost intercept portion of the program is to develop the capability of shooting down ballis tic missiles of any range in their boost phase ie before the miss iles have released their payload from platforms located in orbit two concepts are under devel opment spacebased laser sbl and space based kinetic weapons both concepts have been under development to varying degrees since before sdi in the early 1980s congressional funding support for this portion of the program is waning in fy2002 the bush administration had requested 170 million for space based laser developmen t with much of that directed toward the development of an integrated flight experiment to be c onducted in space and in itially scheduled for 2012 and the construction of test facility to be located at stennis space flight center however congress concerned that the technol ogy was not mature enough to warrant the development of the flight experiment at this time appropriated only 30 million for the program as result th integrated flight experiment which was projected to cost between 1 billion and 3 billion and the test center were cancelled the bush administrations fy 2003 request for the spacebased laser was 34 million and directed primarily at reducing technical ri sks associated with key components the megawatt hydrogenfluor ide laser mirrors beam controls pointingtrackingfire controls etc congress reduced the request by 10 million in its fy2003 appropriations the spacebased kinetic energy com ponent of the spacebased boost phase intercept portion of the program is design ed to further develop the key component technologies including the kinetic kill vehi cle boosters sensor s battle management and control and platform integration development work and experiments are to help reduce the technical risk s and lead to design decision in fy2006 or later this element was new start in fy2002 and received 23 million the bush administration requested 53million for fy2003 and had proposed major increases in the program in the outyears congress cut the request by 50 million in its appropriations report the house appropriations committee stated that greater emphasis should be placed on accelerating th manufacture of existing systems such as the pac3 and on accelerating the development of other more mature technologies there are number of issu associated with space based boost phase intercept any such system could also function as antisatellite weapon an issue that remains highly controversial th desirability of stationing weapons in space generateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31111crs20 differing opinions also the technical hurdles associated with spacebased interceptors especially lasers with their weight size and reliability constraints are difficult feasibility is not yet certain hence the need for the demonstration programs at the very least how long it will take to overcome those hurdles and at what cost remains uncertain although longer constraint when the abm treaty was in force testing and deploying th systems in an abm mode had been prohibited seabased boost ronald orourke specialist in national defense the seabased boost program was created by the bush administration in 2001 as part of its new missile defense program the general idea of using seabased missiles to intercept enemy ballistic missiles in thei r boostphase however goes back several years the seabased boostdefense concept is of potential interest because forward deployed navy ships operating off the coas ts of other countries might be close enough to certain ballistic ssile launch sites of concern for highspeed high acceleration shiplaunched inte rceptors to fly inland from the ship and intercept enemy ballistic missiles during the boost phase the seabased boostdefense concept app ears most feasible for use against missiles launched from sites that are close or somewhat close to international waters since this would reduce the distance that the interceptor would need to fly to reach the enemy missile and thereby increase the chance that the interceptor would reach it during its boost phase the concept might thus have the most potential for intercepting missiles launched fro m countries such as north korea libya or perhaps iran the concept would appear to offer little potential for intercepting longrange russian or chinese missiles whose launc h sites are located deep inland because these missiles are more likely to complete their boost phase befo re shiplaunched interceptor even one with highspeed highacceleration booster could reach them although the seabased boost program is not yet well defined robust sea based boost system would likely requi re an interceptor missile with much higher maximum speed or burnout velocity perhaps 6 to 8 kilometers per second kps than that of the sm3 interceptor missile now being developed for the seabased midcourse system which has maximum speed of bit more than 3 kps high rate of acceleration to maximum speed to help meet the shortengagement times associated w ith boostphase intercepts and kill vehicle different from the seabased midcourse kill vehicle because the latter is designed to operate against small and relatively cold target while boos tdefense kill vehicle would need to be capable of operating agains t large and hotburning target the first two characteristics will likely require either major modification to the existing sm3 missile design or the development of an entirely new missile with diameter of up to 27 inches whether m odified sm3 or an entirely new design higherspeed missile developed for th seabased boost program might prove suitable with different kill vehicle for use as an improved interceptor for the sea based midcourse system conversely higherspeed missile developed for anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31111crs21 43 due to an apparent production error the artic as published in original form mistakenly identified the missile being referred to at this point as the sm1 which is very old version of the standard missile that has potential for missile defense when the article was reprinted later by different publication the reference was corrected to refer to the sm2 block iv which is new version of the standard missile intended for intercepting aircraft and cruise missilesimproved seabased midcourse system might prove suitable with different kill vehicle for use as the interceptor for the seabased boost system see section on the seabased midcourse program using the same basic interceptor missile for both programs could reduce total seabased missile defense costs it may also be possible as nearterm stopgap measure to develop more limited boostphase capability ba sed on the sm3 missile although the sm3 was designed to intercept slowermoving th eaterrange ballistic missiles rather than fastermoving intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms the sm3 may have some potential to intercept certain icbms specifically those that are fired from coastal launch pads during the late r ie exoatmospheric part of their boost phase before they have attained their maximum speeds mid2002 discussion of the s eabased boost concept stated although the radar currently in place on aegis combatants has enough power and resolution to detect and tr ack icbms during the boost phase the navy has optimized the systems performance and displays to defend against targets such as cruise missiles and missiles launched from airplanes the required modifications for icbm defense are not tr ivial but they are achievable what is totally missing at present is suitable boostphase missile interceptor some us navy offici als proposed using sm2 block iv43 missiles to engage boosting icbms in the upper atmosphere that proposal however was fraught with great deal of technical risk and required the ship to be within 50 kilometers of the launch site making the ship itself vulnerable more practical approach may be developing missile interceptor intended to engage the boosting icbm later in its boost phase above the atmosphere allowing ships to be as much as 1000 kilometers from the launch site developers could use the sm3 test missiles being produced for the navys midcourse riskreduction effort as starting point for suitable interceptor missiles successful boostphase intercep t missiles however would have to be faster than the test missiles using the modified sm3 or widediameter missiles fastaccelerating interceptors with high rminal speeds the ship could be as far as 1000 kilometers from the launch point us navy ships thus equipped in international waters could engage missiles launched from all of north korea or iraq the effectiveness of seabased boostphase missile interceptors against icbms launched from iran would depend on the part of the country from which the icbms were launched in some cases us forces would need groundbased or

services committee july 12 2001 page 26 46 transcript of july 13 2001 dod news briefing on missile defense with lt gen kadish seabased boostphase capability has clear political advantages and some disadvantages its main advantage is th ability to provide potential defense against icbms launched from north korea and most parts of the middle east at the same time sea basing would pr esent threat to russias and chinas landbased icbm deterrents because those launch points are far inland as for disadvantages seabased boostphase system would potentially threaten russias submarinelaunched deterrent assuming capability existed to estimate the general location of the submarine second any boostphase defenses would require the establishment of nolaunch zone or other special procedures over the rogue state and willingness in extremis to delegate the engagement decision to the local us commander both requirements may be difficult to sustain politically finally any boostphase concept would require launching the interceptors in the direction of the country launching the icbms as well as toward third parties that may not be involved for example launches against north korean missiles with boost phase missile interceptors would entail launches on azimuths toward both north korea and china when defending against iraqi and iranian missile launches the boostphase missile interceptors would fly over several countries on an azimuth toward russia additionally debris from the engagement damaged wa rheads spent interceptor boosters and so forth could have an im pact on uninvolved countries if the united states accepts these political disadvantages the operational advantages of seabased boostphase interceptor are significant with the potential exception of iran these intercep tors are most effective against the countries in need of dissuasion and deterrence and they are less effective against former adversaries that need reassurance44 mda director kadish stated in july 2001 that the seabased boost program is considering highspeed highacceler ation booster coupled with boost k ill vehicle this same booster will be ev aluated with different k ill vehicle for seabased midcourse roles45 the program could be pursued as either complement to air and spacebased boostdefense systems or hedge against the possibility of technical problems in these other programs genera l kadish also stated in july 2001 that mda is going to institute concept studies and is looking at concepts on how to do the boost phase with kinetic energy as hedge against the directed energy should we run into problems there so we have some experiments in space with the space based laser and were looki ng at whether we should be doing some experiments in space with kinetic energy that build on the

experiments in fy0305 to mitigate the risk in accomplishing the boost mission these critical experiments may culminate in focused demonstration of particular basing m ode depending on the results of the cda study and the early critical experiments47 in early september 2002 it was reported that the defense science board federal advisory committee that provides independent advice to the secretary of defense had recommended in august 2002 that dod focus its missile defense efforts on two main approaches ground based midcourse syst em and seabased boost and ascentphase system48 in june 2002 it was reported that one boostphase activity thats materializing involves modifying the lightweight exoatmospheric projectile leap used as the k ill vehicle in the seabased midcourse defense system it will gather data on boosting target according to dean t gehr missile defense business development manager for raytheon the goal is to conduct flyby experiment and determine whether an infrared sensor

looked for solutions to bridge the gap one option is to have sm3 take on part of the mission to engage targets at shorter ranges sm3 would be modified so the missile has the flexibility not to fire

speak of the need for seabased terminal bmd capability sooner rather than later and have proposed path to get there the cancellation of the navy area missile defence program left huge hole in our developing basket of missiledefence capabilities said adm michael mullen cancelling the prog ram didnt eliminate the warfighting requirement the nation not just the navy needs seabased area missile defence capability not to protect our ships as much as to protect our forces ashore airports and seaports of debarka tion and critical overseas infrastructure including protection of friends and allies the service intends to begin funding nextgeneration antiair warfare aaw interceptor in fy04 which it calls the extendedrange active missile to fill the airdefence gap left by the termination of

controversial it is one component of the space based infrared sy stem sbirs which is designed to replace and enhance the capabilities of existin g satellites that provi early warning of missile launches histor ically us early warning satellites have been placed in geostationary orbit high above the equator 22300 mile s sbirs also will use satellites in that orbit as well in highly elliptical orbits and in low orbits hence the sbirs program is divided into two compone nts sbirshigh and sbirslow for more on both sbirshigh and sbirslow see crs report rs21148 military space programs issues concer ning dods sbirs and stss programs by marcia s smith sbirshigh is managed by the air force and will not be discussed further here management of sbirslow was moved from the air force to the ballistic missile defense office now the missile defense agency effective october 1 2001 to emphasize that its primary objec tive is to support missile defense the mission of sbirslow66 is to track missiles from launch to intercept or reentry discriminate between targets nd decoys transmit data to boost midcourse and terminal defense systems that will cu radars and provide intercept handovers and provide data for intercept hitkill assessments because of deep concerns about the tec hnological readiness of sbirslow and escalating cost projections congress ppropriated funding for sbirslow in fy2002 385 million had been requested however it ppropriated 250 million for satellite sensor technolog and gave the secretary of defense discretion as to whether the funding should be spent on sbirslow or other technologies the decision was to continue with restructured sbirslow program on april 15 mda director general rona ld kadish submitted the restructuring plan to congress the sbirslow
