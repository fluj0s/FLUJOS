from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to kbriffaueaacuk subject fwd re paleo data date fri 01 nov 2002 152805 0000 xsender hegerlmailheacpubdukeedu date fri 1 nov 2002 095645 0500 to phil jones pjonesueaacuk from gabi hegerl hegerldukeedu subject re paleo data worries i can wait till next week it would be great to hear from you next week particularly if you feel i have overlooked something i am planning to submit little grl paper on the detection results based on paleodata soon and so warning if i am doing something wrong would be great its not surprising that the detection results are stable since other than volcanic forcing is mainly driven by the lowf component anyway but it looks to like the volcanic response is not smaller or even bit larger in the annual jgr data except for one real real big peak in the 1998 data greetings have good weekend and good luck for keiths back gabi gabi i have printed the files but i do not know the answer keith is off today with bad back seeing chiropractor i need to talk to him before we can reply i will be away montues next week so we will not be able to reply until later next week cheers phil at 1127 311002 0500 gabi hegerl wrote dear keith and phil i checked and found that we did indeed use the jgr 2001 data by reloading them from your jgr data file i also got the 1998 data from the volcano paper and did some checking my detection results appear quite unimpressed by if i filter the 2001 data to focus on lower frequencies or not the estimated amplitudes of solar volcanic and ghg signals are virtually identical volcanism gets bit tougher to detect if you remove the highfrequency component then i redid the epoch analysis comparing the response of your data old and new to volcanism and find somewhat bigger volcanic signals on average using 50 eruptions between 1400 and 1940 in the jgr paper record i highpassed both datasets and get somewhat more variability in the jgr record not the 1998 record i am wondering is there something i am overlooking i append figure of the highpassed var ca 10 yrs removed records and the volcanic response in both datasets averaging years 120 after the eruption and removing the bestestimate solar and ghg signal before the analysis the analysis omits years with another volcanic eruption within the 20 yrs i also append one version of the figure where the upper 95ile of the ghg signal which appears underestimated in briffa 98 data is removed rather than the best estimate in that case the volcanic signals in both data appear nearly identical greetings and please let know if i am doing something wrong with your data also what is the best reference to discussion on the difference between both datasets thanks in advance gabi dear tom after little detective work we have deduced that the data sent to you constitute version of northern hemisphere land temperatures april sept produced by pca regression using regional average density chronologies ie the jgr paper you refereed i believe it is true that high frequency component is not in my opinion optimal in describing the relative magnitude of extreme interannual extremes this is to do with the unpredictable weighting ascribed to certain areas treedensity series in the averaging of the original raw data this is boring and i wont go into it unless you really want to relative differences in yeartoyear values are likely better represented in the nhemisphere series produced by averaging regional series produced using different approach in which the initial data are highpass filtered and then merged in more straight forward way this is more equivalent to the series on volcanic signals described in our nature paper though the lowfrequency component in this series is definitely not represented there is another series that one could consider good compromise that is composite of the agebanding approach jgr lowfrequency variance added to the earlier nature highfrequency component we did this for figure 6 in the jgr paper but did not provide the data on our web site i now realize however this composite series is very highly correlated with the better high frequency data see the correlations table 1 and related text in 1httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffajgr2001briffa2001pdf there are many possible ways of producing northern hemisphere average involving different prior regionalisation and secondary weighting in space and through time of the constituent series non can be considered correct if you would like us to dig out the composite series or discuss specific aspects of the logic or uncertainties associated with the different large averages let know perhaps it would be better to discuss this on the phone as for longer series we can provide the 2000 year neurasian data composite of ring width chronologies in nsweden the yamal peninsula and taimyr i will soon be able to provide 4000year version that is now being worked on or similar northern treering chronology incorporating more data eg see 2httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffaqsr1999 we do not have the bristlecone data but they are available i presume from the international treering data bank part of the ngdc holdings at 0229 pm 10102 0100

thanks for all your help on the bams paper doe is being exceedingly slow in processing the paperwork for our new round i will keep you posted i am also wondering whether we can get some data from you gabi is comparing our 2d ebm run with the briffa et 2001 jgr time series in order to compare the model prediction of i think you mentioned at one point something to the effect that although this series is good for estimating low resolution temperature variability it may dampen high frequency variability if my memory is correct in this case would you please send gabi the record you consider best for comparing with the model predicted interannual response to volcanic eruptions on another matter we are extending our runs back in time i have now compiled record of global volcanism back to 4000 bp for both hemispheres extended back to 8000 bp for 3090n we are therefore trying to compile paleo records older than ad 1000 to at least get some reconstruction we can compare with i seem to recall that keith or you may have published some longer reconstructionn but cannot recall where it is if so would you be so kind as to send it to also i am trying to find long record from the eastern california for the bristlecone pine for some reason i am having difficulty finding one if you have long record even going back beyond 2000 bp it would be very much appreciated thanks for any help you can give us on this and best wishes tom thomas j crowley nicholas professor of earth systems science dept of earth and ocean sciences nicholas school of the environment and earth sciences box 90227
