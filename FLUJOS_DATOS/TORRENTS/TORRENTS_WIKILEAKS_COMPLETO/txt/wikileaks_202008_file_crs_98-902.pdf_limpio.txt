protection for noncreative databases the copyright act title 17 of the us code protects as copyrightable subject matter those databases or other collections of information that qualify as works of authorship within the meaning of 17 u sc 102 to qualify databases must exhibit at least modest amount of original cre ative expression on the basis of the selection organization or the overall coordination of the data elem ents the data elements may themselves be original works of authorship or ma be uncopyrightable facts or similar items under decision of the supreme court in feist public ations v rural telephone service co however databases that lack at least modest amount of original 1 creative expression are not constitutionally eli gible for copyright protection in feist the supreme court held the white pages of standard telephone directories lack the modest degree of creative expression required by the constitution to sustain copyright the court rejected the socalled sweat of the brow or industrious effort standard that many of the lower appellate courts had invoked to justify copyrigh t protection for telephone directories in the aftermath of the feist decision database producers have becom concerned about the lack of protection for databases that are the result of industrious but noncreative effort that concern was exacerbated by post feist lower appellate court decisions such as warren publishing v microdos data inc the elevent h2 circuit held that warren publishings directory of cable systems th standar d reference work in classifying cable systems by the principal communitie s served had not been infringed by reproduction of the data by competitor in new format international developments added to the concerns of database producers the european

preferred approach of the higher education scientific and library interests if any new databas legislation is enacted this report summarizes the proposals for protection of noncreative database s ie collections of information and reviews the arguments for and against th proposals background although databases are not expressly included in the list of copyright subjec t matter contained in 17 usc 102 it is clear from the legislative history of th copyright act and judi cial interpretation of the act that certain databases and other collections of information are eligi ble for copyright protection if they meet the work of authorshi p standard of the act that standard as interpreted by the courts requires that work must contain at least modest degree of original creativ expression to be entitled to copyright protection prior to the supreme court decision in the feist case the lower appellate courts had protected some collections of information especially telephone directories n the basis of the industrious effort in time money and other resources that wa s expended in order to produce and maintain the collection arguably the industrious effort standard was minority view although at least four courts of appeal d applied this test to uphold the copyrightability of telephone directories some databases may include component materials that themselves may qualify for copyright protection eg abstracts annotations and other textual works in other cases the component elements consist of facts and other items that are t themselves subject to c opyright copyright law protects the expression of an author but does not protect the facts ideas discoveries systems or methods embodied in the work of authorship if the database exhibits original creative expression through the selection arrangement or coordination of the data elements copyright protection subsists i n these facets of the database protection for the original expression in the selection arrangement or coordination of the data is separate from any possible copyrigh t protection in the component parts that may be independently copyrightable another characteristic of many databases is that they are updated on fairl regular basis the additions or changes made to up date the database may or may not exhibit the modest degree of original creative expression required to sustain new copyright in the updated version of course any copyright or lack of copyright in an updated version is independent of the copyright in the original database since most databases are impersonal works copyright ordinarily endures for fixed period of years each separate copyright expires at the end of that period f years the copyright terms were extended by enactment of the sonny bon ohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98902crs4 pl 105298 october 27 19985 the rule of the shorter term is an xception to the general rule of the berne convention that6 nationals of foreign country shall receive the same protection as nationals of the countr continuedcopyright term ext ension act in the 105 congress the basic copyright term for5 th impersonal works is now 120 years from creation or 95 years from publication whichever is shorter in the postfeist era database producers are concerned not only about th existence of copyright protection in their databases but also about the standard f infringement even if the database is copyrightable users of the database may be able to copy certain data elements especially facts and may avoid copying any protected elements if users succeed in copying only noncopyrightable elements they are not liable as infringers under the copyright act computerization of data elements both makes it possible to compile extensive databas more efficiently but also makes it easier for users to extract data from database and recompile it in other formats in theory however if the first compiler of the data elements cannot reap sufficient revenues to profit from its efforts thi s development will have chilling effect on the i ncentive to produce new databases and update them on the other hand since facts and ideas have never been copyrightable society as whole has long benefitted fro m the ability of the second compiler to copy the facts collected by predecessor without forcing the second compiler to engage in wasteful duplication of effort except in those limited pre feist situations where the courts applied an industrious effort test for determining copyrightability within the european union the effort to harmonize their intellectual property laws led the member states to reexamine the nature of copyright protection fo r databases the industrious effort standard was recognized in some member state s such as the united kingdom and ireland but was not recognized in the majority of the eu states examination of this discrepancy in protection coupled with th enormo us economic significance of computerized databases led the europea n commission to recommend new form of protection for databases that are t eligible for copyright protection the new ri ght crafted by the eu database directive is essentially right f extraction with respect to collections of information that result from substantia l investments of time money or other resources protec tion endures for 15 years and is based on the european concept of related or neighboring rights that is right s similar or adjacent to copyright but also lesser in duration and scope than th protection extended to copyright subject matter since the eu databas extraction right is not based on copyright law the eu arguably s the option and has exercised the option to extend this right to foreign national s only on the basis of reciprocity in the case of copyright subject matter both the berne conv ention the principal international copyright treaty and the intellectual property standards of the world t rade organization known as trips require national treatment subject to the rule of the shorter term given th e6httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98902crs5 continued6 where protection is claimed ie national treatment the exception applies in computing the duration of copyright the country where protection is claimed may compare its copyright term with the copyright term in the country of origin and apply the shorter term for more detailed review of international

and scientific communities have expressed serious concerns abou t proposals to create any legal protection against copying of uncopyrightable databases several bills were introduced in the 105

producers for protection of databases that cannot qualify for copyright protection under the standards of the feist case essentially collections of information that result from substantial investments of time money or resources would enjoy misappropriationstyle of protection against copying for 15 years basic right this new misappropriation right would be acted as new chapter 14 of title 17 of the us code but under the authority of the commerce claus rather than the authority of the patentcopyright clause of the constitution the prohibition against copying would apply gen erally to all or substantial part of collection of information that results from the investment of substantial amounthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98902crs6 of money or other resources provided the copying causes actual or potential harm to the market for the database exclusions from protection the bill w ould exclude the following from subject matter protection 1 collections of information developed by federal state or local governments including the efforts of governmen t employees within the scope of their employme nt 2 computer programs used to operate or maintain the collection f information and 3 collections of information included in products or services tha t transmit or store or provide access to digital online communications the government collectio n exclusion would not apply however to information required to be collected by the securities exchange act of 1934 and by th commodity exchange act the computer program exclusion would n ot apply to collection of information that is incorporated in computer program that is otherwise subject to protection under the bill the express exclusion from protection for data that facilitate online digita l communications is ne w in hr 354 although the final version of the database bill in the 105 congress had attempted to achieve similar exclusion through definitionth of products or servic not covered by the bill hr 354 excludes from protection information gathered organized or maintained in order to route transmit or store digital online communications or provide access to connections for digital onlin communications this exclusion is intended to address concerns about interference with the operations of the internet by prohibiting application of the new databas rights to the data used to control the operations of the internet limitation s on the right exceptions or limitations to the new database righ t would be established by the bill in the form of permitted activities the followin g would be permitted activities in relation to use of protected collection individual use or extraction for teaching research or explanation under reasonableness standard use for nonprofit educational scientific or research purposes

genealogical informatio n for nonprofit religious purposes and use of information as part of lawfully authorized investigative protective or intelligence activities ind ividual use or extraction limitation the first limitation above is new i n hr 354 and represents major modification of the data base bill proposals the new individual use or extraction limitation is apparently int ended to respond to criticisms of opponents of protection that earlier proposals did not extend appropriate fair use privileges to database users in determining whether or not the individual use or extraction limitatio n applies hr 354 lists four factors to be weighed in evaluating the reasonableness of the use 1 commercial or nonprofit purpose 2 good faith purpose 3 appropriateness for purpose 4 incorporation of the copied m aterial in an independent work or collection and the degree of difference s between the protected collection and the subsequent work or collection and 5 whether the protected collection wa s primarily developed for marketing to persons engaged in the same field or business as the database user hr 354 specifies that in case can this limitation be applied to permi t extraction or use for sale or in co mmerce or where the use results in development of product r service which is likely to serve as substitute for the original database relationship to othe r laws

after the date of the investment that created the tion of the collection that has been extracted this clause is intended effectively to limit the protection to 15yea r period the lack of clarity of the comparable provision in st years database bills was criticized by opponents of the database proposals new language has been added in hr 354 to make cl earer the 15year limitation on duration of

favor of new legal protection against copying of noncreativ databases were advanced during the 105 congress deliberations on the bills an dth distill into three main points 1 databases have normous economic importance in the electronic digital world of today and of the future appropriate laws are needed t encourage the creation and dissemination of new and u pdated databases by protecting the investment in their development against unfair predatory conduct 2 there is gap in appropriate forms of l egal protection in the aftermath of the supreme court decision in feist publications v rural telephone service company and 3 th creation of new database extraction right wit hin the european union means that the united states must reciprocate by creating an equivalent form of protection fo r databases withi n the united states in order for united states database producers to compete effectively in the lucrative european market the new form of legal protection for noncreative databases is supported by the information industry association the american intellectual prope rty law association aipla and individual database publishers and producers incentives to encourage database investment databases producers argu that there should be doubt about the validity of their basic argument sinc collections of information whether produced through creative or industrious effort are major part of the lifeblood of modern economies modern societies mus t encourage and stimulate the development of new and updated versions of commercial databases through appropriate forms of legal protection against unfair predator copying without appropriate protection against piracy data base producers argue thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98902crs11 statement of michael kir k executive director of the american intellectual property law11 association hearing on hr 2652 the collections of information antipiracy act and hr 2696 the vessel hull design protection ac t before the house subcommittee on

unpublished statement at 412 115 f 3d 1509 11 cir 1997 banc13 thincentive to make the substantial investments necessary to develop and maintain the database will dissipate appropri ate protection for databases is especially significant for the unite d states economy since it is estimated that the united states produces nearly 6 5 percent of the worlds databases with minimum total sales of 20 billion annually11 new technological developments moreover facilitate harmful predator copying and make it necessary producers argue to respond with new forms f protection against commercial piracy in order to provide appropriate economi c incentives to create and maintain databases given modern copying technologies database originators can longer rely on contractbased licensing programs encryption technologies or the head start advantage that usually accrues t originat ors in field independent of the effectiveness of legal protection agains t copying absent appropriate legal protection gainst copying it is argued originators have compe titive advantage everyone becomes predatory copier ultimately in this kind of legal environment there is incentive to invest substantial amounts of money or other resources in the creation of new databases or the updating f existing databases the aipla points out that at the time of the feist decision most online users employ ed modems that required 6 months of continuous downloading to copy n average database of 2 billion characters of data at that speed the copying can b detected and stopped before too much data is copied at the speeds now used i n applied research the same database could be downloaded in less than 2 minutes and within few years downloading time will be down to seconds12 postfeist gap in protection before the d ecision of the supreme court in the feist case at least s ome jurisdictions recognized the industrious effort standard as basis of protection of certain kinds of collections of information while the claim of protection was not always successful the possible invocation of this standar d served as possible defense against the most egregious forms of predator commercial copying in the post feist era database producers have been deprived of this possible argument the effects of the changed legal environment can be seen in the cases lik warren publishing v microdos data inc warren publish ings cable industry fact13 book directory f cable systems had been the primary reference work for facts about the cable industry for decades the 11 circuit found infringementthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98902crs12 aipla statement at the 1997 database hearing unpublished statement at 214 id at 315 id at 416 ibid17when competitor copied the information in warren publishings reference work and resold the information in new format cases like the warren publishing decision it is argued will be replicated i n many future database cases to the detriment of the incentive to produce new products and services unless the legal regime is improved also the supreme courts decision in feist has forced database producers t confront the reality that copyright law does not provide adequate protection fo r electronic databases copyright protection can b justified on the basis of original14 creative effort in either selecti on arrangement or coordination of the contents of the database selection however is arguably tenuous basis for copyright protectio n since most databases are intended to be exhaustive in given subject field whil arrangeme nt has been and can be an original feature of printed databases according to the aipla in the case of ele ctronic databases the database producer provides neither coordination nor arrangement this in fact is provided by the searc h software system which is typically provided by outside vendors rather than by the database producer 15 as explained by the aipla the fact that the database indu stry only recently has begun to press for database protection may be partially related to lack f understanding of the implications of feist on the part of executives and of the nature of electronic databases on the part of their attorneys however the main reason is that the need for greater protection has been forced by the rapid movement f technology primarily changes in network architecture and changes in bandwidth16 until the mid1990s online databases delivered their services through close d network architecture to licensees who subscribed to the ser vice within this network architecture security was relatively easy to maintain and it was very difficult fo r unauthorize d users or pirates to breakin now every major service is moving t delivery via the int ernet and world wide web and is facing the problems inherent in the open rchitecture exemplified by the new digital networks the need fo r more legal protection has become painfully obvio us although licensing is broadly used it does not provide the degree of protection it formerly provided because f these technological changes 17 the eu directive and its reciprocity requirement the european union has recognized the economic importance of appropriate databa protection by mandating new legal prote ction of databases under its database directive american database producers can benefit from the eu database directive only if they have substantial economic presence eg subsidiary in an eu member country or if the unite d states enacts reciprocal database legislation httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98902crs13 1998 pto database conference report at 1518 ibid19 id at

disadvantages for american database producers an american firm that does not enjoy protection under the eu directive face s several possible competitive disadvantages first and most obviously it s noncopyrightable databas may be duplicated and remarketed by others second european data sources looking for fi rm to process and market raw data will be more likely to enter into contract with european company that can guarantee protection f the database versus an american company that cannot thus even if the american firm could effectively protect the database with technology an d contract law it may be at disadvantage in obtaining suppliers of data 18 nor does the united states have much leverage to compel the european union to protect noncreative databases by american companies unless the united state s enacts reciprocal legislat ion the united states is attempting to take unilateral trade action against the european union the office of the united states trad represent ative has cited the database reciprocity provision as one reason for it s placement of the european union on the 1998 priority watch list for special 30 1 review the 1998 pto dat abase conference concluded however that since the eu database directive offers additional pro tection beyond the protection required by the trips agreement the eus sui generis regime is probably n ot subject to the trips national treatment requirement19 the 1998 pto database conference also concluded that although the u directive and hr 2652 the predecessor to hr 354 are based on different legal approaches and differ in tails on the whole the comparable aspects of the two regimes far outweigh the differences according to the pto conference report20 therefore enactment of legislation like hr 2 652 in the 105 congress should satisfyth the european unions reciprocity requirement presumably the same conclusio n applies to hr 354 in the 106 congressth arguments against protection for noncreative databases protection of noncreative databases on the basis of the bills considered by th 105 congress hr 2652 s 2291 and title v of hr 2281 as passed by th eth house on august 4 1998 was opposed by groups

of past database bills pr eliminary indications are that the changes in hr 354 are not sufficient to remove the objectio ns of the higher education scientific and library interests to new database pro

discussion bil l short title database fair competition and research promotion act of 1999 placed in the congressional record by senator hatch on january 19199922 the major arguments against protection for noncreative databases are th following 1 this new protection will have negative impact on science and basi c research 2 the proposed legislation would contrib ute to the spiraling costs of access to online databases and 3 the proposals are anticompetitive and overbroad negative impact on science and basic research opponents argue that th proposals for new protection for noncreative databases threaten the open information environment that is critically important to t he progress of research and development efforts in the public and private sectors it is argued that the basic paradigm f23 data exchange is put in jeopardy by providing unprecedented new legal protection for information under hr 2652 in the 105th congress anyone who collect s information whether selfgenerate d or generated by others may be entitled to assert rights against others for the unauthorized extraction or use of the collection s contents 24 this negative im pact on science and basic research according to opponents of the bill is in marked contrast to the cur rent copyright law which has positive effect on scientific research the digital future coalition argued last year as follows under current copyright doctrine decisions about what information to include in collection or how to arrange that information may be protected one ca n copy the manner in which particular compilation is presented importantly the data which make up contents of compilations are not subject to protection instead they remain ava ilable for all to use the current state of the law has been positive one for

field are free to draw hr 2652 in the 105 congress now threatens this basic paradigm of dat ath exchange 25 opponents of new dat abase protection argued that the exceptions in the bill for nonprofit educational scientific or research uses are circular and hollow since the primary market for many databases is the nonprofit sector although th e26 exception for scie ntific research was expanded somewhat in title v of hr 2281 as passed by the house on august 4 1998 and hr 354 contains new exception for individual uses apparently these changes do not satisfy the opponents f protection for noncreativ databases they successfully argued for elimination of the collections of information antipiracy act from hr 2281 at the end of the 105th congress and apparently will oppose enactment of hr 354 in this congress increas ed access costs opponents of protection for noncreative database s argue that this new legal protection wi ll contribute significantly to increased costs for access to commercial databases data will tend to be licensed rather than shared it is asserted the new level of protection is likely to create kind of economic chain reaction within the research community for every set of research results which is mad available pursuant to license other researchers will experience new costs of data acquisition leading them in turn to consider what additional revenues they may be able to derive from the licensing of their own findings ominously it i s precisely the data which have the greatest immediate ly scientific medical or social importance and on which others dep end more heavily which are most likely to be subjected to this treatment27 the educational and scientific research communities argue that new lega l protection for noncreative databases may require researcher to obtain license to analyze or manipulate the data to reach research conclusions they argue that th prohibition s in the bill exceed unfair competition protection and would apply i n noncompetitive research context s this added layer of licensing would according to the digital future coalition stifle innovations in research28 the educational and scientific communities have not been persuaded by th counter arguments of the bills supporters that the bill requires use in commerce of all or substantial part of the database and in the latest version of the bill proof of direct harm to the actual market in order to prohibit use by nonprofit researcher the database proposals are anticompetitive and overbroad opponent s argue that most databases re already protected by

asserted an ticompetitive effects of the database bill are publishers of preexisting databases wil l be able to drive valueadded publishers out the market business costs wil l increase since additional licenses will be required recompilation or use of data solely for internal business purposes could be actionable since it may harm the potential market for the database and companies that employ scientists to engage in basic research will be negatively affected by the perceived disincentive to share data31 as an alternative to the pending database bill if any database legislation i s

hr 354 argue that the negative effects on scientific research and valueadded database publisher s could be avoided by adopting true misappropriation approach to databas protection which focuses on regulation of unfair comp etitive practices by commercial firms in providing data to consumers 33 conclusion copyright law protects works of authorship that exhibit original creativ expression
