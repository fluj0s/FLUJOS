school is at it again silencing its critics this time theyve been editing the schools wikipedia entry how do we know its the leelanau school well because the ip address that made the changes 711368126 is the school webcam try going to http711368126 and see what you get the editor obviously working for the school when confronted about the edits said the leelanau schools headmaster rich odell can answer any questions regarding changes made to this website 2313345800 he gave school president richard odells number out once this persons edits were seen wikipedia editor cleaned them up saying that wikipedia is not marketing pamphlet so what exactly did the school try and remove from the wikipedia entry well quite bit heres all the things they didnt like people knowing about the school 1 the school has had fluctuating enrollment between 60 and roughly 100 the latter being its nominal capacity over the last 20 years during the last few years the school has suffered declining enrollment and resulting increasing encumbrance on its financial structure challenges facing the school include lack of legacy students students whose parents also attended leelanau and severe shortfall in charitable giving 2 in response to these challenges the school has undertaken realignment of its core competency choosing to emphasize learning differences and has boosted tuition levels to in excess of 40000 annually the success of this realignment in stabilizing the schools fiscal status is yet to be determined 3 an organization called the leelanau alumni organization was formed in late 2005 by alumni concerned over the lack of alumni contributions to the school and the potential of closure this organization is independent from the school and intends to serve alumni interests and hopes to facilitate the schools growth as well the school employee also removed links to sites that had negative reviews of the leelanau school and the leelanau alumni organization now i know what the schools going to say about this theyll say that they were cleaning up factual inaccuracies in the entry fair enough lets check the facts number one and two can be confirmed by tax reports released by the leelanau school and available in the download section for number three you dont have to look any farther than the leelanau alumni site the schools wikipedia editor also added quite bit to the wikipedia entry making the page sound more like promotional video than an encyclopedia entry he added too much to list here but heres just sample of his unbaised view of leelanau the leelanau school is the experiencebased fivesenses learning community where students in grades 9 through 12 live and discover together on lake michigans wooded shore we build on each students learning strengths creatively using handson projects and our dramatic natural setting to help students gain fresh new sense of independence engagement and capability beyond textbooks through experience toward college with whole new sense of whats possible the leelanau experience is engaging unique memorable and life changing the leelanau staff carefully assesses the strengths of each student and builds program that pays attention to each individuals educational social physical and emotional development in todays society with all of the pressure for youth to succeed the leelanau experience allows students to significantly improve their confidence and selfesteem luckily there are people on wikipedia who want you to have the facts instead of bunch of promotional hot air unfortunately the school didnt stop at just vandalizing their own page the author continued on editing the page on charles darwin to say that darwin hated with the passion of thousand suns one and only one and that was marie curie because she stole her husbands ideas and won bunch of prizes now how do we know that these edits arent just done by students messing around online simple because when you edit wikipedia from school thats not the ip address that shows up this is one of the external ip addresses from the school staff network ive edited things on wikipedia from school and they dont show up under that ip and i know im not the only person who has edited things i have attached zip file where i saved copies of all of the page edits seeing as to how the leelanau school might see it fit to go delete those off of wikipedia as well see the downloads section to the right for honesty adb possibly related postsjanuary 8 2009 new headmaster of leelanau matt ralstonapril 22 2009 leelanau golf team phone
