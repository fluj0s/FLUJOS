transfers and repealing the geographic restrictions on conservation easements phasedown period 20022009 during the phasedown period for the estate tax calendar years 2002 through 2009 egtrra reduces estate gift and generationskipping transfer gst tax liabilities by raising the exempt amount of taxable estate the applicable exclusion amount and lowering the maximum marginal tax rate repeal of estate tax and gst tax 2010 in calendar year 2010 the estate tax and the generationskipping transfer gst tax are repealed for assets transferred at death the stepup in basis is replaced with modified carryover basis for gifts made during ones lifetime the gift tax will remain in effect with lifetime exemption of 1 million but the maximum gift tax rate will be lowered to the maximum income tax rate in 2010 sunset 2011 and after under the terms of title ix of egtrra all provisions of the act are scheduled to sunset on december 31 2010 in particular provisions of the act shall not apply in the case of title v to estates of decedents dying gifts made or generation skipping transfers after december 31 2010 as result of this sunset provision on january 1 2011 estate and gift tax law is scheduled to revert to the law that was in place prior to june 7 2001 changes relative to prior law this section emphasizes the major changes in estate and gift tax law made by the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 because the new law is scheduled to sunset on december 31 2010 knowledge of prior law remains relevant for longterm estate and gift tax planning also for most provisions prior law continued to apply until yearend 20014 the order of presentation here does not follow the sequence in the act however to make it easier to refer to the act the subheadings indicate the subtitle of title v that contains the provision being discussedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31061crs4 5decedent is the word used in the law to refer to deceased or dead person people planning ahead for their own affairs could substitute the word person or individual for decedent it is important to understand that the estate tax provisions apply to each person individually and not to married couple as unitexemption amount increased during phasedown subtitle c the amount of decedents5 assets that may be transferred free from estate tax is commonly referred to as the exemption amount or simply the exemption formally in the internal revenue code the exemption is called the applicable exclusion amount egtrra calls it the unified credit effective exemption amount referring to the unified estate and gift tax credit under prior law the unified estate and gift tax exemption amount was scheduled to rise from 675000 in 2001 to 700000 in 2002 and 2003 850000 in 2004 950000 in 2005 and finally 1 million in 2006 instead egtrra raised the exemption amount to 1 million for 2002 and 2003 the lifetime gift exemption is to remain at 1 million thereafter while the unified estate and gift exemption continues to rise during the tax phasedown period under prior law the generationskipping transfer gst tax exemption was set at 1 million indexed for inflation after 1998 the gst exemption was 106000 in 2001 and is 1100000 for 2002 for 2003 the gst exemption will have its indexed value to be determined under prior law starting in 2004 egtrra sets the gst exempti on equal to the applicable exclusion amount for the estate tax the exemption for both the estate tax and the gst tax will rise together to 15 million in 2004 2 million in 2006 and 35 million in 2009 the applicable exclusion amount for the estate tax by calendar year is shown in the middle column of table 2 the estate and gift tax are still unified from 2002 through 2009 in the sense that the exemption available at death will be reduced by the amount of lifetime gifts that claimed the gift tax exemption as an illustration assume that person had given cumulative gifts of 1 million or more during their lifetime and claimed the maximum permitted lifetime gift exemption of 1 million if the person died in 2002 or 2003 there would be exemption remaining for the estate at death because the unified credit effective exemption for 2002 and 2003 of 1 million would already be fully used however if the person died in 2009 the exemption amount still available to the estate at the time of death would be 25 million equal to the unified credit effective exemption for 2009 of 35 million minus the lifetime gift exemption of 1 million in 2010 the estate tax is repealed but the gift tax remains in place with lifetime exemption of 1 million the exemption amount continues to apply per decedent thus for couple to take full advantage of two times the estate tax exemption amount 2 million instead of 1 million in 2002 7 million instead of 35 million in 2009 they must take thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31061crs5 6the new law did not adopt the proposal offered in some of the estate tax reform bills introduced in the 106th and 107th congresses that surviving spouse be able to use any remaining exemption amount unused by the first spouse to die necessary estate tax planning steps this includes assigning ownership of some assets to each spouse independently rather than jointly6 table 2 applicable exclusion amount and maximum tax rate under the estate tax 20022011 calendar year in the case of

unified exemption or applicable exclusion amount may include up to 1 million in lifetime gifts b the same exemption amount applies to the generationskipping transfer gst tax as to the estate tax from 2004 through 2009 under egtrra the gst exemption is 1100000 for 2002 and will be indexed for inflation again in 2003 under prior law c as under prior law the gst tax rate is the maximum estate tax rate in effect for the yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31061crs6 7the applicable credit amount the unified credit is equal to the estate tax that would be due on the applicable exclusion amount the exemption the tax credit is subtracted from the tentative tax that would otherwise be due on the entire taxable estate both the exemption and its corresponding credit amount will vary according to the particular calendar year of persons death for given year the maximum dollar amount of the permitted credit is the same for all estates regardless of their size for further explanation see crs report rl31092 calculating estate tax liability during the estate tax phasedown period 2001 2009 by nonna noto 8in contrast hr 8 the death tax elimination act of 2001 passed by the house on april 4 2001 would have converted the applicable credit amount or unified credit into true exemption under that system the exemption amount would be subtracted from the value of the taxable estate before applying the graduated tax rate schedule for the same dollar amount of exemption larger estates facing higher marginal tax rates would receive bigger tax saving that smaller estates facing lower marginal rates 9for further explanation of the criteria to qualify for the deduction and the mathematical interaction between the qualified business deduction and the applicable credit amount see crs report 95416 federal estate gift and generationskipping taxes description of current law by john r luckey section on deductions from the gross estate reaching the taxable estate p 5 the new law retains the system of tax credit to deliver the tax benefits of the exemption under egtrra the applicable exclusion amount is still converted into tax credit known as the applicable credit amount or the unified credit where unified refers to the unified estate and gift tax7 8 familyowned business deduction repealed under prior law there is special deduction for familyowned business interests section 2057 of the internal revenue code or irc that special deduction of 675000 maximum in combinat ion with the applicable exclusion amount available to all estates can protect up to 13 million in estate value from taxation9 because the exemption available to all decedents will reach 15 million in 2004 the 13 million deduction would longer offer an advantage egtrra repealed the special deduction for estates with familyowned businesses as of 2004 maximum tax rates lowered during phasedown subtitle b from 2002 through 2009 during the phasedown period the same reductions in the maximum tax rate apply to both estate and gift tax rates the reductions in the maximum tax rate affect taxable estate values above 2 million the graduated rates established by prior law continue to apply to estate values up to 2 million in 2010 when the estate tax is repealed the gift tax will remain at that time the maximum gift tax rate will be lowered from 45 to 35 this is equal to the maximum rate of the income tax in 2010 under other provisions of egtrra information about the maximum tax rates in effect each year and the level of taxable estate values above which they will apply is summarized on the preceding page in the last column of table 2 the two tables in the appendix at the end of this report were created by the congressional research service to present the full schedule of graduated estate and gift tax rates for each year from 2002 through 2011httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31061crs7 because the new law is scheduled to sunset on december 31 2010 the column for 2011 reflects the law in place prior to enactment of egtrra on june 7 2001 in the appendix table a1 presents the schedule of federal estate tax rates table a2 presents the schedule of federal gift tax rates in both tables the changes in the maximum tax rate are highlighted in bold type under prior law the maximum rate of estate and gift tax was 55 on taxable estate values over 3 million in addition 5 bubble surtax was levied on estate values from 10 million to 17184000 the surtax was intended to phase out the benefit of the graduated rates the rates below 55 for large estates under egtrra the 5 surtax is repealed in 2002 also in 2002 tax rates in excess of 50 are repealed these include the rates of 55 on taxable estate value over 3 million and 53 on values from 25 million to 3 million thus in 2002 the maximum rate is 50 on taxable amounts over 25 million in 2003 estate and gift tax rates in excess of 49 are repealed this means that the tax rate on taxable estate values over 25 million will fall from 50 to 49 the remaining four rate reductions lower the tax rate on all taxable estate values over 20 million the maximum marginal tax rate will fall from 49 in 2003 by one percentage point per year down to 45 by 2007 this means that the tax rate on estate values over 20 million will be 48 in 2004 47 in 2005 46 in 2006 and 45 in 2007 through 2009 under prior law the tax rate already was 45 on taxable estate values from 15 million to 20 million the graduated tax rates in the tax brackets below 20 million will remain the same as under prior law as of december 31 2010 all of the changes made by egtrra are scheduled to sunset unless future legislation extends the provisions of egtrra or enacts new ones on january 1 2011 estate and gift tax law will revert to the law in place prior to june 7 2001 under provisions of prior law the exemption amount under the estate tax would have risen from 675000 in 2001 to 1 million for 2006 and subsequent years tax rates would revert to their priorlaw levels with maximum rate of 55 and the 5 surtax to phase out the benefits of the graduated rates see appendix table a1 for yearbyyear schedule of estate tax rates estate tax repealed in 2010 gift tax retained subtitle in 2010 when the estate tax and the generationskipping transfer tax are repealed the gift tax will remain in effect under prior law the estate tax and gift tax were completely unified and faced single exemption amount they will continue to be treated this way for 2002 and 2003 under egtraa with regard to tax liability it did not matter whether person transferred assets to another individual as gift while still alive or as bequest after death for each person the applicable exclusion amount was cumulative lifetime exemption that encompasse d both taxable gifts during life and the estate remaining at death the gift tax only became due on current basis once personhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31061crs8 10there are some exclusions from the gift tax described near the end of this section gifts covered by these exclusions are not considered taxable and are not counted against the lifetime exemption 11beginning in 2010 transfer to trust will be treated as taxable gift unless the trust is treated as wholly owned by the donor or the donors spouse under the grantor trust provisions of the internal revenue code 12the graduated rates below 35 affect the calculation of the total tentative gift tax and the tax credit on the first 1 million in giftshad given away taxable gifts10 over their lifetime that cumulatively exceeded the applicable exclusion amount in effect for the year of the gifts in 2001 cumulative taxable gifts exceeding 675000 under egtrra in 2002 and 2003 cumulative taxable gifts exceeding 1 million at the time of death lifetime taxable gifts were counted as part of the estate in calculating the tentative estate tax due in determining the net estate tax due after death the estate was credited for any gift taxes already paid hence the name unified credit the same graduated tax rate schedule applied to both estate and gift taxes under egtrra the same reduction in the maximum tax rate that applies to the estate tax also applies to the gift tax during the entire phasedown period from 2002 through 2009 for 2002 and 2003 the unified credit effective exemption increases to 1 million for both the estate and gift taxes however egtrra gradually separates the estate tax from the gift tax after 2003 the lifetime exemption under the gift tax will remain at 1 million in contrast the estate tax exemption is scheduled to rise to 15 million in 2004 2 million in 2006 and 35 million in 2009 in 2010 when the estate tax is repealed the gift tax remains in effect with an exemption of 1 million11 however the maximum gift tax rate will be lowered from 45 to 35 the maximum individual income tax rate by that time under other provisions of egtrra the 35 maximum marginal tax rate would apply to cumulative taxable gift transfers above 500000 in the brackets up to 500000 the lower graduated marginal tax rates will remain as under prior law12 the maximum value of the lifetime gift tax credit would be 330800 the tax otherwise due on the first 1 million in taxable gifts the total lifetime credit can be allocated in portions to separate gifts to protect them from gift tax cumulative gifts in excess of 1 million would be subject to gift tax on current basis for the year the gift is made if the new tax law sunsets as scheduled on december 31 2010 the cumulative lifetime exemption under the unified estate and gift tax would remain at 1 million because it would have risen to 1 million for 2006 and thereafter under provisions of prior law however the maximum gift tax rate would revert to its former higher level rising from 35 in 2010 back to 55 in 2011 see appendix table a2 for yearbyyear schedule of gift tax rates in short any lifetime gifts beyond the first 1 million would be subject to gift tax on current basis under all of the scenarios during the phasedown period from 2002httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31061crs9 13inflationadjustments that are not exact multiples of 1000 are to be rounded down to the next lowest multiple of 1000 14for further explanation of qualified tuition programs and the tax treatment and restrictions on contributions to them see crs report rl31214 saving for college through qualified tuition section 529 programs by linda levine particularly the section on coordination of contributions with estate gift and generationskipping transfer taxes p 78 15this is explained in the section below on stepup in basis replaced with modified carryover basis for inherited assets in 2010 subtitle for further explanation of the continuedthrough 2009 in 2010 when the estate tax is repealed and in 2011 and beyond under either prior law or an extension of egtrra three exclusions from the gift tax remain as under prior law gifts covered by these exclusions do not count against the donors lifetime gift exemption there is still an annual exclusion for gifts from an individual donor to an individual beneficiary up to certain dollar amount under prior law the exclusion amount of 10000 per person per year was indexed for inflation after 1998 with minimum increment of 100013 irc section 2503b the annual exclusion increased for the first time from 10000 to 11000 effective january 1 2002 there is also an exclusion from the gift tax for qualified transfers of payments for tuition or medical expenses on behalf of another individual irc section 2503e in addition there is special exclusion from the gift tax for contributions to qualified tuition programs irc section 529 contributor may give on behalf of an individual beneficiary up to five times the annual exclusion amount at one tim but have the amount treated for gift tax purposes as divided over 5 years as of 2002 this exclusion would cover gift contribution to qualified tuition program of up to 55000 five times the annual exclusion of 11000 made in the first year of 5 year period14 additional gifts to or on behalf of that beneficiary during the 5year period would be subject to the gift tax unless covered by these exclusions gifts from an individual to the same beneficiary within calendar year that are in excess of the standard annual exclusion 11000 as of 2002 would be considered taxable gifts and counted against the donors lifetime gift exemption of 1 million as under prior law assets transferred as gifts continue to receive carryover basis the donors adjusted basis for the recipient the carryover basis is used to calculate the capital gain or loss under the income tax when the gift is sold by the recipient the carryover basis for gifts will continue in 2010 when the estate tax is repealed and assets transferred at death receive modified carryover basis and in 2011 and beyond under either prior law or an extension of egtrra retaining the gift tax is intended to help protect income tax revenues hr 8 the death tax elimination act of 2001 which passed the house on april 4 2001 would have repealed both the estate tax and the gift tax like egtrra hr 8 created potential capital gains tax liability for some heirs by replacing the stepup in basis with carryov er basis for assets transferred at death15 in discussionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31061crs10 15continued potential capital gains tax liability see crs report rl30875 stepup vs carryover basis for capital gains implications for estate tax repeal by nonna noto 16an indirect skip occurs where the generation one level below the deceden t eg the decedents or daughter receives some beneficial interest in the property before the property passes to the generation two or more levels below eg the decedents grandchildren direct skip occurs where the property passes directly to the generation two or more levels below the decedent the gst tax applies to both types of transfers for additional explanation see crs report 95416 federal estate gift and generation skipping taxes description of current law by john r luckey 17the inclusion ratio is explained in more detail in footnote to the subsection near the end of this report on modifications of generationskipping transfer tax subtitle gsurrounding the passage of hr 8 tax practitioners pointed out strategy to reduce the income taxes due on the capital gains when the assets are eventually sold absent gift tax wealthy people could transfer assets during their lifetime without tax cost to friends and relatives in lower income tax brackets who could sell the assets subject to lower capital gains tax rate and possibly tax liability at all the original owner could then receive back the proceeds from the other persons sale of the asset through either gift or inheritance in an effort to discourage this potential means of evading income tax liability on capital gains egtrra retained the gift tax on transfers of assets in excess of 1 million during ones lifetime generationskipping transfer tax lowered then repealed under prior law the generationskipping transfer gst tax is levied in addition to the estate tax on amounts transferred either indirectly or directly to skip person skip person is person assigned to generation two or more generations below the transferor grandchild or more distant generation16 each person transferring assets transferor has cumulative exemption to allocate to generation skipping transfers made either during life or at death the gst tax is levied at flat rate of tax equal to the maximum estate tax rate 55 under prior law multiplied by the inclusion ratio the inclusion ratio that applies to particular transfer of property reflects the amount of the total gst tax exemption allocated to that property17 the gst tax is levied on the value of the taxable property at the time of the taxable event the transfer the gst exemption amount of 1 million was indexed for inflation after 1998 the gst exemption is 1100000 for 2002 and will be adjusted by the index for 2003 under prior law under provisions of egtrra from 2004 through 2009 during the phasedown period the exemption under the generationskipping transfer tax will be the same as the applicable exclusion amount under the estate tax thus the gst exemption is scheduled to rise to 15 million in 2004 2 million in 2006 and 35 million in 2009 see the middle column of table 2 earlier in the report as under prior law the tax rate on generationskipping transfers will be the highest estate and gift tax rate in effect for the year of the transfer under egtrra the maximum tax rate will decline first to 50 for 2002 and then gradually to 45 for 20072009 see the last column of table 2 and appendix table a1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31061crs11 18irc section 1014

if the value was lower for income tax purposes when the heir sells the asset the capital gain is calculated as the difference between the heirs selling price and the steppedup basis of the asset as of the decedents date of death the stepup practice means in effect that the capital gain on the asset during the decedents period of ownership is not subject to income taxation for either the decedent or the heir only the capital gain or loss on the asset after the decedents death is taxable to the heir when the heir sells the asset in contrast assets transferred by gift during the donors lifetime retain carryover basis the carryover basis is the decedents adjusted basis the decedents acquisition cost with certain permitted adjustments such as adding the cost of capital improvements or subtracting depreciation the use of carryover basis for gifted assets remains unchanged under the new law20 under egtrra when the estate tax is repealed in 2010 the stepup in basis provision for inherited assets will be repealed and replaced by modified carryover basis in 2010 assets transferred at death generally will be treated like assets transferred by gift with certain exceptions as with gifts the carryover basis to the recipient of the asset will be the lesser of the decedents adjusted basis or the fair market value of the property on the date of the decedents death unlike with gifts however limited basis increase to the decedents adjusted basis will be permitted for certain inherited property basis increase allowances egtrra provides two basisincrease allowances an aggregate basis increase of 13 million is permitted per decedent this 13 million limit may be increased by the amount of unused builtin losses associated with assets in the decedents estate these are losses that could have beenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31061crs12 21the builtin losses include capital loss carryovers net operating loss carryovers and losses not compensated by insurance the losses need not be assigned to the particular assets from which they originated rather the aggregate dollar amount of these losses can be added to the total basis increase available to be allocated 22qualified spousal property includes both outright transfer property and qualified terminable interest property qtip qtip is property in which the surviving spouse has qualifying income interest for life but which passes to others when the second spouse dies under terms set forth by first spouse to die the new law also establishes rules relating to the treatment of jointly held property for purposes of the basis increase 23the basis increase provisions in egtrra will hold most heirs harmless relative to prior law with respect to the amount of assets they may inherit free from either the estate tax or capital gains tax 24 not all assets are appreciable and therefore candidates to receive part of the basis increase allowance for example bank accounts or us savings bonds are not subject to capital gain or loss 25for discussion of possible difficulties in administering carryover basis regime see stefan f tucker thoughts on radical estate and gift tax reform testimony before the senate finance

he or she were still alive21 in the case of decedent who is nonresident noncitizen nonresident alien the aggregate basis increase is limited to 60000 and the provision to add unused builtin losses and loss carryovers does not apply in addition 3 million basis increase is permitted for assets transferred to surviving spouse22 thus 43 million in basis increase could be assigned to property transferred to surviving spouse 13 million plus 30 million23 these basisincrease amounts are counted in addition to the decedents adjusted cost basis in order to determine the maximum total basis for all of the appreciable assets24 in the estate for example if the adjusted cost basis of the assets were 1 million then 23 million in assets 1 million plus 13 million could be transferred to beneficiaries without any potential liability for income taxes on capital gains when the assets are sold that is the gross value of assets protected from possible capital gains income taxation to heirs is more than the 13 million and 30 million spousal basisincrease amounts the basisincrease limits of 13 million per decedent 60000 for non resident aliens and 30 million for spouses are indexed for inflation after 2010 the permissible inflation adjustment amounts are rounded down to increments of the nearest 100000 5000 and 250000 respectively the executor of the estate is given the responsibility for allocating portions of the basis increase or alternatively strict carryover basis to particular assets and consequently to particular heirs different heirs could thus receive assets with comparable current market value but very different basis and consequently very different capital gains tax implications upon sale of those assets25 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31061crs13 25continued

gains on assets held outside such accountsthe basis of any particular asset may not be increased above its fair market value at the date of the decedents death the former steppedup basis value assets not assigned any basis increase at all will receive their carryover basis the lesser of the decedents adjusted cost basis or the fair market value of the asset at date of death in between are assets that receive some amount of the total basisincrease allowance but not enough to bring their modified carryover basis up to their dateofdeath fair market value exclusion for capital gain on principal residence in addition to the basis increase allowance the income tax exclusion of up to 250000 of capital gain on the sale of principal residence is extended to the estate or person inheriting the decedents residence there is still requirement that the property have been used as principal residence for 2 or more years during the 5year period before the sale to qualify for the exclusion if the decedent met the residency requirement before death the exclusion may be claimed when the residence is sold by the estate or the heir if the decedent had not met the residency requirement and if the heir takes occupancy of the property as principal residence then the decedents period of occupancy may be added to the heirs subsequent period of occupancy to satisfy the 2year residency requirement for the exclusion property ineligible for basis increase the new law enumerates several categories of property that may not receive basis increase these include property acquired by the decedent by gift within 3 years of death and the stock of several types of foreign investment companies in addition the new law specifically provides that the basisincrease provisions do not apply to property which constitutes right to receive an item of income in respect of decedent under section 691 one implication of this provision is that the basis increase allowance cannot be applied to assets that the decedent held in tax deferred retirement plans such as traditional not roth iras and 401k plans as under prior law heirs will owe income taxes on any assets they withdraw from these inherited plans furthermore any withdrawals including investment earnings from capital gains will be taxed at the heirs ordinary income tax rate not the lower capital gains tax rate26 reporting requirements and penalties for failure to report the purpose of returns filed with the irs will change under prior law the emphasis is on determining the value of the taxable estate of the decedent under the new law

675000 for 2001 is required to file an estate tax return form 706 with the internal revenue service whether or not the estate has tax liability28 under egtrra the rules regarding filing an estate tax return will continue to apply during the phasedown period from 2002 through 2009 to estates of decedents dying up to december 31 2009 however the filing threshold will rise to the much higher applicable exclusion amounts set by egtrra 1 million in 2002 and 2003 rising in steps to 35 million in 2009 if the new law sunsets in 2011 the filing threshold would be 1 million in gross assets for 2011 and subsequent years as scheduled under prior law under egtrra the language in section 6018 of the irc referring to estate tax returns is replaced by language on returns relating to large transfers at death29 for deaths occurring in 2010 when the estate tax is repealed the executor of the estate or the trustee of revocable trust is required to report to the irs regarding all noncash assets transferred at death if the gross fair market value of the property in the aggregate exceeds 13 million if the estate exceeds this threshold all of the noncash assets must be reported even those assets whose capital gains will be shielded from future income taxation by the basisincrease allowances30 property that constitutes right to receive an item of income in respect of decedent ird under section 691 is not considered to be property acquired from decedent for purposes of the carryover basis rules consequently ird property including traditional iras and 401k plans is not eligible for stepup in basis as previously explained and need not be reported to the irs on the section 6018 return relating to large transfers the executor also must report to the irs on appreciated property received by the decedent within 3 years of death which was required to be included on gift tax return such recentlygifted property is not eligible to receive basis increase the section 6018 return is

by the irs if unable to file complete return on particular property the executor is to include description of the property and the name of every person holding legal or beneficial interest in it within 30 days of filing the return with the irs the executor is required to provide the same information in writing to the individuals receiving each property along with the executors name address and phone number there are penalties on the executor for failure to provide the required information to the irs by the required date the penalty for each violation is 10000 for failure to report on
