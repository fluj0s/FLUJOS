attitude and altitude holding see figure 11 for graphic illustration of system and for component location on the aircraft 13 control augmentation system cas cas measures forces put on the control stick andrudder pedals and compares input commands to aircraft response if aircraft response exceeds input commands cas subtracts from control surface displacement until aircraft response matches force commands similarly cas adds surface displacement if aircraft response is less than force commands 14 since cas commands large control surface movements each casaxis has selfmonitoring dual channel system if the two channels are not in agreement the monitor system shuts off cas for the malfunctioning axis and prevents control surface displacements which are not correct 15 attitude hold

pressure and static pressure lines the transducers supply dual electrical signals proportional to dynamic pressure qc the dynamic pressure signals are applied to the rollyaw computer and are used to reduce total differential stabilator deflection in roll cas at high speeds the dynamic pressure sensor is in back of door 3r 119 accelerometer assembly 221020 the accelerometer assembly contains four accelerometers each sensor provides an electrical output signal proportional to aircraft acceleration along the two sensitive axes two sensors are oriented to sense normal acceleration and two are

mechanical inputs are transmitted to flight control surface actuators by way of the control stick boost pitch compensator csbpc the primary flight control system enables the aircraft to continue mission even after loss of cas functions aircraft maneuvering capability is provided by the csbpc the csbpc is hydromechanical analog computer made up of two units pitch and roll channel assembly prca and an aileron rudder interconnect ard assembly 127 the csbpc provides the functions below ahydraulic boost of pilot effort in pitch and roll bvariable mechanical advantage of pitch and roll control

sr1f15c222gs001 220000mechanical advantage the prc is variable linkage positioned by small hydraulic servoactuator the actuator control valve is driven by an air data scheduler which uses bellows to convert pneumatic signals from the aircraft pitotstatic system into forces that position the valve as function of both airspeed and mach number 132 the prca also has pitch trim controller ptc the ptc hydraulic actuator supplies series trim to the longitudinal control system when ptc position is summed with the pilot trim position the stabilator position changes without resultant stick motion the ptc automatically compensates for trim changes caused by accelerating from subsonic to supersonic flight operating flaps or speed brake or stores separation the ptc is driven by control valve which operates as function of normal acceleration load factor and control stick position the ptc is damped to prevent disturbances from affecting the mechanical control system ptc travel is limited as the prc nears minimum ratio shutoff valve is added to the prca which defeats the ptc nose down trim limiter when cft conformal fuel tanks are installed when pitch cas is engaged the cas interconnect casi servo controls the ptc 133 the sum of prc position and ptc position drives prca hydraulic boost actuator to move all the downstream linkage and controls the stabilator actuators the prca boost actuator prevents the pilot from feeling friction and breakout forces in the rest of the linkage and prevents cas commands inserted in the stabilator actuator from backdriving the control stick the boost actuator also drives linkage input to the prca roll axis and to the ari 134 the boosted pitch commands drive the laterallongitudinal mixer linkage where pitch motions of the control system are summed with roll motions to drive the stabilator actuators each stabilator actuator is dual tandem unit which uses two hydraulic systems simultaneously to drive each stabilator each actuator includes the cas series servo which is used for both pitch and roll cas functions detent springs attached to the input levers drive the stabilators to position from which cas can control the aircraft if the primary control system becomesdisconnected the stabilator main ram and cas ram lvdt signals supply feedback information for pitch and roll cas operation 135 longitudinal mass balance is mounted on the linkage between the control stick and the prca the mass balance neutralizes the effect of acceleration on the control stick mass during maneuvers 136 if hydraulic power is lost to the prca pitch axis all prca actuators drive to predetermined failed position and lock the pilot can then operate the control stick and move the pitch control linkage without boost or pitch trim as in conventional bellcrank aircraft control system the same effect is arrived at when the pitch ratio switch is set to emerg if pitch cas can be reset and engaged with the pitch ratio switch in emerg the aircraft can be maneuvered with afcs signals 137 lateral roll mechanical control system see figure 13 the roll trim actuator position determines the control stick neutral zero force position in roll the prca roll ratio changer rrq multiplies the control stick position by the control system mechanical advantage number of degrees of aileron and differential stabilator deflection per degree of lateral stick deflection and computes the mechanical advantage the rrc is variable linkage positioned by small hydraulic servoactuator the actuator control valve is driven by two inputs 138 the first input is from an air data scheduler which determines the required roll ratio the ratio is derived from bellows which uses pneumatic inputs from the aircraft pitotstatic system to develop valve control force proportional to airspeed the computed roll ratio is compared to second input ratio that is function of pitch command supplied by linkage to the roll ratio changer from the pitch booster the ratio changer actuator drives to the smaller of the two ratios thus determined the arrangement reduces lateral control surface displacements at high speed and during the large pitch maneuvers pilot selected stick position modified by the rrc drives through hydraulic boost actuator that moves all the downstream linkage to the stabilator and ailerons actuators change 18 111figure 13 simplified lateral roll mechanical control syst em diagram 112to sr1f15c222gs001 220000the roll linkage from the prca roll booster is sent to the aileron actuator in each wing through safety override spring so that loss jam of one aileron linkage does not prevent continued use of the remaining roll control system the linkage also goes to the laterallongitudinal mixer and operates as described for the pitch system 139 lateral stick position is also supplied to the ari the ari contains separate ratio changer and boost actuator the ari ratio changer is normally set at zero ratio rudder motion in response to lateral stick travel but the same pitch input which reduces the roll ratio setting in pitch maneuvers also drives the ari ratio changer as result lateral stick movements result in larger rudder deflections as pitch maneuvering is increased pilot selected roll stick position modified by the ratio changer drives through the boost actuator that moves all the downstream linkage to the stabilator and aileron actuators 140 the rudder schedule is such that aft stick travel increases the amount of right rudder deflection resulting from right stick inputs forward stick travel increases the amount of the left rudder deflection resulting from right stick inputs the ari is deactivated above mach 10 by hydraulic switching signal supplied by the prca pitch axis flap down signal operates solenoid valve which shifts the ari schedule to the required landing configuration 141 if hydraulic power to the prca roll axis is lost or the roll ratio switch is set to emerg the ari is deactivated and prevents any lateral stick movements from affecting the rudders in addition the roll ratio changer and ari ratio changer drive to predetermined failed positions and lock the two roll boost actuators center and lock the pilot then controls the ailerons and differential stabilators at fixed ratio without boost the prca roll axis reverts to the equivalent of simple bellcrank which provides the pilot with enough handling qualities for safe return to base if the pilot switches off the prca pitch axis the roll axis continues to operate and vice versa however if either axis is switched off the mechanical ari function is deactivated 142 directional rudder mechanical control system see figure 14 the yaw trim actuator determines the neutral zero forcerudder pedal position the yaw trim actuator also provides the rudder pedal position signals to the afcs for use in yaw cas operation 143 the mechanical system from the rudder pedals to the rudder actuators is made up almost completely of pushpull cable the cable is long flexible ball bearing the control element is flat steel ribbon the ribbon runs the length of the cable and rides on steel balls contained in retainer strip on each side of the ribbon flexible case fits over the assembly although the ribbon bends in only one direction it can be twisted so that bends can be made in various directions along its length friction and freeplay are higher with this type of control system than pushpull rods and bellcranks the use of this cable has been confined to the rudder control system where there is more allowable friction and freeplay 144 the rudder cables connect to the ari box mixer linkage where lateral control inputs are added to the rudder pedal inputs the roll input booster in the ari box prevents rudder pedal inputs from feeding back into the lateral control system 145 the rudder actuators have rotary output and form part of the rudder hinge the control valve in the actuators receives enough mechanical input motion to allow one rudder to move through the travel limits even though the other rudder linkage is jammed or disabled 146 general automatic flight control system operation see figure 15 the automatic flight control system aids the primary flight controls it provides automatic take off and manual trim functions the afcs also increases control in pitch roll and yaw and extends pilot relief functions in attitude and altitude holding modes the cas control panel provides switching to engage selected modes 147 when the to trim switch is pressed the takeoff trim command is applied to the roll yaw computer the trim circuits drive the roll trim and yaw trim actuators to neutral the pitch trim actuator drives the control stick to approximately 1 aft of neutral the trim actuators move the mechanical flight

in pitch 148 the pitch roll and yaw cas switches provide the inputs to the cas logic circuits for each axis the att and alt switches provides the logic to engage the outer loops for pilot relief mode operation 149 the control stick force sensors provide electrical signals proportional to the force applied to the control stick along the longitudinal and lateral axes the rudder trim actuator position lvdt signals are proportional to rudder pedal position 150 if cas is engaged pitch force sensor electrical signals drive the stabilator surfaces together roll force signals drive stabilator control surfaces differentially but ailerons are not affected by roll force signals rudder pedal position lvdt signals drive rudder control surfaces 151 when the pilot moves the control stick or rudder pedals the mechanical control system moves the control surfaces in response to pilot commands control stick movement produces pitch andor roll signals proportional to applied forces when rudder pedals are moved lvdt signals proportional to rudder pedal position are produced as the aircraft responds to mechanical flight control system inputs rate sensors and acceleration sensors detect and measure aircraft response to the commands 152 the measured aircraft response to pilot commands is in the form of electrical signals signals resulting from aircraft response are compared to signals produces by pilot commands if aircraft response is equal to pilot command command signals are nulled and control surfaces are not affected if measured response is smaller than pilot command cas adds control surface movement and cas reduces control surface movement if measured response is larger than pilot command 153 yaw cas uses rudder pedal position signals to measure pilot commands lateral acceleration sensors and yaw rate sensorsmeasure aircraft response to pilot commands in roll cas control stick roll force sensors measure pilot command and roll rate sensors provide measured response dynamic pressure sensors limit roll cas authority as function of airspeed 154 pitch cas uses control stick force sensors to measure pilot commands pitch rate sensors and normal acceleration sensors provide measured aircraft response to pilot commands pitch signals are also applied to the prca to make sure that the mechanical system follows the cas commanded maneuver since the mechanical system follows cas commands pitch disengage transients are minimized angleofattack sensors not shown in block diagram provide the required intelligence for stall warning roll limiting and ari scheduling 155 if att is engaged inertial measurement unit pitch and roll signals are processed in the outer loops and combined with pitch and roll computation signals to command the stabilators to maintain the selected attitude if alt is engaged air data computer altitude signals and inertial navigation unit inu velocity signals are used to maintain the required altitude 156 the primary flight controls provide maneuvering abilities if the cas fails if the prca fails or if the mechanical control system linkages jam or break afcs cas continues to provide maneuvering ability 157 detailed principles of

for coordinated turns and is the cas equivalent of the primary flight control system ari the pulse width multiplier is variable gain amplifier if the aircraft flies straight and level in pitch the aircraft can be rolled without inducing any rudder movement but as the angleofattack increases roll rate signals are amplified so that at 316 aoa the pulse width multiplier provides gain of 94 to the

applies locking pressure to the mcv dynamic sleeve as the rudder pedals are moved the mcv piston moves and ports regulated hydraulic pressure to the rotary valve as the valve rotates in the command direction moving the rudder the helical coupling translates the rotation into linear extention and retraction of the mechanical followup linkage the followup linkage moves the mcv piston in direction opposite to the direction commanded by the rudder pedal when the rudder has moved to the commanded position the mcv piston is centered and rotation stops 1133 when yaw cas is engaged the solenoid valve energizes the return port opens and the pressure port closes as the pressure at the top of the cas mode switch valve is removed trapped hydraulic pressure is ported to return since pressure is available at the bottom port the plunger moves up and pressure is applied to the ehv since locking pressure is also removed from the mcv dynamic sleeve the sleeve is free to receive ehv rudder left rl and rudder right rr commands when right servo command is received the ehv plunger moves down and applies rr control pressure by way of the open cas mode switching valve to the mcv the mcv sleeve moves up and ports rr control pressure to the hydraulic rotary shaft cavities the sleeve movement moves the mcv position lvdt the rudder mcv position signal nulls the servo command when the dynamic sleeve has moved the required distance as the rotary shaft rotates to the right the mechanical followup linkage extends and drives the mcv plunger up to block the mcv rr control pressure port the mechanical followup is active even if mechanical controls are jammed or disconnected rl control pressure rotates the rotary shaft to the left and retracts the mechanical followup linkage 1134 just as primary directional controls move the rudders independently of cas commands cas commands deflect the rudders without mechanical inputs the systems work together and only limited rudder deflection is available independently the limitation is restricted by the relation between mcv plunger and dynamic sleeve if cas is off the sleeve is stationary and the amount of mechanical followup motion to block the mcv rl or rr control ports is relatively small if cas is engaged the dynamic sleeve also moves to command rudder deflection the followup linkage must move greater distance to block the ports so greater rudder movement is arrived at when yaw cas is engaged 1135 when the mcv is pressurized the damping pressure reservoir is also pressurized the damping pressure smooths out rudder movements during normal operation and prevents rudder oscillations in flight if pressure is lost to the rudder actuator rudder actuators move together in normal flight but independently of one another even if one

of the inputs are low if normal acceleration is not greater than 40g or less than 00g the top input is low if pitch cas is not shut down the second input is low if the ins is valid logic inverter 2 provides the next low if the roll attitude interlock is low the fourth low input is provided and before engagement only if pol integrator commands are within 10 026g the fifth low input is provided after engagement the same voltage which is applied to the holding coil activates or gate 1 and keeps the logic inverter 3 output low if any input to or gate 4 goes high the gate is triggered logic inverter 6 goes low switch 2 opens and the att hold switch deenergizes 1148 when the att hold coil is energized top inputs to and gates 1 and 5 are high if pitch attitude is less than 45 roll attitude less than 625 and pitch css is not in effect or gate 2 output is low and the bottom and gate 1input is high and gate 1 is triggered and provides the second high input to and gate 5 and one of the high

indicates how ins pitch attitude signals are used to hold pitch attitude during att hold operation and how adc altitude error signals and ins vertical 146to sr1f15c222gs001 220000figure 118 simplified

signals are used to hold roll attitude in att hold and alt hold operation extensions of the logic required for both modes are also shown 1152 solid state sync drives the pitch computer solid state sync drive and the roll yaw computer solid state sync drive are required to detect attitude errors since both sync drives operate in the same way only the pitch computer solid state sync drive is explained 1153 demodulated pitch attitude signals are applied to summing amplifier 8 the amplifier output is applied to zero level detector the zero level detector output is applied as an add subtract signal to pulse width modulator which is driven by 250 khz clock the pulse width modulator output is applied through normally closed nc switch 5 contacts filter and an integrator to summing amplifier 8 if pitch attitude is at 0 the 250 khz clock drives the pulse width modulator without interference from addsubtract signals so that the inverting input to amplifier 8 is series of equally spaced negative and positive pulses the amplifier 8 output is symmetrical sawtooth with an average value of zero if pitch attitude goes positive the zero level detector supplies subtract signal changing the pulse width modulator output ratio so that the positive going pulses are longer than the negative going pulses the summing amplifier output still maintains an average value of zero but the sawtooth is asymmetrical to subtract from the positive attitude signal conversely if the attitude signal is negative the zero level detector add signal causes the summing amplifier output to add to the negative attitude signal 1154 when att hold is engaged switch 5 goes to ground and the pulse width modulator output is removed from amplifier 8 since the amplifier output was held at an average value of zero before engagement any deviation from pitch attitude at the time of engagement is supplied as pitch attitude error to the pol circuit if alt hold is engaged control voltage is removed from switch 5 and the synchronizer is again enabled providing zero average altitude error output 1155 pitch computer logic see figure 1 19 1156 attitude hold the inertial navigation unit inu ins validity switch provides 28vdc signal to the pilot relief circuit if attitude signals are valid buffered and demodulated pitch signals are applied to 45 level detectors if pitch attitude exceeds45 or gate 2 is triggered and attitude holding operation is inhibited if att hold is engaged and alt hold is disengaged switch 5 goes to ground and pitch attitude error is applied to summing amplifier 12 1157 the pol engagefade signal from the pilot relief engage logic circuit exists if condition required for att hold operation are satisfied the pol engagefade signal is applied directly to switches 1 4 and 6 switch 1 applies maximum limiter bias to the fader switches 4 and 6 integrate the unlimited pitch pilot relief ppr signals 1158 altitude hold the adc supplies 15vdc signal to the inu if altitude signals are valid if vertical velocity is valid the inu supplies an altitude error and vertical velocity valid signal to the pilot relief engage logic if alt hold is engaged and operating the alt hold engaged signal is applied to 12vdc level changer and to switches 2 and 3 switches 2 and 3 control the altitude error signal input to summing amplifier 12 the 12vdc level changer disables the adc altitude error synchronizer and adc deviations from reference altitude are applied to buffer amplifier 1 inu vertical velocity is applied to buffer amplifier 2 1159 altitude error change in altitude and vertical velocity are summed at amplifier 5 to arrive at an altitude error in feet 1160 as the afcs drives the aircraft towards reference altitude the altitude error is reduced summing amplifier 9 combines altitude error with vertical velocity and cancelled pitch attitude when the alt hold engaged signal is not present logic switch 2 is closed and switch 3 is open this permits the output of amplifier 9 to appear at the input of the fader only when the alt hold engaged signal is present logic switch 2 opens and 3 closes this grounds the fader input and removes the ground on switch 2 allowing the output of amplifier 9 to be applied to summing amplifier 12 the fader output is such that it initially opposes the output of amplifier 9 providing an easyon circuit preventing large errors from being immediately switched into amplifier 12 1161 pitch pilot relief signal ppr summing amplifier 12 is the source of ppr signal if alt hold is engaged the input is altitude error plus vertical velocity and cancelled pitch attitude if only att hold is engaged the signal is pitch attitude error the signal is applied to summing 148 change 1 8all data on pages 148a and 148b deletedto

to the 625 level detectors the roll solid state synchronizer works the same as the pitch synchronizer but is not enabled when alt hold is engaged for all practical purposes the roll axis is in att

roll pilot relief rpr signal to the roll cas circuit 1164 preengage logic the roll solid state synchronizer tries to maintain the roll attitude output to an average zero level before att hold is engaged if the aircraft is rolling the synchronizer may not be able to maintain the zero level output logic inverter 6 provides high input to and gate 7 if roll rate is greater than 35sec the high 35sec level detector output triggers and gate 7 and gate 7 triggers or gate 6 and the roll attitude interlock signal prevents att hold engagement if roll attitude is greater than 625 the high output from either level detector triggers or gate 5 when the or gate 5 output is high the logic input to the pitch computer inhibits pitch attitude operation or gate 5 also triggers or gates 3 and 4 and then inhibits and gates 5 and 6 if roll force is greater than 10 lb left or right or gates 3 and 4 are also triggered with the same results but only the roll channel is inhibited because the roll force logic roll css is not transmitted to the pitch computer 1165 postengagement logic roll css may be started after engagement if lateral stick force exceeds 10 lb roll attitude holding is interrupted and resumes with new reference roll attitude when the force is removed if the limited rpr signal exceeds 174sec the high level detector output triggers or gate 6 and produces the roll attitude interlock signal and disengages the att hold switch or gate 6 can also be triggered if roll cas shuts down manually or automatically since yaw cas must be engaged and operating correctly before roll cas can be engaged yaw cas shutdown also triggers or gate 6 and produces roll attitude interlock signal 1166 autopilot caution light the auto plt caution light comes on if the att hold
