6506c29 shspec64 the wellrounded auditor msh audited lrh to firststage release on 24feb63 they went ahead he went keyedout ot then he did more research and plowed himself into the r6 bank then he developed power processes power processes were totally predicted not empirical there they should be and there they were lrh ran the power processes solo when he got to the end all that was there was beginning of track and the r6 bank he backed off and looked for processes that would enable someone to have an ability back he got third stage release va see hcob 28jun65 releases different kinds hcob 12jul65 states of being attained by processing hcob 5aug65 release stages and pp 733738 below you can run it too far into the bank ie into r6ew but now you are at the correct end of third stage release can go into and out of the r6 bank at will he is also able to have selective abilities this probably made class vi easier we are getting an interesting reaction from orgs why are you sending us class vii note at this point class vii is power auditor were releasing all the people we want on 0 i and ii the differences between the stages of release are basically differences of stability the fellow has been gotten to state where he can postulate when he is released at level iv person can remain keyedout clear until he makes postulate wrongwayto and keys himself in again and the r6 bank kicks him in the teeth power release is more stable we still dont get keyedout ot at will although it does occur sometimes during power processing it is easy to overrun first stage release we have cleared many people by the book one definition of clear and then overrun them because the auditor didnt recognize floating needle after that the pc could get very arc breaky all that could be done with pc like this is to run him on power and bring him to higher degree of stability power can also be overrun if you overrun power and then audit someone on ordinary processes within power processing you would really be in trouble because where is only one thing there to hack at and thats the h6 bank you could audit some selective abilities with power plus run him up to third stage release playing tag with the r6 bank then go on to audit r6 it is highly unlikely that person will make clear unless he has been released on power the route through the bank is too hard when it lies across an engram that will revivify you are sitting in an engram trying to run r6 and it wont asis properly that is the trouble with it it is interesting to watch raw meat on power they dont know about the r6 bank they feel wonderful and full of awe because they dont know what the hell happened or what is going on after being run on power processes technical advances are out of this world administratively r6 and power look very simple and elementary the trick in instructing class vii note class vii is now power auditing is to get the simplicity of the processes and procedures duplicated when the students are used to complexity confusion has to blow off you run power processes muzzled the study materials have more to them than would at first appear to be the case the evaluation of importances is one area for instance darkroom worker who works for lrh on weekends knows lots of tricks but he doesnt know fundamental importances lrh spotted the similarity to new auditors who arent fully trained in fundamentals they want tricks and shortcuts all of which are interesting but unimportant it isnt the tricks that get anyone anywhere that is what psychiatry and psychology do they collect tricks like stamp collectors but they have effective standard basic tech i have never heard one of them utter one essential piece of information that would have led to the resolution of case fantastic hors doeuvres main course so the study phenomenon is theres the fellow who knows it and can do it and the theres the fellow who knows all the tricks and cant do it it is out evaluation of importances you can take basically sound piece of data eg that pc who never looks at the auditor or who slews around to sit sideways in the chair is arc broken and twist it to something like never acknowledge pc until he looks at you if you did this on power the pc would go round the bend hed go on automatic there is mainline information and then there are tidbits an auditor in training should differentiate between 1 mainline data which is very senior 2 data you should know to apply the senior data 3 parsley data data that if you use it it will make you look very clever nice data but of great value when someone like lrh shifts senior datum people go adrift for instance audit the pc in front of you was senior before grades and organization an org auditor doesnt audit the pc in front of him at all the auditor now audits the process if he sees bis or runs into trouble he sends the pc to review there is policy letter now with all the things on it that could be wrong with the pc hcopl 7apr70ra green form it is asking too much to expect the auditor to pick up the right one in session with form out of 44 possibilities especially when the pc may have overts on that auditor the pc should be repaired by some other auditor the auditor may be part of what is wrong hence the pc needs another auditor review auditors must be experts in assessment they pick up any read and straighten out whatever needs to be fixed whatever the problem is it is not standard tech that is the problem the review auditor is in different division qual the d of p apparently covers also the cs post at this time is forbidden ever to interview pc or talk to an auditor about pc only what can be statisticized is the concern of the d of p total ta process run hours in session etc if the auditor is trying to talk to the d of p about cases he gets job endangerment chit if pc doesnt gain in processing there are reasons why but knowing little tricks wont tell you what they are you cant put beings together again with cute little trick the auditors job is to audit standard processes on the pc with standard comm cycle on standard gradation program the d of p does standard d of ping he goes over the session and checks ta for the session he picks up the next folder the pcs goal is not to have too much trouble in this session the total ta was 27 divs for 2 12 hour session the pc is not in trouble continue the process next folder goals or gains pc restive didnt want to run any processes how many hours were wasted here all morning and all afternoon the pc was arc broken through it all auditor to ethics and pc to review handled in this way cases keep winning if the pc rollercoasters he goes to review then to the examiner then to ethics if the pc cant spot the sp ethics just keeps working it over there is someone who uses generalities that keep the pc from spotting him if you get the right one the ptss face lights like christmas tree if you get the wrong one it wont and it is like indicating the wrong bpc the condition doesnt change that is the only time ethics lays an egg when the pts situation is handled the pc goes back to the hgc and the auditor takes up from where he left off ethical standard matches case level ethics has as purpose making people better not punishing people suppose the org exec sec sees declining stats in the hgc processing is not as successful as before now is the time to look at all the review chits he finds that auditing cycles are out on several auditors he tells the d of p the d of p sends these auditors for special training and gets their comm cycle in lower classed auditors have lower ethical standards to be an excellent review auditor you must be crackerjack assesser be able to make the emeter sit up and sing know the processes called for on the green form be able to audit routine auditing on the grades be able to cs any folder know when to send pc to review and when to review auditors know when process is flat know what gis and bis can be read from folder know what process should be run next know what is good ta and poor ta and be cryptographer so you dont get misunderstoods you should know which auditor to assign to which pc your auditors are not all releases and you know that there are quirks that make auditor audit poorly with certain pcs if you drop out one of those skills you are that much less complete auditor there is review for power processing so power processing is done in review with two class viis csing each other an auditor in training is not being trained as onemanband he gets tired and quits auditing if he tries but he should be able to do the above actions so that he understands what is happening when he audits you only change the standard pattern of the session when the pc gets nonstandard the pc goes to review when he is flat ballbearing the auditor should know how to do green form not because he is going to do one in standard session but because as the org grows more review auditors will be needed the effects of outtech are slower to appear in the hgc maybe six months than in the academy few days people are always fighting to own this planet thats silly why dont they just go ahead and own it as we are doing
