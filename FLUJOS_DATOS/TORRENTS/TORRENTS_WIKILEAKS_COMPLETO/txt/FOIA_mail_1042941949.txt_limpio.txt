from mike hulme mhulmeueaacuk to timothy carter timcarterymparistofitmitchellueaacuk subject re pattern scaling document for the tgcia date sat 18 jan 2003 210549 0000 xflowed tim as promised some comments on the paper general it is very good just what is needed and puts the last 4 years of debate into the right context general why consistently climate changes rather than the more usual climate change abstract line 10 why only quote as high as 099 and not the lowest correlation which actually is more to the point it is still very good after the 2020s even for precip abstract lines 1213 as worded this does not quite follow although i see from later that the ellipses used are at 95 confidence just because they fall outside natural variability does not in itself prove they are stat sig p2 lines 1719 and also several places on p4 impacts are mentioned but nothing said about adaptation it is really adaptation actionsdecisions that are crucial impacts are only one way to get there alter the focus p2 line 10 add necessarily between not and be aogcms may actually do not so bad job on occasions about climate change relative changes for example so dont completely dismiss this one p5 section 2 general point there is list or table or statement about exactly what these 17 experiments are the models are listed but not the experiments eg which sres scenarios did which modelling group and how many ensembles for the lay person this is not obvious p7 top line you should perhaps make the point that simple bias indices such as these may partly be explained by elevation offsets model height vs real height it is to my mind mitigating factor than can work in models favour not always it should be mentioned because the biases may not be due to just dumb models but due to simple resolution issues that can be adjusted easily similar point perhaps applies in the next about oceanland boundaries ok you could say this just shows how bad models are but it perhaps gives people poorer view of the model physics and credibility than is truly needed another point to mention in this about precip is the obvious point about decadal natural variability its tall order to expect the models to get the 196190 monthly mean precip exactly right owing to internal variability indeed give such variability can be plusminus 1020 or more it would be astonishing if they matched be generous to models i say p9 middle interesting point about echam4 and ncar masks p15 2 didnt you have a1fi available from hadley surely it could have been used to test this last sentence in this why evidently conform p16 last line interesting point here if you claim the patternscaling didnt work for the 2020s because of nat var sn ratios then why actually should we go with the raw model results anyway certainly if it is the signal we are interested in and not the noise it suggests the raw 2020s models results are misleading us this is rather circular argument i realise but the bottom line point again comes back to sn ratios and the role of nat decadal variabiliy esp for precip are we going to recommend adaptations to noise or to signals and why p17 middle what about mentioning climate sensitivity here i know its out of vogue now but pcm and nies differences are explained by overall model sensitivity arent they p17 4 this point about where agreement occurs between models is important some people i heard wigley do it recently write models off at regional scales re precip changes because they all disagree they do for some regions but not all and where we think we have physical grounds to accept agreement as legit eg uk cf ukcip02 scenario metholody then we should be confident to say so p17 line 7 why use forecasting here could confuse some people the old argument about terms i guess and again top line on p18 is dangerous we can predict nat variability in stochastic sense using ensembles change the wording p18 line 9 not only are they difficult to forsee they are simply unforseeable to significant extent because it is we who determine them i prefer to make the distinction between different types of prediction problem more explicit p18 lines 1920 i dont like the use of truth and precise here it implies strong natural science view prediction and the competence of science modellers which i think should be softened p18 4 the intermodel differences bit being as large as the interscenario differences again at least mention the role of nat var here some of these intermodel differences must be due to nat var not simply models not able to agree with each other p19 1 i think the stabilisation case should be mentioned here what about patternscaling stab scenarios as i hear it from defra and hadley here in uk this was big issue at the tgcia meeting make comment at least i think in principle pscaling is probably ok within some limits even here i think you should make reference to some of tim mitchells work here andor elsewhere since he has looked at some of these things too his thesis or his cc paper perhaps and finally wo sounding as selfserving as tom wigley it would be nice if you could reference perhaps in section 33 the hulmebrown 1998 paper in cr which was the first time i published scatter plots in this form for gcms results and possible the first time this form of presentation had been used anywhere but i stand corrected of course maybe i simply picked it up from someone else so there it is great piece of work and good write up i dont know kimmo but pass on my congratulations to him ill look out for it on the web site best wishes mike at 1342 130103 0200 timothy carter wrote dear mike and tim i know that you are not now involved in the tgcia but there is still some old baggage from the days of mikes tenure that you may have some interest to comment on concerning regional patternscaling work i attach paper that we have prepared and distributed at the latest tgcia meeting for comment last week if you have any comments i would be very appreciative i need comments if possible by the end of this week the 96 pages of scatter plots are currently enormous files and i cant possibly attach these for you to see i am working on way to get these substantially reduced in size i have attached one example so you can see what to expect any feedback would be much appreciated we intend to post this document or something like it on the ddc tim have you published any of your phd results yet best regards and happy new year tim timothy carter research professor research programme for global change finnish
