remaining regular appropriations acts for the fiscal year will be completed is uncertain3 media reports have suggested that funding for most of the regular appropriations acts may be provided under tinuing appropriations act into the early months of the 2009 session when the issue of such funding can be revisited with the new president such course of action however is not immune from criticism because it would impose restri ctive funding levels on agencies for considerable portion of the fiscal year ie about four months or more which could undermine agency planning and efficient operations this report provides information on the consideration of annual appropriations acts in connection with lameduck ssions occurring be tween 1994 and 2006 as background for the possibility of such session this year background lameduck session occurs during the pe riod following election day which is the tuesday after the first monday in n ovember of each evennumbered year and before the convening of new congress bout two months later in early january under the 20th amendment to the constitution c ongress is required to convene at noon on january 3 unless by statute it desi gnates different day for convening in recent years new congress has convened during the first week of january in each oddnumbered year but not necessarily on january 3 in 2009 january 3 occurs on saturday4 lame duck session of congress is one that takes place after the election for the next congress has been held but befo re the current congress has reached the end of its constitutional term under contemporary conditions any meeting of congress that occurs between congre ssional election in november and the following january 3 is lame duck session the significant characteristic of lame duck session is that its participants are the sitting members of the existing congress not those who will be entitled to sit in the new congress5 several factors may cont ribute to the occurrence of lameduck sessions including the need to deal with unfinished business or urgent matte rs that have arisen suddenly the consideration of legisl ative proposals particularly those with significant budgetary implications some times is postponed until lameduck session often to avoid the need for politically difficult votes before an electionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34597crs3 6 crs report rl33677 ibid identifies 15 meduck sessions between 1935 and 2004 see table 1 and one more occurred in 2006 according to the report the possibility of lame duck session of congress in the modern sense began in 1935 when the 20th amendment to the constitution took effect p 1consideration of measure raising th statutory limit on the public debt by 800 billion to 8184 trillion for example wa s postponed in 2004 until the lameduck session the measure was signed into law by president george w bush on november 19 2004 as pl 108415 118 stat 2337 lameduck sessions have been used in recent years for various purposes including efforts to bring action on regular appropriations acts for fiscal year to close in addition to action on appropr iations measures meduck sessions have been used for such matters as the consid eration of authorization measures for the department of defense and intelligence ac tivities the finaliza tion of measure establishing the department of homeland security and impeachment proceedings against president bill clinton by the house sixteen lameduck sessions occurred between 1935 and 20066 ten of the 16 lameduck sessions occurred during the halfcentury covering the decades of the 1940s through the 1980s an average of one every five years the use of such sessions however has become more common in recent years occurring about twice as frequently th remaining six lame duck sessions which occurred in 1994 1998 2000 2002 2004 and 2006 covered span of seven congresses an average of one about every 23 years as table 1 shows lameduck sessions during this period occurred

occurred in presidential election years 2000 and 2004 as well as nonpresidential election years overview of action on appropriations acts before during and after lameduck sessions in recent years covering calendar years 1994 through 2006 lameduck sessions have in some instances afforded cong ress an opportunity to complete action on regular appropriations acts for fiscal ear in other instances lameduck sessions played little or role in this regard as action on regular appropriations acts was completed well before or after lameduck session total of 67 regular appropriations acts were enacted into law during this period including 34 that were enacted separately and 33 that were incl uded in omnibus measures nine regular appropriations acts were not enacted into law in addition total of 42

resolutions have been an integral component of the annual appropriations pr ocess for decades whenever action on one or more of the regular appropriations acts for fiscal year is incomplete after the fiscal year has begun continuing appropriati ons acts are used to provide stopgap funding thereby avoiding disruption in agency operations one issue that arises under these circumstances is how continuing appropriations acts will be used to resolve any funding impasses and the appropriate dura tion of any period for their use9 continuing resolutions may have rela tively short duration in the expectation that action on the regular appropriations acts will be concluded within several days or weeks in this case multiple shortterm continuing resolutions often are used to buy time for ongoing negotiations on regular appropriations acts while maintaining incentives to complete the negotiations alternatively continuing resolutions may have longer duration to postpone final action on appropriations decisions until after elections or into the beginning of the next congressional session finally continuing re solution may provide funding for the remainder of the fiscal year continuing appropriations acts have been an important element of action on annual appropriations measures before during and after some of the six lameduck sessions held during the 19942006 period but not others see table 3 total of 42 continuing appropriations acts were enacted into law during this period in total 27 of the 42 continuing appr opriations acts were enacted into law before the
