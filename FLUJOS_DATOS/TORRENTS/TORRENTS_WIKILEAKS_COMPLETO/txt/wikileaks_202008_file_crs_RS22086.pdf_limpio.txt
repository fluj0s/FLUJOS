resolution provides blueprint for all federal revenues and spending over multiyear period alt hough it does not require the presidents approval the budget resolution does establish limits for all discretionary and mandatory spending for the coming fiscal year once approved the discretionary spending total is allocated to the appropr iations committees where it is subdivided among their various subcommittees the resolution also might require reductions in mandatory spending particularly in years when the federal deficit is expected to be large when this occurs the resolution issues reconciliation instructions to various authorizing committees requiring them to report changes to legisla tion to reduce spending on mandatory programs under the committees jurisdiction the repor ted language from each committee is then sent to its respective budget committee by da specified in the resolution where it is packaged with language from other committees into an omnibus reconciliation bill which is taken to each chambers floor for c onsideration each chambers approved reconciliation bill is then sent to conference committee and final conference measure must be approved by both chambers and sign ed by the president before it becomes law for more on budget reconciliation procedure see crs report 98814 budget reconciliation legislation development and consideration by bill heniff jr and crshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22086crs2 1 the one exception is the child nutrition prog rams which are under the jurisdiction of the committee on education and the workforce in the house and the agriculture committee in the senate 2 the major mandatory farm commodity price and income support programs include those for wheat feed grains oilseeds cotton rice peanuts sugar and dairy the largest mandatory conservation programs include the conservation reserve program the environmental quality incentives program the conservation security program and the wetlands reserve program for more background see crs report rs20848 farm commodity programs short primer and crs report rl32940 agriculture conservation programs scorecard report rl30458 the budget reconciliation process timing of legislative action by robert keith usda mandatory spending defined approximately threefourths of total sp ending within usda is classified as mandatory which by definition occurs outsi the control of th annual appropriations process currently accounting for the vast majority of usda mandatory spending are the farm commodity price and income support programs the food stamp program and most child nutrition programs the federal crop insurance progra m and various agricultural conservation and trade programs legislative authority for these programs is under the jurisdiction of the house and senate agriculture committees1 hence any reconciliation instructions that are delivered to the agriculture committees could potentially impact spending for any or all of these programs all of the farm commodity support progra ms and mandatory c onservation and trade programs are funded through the borrowing authority of usdas commodity credit corporation ccc not by an appropriation to the programs2 the ccc has 30 billion line of credit with the us treasury that it taps to provide the nnual required funding of these programs as well as for other purpos because the ccc typically spends more than it takes in its losses must be replenished annually through congressional appropriation so that its 30 billion borrowing authority is not depleted administration and congressional budget forecas ters estimate each year the projected cost of the commodity support programs however because farm crop prices are highly variable and difficult to estimate these programs ultimate ly receive such sums as necessary under their farm bill authorization re gardless of budget estimates the mandatory conservation programs for th most part have fixed authorization level each year stated either in dollars or enrolled acreag as mandated by the 2002 farm bill with funding from the ccc not from an appropriation like the commodity support programs crop insurance also receives such sums as necessary regardless of budget estimates its funding comes through an i ndefinite appropriation to the federal crop insurance fund fund separate from the ccc the mandatory usda food and nutrition programs food stamps and child nutrition pr ograms receive an annual appropriation but funding levels ultimately are termined by the eligibility rule s established in current food and nutrition lawshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22086crs3 cbos baseline budget for usda each year the congressional budget office issues baseline budget for all federal spending under current law over 10year pe riod projected spending in the baseline budget represents cbos estimate at particular point in time of what federal spending and revenues will likely be unde r current law if policy ch anges were made over the projected period the cbo baseline serves as benchmark or starting point for future budget analyses for example whenever any new legislation is introduced that affects federal mandatory spending its impact is measured by cbo as difference from the baseline table 1 below represents cbos most recent fficial baseline march 2005 estimate for the major mandatory usda programs it represents cbos estimates under current law eg the 2002 farm bill for the commod ity support and conserva tion programs given current cbo projections for economic and ma rket conditions for the next five years budget reconciliation instructions that are given to the agriculture committees are measured against the cbo baseline this means that any legislation that the committees are required to report will be scored by cbo against the baseline to determine whether the committee is in compliance with the reconciliation instructions table 1 cbos march 2005 baseline budget estimates for selected mandatory usda

respectively the approved resolution contained reconciliation instructions that require the house and senate agriculture committees to report legislation reducing spending on mandatory usda programs

the 2006 crop year were already dis bursed by usda by the time pl 109171 was enacted in february 2006 hence the required reduction in the advance payment rate s from 50 in 2005 to 40 in 2006 could not be achieved this means all of the estimated savings of 1452 billion is recognized in 2007 when the advance payment rate falls to 22 as required by pl 109171 agriculture committees were to achieve the required spending reductions instead those decisions were left to the committees agricultural cuts in the fy2006 reconciliation act pl 109171 the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 s 1932 incl udes net reductions of 27 billion over five years for usda manda tory programs the final law actually contains 37 billion in gross reductions to usda programs however conferees also adopted twoyear extension of dairy inco support program at twoyear cost of nearly 1 billion which brought the net usda reductions to 27 billion included in pl 109171 is 17 billion reduction in farm commodity support

development programs as scored by cbo over fiveyear period fy2006fy2010 houseproposed reduc tions to food stamp spending were not included in the conference measure the process of determining the specifics of the usda spending reductions began earlier in 2005 when the house and senate agriculture committees sub mitted to their respective budget committees their recommendations for cuts as required by the fy2006 budget resolution the net usda cut of 27 b illion in the final law is below both the housepassed 35 billion and senatepassed 30 billion levels the following text and table 2 provide comparison of the usda provisions in the final law to what was recommended in the house and senatepassed bills farm commodity programs pl 109171 achieves mo st of its reductions to farm commodity spending by changing the timing of farm commodity direct payments without reducing the overall leve l of payments to farmers current program law allows recipients of direct payments to receive up to 50 of their payments in advance of the end of the crop year pl 109171 reduces the dvance payment rate to 40 in the 2006 crop year and 22 in 20073 the agreement also includes the elimination of the upland cotton step2 program effective august 1 2006 in response to brazils successful challenge of the program in the world trade organization wto offsetting just over onehalf of the 17 b illion in farm commodity program savings is provision in pl 109171 that reauthoriz the expired milk income loss contract milc for two years until september 30 2007 extension was supported by small to moderatesized dairy farms which are the primary beneficiaries of this program that makes payments to dairy farmers when market prices fall below target price some farm commodity groups were opposed to milc prog ram extension as long as its estimated 998 million cost had to be offset with comp arable reductions in other usda programs for more information on milc see crs issue brief

eqip spending for the csp is limited to 1954 billion over five years 20062010 and 565 billion over 10 years for savings of 649 million over the fiveyear horizon of the reconciliation bill pl 109171
