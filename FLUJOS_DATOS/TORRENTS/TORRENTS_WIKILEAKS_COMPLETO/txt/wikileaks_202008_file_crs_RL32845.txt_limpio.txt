attempt on yushchenkos life during the campaign which has left him disfigured in foreign policy ukraine seeks closer ties with the european union nato and the united states with the goal of eventual

introduction ukraines orange revolution has sparked great deal of interest in congress and elsewhere some hope that ukraine may finally embark on path of comprehensive reforms and euroatlantic integration after nearly 15 years of half measures and false starts others are interested in the geopolitical implications of prowestern ukraine in the former soviet region and in relations between russia and the west some analysts detect new wave of democracy sweeping the postsoviet region from the rose revolution in georgia in november 2003january 2004 to the orange revolution in november 2004january 2005 and possibly to the overthrow of the regime in kyrgyzstan in march 2005 in 2004 many observers believed that ukraine was at key period in its transition that could shape its geopolitical orientation for years to come in part due to presidential elections held on october 31 november 21 and december 26 2004 in their view the elections could move ukraine closer to either integration in euro atlantic institutions real democracy and the rule of law and genuine free market economy or they could move ukraine toward russian sphere of influence with managed democracy and an oligarchic economy for the past decade ukraines political scene had been dominated by president leonid kuchma and the oligarchic clans regionally based groups of powerful politicians and businessmen that supported him the oligarchs chose prime minister viktor yanukovych as their candidate to succeed kuchma as president the chief opposition candidate former prime minister viktor yushchenko was proreform prowestern figure international observers criticized the election campaign and the first and second rounds of the election as not free and fair citing such factors as governmentrun media bias in favor of yanukovych abuse of absentee ballots barring of opposition representatives from electoral commissions and inaccurate voter lists nevertheless yushchenko topped the first round of the vote on october 31 by razorthin margin over yanukovych other candidates finished far behind after the november 21 runoff between the two top candidates ukraines central election commission proclaimed yanukovych the winner yushchenkos supporters charged that massive fraud had been committed hundreds of thousands of ukrainians demonstrated against the fraud in what came to be known as the orange revolution after yushchenkos chosen campaign color they blockaded government offices in kiev and appealed to the ukrainian supreme court to invalidate the vote the court invalidated the runoff election on december 3 and set repeat runoff vote on december 26 yushchenko won the december 26 revote crs2 with 5199 of the vote to yanukovychs 4419 after several court challenges by yanukovych were rejected yushchenko was inaugurated as president of ukraine on january 23 2005 on february 4 2005 the ukrainian parliament approved president yushchenkos appointment of yulia tymoshenko as prime minister of ukraine by vote of 3730 tymoshenko is an energetic charismatic leader with sometimes combative political style who campaigned effectively on yushchenkos behalf she is controversial figure due in part to her alleged involvement in corrupt schemes as businesswoman and government minister during the kuchma regime1 during the campaign yushchenko accused the authorities of trying to poison him on september 6 2004 he fell seriously ill shortly after attending dinner with the chief of the ukrainian security services after his condition worsened he was rushed to the rudolfinerhaus medical clinic in austria doctors were unable to determine the cause of the illness at the time yushchenko soon resumed campaigning but his face was and remains severely pockmarked on december 11 doctors at rudolfinerhaus reportedly with the help of american experts confirmed that yushchenko had been poisoned with massive dose of the toxic substance dioxin ukrainian law enforcement officials are investigating the poisoning plot and say they have developed information on who was behind the plot and who carried it out but have not disclosed details ukrainian officials have hinted that the poison may have come from russia although the ukrainian government has not accused the russian government of complicity in the plot ukraines priorities president yushchenko has set an ambitious set of domestic priorities for the new government yushchenko has said that his key domestic priorities include reducing the size of the unofficial shadow economy especially by reducing taxes and eliminating loopholes and exemptions for favored businesses another key goal is to maintain macroeconomic stability although this effort may be challenged by campaign promises to increase social spending yushchenko has pledged to fight corruption critical problem in ukraine including through administration and civil service reforms other priorities include improving the independence and effectiveness of the judiciary and attracting foreign investment2 yushchenko has vowed to prosecute those guilty of crimes including fraud during the election the 2000 murder of ukrainian journalist georgi gongadze and the attempt on yushchenkos own life yushchenko has said that he does not envision wholesale reversal of the sometimes dubious privatization deals of the past 15 years possible relief to some oligarchs but that he will revisit highly questionable privatizations that have occurred in recent years which he has estimated at about 2030 firms in addition 1 for more background on the ukrainian presidential election see crs report rl32691 ukraines political crisis and us policy issues by steven woehrel 2 text of president yushchenkos speech to the world economic forum ukrainian tv kanal 5 as carried by the bbc monitoring service january 28 2005 crs3 he has raised the possibility that current owners could keep the companies if they paid the government an additional amount to make up the difference between the fair market price of the firm and what they originally paid for it one privatization the huge kryvrizhstal steel works has already been overturned according to press reports international steel companies including us steel and russian firms may be interested in bidding on the firm if it is reprivatized however prime minister tymoshenko has resisted limiting the number of deals under investigation and has launched much broader inquiry that could involve hundreds or even thousands of firms western observers have expressed concern that the current uncertainty over privatization and other government policies is having an unsettling effect on ukraines investment climate efforts to overturn previous privatizations could result in lengthy court battles in addition potential longterm investors could fear that their property could be expropriated if politicallydetermined rules of the game are changed once again in the future instead of firmly establishing the rule of law some western observers are also concerned that the government seems focused on boosting tax collection to pay for increased social spending promised during the campaign rather than on reforms that would attract more foreign investment indeed such efforts undertaken without consultation with investors and in the hands of corrupt bureaucrats could actually discourage investment they say foreign policy yushchenkos main foreign policy priority is expanding ties with the eu seeking eu designation as market economy as first step after ukraine receives world trade organization membership which yushchenko wishes to achieve by the end of 2005 ukraine will seek free trade zone with the eu and by 2007 start talks on eu membership an objective yushchenko believes can be achieved within decade however eu officials have tried to downplay the chances for ukrainian membership in the eu instead calling for practical steps to improve relations within the context of the eus european neighborhood policy which could include eu designation as market economy assistance for ukraines wto candidacy feasibility study for an euukraine free trade area and other forms of assistance president yushchenko has said that he favors eventual ukrainian membership in nato the kuchma regime at least until the presidential election campaign when it recanted under alleged russian pressure claimed to seek membership in the alliance and the united states expressed support for ukraines aspirations nato and ukraine formed natoukraine commission to foster cooperation in 2002 the two sides developed natoukraine action plan to outline goals and objectives for political and military reform in ukraine however ukraines lack of progress on reforms under kuchma made such efforts largely ineffective in april 2005 nato launched an intensified dialogue with ukraine on its membership aspirations and relevant reforms without however committing the alliance to any decision on membership ukraines foreign minister boris tarasyuk has said that ukraine could be ready to join nato as early as 2008 other observers are more skeptical noting that ukraine faces serious challenges in reforming its armed forces and security sector not to mention the broader tasks of political and economic reform moreover crs4 some members of the government including those with economic ties to russia are skeptical or opposed to nato membership for ukraine president yushchenko has noted that another obstacle to ukraines possible nato membership is lack of public support at present according to june 2005 poll by the razumkov center for economic and political research and the kyiv international institute of sociology 567 of those polls were opposed to nato membership for ukraine while only 224 supported the idea ukrainian officials believe an extensive public information effort will be needed to strip away misinformation and sovietera prejudices toward the alliance some observers have speculated that stronger push for nato membership may have to wait until after the march 2006 elections in order to avoid giving the governments opponents campaign issue particularly in eastern ukraine where prorussian sentiments are strong3 yushchenko has tried to allay public concerns by saying any future decision to join nato would be put to national referendum first despite russias strong support for his opponent during the campaign yushchenko has said that he favors good relations with russia in his first foreign visit as president yushchenko held meetings with russian president vladimir putin in moscow on january 24 yushchenko called russia permanent strategic partner of ukraine but insisted that he will subordinate participation in the russianled single economic space ses and the commonwealth of independent states to his goal of euroatlantic integration specifically ukrainian leaders have said that they may consider free trade zone within the ses but not customs union or currency union russian observers have expressed concern about how ukraines new european orientation and reprivatization plans will affect bilateral economic ties about 90 of ukraines oil and 80 of its natural gas supplies come from russia and substantial portion of the rest is transported through russia russia is also ukraines largest export market absorbing 18 of ukraines exports in 2003 78 of russias lucrative natural gas exports to western europe transit ukraine4 russia and ukraine have established joint consortium to supply western europe with gas but ukraine is seeking to include western european firms as well russian businessmen could see advantages in more favorable climate for foreign investment in ukraine ukrainian officials have assured russia that ukraines nato aspirations would not affect the status of the russian black sea fleet in ukraine which holds lease there through 2017 one possible area of controversy between moscow and kiev could be policy toward postsoviet countries moscow may be uneasy about ukraines possibly more active role in the guam group of countries an acronym based on the countries forming it georgia ukraine azerbaijan and moldova although having widely varying political and economic conditions these countries have in common desire 3 discussions with ukrainian experts february 2005 4 eia country analysis brief ukraine january 2005 department of energy website httpwwweiadoegovemeucabsukrainehtml crs5 to maintain their sovereignty that they sometimes see threatened by russia and the russiandominated cis one particular area in which these countries could work together is diversification of sources of energy and the pipelines needed to transport that energy ukraine is currently studying how to move forward with plan to extend into poland an oil pipeline that currently runs from an oil terminal at the port of odesa to the town of brody the odesabrody pipeline could be used to transport caspian sea oil through georgia across the black sea in tankers to the odesabrody pipeline and into western europe thereby reducing dependence on russian oil and reducing russias control of regional pipelines however due to decision of the previous government the pipeline currently runs in reverse mode transporting russian oil to the odesa terminal and out to the mediterranean sea the new government faces problems in restoring the pipelines originally planned direction including lack of oil supplies to fill the pipeline and russian pressure on ukraine and on potential oil suppliers such as kazakhstan aimed at thwarting the project ukraines new government supports moldovas desire to reintegrate its breakaway transnistria region in may 2005 ukraine offered peace plan for moldova that called for internationally monitored elections in transnistria and for transnistrias autonomy within moldova moldova welcomed kievs initiative in principle but reacted cautiously to some of its details and omissions noting for example that it does not mention the need for russian troop withdrawal from moldova perhaps as importantly ukraine has promised to crack down on the lucrative often illegal trade between ukraine and transnistria this could put heavy pressure on the transnistria leadership perhaps making negotiated settlement more likely russia would likely view ukraines stance as an effort to undermine moscows influence in transnistria another potential problem for russianukrainian relations is the fear expressed by some russian observers that ukraine may try to export its democratic revolution to other countries in the region including belarus and even russia itself although ukrainian leaders deny such intentions ukrainian ngos that played an important role in the orange revolution including the youth group pora have expressed such goals moreover the very existence of successful democratic revolution could raise expectations in other cis countries particularly if ukraines reforms result in greater prosperity for ukrainians the fear of color revolution in belarus has led belarusian dictator aleksandr lukashenko to intensify crackdown on opponents independent media and ngos he has also put in place sovietstyle policies to reduce contacts between belarusians and foreigners who could contaminate them with democratic ideas crs6 prospects ukraines new leaders have several things in their favor in their efforts to reform ukraine and move it closer to the west ukraines new leadership has many competent figures is fairly young and highly motivated yushchenko enjoys strong public support at present the former regimes supporters have been thrown into disarray by their unexpected defeat and many of them appear to be currying favor with the new regime with the exception of the communist party which has declined in importance since independence the opposition does not have set of principles to provide cohesion ukraine is also benefitting from substantial goodwill from the united states and other western countries in marked contrast to the former regime which had isolated itself from west by its actions and had become more dependent on russia potential obstacles however ukraine faces many obstacles as well many of its goals such as rooting out corruption may be easy to proclaim but very difficult to achieve it is possible that some in the new leadership many of whom served in the old regime may be tempted to engage in corruption and use that regimes quasiauthoritarian methods related issue is whether those businessmen who supported the orange revolution will expect to become the new oligarchs of ukraine and if so what impact possible struggle between old and new oligarchs over ukraines economic resources will have on reform efforts yushchenko has formed centerright propresidential bloc called peoples unionour ukraine peoples unionour ukraine is in loose coalition with other groups including the yulia tymoshenko bloc the centrist party of industrialists and entrepreneurs led by first deputy prime minister anatoli kinakh the centrist peoples party headed by parliament chairman volodymyr lytvyn and the leftist socialist party reforms have been slowed as much by dissension within the coalition than effective opposition by the communists and supporters of oligarchs from eastern ukraine personal and policy conflicts among coalition partners have led to confusion over the governments policies on many issues including such fundamental ones as the proper amount of government control over the economy key legislation needed for ukraines admission to the world trade organization including legislation to fight ukraines severe optical media piracy problem has been voted down by the parliament including by some members of yushchenkos own peoples unionour ukraine group putting yushchenkos goal of joining the wto in 2005 in jeopardy some ukrainian and western observers have complained that part of the problem is that president yushchenko has not exercised consistent discipline and leadership over the government and parliament to push needed legislation through and to ensure coherent government policies other observers note that the new government has been in place only few months and that these problems could be eased after the march 2006 parliamentary elections when stillpopular yushchenko may be able to form more homogenous majority in parliament crs7 regional differences in ukraine may present another problem ukrainian officials have sharply warned leaders in eastern ukraine that any talk of separatism would be severely punished yushchenkos electoral support was overwhelmingly concentrated in western and central ukraine due in part to the previous regimes propaganda that attempted to portray yushchenko as antirussian and an extreme nationalist even as nazi the new government may face challenge in gaining the support of people in eastern and southern ukraine in contrast to setbacks on some reform issues the new government has moved more quickly to replace loyalists of the old regime in public posts particularly in eastern ukraine moreover ukrainian prosecutors have arrested several leading figures of the old regime for various crimes ranging from extortion to electoral fraud to fomenting separatism many of these people are closely associated with the donetsk region and yanukovych reprivatization could also lead to largescale redistribution of property from oligarchs in eastern ukraine to those supporting yushchenko efforts by yanukovych and others to characterize these actions as political repression and create massive public support for themselves in eastern ukraine have so far failed nevertheless the government remains more popular in western ukraine than in the east in june 2005 poll taken by razumkov center for economic and political research and the kyiv international institute of sociology in western ukraine 549 strongly supported yushchenkos actions as president 554 felt the same way about prime minister tymoshenko while the corresponding figures in eastern ukraine were 189 for yushchenko and 75 for tymoshenko this may be because some people from eastern and southern ukraine may fear transfer of economic resources from their regions which they view as more productive to poorer regions in western ukraine also yushchenkos opponents could play on fears that the new government will pressure people in eastern ukraine which is overwhelmingly russianspeaking to speak ukrainian ukrainian officials have assured people in eastern ukraine that efforts would be made to force use of the ukrainian language on people in their region for example by shutting down russian language schools and media there is also the possible impact of the constitutional changes approved by the ukrainian parliament in december 2004 as part of political compromise to end ukraines political crisis the reforms which will reduce the powers of the presidency which will go into effect in september 2005 if new law on local government is passed and in january 2006 if it is not under the reform the cabinet of ministers will be the supreme executive body in ukraine the president will have the power to nominate the prime minister the foreign minister and the defense minister subject to the approval of parliament the rest of the government will be nominated by the prime minister and approved by the parliament it is possible that these changes could be struck down as result of legal challenges however if the reforms go into force they will make the results of the march 2006 parliamentary elections even more important international obstacles ukraine could also face important international obstacles perhaps the most important is russias policy it is unclear whether russia will genuinely treat ukraine as an equal instead of attempting to pressure or punish the new leadership russia could attempt to manipulate ukraines heavy dependence on russian energy however as in the past russias leverage is somewhat limited crs8 by ukraines control of the main pipelines for russian energy exports to western europe some analysts point to several recent incidents that could indicate that russia may be trying to pressure kiev by playing the energy card in april 2005 gasoline prices rose sharply in ukraine prime minister tymoshenko accused russian energy firms which control not only most of ukraines crude oil supplies but also its oil refineries and filling stations of abusing their market position she imposed price controls and called for greater government control of ukraines energy sector the russian firms responded by cutting off gas supplies president yushchenko stepped in sharply criticized tymoshenko for her nonmarket approach to the problem and reached compromise with the russian firms in another case the russian natural gas giant gazprom has called for large increases in the price of gas to be supplied to ukraine in 2006 and has accused ukraine of massive theft of russian gas sharply increased energy prices could have negative impact on ukraines economy the ukrainian government has responded to the problem by trying to diversify its supplies of oil and natural gas through negotiating deals with turkmenistan kazakhstan and iran among other countries another way russia could attempt to punish kiev could be to bolster pro russian opposition forces in eastern and southern ukraine however it should be noted that russia has in the past tried to play upon regional differences in ukraine most recently during the presidential elections without success ukraines reform efforts might be hampered if western countries do not provide timely and effective assistance which could come in the form of political support economic aid lower trade barriers and support for wto membership indicators of success one indicator of success will be if ukraine experiences substantial increase in foreign investment this would indicate that investors are happier with ukraines progress in such areas of perennial concern as fighting corruption reducing red tape and enforcing the rule of law perhaps more important indicator from the point of view of the majority of ukraines population would be an increase in living standards and decrease in poverty in recent years ukraine has experienced high levels of economic growth but the benefits of that growth have not reached all sectors of the population international observers may closely monitor the march 2006 parliamentary election campaign for signs of media access for opposition candidates improved election laws and administration and other signs of free and fair elections in the longer term ukraines foreign policy success may be measured by whether it receives signal from the eu that it can be considered candidate for eventual eu membership and similar signal from nato perhaps in the form of membership action plan however it should be noted that success in these areas depends as much or more on such issues as intraeu politics transatlantic ties and perceptions of russias future as on ukraines own efforts france germany and other eu countries stress the importance of maintaining good relations with moscow in order to preserve regional stability and economic ties with russia in addition possible membership for ukraine poses difficult problems of its own for the eu which is struggling to incorporate ten recently admitted members as well as possible crs9 future new members in turkey and the balkans on the other hand many of the eus new members in central europe especially poland and the baltic states are looking to counterbalance russia and stabilize their eastern borders they continue to push strongly for one day incorporating ukraine and possibly other postsoviet countries into the eu if ukraine becomes discouraged about the prospects for joining the eu due to the eus current difficulties it is possible kiev could push more strongly for nato membership in bid to show tangible gains in its euro atlantic integration efforts us policy us officials supported the orange revolution in ukraine warning the former regime of negative consequences if it engaged in fraud sharply criticizing fraud in the november 21 runoff vote and hailing yushchenkos ultimate victory the united states also provided assistance to ukrainian nongovernmental organizations that monitored the election and conducted exit polls to detect fraud5 in show of support for the new leadership president bush and other nato leaders met president yushchenko at nato summit on february 22 2005 president yushchenko visited the united states from april 47 and had meetings with president bush and secretary of state rice yushchenkos address to joint session of congress on april 6 was interrupted by several standing ovations the two leaders signed joint statement that hailed ukraines democratic revolution and said the two countries would work to spread freedom in the region as well as throughout europe and beyond including in belarus and cuba it restates the longstanding us policy goal of democratic secure ukraine integrated in european and euroatlantic institutions in the statement the united states pledged its assistance to help ukraine make the necessary reforms to join the wto in 2005 and its support for ukraines nato aspirations the administration also called for immediately ending the application of the jacksonvanik amendment to ukraine the two sides will establish an energy dialogue to help ukraine achieve greater energy independence the statement underlines the cooperation of the two sides to fight terrorism and weapons proliferation especially in ballistic missiles an area in which ukraine is world leader in the statement the united states pledges to help kiev fight aidshiv serious problem in ukraine and to provide an additional 45 million to the chernobyl shelter fund which collects funds to repair the protective shelter over the reactor destroyed in the 1986 nuclear accident current us aid levels for ukraine are relatively modest according to the fy2006 budget submitted by the president ukraine will receive an estimated 935 million in us aid in fy2005 the administration proposed 1159 million in aid for ukraine in fy2006 the president sought an additional 60 million to aid reform in ukraine in an iraqafghanistan fy2005 supplemental appropriations request us aid is focused on anticorruption and rule of law efforts media and ngo 5 for background crs report rl32691 ukraines political crisis and us policy issues by steven woehrel crs10 development and election monitoring and other democracybuilding programs the united states also seeks to increase exchange programs between the two countries as noted in the april 2005 bushyushchenko joint statement the united states will be interested in seeing how the new government tackles such issues as weapons proliferation and human trafficking during the kuchma era several arms trafficking scandals damaged ukraines international reputation in september 2002 the administration announced that it had authenticated conversation taped in kuchmas office in july 2000 in which kuchma gave approval for the sale of four kolchuga early warning radar systems to iraq sale banned by security council arms embargo the yushchenko government has recently opened investigations into other arms sales including the sale of 18 nuclearcapable longrange cruise missiles to iran and china in 19992000 the united states is leading nato effort to help ukraine destroy its vast stocks of obsolete small arms and manportable surfaceto air missiles the 2005 state department trafficking in persons report says that ukraine is source country for women and girls trafficked for purposes of sexual exploitation the report designates ukraine as tier 2 country which means that it does not comply with minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking but is making significant efforts to do so the report says ukraine has increased the number of prosecutions and convictions of traffickers but that shortcomings exist in several areas including government corruption the report notes that the new government aims to improve ukraines performance on this issue the report recommends that ukraine create special witness protection program for trafficking victims expand the legal definition of trafficking to conform with international requirements ensure the appropriation of consistent resources for the antitrafficking unit and conduct sensitivity training to reduce victim blaming and breaches of victim confidentiality iraq key issue for us policymakers is the withdrawal of ukrainian troops from iraq us officials said during 2004 that ukraines contribution of over 1600 troops while appreciated would not cause the united states to overlook ukraines democratic shortcomings during the presidential elections however some observers were concerned that the leaders of the former regime were hoping that the united states would downplay election irregularities if ukraine continued its troop deployment in iraq during the campaign yushchenko pledged to quickly withdraw the troops if elected while yanukovych supported the deployment but raised the possibility that continued deployment could be conditioned on such factors as the granting of more reconstruction contracts in iraq to ukrainian firms after taking office president yushchenko confirmed that he would pull ukraines troops out of iraq after consultation with other iraq coalition members and the iraqi government on march 11 2005 over 130 ukrainian troops were withdrawn from iraq further 550 left iraq in may and the remaining troops will be withdrawn by the end of the year the administration has downplayed the significance of the ukrainian withdrawal after an april 4 meeting with president yushchenko president bush said that yushchenko was fulfilling campaign crs11 pledge i fully understand that but he also has said that hes going to cooperate with the coalition in terms of further withdrawals and i appreciate that6 policy issues one important issue for us policy will be whether to take additional steps to help ukraine many analysts say that the united states could provide additional support to ukraine for example by helping it obtain loans from international financial institutions for its reform plans ukraines trade with the united states could be enhanced if the department of commerce determined ukraine to be market economy in the near future7 some experts have said that ukraine should receive funding under the millennium challenge account when it qualifies for such assistance finally some observers have suggested that leading western countries should hold an aid donor conference this year in order to seek aid pledges and coordinate assistance efforts in addition us assistance tailored to yushchenkos nearterm agenda and similar support from the eu could be important to consolidating the gains of democratic forces in ukraine in the runup to the march 2006 parliamentary elections another potential issue is how or whether to deal with perceptions among some observers in the united states and elsewhere that the reform process in ukraine is in state of drift particularly on economic reform us officials have praised the yushchenko government as beacon of democracy and reform and have appeared cautious about offering public criticism perhaps because the government is only few months old and perhaps for fear of undermining it however some observers argue that more frank approach expressed by highlevel officials could be useful to help nudge the reforms forward third issue is whether the united states should strongly signal support for ukraines nato aspirations if the united states decided to make such move it would likely also have to cope with moscows strident opposition as well as tension with several european nato allies more eager to accommodate moscow on the issue at present administration officials are approaching the issue of nato membership for ukraine with some caution they have called on ukraine to focus on implementing its current action plan with nato during an april 4 press conference with yushchenko president bush said im supporter of ukraine becoming member of nato i think its important but he cautioned that ukraines nato membership is not given noting that ukraine has to make reforms before it can join the alliance8 6 federal document clearing house transcript of president bushs press conference with president yushchenko april 4 2005 7 one possible stumbling block is ukraines record on intellectual property rights in 2001 the united states withdrew ukraines benefits under the generalized system of preference due to rampant optical media piracy although the us trade representative has reported that ukraines record has improved on this issue extremely high levels of piracy continued in 2004 according to the ustr 8 transcript of president bushs press conference with president yushchenko april 4 2005 continued crs12 there is also the issue of the impact of ukraines political crisis on the bilateral relationship between the united states and russia some russian observers have viewed the orange revolution as an americanengineered humiliation of and threat to russia as well as part of geopolitical offensive against russian interests in the region administration officials have tried to avoid confrontation with moscow on the issue saying that the united states is only interested in promoting democracy in the region and throughout the world however such assurances may be of little comfort to russian elites who may fear greater democracy could undermine their power at home and abroad and to the russian public much of which views ukraine as inseparable from russia9 congressional response during the ukranian presidential election campaign and during the ensuing electoral crisis the 108th congress approved legislation calling for free and fair elections in ukraine and urged the administration to warn ukraine of possible negative consequences for ukraines leaders and for usukraine ties in the case of electoral fraud on july 22 2004 the senate passed s res106 by unanimous consent the resolution noted the violations against osce standards for free and fair elections that took place during the ukrainian election campaign the resolution pledged congresss support for ukraines establishment of democracy free markets and place in the western community of democracies hconres 415 was passed by the house on october 4 it was identical to sconres 106 except that it added two clauses that strongly encourage the president to fully employ us government resources to ensure free and fair election and to stress to the ukrainian government that the conduct of the elections would be central factor in determining the future relationship between the two countries on november 18 2004 just before the second round of the election the senate passed sres 473 by unanimous consent as in the case of hconres 415 it warned ukrainian leaders against conducting fraudulent election however it went further than hconres 415 in that it strongly encourages the administration to impose sanctions against persons encouraging or participating in fraud senator richard lugar chairman of the senate foreign relations committee monitored the november 21 2004 runoff at the request of president bush he said after the vote that it is now apparent that there was concerted and forceful program of election day fraud and abuse enacted with the leadership or cooperation of the authorities senator lugar said that he had carried letter from president bush to president kuchma that warned that tarnished election will cause the united states to review its relations with ukraine senator lugar stressed that kuchma has the 8 continued from the white house website httpwwwwhitehousegov 9 jamestown foundation eurasia daily monitor vol 1 issue 145 december 13 2004 crs13 responsibility and the opportunity for producing even at this point an outcome which is fair and responsible10 the 109th congress passed resolutions after president yushchenko was inaugurated on january 25 2005 the house passed hconres 16 and the senate passed sconres 7 on the 26th the identical resolutions include clauses congratulating ukraine for its commitment to democracy and its resolution of its political crisis in peaceful manner congratulating yushchenko on his victory applauding the candidates the eu and other european organizations and the us government for helping to find that peaceful solution and pledging us help for ukraines efforts to develop democracy free market economy and integrate into the international community of democracies current issues if the orange revolution continues to show progress congress could consider further legislation on ukraine including ending the application of the jacksonvanik amendment to ukraine the jacksonvanik amendment bars permanent normal trade relations pntr status for countries with nonmarket economies that do not permit freedom of emigration the amendment was originally intended to pressure the soviet union to permit jewish emigration the success of legislation on granting
