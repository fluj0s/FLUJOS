counselor andrew young 14 bd 1 cnf summary presidential afadvisor romain serman on june 18 said that deposed mauritanian president abdallahi seemed to be blocking final political agreement over the dakar accord france was prepared to call stop to the process and urge that the dakar accord be implemented as is with or without abdallahis agreement or participation which could encourage cooperation on abdallahis part serman said that junta leader aziz visited paris privately on june 12 and met with presidential secretarygeneral claude gueant with discussion focusing on terrorism serman said that president sarkozy planned soon on chairing highlevel gof meeting on terrorism in the sahel which indicated the level of french concern about terrorism in the region serman criticized businessmanlobbyist robert bourgi for his role in arranging azizs meeting with gueant and for several press leaks involving aziz and the late president bongo of gabon serman said that bourgi should not be viewed in any manner as representative or spokesman for the gof including with respect to his most recent activities in madagascar to promote himself and his business interests end summary mauritania xxxxxxxxxxxx azizs visit to paris 5 c serman confirmed press reports that junta leader aziz traveled to paris and met with presidential secretarygeneral claude gueant on june 12 serman said the visit was engineered by businessman and selfstyled af lobbyist robert bourgi who had ties to gueant and to president sarkozy predating sarkozys election to the presidency see below for further on bourgi bourgi encouraged aziz to make private visit flew aziz to france on one of his own planes and arranged the meeting with gueant serman who did not attend the azizgueant meeting understood that it consisted largely of discussion of the growing terrorism problem in the sahel subject of keen interest to gueant serman said that they undoubtedly paris 00000815 002 of 002 discussed the situation in mauritania but he could offer details french concern about terrorism in the sahel 6 c xxxxxxxxxxxx cnf robert bourgi 7 cnf sermans mention of bourgi allowed us to ask about his role and influence subject of episodic reporting in the press where bourgi is depicted as one of the last franceafrique fixers middlemen operators and businessmen serman said that bourgi had longstanding ties to gueant and sarkozy but that he was first and foremost selfpromoting businessman looking out for his own interests true wheelerdealer bourgis main client had been gabons recentlydeceased president bongo bourgi also had ties to rocs sassou nguesso and to senegals wade although these were less significant than his ties to bongo 8 cnf serman said that bourgi was rapidly burning his bridges however and this was causing his influence to drop precipitously among the french and africans as well bourgi was the source of the press leak announcing bongos death before the gabonese were prepared to make the announcement themselves this leak angered bongos family serman reported that sarkozy was also unhappy about the leak especially since the information was attributed in the press to source close to the french government which tended to make observers think that the gof was responsible for the leak or tacitly approved of it which was not the case 9 cnf the french were also annoyed that bourgi leaked the fact of azizs meeting with gueant to the press azizs visit to france was supposed to be private as was his meeting with gueant in sermans view bourgi leaked news of the event in an effort to demonstrate his continuing clout after the bongo episode serman said this was backfiring however as the french including especially sarkozy and gueant were not at all pleased with the leak serman said that bourgi is fool but sometimes it seems he cant help himself when theres an opportunity for selfpromotion even if he knows it might cost him 10 cnf although madagascar was not his area of expertise serman was aware of bourgis attempts to play fixer role there amidst the current political turmoil which gives him an opportunity to place himself in the thick of things serman said that bourgi was eager to score new business in response to the potential loss of the gabon account and his alienation of the bongo clan serman said that bourgi also had new rivals for influence with the opening up of the old franceafrique network that sarkozy has encouraged since taking office this too was causing bourgi to scramble for new business speaking with emphasis serman said that you should be aware that in madagascar and everywhere else he is active bourgi does not represent the french government and does not speak for us and you should tell everybody else that too 11 cnf serman concluded by noting that bourgi often used lettre du continent the biweekly parisbased newsletter covering principally francophone africa as the vehicle for his news leaks serman advised that anything appearing in lettre smacking of possible bourgi connection should be read with caution and that one should keep in mind that bourgis primary objective was selfpromotion for the purpose of selfenrichment pekala
