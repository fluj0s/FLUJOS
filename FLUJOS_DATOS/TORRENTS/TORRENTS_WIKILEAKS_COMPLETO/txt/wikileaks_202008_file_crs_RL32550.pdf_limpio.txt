financial accountability act contended that the cfo act and related laws should appl consistently across the executive branch and that the unequal status initially accorded the cfo in dhs denigrated the cfo position and the impor tance of financial management in dhs proponents also argued that the cfo pos ition with its fiduciary responsibilities carries with it special needs for accountability which senate conf irmation reinforces on the other hand at the beginning of the 108th congress the bush administration continued to oppose bringi ng the dhs cfo under the cfo act on grounds of special

and re lated bill hr 4259 was approved by the house on july 20 2004 the legislation ppeared to enjoy considerable support as noted in testimony by gao the goals of the cfo act and related financial reform legislation such as ffmia are to provide congress and agency management with reliable financial information for managing and making daytoday decisions and to improve financial management systems and controls to properly safeguard the governments assets dhs should not be the only cabinetlevel department not covered by what is the cornerstone for pursuing and achieving the requisite financial management systems and capabilities in the federal government30 supporters also contended that the cf act and related laws should apply consistently across the executive branch and that the unequal status previously accorded the cfo in dhs denigrated the cfo position and the importance of financial management in dhs the cfo position with its fiduciary responsibilities carried with it special needs for accountability which senate confirmation reinforces proponents argued on the other hand the bush administration had opposed bringing the dhs cfo under the cfo act on grounds of special managerial principles for the new dhs and subsequently from the rationa of reducing the number of positions subject to senate confirma tion as an omb official testified in september 2003 regarding application of the cfo act to dhs it is ombs position that the substan tive provisions of the cfo act should apply to the new department of home land security however the cfo act specifies an organization structure di rect reporting of the cfo to the agency head that is inconsistent with the structure congress endorsed when it passed the homeland security act of 2002 the homeland security act enacted the presidents proposal to consolidate management responsibilities at the new department under the under secretary for management requiring the cfo at dhs to report directly to the cretary of homeland security would dilute this principle the administration is also working with congress to reduce the number of officials subject to confirmation by the senate and therefore opposes making the cfo subject to confirmation by the senate 31 andrew maner currently serving as cfo for dhs along with his predecessor bruce carnes had maintained that however wellintentioned th

focusing on the federal governments consolidated financial statem ents and on financial management at the departments of defense nd homeland security in his opening statement chairman fitzgerald referred to the legislation to bring the cfo position in dhs under the 1990 statute noting we look forward to hearing from our witnesses on their views regarding the importance of applying the cfo act to dhs33 testimony from dhs cfo andrew maner at the senate subcommittee hearing in july arguably might be construed as indicative of lessening of the administrations opposition to the legisl ation unlike prior statements from administration officials which suggested that the dhs financial accountability act was unnecessary and undesirable in july mr maner stated as cfo of dhs i commend all relevant efforts by the executive and legislative branches including those of the chairm an senator fitzgerald and mr akaka ranking minority member of the subcommittee with s 1567 to make our controls tighter and to provide financial managers better tools to complete our mission more efficiently and effectively 34 further mr maners july testimony did not reiterate the administrations previous objections to bringing dhs di rectly under the cfo act especially with regard to the framework for senate confirmation and administrative placement of the cfo one might surmise that the absence of such commentary in july reflected tacit acceptance of the dual reporting arrangement for the cfo in dhs as developed in the house35 mr maner cited one remaining objectionable provision in s 1567

because of time constraints for the remainder of the 108th congress another possibility was for the house and senate to reach agreement via exchan ge of amendments between the houses39 time
