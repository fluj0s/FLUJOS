office bolivia ae 200436602 executive summary in october 2004 oios conducted an audit of the uni ted nations office on drugs and crime country office bolivia cob the audit covered ctivities with total expenditure of 73 million in 2003 and 2004 oios overall assessment is that projects were well managed by executing agencies and that adequate systems were i n place to ensure that regulations and rules operational and administrative were complied with unodc has accepted most of the recommendations made and is in the process of imple menting them financial reporting financial information of national and directly exec uted projects as per the undp atlas system was incorrect because 2004 expenditures we re charged to single cost recovery code 10015 good progress had since been made to reallocate th expenditures oversight issues individual projects were evaluated of which the res ults were positive what was lacking was programme evaluation of cobs response to drug an d crime concerns of the overall impact of its alternative development projects and as to whether the combination of projects was the most effective thematic evaluation of alternative development pr ojects that included visit of seven days to bolivia was cond ucted and depending on the outcome of the evaluation programme evaluation will be consider ed oios is not convinced that the results of thematic evaluation of which only sev days were spent in bolivia and which was restricted to the thematic area of alternative development can be used to determine the need for programme evaluation programmeproject documentation project documents failed to be effective implementi ng instruments that are legally binding project bold69 remained without an approved projec t document for almost two years and projects bolf57 and bold80 remained without such document for more than one year the independent evaluation unit is in the process f reviewing the project cycle management of unodc upon completion of the exerci management instruction on project development will be formulated this is an opportune time to consider the development of an implementing agency agreement to replace or supplement the project document in cases where implementing partners are ngaged project management executing agencies ilo fao and government institu tions had adequate accounting systems and internal controls in place also they complied with the relevant regulations and rules projects were well managed but monitoring responsi bilities strategies and timetables should be documented and formal system introduced to rec ord and report results cob undertook to enhance financial and performance monitoring and to include time table on financial and performance monitoring in its 2005 work plans this is still to be done and upon completion it should be shared with the executing agencies alternative development projects that accounted for 84 per cent of project resources continued to focus on the cochabamba tropics where as coca cultivation was increasing substantially in the yungas of paz cob stated that coca eradication and cultivation achievements were results of complex political eco nomical and social conditions and not limited to the results produced by alternative deve lopment projectsactivities still the impact of alternative development projects on coca cultivation in the chapare and yungas should be determined in an effort to maxim ize the impact on coca cultivation or at least to focus on areas where the biggest impact ca n be achieved administration cob complied

country office bolivia cob the audit was conducted in accordance with the international standards for the professional practi ce of internal auditing 2 bolivia is the worlds third largest producer of coca leaf after colombia and peru since 2000 the decreasing trend of coca crops has been r eversed especially in the yungas of the paz region where coca cultivation increased from 14 000 hectares in 2000 to more than 23000 hectares in 2003 3 the ongoing programme in bolivia includes eight projects government institutions are implementing five projects the food and agricultur organization fao and the international labour organization ilo each implem ent one project and one project is implemented directly by unodc the projects focus on key areas of the the bolivian integral strategy to fight against illicit drug tra fficking 20042008 which are the eradication of coca crops alternative development drug law enforcement and drug abuse prevention the percentage of the total expenditur

most of the recommendations made and is in the process of imple menting them ii audit objectives 8 the main objectives of the audit were to determine whether projects are properly formulated planned implemented and evaluated and whether project resources are used ef ficiently and effectively determine the effectiveness of projects internal c ontrols to ensure reliable recording and reporting of transactions safeguard ing the assets and compliance with relevant unodc and undp regulations and ru evaluate the system for reimbursement of costs for services locally provided by undp country office to cob determine whether the administration adheres to the relevant directives rules and procedures and assess the adequacy of systems i n place to ensure sound management practices in key functional areas iii audit scope and methodology 9 current project budgets total 30 million of whi ch 17 million was expended prior to 2003 38 million in 2003 and 3 million in 2004 as of september 2004 10 the audit covered 2003 and 2004 expenditures to talling 68 million incurred in the following projects adbol97c23 executed by the food and agriculture organization fao with expenditures totalling 12

internal control systems in place at executing agencies 12 also oios held discussions with project person nel and the main donor the united states agency for international development usaid offi ces of executing agencies were visited in paz and cochabamba and field visits were unde rtaken to project sites in the cochabamba tropics and the yungas of paz 13 furthermore administrative expenditures incurr ed in 2003 and 2004 totalling 500000 and the general administration at cob were also bjected to audit iv iv audit findings and recommendations financial reporting 14 undp bolivia recorded cobs certified administr ative expenditures and national and directly executed project expenditures on monthly basis until the end of 2003 undp bolivia recorded the expenditures in the winfoas accounting

project bole07 executin g agency ilo all projects were audited externally up to 2003 the audit opinions included in the certificates were unqualified project audits are required within the system and as per the letter of agreement project bole07 is subject to ilos int ernal and external audits 19 fao engaged an independent external auditor to audit project bolc23 on six months basis but the reports of the audits were not share d with cob as recommended by oios cob requested fao on 18 january 2005 to submit the audit reports as and when received from the independent external auditor b evaluations 20 project bolf57 was not evaluated an evaluati on is planned for 2005 project bolc23 was evaluated in 2001 and in 2004 bole07 in 2002 while the rest of the projects were evaluated in 2001 the results of individual project evaluations were positive especially for project bolc23 21 what was lacking however is an evaluation of the totality of cobs response to drug and crime concerns in bolivia and the overall impact of projects especially the impact of alternative development projects on coca cultivatio n unodc management instruction mi7rev1 of 1 may 2004 1 provides for prog ramme evaluations that measure performance in the context of unodc strategic frame work priorities and major activities within specific time period as well as assess t he strategy design implementation and results of the programme as whole including the contribution and relevance of the various projects and other activities which make up the programme such evaluations include global regional subregional and country level activities in line with this unodc needs to find out whether the formulated projects and their funding provide the optimum combination to obtain maximum value for money the past ratio between alternative development projects and other projects ie drug abuse and prevention and law enforcement is 80 per cent versus 20 per cent without any projects to address crime c oncerns in the country 22 oios was of the opinion that cob should conside r programme evaluation of its response to drug and crime concerns in bolivia in particular it should evaluate the overall impact of its alternative development projects and to determine whether the current formulated projects provide the optimum combination to obtain the maximum value for money recommendation head2right unodc division for operations should consider programme evaluation of country office bolivias r esponse to drug and crime concerns in bolivia in line with management instruction mi7rev1 of 1 may 2004 i n particular it should evaluate the overall impact f its alternative development projects and to determine w hether the current formulated projects provide the optimum com bination 5 to obtain the maximum value for money rec 01 23 in 2004 unodc conducted two major thematic evaluat ions on alternative development the second included field mission from 12 to 19 ctober 2004 to bolivia and the final report is expected in the coming months depending on the analysis of both thematic evaluations unodc will assess the need for progr amme evaluation in bolivia the results of the thematic evaluations of alternative developm ent projects could assist when an evaluation of bolivias response to drug and crime concerns is considered but oios concern is that thematic evaluation of seven days in boli via and focusing only on alternative development may not provide enough information to determine as to whether programme evaluation is needed or not oios will keep this r ecommendation open and will consider it as implemented when it receives copy of the decision to carry out the programme evaluation c documentation and implementing instruments 24 cobs strategic programme framework for the per iod 2005 to 2008 was still in draft the document was under revision at the date of the audit the document takes into account the current projects that addresses drug issues and includes anticipated ones that mainly relate to crime projects have been formulated to addr ess crime related programme areas ie criminal justice reform antihuman trafficking and antiorganised crime and corruption but expected results are indicated in the document 25 key project documents in the formulation of p roject are the project idea and the project document overall cob properly prepared and submi tted the documents in accordance with the relevant management instruction unodcmi5rev 1 26 some project documents were not revised after t he implementation period expired although the projects continued while revisions of other project documents were not approved for substantial period of time bold80 had an implementation period until march 2003 and is still in operation since then revision has been approved project document revision is in process and will be forward ed for approval to the division for operations for approval upon the bolivian governmen ts clearance bold69 had an implementation period up to august 2001 but contin ued until 2003 without any revision bolf57 was without an approved project document fo r 16 months before further project document was approved in october 2003 this does n ot only represent gaps in documentation but also reflects on the adequacy of the project document to be an effective implementing instrument 27 the project documents include the main elements of an agreement but fail to be an effective implementing instrument they do not adeq uately provide for details in cases where the implementing period covers number of years u nless they are revised on regular basis to provide for changed circumstances thereby remai ning living document they must also contain uptodate clauses that will make them legally binding especially in respect of funding arrangements and monitoring and reporting r esponsibilities 28 where projects are regularly revised such as p roject bolc23 to change an objective or budgetary requirement the whole document is resubm itted to the division for operations for review and approval this results in extra paperwo rk and unnecessary reviews of 6 documentation that was previously approved in total budgetary revisions are substantial in number especially because cob experiences stopgo situations because of funding for example project bolc23 has already been revised t hree times in 2004 to increase the budget from 154 million to 192 million 29 directives such as the letter of agreement w ith ilo the memorandum of understanding with fao and the working arrangemen t with undp outline the organizational arrangements and it is naturally not the purpose of these directives to guide the implementation of specific project oios therefo re sees need for standard implementing agency agreement that will address the weaknesses f the current project document when it comes to multiyear projects recommendation head2right unodc division for operations should during its r eview of the project cycle management consider developing n implementing agency agreement because the current project document fails to be an adequate implementing instr ument with implementing partners rec 02 30 the independent evaluation unit is in the process f reviewing the project cycle management of unodc upon completion of the exerci management instruction on project development will be formulated this is an opportune time to consider the development of an implementing agency agreement to replace or supplement the project document in cases where implementing partners are ngaged oios will consider this recommendation open when it receives copy of the standard implementing agency agreement once developed in the ongoing project cyc review d programmeproject management project budgets 31 the budgets in project documents included descr iptions of expenditures that are foreseen during the duration of the project these are mere estimations of foreseen expenditures over number of years to demonstrate that the project can be carried out within the total budgeted amount for particular year an annual budget is prepared and revised as needed in the interim these budgets are prepared per category f expenditure and the details of expenditure are not disclosed the category of equ ipment for example is budgeted for but the description of the equipment that is to be purc hased is not reflected in the document 32 although there are other tools such as work pl ans that may include more details there is single implementing instrument that provides ade quate details of agreed upon expenditures that an executing agency can incur in the case of bolc23 for example more than 300000 is allocated to the line for sundries rather wide range of expenditures could be charged to such line item that increase the risk of weakened budgetary controls and could hamper project monitoring therefore the executin g agencies should provide the details of expenditure with their budget submissions to cob fo r review and approval as suggested by oios cob undertook to request its executing agenci to submit detailed descriptions of the 7 expenditures that will be incurred under each categ ory of expenditure with their budget submissions starting 2005 b project monitoring 33 monitoring responsibilities strategies and tim etables are not documented formal system to record and report the results of monitori ng is also not in place furthermore cobs monitoring is mainly limited to reviews of narrativ and financial reports that are received from the projects and visits that are carried out n an ad hoc basis not only is it important that cob determine monitoring strategies but also to share the timetables of monitoring activities with executing agencies to ensure adequa coverage without duplicating efforts 34 the number of financial and narrative reports i s substantial apart from the annual and interim project progress reports the projects subm it financial and narrative data on monthly basis to cob that is submitted to unodc fi nancial resources management service frms 35 the financial reports of executing agencies th at excludes national and direct executed projects were per category of expenditure and ther efore the desk review of cob was limited to comparing expenditures incurred with allocations issued the underlying transactions and supporting documents were not verified although t he executing agencies had adequate internal control systems in place and financial rep orting was substantial it is essential that cob periodically verify expenditures to ensure that funds are spent according to the agreed budgets and for the intended purposes 36 the adequacy of accounting systems and internal controls at the project offices should also be assessed financial verification exercises should however not be standalone procedures but linked to performance monitoring to assess the costeffectiveness of results recommendation head2right unodc country office bolivia should establish fin ancial and performance monitoring strategies and on an an nual basis prepare and include timetable in the work plans nd share this information with the executing agencies unodc cob should ensure that the financial monitoring strateg include periodic verifications of project expenditures incu rred by their executing agencies rec 03 37 unodc cob undertook to enhance financial and perfo rmance monitoring and to include time table on financial and performance m onitoring in its 2005 work plans unodc commented that the verification of project ex penditures would be implemented progressively within the limited human and financia l resources field visits would also be increased and would include such verification oios reiterates that the 2005 work plans and monitoring strategy be shared with the executing ag encies oios will consider the recommendation implemented when it receives copy of the 2005 work plans that provide for financial and monitoring strategy as well as plans for field verifications 8 c alternative development project allocation 38 alternative development projects ie bolc23 bole07 bold69 and bolf57 accounted for 245 million 84 per cent of the tot allocations the graph below indicates the total amount per year allocated towards project s in the cochabamba tropics chapare and the yungas of paz yungas and the estimat ed number of hectares under coca in each of the areas alternative development allocation distribution by region 037 131 290 273 273 412 314 420 063 056 064 104 098 000 315 235 75 56 42 54 45 143 145 143 140 157 141 234 00 10 20 30 40 50 60 1997

reduced subst antially from 31500 hectares in 1997 to 7500 hectares in 1999 reduction of 24000 hect ares 76 per cent in less than three years during this period 46 million was allocated to lternative development projects in the chapare from 2000 to 2003 127 million was located but the number of hectares under coca cultivation was reduced by only 3000 he ctares from 7500 to 4500 of the 4500 hectares 3200 hectares are licit coca crops the re is therefore limited room for further reduction only some 1300 hectares 40 the number of hectares under coca in the yunga s exceeded that of the chapare as early as 1999 and in 2003 was five times more but the allocated amount towards projects in the yungas was only 22 per cent of that allocated towards the cochabamba tropics even in 2004 and although coca cultivation is still inc reasing in the yungas only 20 per cent of total allocations was allocated towards the area 41 oios is aware that there is direct relations hip between the amount of money spent on alternative development projects and the number of hectares under coca cultivation because there are various other factors that include eradic ation efforts by the government and legislation the quantity of licit coca crops tota ls 15200 hectares according to law 1008 up to 12000 in the yungas of paz and 3200 in the cochabamba tropics further 9 important factor is that alternatives to coca culti vation are provided not only to reduce coca cultivation but also to prevent an increase therei n recommendation head2right unodc country office bolivia should determine the impact of alternative development projects on coca cultiva tion in the cochabamba tropics and yungas of paz and should allocate available funds accordingly in an effort t maximise the impact that projects have on coca cultivation rec 04 42 cob stated that coca eradication and cultivation ac hievements were results of complex political economical and social conditions and t limited to the effects produced by alternative development projectactivities not ss important there are other role players working in alternative development such as usaid european commission spain and belgium among others in addition unodc cob foc used alternative development projects in areas where there is an advantage and where adde d value can be expected 43 the benefits of alternative development project s and the numerous factors that impact on achievements in coca eradication and cultivation ar not disputed but oios remains of the opinion that the impact of alternative development projects on coca cultivation in the chapare and yungas should be determined to ensu re that projects have maximum impact or at least to focus on areas where the bigg est impact can be achieved oios will consider this recommendation as implemented when it receives information on the 2006 allocation of resources to these regions and their anticipated impact on coca cultivation projects bolc23 and bole07 44 an amount of 204 million 80 per cent of ternative development project allocations has been issued to project bolc23 the projects activities are based on forest management and establishing agroforestry systems over 17000 0 hectares of forestry are under managed plans and the project had been involved in the blishment of almost 7000 hectares of agroforestry systems the project is financially nd administratively well managed in accordance with fao rules and regulations 45 project bole07 focused on vocational training support to microenterprises employment generation and support to schools inclu ding computer training the project also supported 133 entrepreneurships with total n umber of 1300 beneficiaries the enterprises are properly recorded and followup mec hanisms are in place to monitor their sustainability 46 from the beginning of the project more than 16 500 youths were trained in rather wide range of courses of which 7500 45 per cent were women of the trained youths some 400 were reported as being placed in the labour market by the project and according to an impact study of hired consultancy company 1140 trained youths obtained employment by direct influence of the project oios agrees with cobs v iew that the training is not focused on creating employment but is of the opinion that tra ining should focus on areas where the 10 impact is greater therefore oios recommended tha t unodc cob following the impact evaluation study request the international labour organization to conduct market research of employment opportunities and to focus on skills tha t are required in the market in an attempt to increase the trainees prospects of starting up an enterprise or obtaining employment 47 unodc cob pointed out that the evaluation of activi ties based on year 2001 and 2002 information showed that 34 per cent the projects b eneficiaries had productive employment and that in the period 2001 2004 some 2740 16 per cent of the total beneficiaries of the project young people obtained productive employmen t as direct result of project action unodc cob further commented that following the reco mmendations of the midterm evaluation of the project bole07 which was carried out in 2002 ilo developed in june 2003 study for the identification of the manpower demand in the cochabamba tropics the aforementioned study identified the production sect ors or services with potentialities of labour force absorption as well as the training co urses required at present activities of vocational training and micro enterprises support c arried out by project bole07 take into account the outputs of said study 48 still oios is of the opinion that the number f young people obtaining employment which was recorded as 16 per cent target of only 5 per cent of the total beneficiaries of the project within the period 2001 to 2004 remained l ow naturally there are areas where employment is more possible than others during field visit in the cochabamba tropics the audit noted the limited impact of training in repai ring refrigerators for example only one trainee of class of 20 students started an ente rprise and in four months repaired only three or four refrigerators in turn some sewing and ca rpentry activities that were visited were well established therefore it may be necessary for ilo to cease training in vocational areas that did not yield results such as refrigerator repairi ng recommendation head2right unodc country office bolivia should request the international labour organization to set reasonable targets as to the number of beneficiaries that should obtain mployment after vocational trainings and to cease training in vocational areas that did not provide employment opportunities as expected rec 05 49 to record this recommendation as implemented ios requests copy of the unodc request to ilo to set reasonable employment targets for their vocational trainings and to cease providing them if employment opportunities are low d drug abuse and prevention 50 projects bold80 and rlad75 are both executed by the viceministry of social defense this is costeffective arrangement and oios found the project finances to be well administered 51 project bold80 aims at drug abuse prevention ducation and health promotion in schools and institutions and rlad75 is regional project that conducts studies on drug usage the project started in 1999 but little pro gress was made until the end of 2001 from 11 2002 the project managed to complete two studies n drug usage one in school populations and the other in the workforce 52 the project document originally provided for study of drug usage in school populations and general survey on drug abuse study on sch ool populations was conducted but the general survey was limited to that of drug usage in the workforce according to the project manager there was shortage of funding noted however is the low implementation rate i n 2003 and 2004 in 2003 less than 45 per cent of t he allocated 23600 was spent after the allocation was reduced from 77000 to 23600 by t he end of 2003 in 2004 up to the time of the audit only 23 per cent of the initial alloc ation of 54000 had been spent the explanation by the project manager for not conducti ng study on the drug usage in the general population is therefore not convincing law enforcement 53 project bold73 supports the bolivian national drug control strategy in law enforcement on drug trafficking and is the only pro ject in precursor control in 2003 some 600 public servants participated in 70 training eve nts that ranged from computer training to seminars on legislation in 2004 only 19000 was initially allocated for this project this figure was revised in june 2004 to 62000 staffi ng had been reduced from six staff to only one technician by the end of february 2004 with the effect that until july 2004 only two training courses were held attended by 59 persons cob stated that an administrator was appointed and in the two months of august and septe mber 2004 15 courses were held and attended by 242 persons administration 54 in the areas of administration and finance cob complied with the
