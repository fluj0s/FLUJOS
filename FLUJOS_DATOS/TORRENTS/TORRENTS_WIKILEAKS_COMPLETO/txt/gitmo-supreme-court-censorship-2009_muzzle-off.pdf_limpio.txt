who asked if i could give her profile of myclient alghizzawi as he was on list of men whomthe us was looking for new home and her countrywas considering accepting him this was the first ihad learned that alghizzawi had been cleared bythe obama review team for release i gave herinformation about my client and for all i know astory was published about the plight of alghizzawiat guantanamo his status as cleared and why heneeded country in europe to take hima few days later an attorney from the justicedepartment called to tell that alghizzawi wascleared for release and we laughed about the factthat i already knew the information however thelaughing stopped when the attorney told that thejustice department had designated the informationas protected and i could not tell anyone except myclient and those people who had signed on to theprotective order court document that outlines theprocedures for the guantanamo cases about hisstatus as cleared for release i told the attorneythat he could not declare something protected thatwas already in the public domain to make longstory short we were not in agreement and theattorney filed an emergency motion with the judge tomuzzle despite the fact that the information wasin the public domain i was muzzled by the goodjudge who apparently doesnt believe that theconstitution applies to i couldnt even tell mralghizzawis brother what i thought was good newsi didnt know then that this was just another stalltactic by the justice departmentnot only was i muzzled but mr alghizzawis casewas put on hold the habeas hearing that we hadbeen fighting to obtain literally for years was stayedby the judge despite the fact that the us supremecourt held in june of 2008 that the men wereentitled to swift hearings so much for thesupreme court the president asked the judges tostop the hearings for those men who were clearedfor release and the judges have fallen into lockstepshamefully abandoning their duties as judgesa few months later when i visited alghizzawi atthe end of august he had just received word fromhis wife that she could longer wait for his releaseand she asked him if she would sign papers for adivorce bad news is an every day occurrence for alghizzawi and he was holding up well despite thislatest blowwhen i returned from the base i asked the justicedepartment to allow to contact alghizzawiswife and tell her that he had been cleared forrelease i hoped that if she knew he was to bereleased she would hang in there and not go throughwith the divorce i was told they would get back tome when they didnt i asked again but they stillwould not give the ok in court papers i pleadedwith the judge to let tell alghizzawis brotherand wife telling the judge about the wifes requestfor divorce but the judge the same judge who hasapparently decided to ignore the supreme courtsdirective for quick habeas hearings ignored thisplea as welli seriously thought about disobeying the order andtrying to get word to alghizzawis wife and thentaking whatever lumps were thrown mywayhowever despite the fact that the judicialsystem has failed alghizzawi and most of the menat guantanamo i could not bring myself to blatantlydisobey court order for five months i have keptthis information confidential despite the injustice toboth my client mr alghizzawi and to what wasour rule of law until yesterday when the muzzlewas liftedthis is only part of the story i will be writing moreabout this in the future and our friend the talkingdog has more to say on thisclick on the title for his takemeanwhile if you hear from habeas attorney thathis or her case has been stayed you will know aboutthe injustice that their client is continuing to sufferyou will know that the client has been cleared forrelease that the attorney cannot discuss that factand that the judge in that case has abandoned his orher duty to be judge you will also know that beingcleared for release is just as meaningless aseverything else that has been happening to theseunfortunate menbecause being cleared for releasemeans nothingposted by h candace gorman at 1128 am0 commentspost commenthomesubscribe to post comments atom subscribe to the gitmo blogabout view
