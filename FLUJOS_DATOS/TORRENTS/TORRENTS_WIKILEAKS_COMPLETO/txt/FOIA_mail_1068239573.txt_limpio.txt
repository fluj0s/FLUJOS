rmckitriuoguelphca priority normal xmailer execmail for win32 511 build 10 dear steve please send your material for comment direct to tim osbornei would like to publish the whole debate early next year but respectful comments in the meantime can only help and the cru people seem genuinely interested and have integrity i have never heard of such bad behaviour here as appears to have been the case between sallie and soon and the restthe us adversarial system and too many egos as you know the contact is tim osborn tosbornueaacuk and i take the liberty to forward this to him now you seem to suggest that this is welcome and are making make direct comments on his remarks to concerning your paper we shall get the printed proof as single electronic file today and shall look through it early next week i am sure you do not want to see your paper again i think that adding anymore now the exchanges between you and mannbradley and perhaps now tim as well is premature and we shall wait until the next issue mann is said to be writing something but he has not yet contacted though i just hang up on that journalist appell who keeps on ringing i told him that i will deal only directly with mann what cheek after threatening with litigationjust keep in the loop thanks sonja ps by the way the economist has taken up previous paper from ee castles and henderson the social science critique of teh emission scenarios and teh australian and uk treasuries have become involved i have not seen it yet as you know i have always argued that the real driver of teh ipcc deception if that is the right word has been on teh social technology forcing side with focus of wg iii in london i heard two days ago that the wto might make ratification of kyoto conditional for something russia wants the source was speaker from the deutsche bank justin mundy former advisor to the eu commission on eurussia coordination and once senior advisor to the european centre for nature conservation he also worked for the world bank sonja on fri 7 nov 2003 095033 0500 steve mcintyre smcintyrecgxenergycom wrote dear sonja the interesting thing about their preliminary response however is that it indicates that the difference in results might be fully explained by simple error in not using many of the early treering data if this is confirmed by their fuller response then even though there may be some problems with the proxy data used by mann et it implies that these problems do not actually make lot of difference to the results the main difference comes from omitting the early treering data paper that identifies some problems with the proxy data used by mann et would still be interesting but if these problems made very little difference to the results obtained then it would be of rather minor importance 1 imho the data issues rise above some problems when youre doing prospectus audit or engineeringlevel feasibility study there is concerted effort to eliminate every error i have never seen such sloppy data as mbh98 perhaps from my business experience i am used to more demanding approach to data integrity than the above comment suggests about academic studies even the mbh response criticizes us for failing to use obsolete data how silly is that bradley has also said that an audit should use original data and should not verify against source data and says that i should know better i think that my experience with audits and engineering studies is more substantial than bradleys and this is an extraordinarily silly thing for him to say after the fact one of the key missteps in the brex fraud was the engineering report in which ore reserves were calculated using false data supplied to the consulting engineers by brex without any verification being carried out by the engineers 2 there was not simple error of simply not using many of the early treering data the early treering data in question are principal components of north american tree ring sites and of stahleswm also north american tree ring sites mbh98 states that they used conventional principal components methods for temperature they do not explicitly say that they used conventional principal components methods for tree ring regions but in the absence of disclosure otherwise this is certainly the most reasonable interpretation of the public disclosure leaving aside manns refusal to provide clarification in response to our inquiries on methods conventional principal component calculation requires that there be missing data accordingly this indicator became unavailable in the earlier years using conventional principal component calculations it was not left out mbh now disclose for the very first time that they used stepwise principal components approach although this is nowhere disclosed in mbh98 or in the si thereto they have still not disclosed the rosters of principal components involved if this method is material to their results as they now state then it was material omission in their prior disclosure it seems like very strange rebuttal for mbh to say youre at fault because we made material nondisclosure on methodology in our papers if i were in mbhs shoes i would be embarrassed at this nondisclosure and mitigating the situation by making full disclosure now when you do prospectus you have to sign an affidavit that there are material omissions i have approached disclosure questions on the basis that prospectuslevel disclosure is the minimum level of public disclosure in this matter assuming that this level of disclosure would be exceeded 3 ive redone calculations with recalculated us pc1 in and get results similar to those in ee rather than the mbh response this is not guarantee that i have fully replicated still undisclosed mbh methodology however mbh disclosure of their methodology is very inadequate and without full disclosure by mbh of their methods it is possible to be somewhat at crosspurposes this defective disclosure is entirely their responsibility it should be remedied immediately through ftp disclosure of their computer programs and full description of their methodology snip it is quite obvious that if the opinion of these three people from the uk university of east anglia concerning publication of teh mm paper had been sought and taken there would not have been publication then i suggest you read our commentary again which does not state this at all part 2 has been drafted and i would be delighted to obtain comments on it from ueacru indeed i think that it would be very constructive since part 2 is significantly more hardedged than part 1 because we have stated that we would post up reply to the mbh response we would have to disclose something on our websites but id be prepared to deal with this intuitively full true and plain disclosure would be to state that we have prepared reply and submitted it to ueacru for comments i think that the many data errors will be selfevident to ueacru we have organized our materials to show this as will be the material nondisclosures on methodology by mbh however if they are prepared to comment this would have to be agreed on very quickly as we are very close to
