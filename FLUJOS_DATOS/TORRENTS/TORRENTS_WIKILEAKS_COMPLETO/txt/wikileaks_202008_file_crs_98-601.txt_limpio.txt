robert meltz legislative attorney american law division summary on july 7 1998 senator hatch introduced s 2271 the property rights implementation act of 1998 the bill appears to be the likely replacement on the senate floor for hr 1534 as reported by the senate committee on the judiciary s 2271 retains the basic process approach of its predecessor but makes numerous changes among these are restriction of hr 1534s takingsripeness provisions to real property rather than all types of property new definition of futility different restrictions on district court abstention and new provisions as to attorneys fees and prior notice applicable to parties suing local governments for takings under 42 usc sec 1983 on july 7 1998 senator hatch introduced s 2271 the property rights implementation act of 1998 the bill takes process approach to the property rights issue lowering or eliminating some of the threshold hurdles now encountered by property owners when they sue local governments or the federal government for alleged infringements of property rights these threshold hurdles allow the federal court to avoid reaching the merits of the property owners claim when the claim is deemed by the court to be improperly or inappropriately before it the bill disavows any intention to change the substantive standard by which courts determine whether government actions effect takings under the takings clause of the fifth amendment s 2271 is designed as replacement for hr 1534 which the senate committee on the judiciary reported in february 1998 it is scheduled for senate floor vote should it survive likely filibuster in the near future this report supplements crs report 97877 which examines in detail the senate reported version of hr 1534 and the two housepassed bills hr 992 and hr 1534 of which it consists crs report 97877 also provides extensive background for understanding the complex legal concepts of tucker act jurisdiction abstention and ripeness which these bills seek to modify here we do not repeat that background and urge the reader to read the present brief update in conjunction with the earlier report the congressional research service the library of congress crs2 present report confines itself to the changes made by s 2271 in the committeereported version of hr 1534 those changes are 1 title s 2271 is the property rights implementation act of 1998 hr 1534 is the citizens access to justice act of 1998 2 duty of notice to local governments an s 2271 provision with counterpart in hr 1534 bars the filing of an action under 42 usc sec 1983 alleging the taking of real property until 60 days has elapsed from the date when written notice has been provided to the defendant section 1983 actions are widely used to challenge actions of local governments in federal court 3 ripeness scope of provisions the ripeness provisions of s 2271 apply solely to claims founded on constitutional right to use real property land and things attached to land hr 1534s ripeness provisions would have applied to all types of property real and personal tangible and intangible 4 ripeness time allowed for government processing of development applications s 2271 says that the ripeness of the property owners taking comes about only after the specified government approvals following application therefor have not been obtained within reasonable time hr 1534 in possibly inadvertent omission demanded only that following the property owners submission of its application for development approval such approval had not been obtained there was mention of within reasonable time 5 ripeness definition of futility s 2271 like its predecessor provides that property owner can ripen its taking claim without having obtained required government approval if applying therefor would be futile hr 1534 offered definition of futile however suggesting that the terms meaning was to be drawn from takings case law s 2271 defines futile to mean the inability of an owner of real property to seek or obtain approvals to use such real property and the hardship endured by such inability as defined under applicable land use and invironmental law 6 ripeness definition of meaningful application both bills insist as condition for ripe taking claim that the property owner make one meaningful application to develop its property to the local land use regulating entity which is not approved hr 1534 says that the content of meaningful application is as defined by the locality s 2271 retains the as defined by the locality language of hr 1534 for some uses of meaningful application the discretionary abstention provision and where the meaningful application is not approved and is accompanied by an explanation of the development that would be accepted but not for one other use where the meaningful application is not approved and is not accompanied by an explanation of the development that would be approved the reasons for having two definitions of meaningful application are not clear 7 ripeness the written explanation provided by the locality both bills stipulate that where local government offers in conjunction with development proposal disapproval written explanation of the use density or intensity of development it would accept the landowner must to ripen its constitutional claim submit second application taking into account that explanation and have that application just as the first one not be approved s 2271 clarifies that such written explanation need only specify the range of use density or intensity of development that would be approved crs3 8 abstention nature of prohibition on district court use s 2271 states that whenever federal district court exercises jurisdiction under 28 usc sec 1343 which covers section 1983 actions among others the court shall not abstain because the party seeking redress 1 brings prior or concurrent proceeding before state territorial or local tribunal 2 asserts claims under state or local law pendent to or arising from the same core of operative facts as claim for the taking of real property or 3 asserts claim for the taking of real property that requires interpretation of state territory or local laws this language appears to contemplate that districtcourt abstention is never categorically barred but rather cannot be based by the court on the specified factors hr 1534 by contrast takes the form of an absolute ban but states the triggering factors more narrowly than those of s 2271 under hr 1534 an abstention prohibition applies only when state law at all is filed and where parallel proceeding arising from the same facts as the taking claim is pending in state court s 2271 also contains discretionary abstention provision not present in hr 1534 under s 2271 federal district that exercises jurisdiction under 42 usc sec 1343 in an action concerning real property use may abstain where the plaintiff 1 has not submitted meaningful application see item 5 to use the real property and 2 challenges whether an action of the locality exceeds the authority conferred upon it under state law 9 abstention when district courts should certify questions of state law both bills deal with the issue of when district court facing claim involving the use of real property that cannot be decided without resolving an unsettled question of state law may certify that question to the highest appellate court of the state s 2271 states that the district court in deciding whether to certify may consider whether the question of state law will significantly affect the merits of the claim and is patently unclear hr 1534 states that the district court shall not certify the question unless these factors are present 10 attorneys fees in claims against any act of congress or federal regulation affecting property rights s 2271 specifies that the court may award attorneys fees and other costs to the prevailing plaintiff hr 1534 used the mandatory shall instead an s 2271 provision with analog in hr 1534 is titled attorneys fees for localities this provision states that in section 1983 action under 42 usc sec 1983 alleging taking of real property district court may hold the property owner liable for reasonable attorneys fee and costs where the taking claim is not substantially justified unless special circumstances make such an award unjust the phrase substantially justified is apparently taken from the equal access to justice act where it performs similar function in specifying that the united states must pay attorneys fees to prevailing parties in judicial actions unless its position in the litigation was substantially justified 28 usc sec 2412d1a for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98601
