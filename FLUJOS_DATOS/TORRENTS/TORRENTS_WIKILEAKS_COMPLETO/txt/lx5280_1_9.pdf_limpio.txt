architectureshavebeenwidelydeployedinrisccpuswhereincreasedperformanceisobtainedatthecost of significantly increased area although superscalar issue significantly increases the area of the lx5280 processor core performance analysis at lexra demonstrates benefits on key dsp algorithms well beyond that which is obtained in typical cpu benchmarks sustaining peak computational performance in dsp algorithms typically requires at least one operand from memory per instruction cycle dsps have traditionally implemented specialized instruction sets that support memorybased operands singleissue risc architectures operate on registerbased operands and thus degrade performance by factor of two in order to preload the operand into the register file grafting

whilethemultipleaccumulatedatapathmacoperatesonregisterbaseddataloadedearlierfrommemory the risc data path is 32bits but few dsp algorithms require more than 16bits of precision thus two values can be fetched simultaneously from memory simultaneous dual 16bit alu and mac operations further improve the lx5280 dsp performance compared to specialized 32bit or even 16bit dsp instructions which allow

furthermore since 1 can be represented in fractional format but 1 cannot be represented in fractional mode the dual mac detects when both operands of multiply are equal to 1 if so it generates the

significant bit of product is always zero in fractional mode due to the left shift the accumulation units can add the product to or subtract it from one of the four accumulator registers this

programming restrictions in order to obtain correct results from sequence of dual mac instructions howeverthemostefficientuseofthedualmachardwareisobtainedwhentheprogramavoidsthesestalls this can be done by scheduling the instructions properly table52 on page123 indicates the number of cycles that must be present between mac instructions to avoid stalls in addition several instruction sequences
