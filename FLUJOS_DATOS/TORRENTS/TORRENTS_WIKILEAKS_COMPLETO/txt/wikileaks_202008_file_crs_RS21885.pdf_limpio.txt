effects3 the conference adopted the senates version of the manufacturing subsidy deduction rather than corpor ate rate cut but with the houses broader definiti on of manufacturing table 1 lists the major revenue gainers in the bill for the year 2013 when all provisions have been phased in to provide some perspective in that year the corporate tax is estimated to raise 307 billion the b ill relies not only on corporate provisions the eti and most of the tax shelter provisions are largely corporate but also on excise provisions the eti provision produces gain in that year of close to 7 billion the antishelter provisions produced larger revenue gain in the senate bill than in the house bill for several reasons while the final value was between the two the provision restricting leasing arrangements between taxable and taxexempt entities which is the single largest tax shelter provision in any of the versions appears more stringent than the one in the house bill4 the senate bill contained provision codifying and strengthening the economic substance doctrine and tax on corporate inversions while the house bill had economic substance doctr ine provision and its earnings stripping provision aimed at corporate inversions was not included in the final version5 inversions occur when us firm moves its headquarters abroad to reduce us tax primarily through earnings

under 32 deduction reduces the rates for smaller cor porations and is exte nded to unincorporated businesses as well the house bill reduced the top rate to 32 and although it did not include smaller firms other provisions for small businesses benefitted small corporations by reducing some of the intermediate rates the conference bill was similar to the senate version the tax rate reduction accounted the bulk of the small business provisions in the house bill small part of the loss is asso ciated with benefits for subchapter s corporations corporations ta xed as partnerships which wa s contained in all versions6 the second largest set of provisions redu ced the tax burdens on income from foreign source investments the largest provision common to all bills is provision allowing foreign interest as well as domestic to be allocated between us and foreign sources for purposes of determining the limit on the fo reign tax credit which accounted for 28 billion of the total the
