background and legislative proposals susan boren specialist in social legislation domestic social policy division summary the federal governments role in financing school construction and renovation continues to be an issue in the 109th congress although school construction has generally been considered state and local responsibility according to the national center for education statistics nces the unmet need for school construction and renovation is estimated to be 127 billion higher amount than the government accountability office gao formerly the general accounting office previous estimate of 112 billion using similar methodology nces indicates that three quarters of the nations schools report needing funds to bring their buildings into good overall condition the department of education ed has documented that the average age of public school building is estimated at 42 years an age when schools tend to deteriorate indirect federal support for school construction is currently provided by exempting the interest on state and local governmental bonds from federal income taxes as well as other tax code provisions pl 106554 provided direct funding of 12 billion for emergency school renovation and repair the child left behind act pl 107110 increased funds for impact aid construction and established credit enhancement plan for charter school construction pl 10716 the tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 aided taxexempt bond financing by loosening arbitrage rebate rules and by expanding the definition of private activity bonds pl 108311 extended qualified zone

congress for updated legislative activity legislative action the esea reauthorization the child left behind act pl 107110 contained cursory reference to school renovation in general but it did include enhanced credit provisions for construction under an expanded charter school demonstration program and provided for school facility emergency repair and modernization under impact aid congressional research service the library of congress crs2 construction the labor health and human services education and related agencies appropriations for fy2006 hr 3010pl109149 provided 178 million excluding the acrosstheboard rescission for impact aid construction the final fy2006 appropriation provided 366 million excluding the acrosstheboard rescission for credit enhancement for charter school facilities whereas the senate committee would eliminate funding for the program background one major issue of concern in the 109th congress is whether the federal government should assume greater responsibility for school construction some argue that the federal government already provides indirect financial support for school construction by exempting the interest on state and local governmental bonds from federal income taxation at varying annual cost to the federal government1 the exemption allows bonds to be issued at lower interest rates that still provide competitive returns in addition the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 authorized tax credits for new form of obligation called qualified zone academy bonds qzabs qzabs may be used for schools based in empowerment zones or enterprise communities or with 35 of students qualified for free or reduced price lunches under the federal school lunch program2 qzabs were extended through calendar year 2003 by the job creation and worker assistance act of 2002 pl 107147 and then through calendar year 2005 by the working families tax relief act of 2004 pl 108311 the federal governments direct role in financing elementary and secondary school construction began with impact aid laws in 1950 there were also some precursors to the impact aid legislation that provided funds for school construction some relief bills during the new deal expanded definitions3 of relief and public works to include school construction however there has been gap in federal funding for formal program for school construction other than through the impact aid construction program which has had substantial reduction in funding in the past4 in the 103rd congress the education infrastructure act of 1994 title xii of the esea was enacted as federal grant program for school infrastructure the grant program was never funded5 1 the total revenue loss on the outstanding stock of taxexempt bonds was estimated in 2000 at 226 billion the portion of that loss represented by construction bonds has not been calculated see crs report rl30638 taxexempt bonds description of state and local government debt by steven maguire 2 see crs report rs20606 qualified zone academy bonds brief explanation and crs report rs20699 funding school renovation qualified zone academy bonds vs traditional taxexempt bonds both by steven maguire 3 an

rl31885 impact aid for public k12 education general overview and current status by rebecca r skinner and richard n apling beginning with fy2002 impact aid construction increased from 128 million to 48 million in appropriations 5 the infrastructure act authorized direct federal grants for repair renovation alteration and continued crs3 estimates of construction needs accurate estimates of school construction needs are difficult to obtain and most are based on opinion surveys of local school officials however gao and nces have surveyed needs and projected costs to fulfill those needs gao reports eight gao reports have been issued three in 1995 three in 1996 one in 1997 and one in march 2000 dealing with school facilities americas schools report differing conditions gao june 1996 surveyed national sample of 10000 schools school officials were asked to estimate costs to repair or upgrade facilities to good overall condition at minimum officials estimated that 11 billion was needed to comply with federal mandates with total estimated need of 112 billion the last in series of gao reports school facilities construction expenditures have grown significantly in recent years gaohehs0041 march 2000 concludes that construction expenditures for public elementary and secondary schools 86000 across the nation have grown by 39 from fy1990 to fy1997 to about 25 billion in inflationadjusted 1998 dollars however average annual construction expenditures varied widely from state to state ranging from 934 per pupil in nevada to 37 per pupil in connecticut with the national average at 473 according to gao states with the largest per pupil expenditures for construction eg nevada also had high enrollment growth rates most school construction is financed by state and local governmental bonds the interest on which is basically exempt from federal income tax in most states there is some combination of local and state funding although 15 states provided little or state funding for school construction in 19981999 gao indicated the data are incomplete with regard to funding sources for school construction and an accurate estimate of the cost for construction needs is also difficult to obtain national center for education statistics nces study an nces study condition of americas public school facilities nces2000032 1999 from its fast response survey system used similar methodology to gaos based on local school officials reported construction needs the study indicates that approximately three quarters of schools reported needing money for repairs renovations and modernizations to place the schools current buildings in good overall condition nces estimates the need at 127 billion6 the average dollar amount per school for renovation is about 22 million and the average cost per student for repair and modernization is 3800 per student 5 continued construction of public elementary and secondary schools school libraries and media centers grants were authorized for leas that lacked fiscal capacity and where school buildings were in urgent need of repair the initial funding for the infrastructure act title xii esea for fy1995 100 million was rescinded with subsequent funding 6 the highest estimate is from national education association nea study published in 2000 modernizing our schools what will it cost nea suggests that the total funding need for public school modernization is 3219 billion of that total 2682 billion of the need is for school infrastructure and 537 billion of the need is for education technology this report was prepared as statebystate assessment using research from nea affiliates in all 50 states crs4 enrollment projections and construction according to the projections of education statistics to 2010 by nces the projection for total k12 enrollment for 2010 will be over 53 million students school construction reports indicate that growing enrollment is crowding both high schools and middle schools in large number of school districts according to the school planning and managements 2005 school construction report school construction valued at an estimated 202 billion was completed in calendar year 2004 rallying from low point in 2003 1996 billion from the 2004 construction level an estimated 122 billion went into the design and construction of new schools with the remainder of the money for renovation and additions to existing school buildings plans for 2005 project approximately 196 billion in construction dollars representing slight decline the school construction explosion that started in 1996 appears to have continued virtually unabated until 2003 but has rallied again in 2004 the national median cost of building new elementary school is estimated at 110 million for school serving 600 students for middle school the national median cost would be 150 million for school serving 750 students and for high school serving 1200 students the national median cost would be
