report of the copyright office on these licenses httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98320television satellite and cable retransmission of broadcast video programming under the copyright acts compulsory licenses summary the cable and satellite compulsory licenses of the copyright act require rightsholders to permit the retransmission of certain broadcast signals by cable systems and wireless cable in the case of the 111 license and by satellite providers including direct broadcasting entities in the case of the 119 license the licenses have some common features such as rate adjustment and distribution proceedings the licenses differ markedly however in their overall structure signal coverage conditions of carriage and copyright royalty payment mechanisms the satellite carrier license of the copyright act authorizes retransmission of superstation and network television programming by satellite carriers to home satellite dish owne rs upon payment of copyright royalty of 27 cents per signal per subscriber each month and compliance with other statutory conditions the license which is codified as section 119 of title 17 u s code applies only for purposes of private home viewing legislation creating the license was originally enacted for 6 years effective january 1 1989 before its expiration the satellite carrier licen was extended for another 5 years by the sate llite home viewer act of 1994 shva of 1994 public law 103369 the 119 license expires december 31 1999 unless congress acts to extend it the cable compulsory license of 111 of the copy right act permits retransmission of any broadcast signals by wired or wireless cable systems subject to the payment of copyright royalties essentially for signals distant to the community served by the cable system the cable license is permanent law recent developments relating to the satellite and cable licenses include the 1997 satellite license rate ad justment proceeding in troduction of s 1422 and hr 2921 which would delay

carriers would have been able to retransmit broadcas t television programming to their home dish owner subscribers after 1994 only if the ca rriers had negotiated voluntary licensing agreements with every copyright owner of the works embodied in the broadcast programming but see the later discussion conc erning the satellite carriers argument that they might qualify for the 17 usc 111 cable

approximately one to tw percent of the television households in the united states which could not receive one or more of the three major commercial networks abc cbs and nbc these households were located primarily in remote rural areas where terrain or distance from the nearest tran smitter whether primary or translator station make overtheair reception of viewable sign not feasible in some cases cable service is available to retransmit viewable signal the satellite carrier license does not apply to household that subscribed to cable service within 90 days before starting satellite carrier service as discussed later the expansion of the definition of network station to include the fox stations and probably united mount and warner brothers stations also expands the reach of the satellite carrier lic ense to areas outside the traditional white areas of course this expansion only relate s to these smaller networks which do not have the number of affiliates and nationwide coverage that the three major networks have 21the satellite home viewer act of 1988 shva of 1988 incorporated several key definitions from the section 111 cable license including the definition of network station under this definition neither pbs member st ations nor fox broadcasting affiliates clearly qualified as network stations the absence of fully nationwide television service excluded the fox affiliates their noncommercial status apparently excluded pbs stations from the network category under the shva of 1988 notwith standing reference in the legislative history of the shva of 1988 which referred to pbs as network hr rep 887 part 2 100th cong 2d sess 19 1988 the copyright ffice however did not refuse to accept satellite license statements of account that char acterized pbs stations as network signals as discussed later the shva of 1994 clar ified the status of pbs stations and also broadened the definition of network to include the fox network and new smaller networks 22the current rate took effect january 1 1998 the former rates were 6 cents for network signals and 175 or 14 cents per month per sign per subscriber for superstation signals depending upon whether or not the broadcast station was entitled to protection under the fccs syndicated exclusivity rules syndica ted television programming is offnetwork or postnetwork programming licensed directly to individual broadcast stations the fccs rules basically require respect for the contract ual rights obtained by broadcasters in the syndicated programming superstation programming subject to these rules must be blacked out upon request in areas where other stations hold exclusive rights unless the superstation has obtained nationwide rights in the same pr ogramming in which case the other stations rights would be nonexclusive signals only for their retrans mission to households unserved20 by the networks and their affiliate stations21 superstations are independent broadcast stations like wtbsatlanta wor new york and wgnchicago not affiliate d with any of the commercial networks the overtheair signal of these independent stations is retransmitted on an essentially nationwide basis principally by wired cab services under the authority of the separate cable compulsory license of section 111 of the copyright act the section 119 satellite carrier license requires monthly royalty payment for each broadcast station retran smitted based on the number of subscribers to the signal multiplied by the statutory rate for that type of station the current rate if 27 cents per month per

distribution function was transferred to ad hoc arbitration panels which are convened and supervised by the copyright office under the direction of the libraria n of congress the librarian also now convenes any arbitration pane l for purposes of adjusting the satellite license rates24 to justify carriage of network programmin g the satellite carrier submits to each network within 90 days af ter commencing retransmission the names and addresses of its subscribers the networks and their affiliates can use this list to determine whether the subscriber resides in an unserved household which is

retransmission of their works embodied in broadcast programming and to facilitate access by wired cable systems to broadcast programming under reasonable rates and conditions for the benefit of cable subscribers and the public early history of cable television cable television systems began as communitybased receptionenhancing services in the late 1940s and early 1950s known originally as community antenna television catv cable systems initially provided simple antenna service that impr oved reception of overtheair local broadcast signals very soon howev er cable system technology was used to import distant broadcast st ations not available overthe air in the cable systems service area premium or pay cable programming services also were developed by the early 1970s cable operators purchased transmission rights for the premiumpay cable programming from their copyright owners cable operators paid nothing to broadcasters for retransmission of broad cast signals and did not obtain any voluntary copyright licenses for this retransmission broadcast stations were concerned about the competitive impact of cable technology and the unauthorized use of their broadcast programming without any payment of royalties broadcasters st renuously objected to importation of distant signals throughout the 1960s broadcaste rs sought administrative relief through regulations of the federal communications commission fcc petitioned congress to make cable systems liable fo r copyright infringement by amendment of the copyright law and challenged in court the legality of cable carriage of broadcast signals when it became possible to count cable viewership for ratings purposes some broadcasters preferred mandatory cable carriage of local signals to copyright relief and the fcc obliged the broadcaste rs by issuing mustcarry rules in 1972 the networks and most commercial broadcasters both network affiliates and independent stations remained strongly opposed to im portation of distant broadcast signals they felt the distant signals cost the local broadcaster viewers and diluted the value of their programming for which they had paid significant sums to obtain exclusive rights in their own television ma rket in the 1960s the distant broadcast station itself could not generally sell advertisements directed to the distant televisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98320crs8 27the economic situation changed later for some distant stations as national or regional advertisers became aware of the possibilities of advertising on broadcast stations imported into distant television markets with the ad vent of satellite technology and the creation of the superstation national and regional advertisers could place ads at rates less than network rates and still reach large national or regional audience except for station wtbs atlanta willing superstation which from its inception as superstation sought to sell ads nationally the independent br oadcast stations that were turned into superstations without their permission continue d to join the networks and their affiliates in opposing uncompensated retransmission of their broadcast programming by cable systems 28copyright owners licensed some works to networks for nationwide transmission for which the networks paid large sums of money because broadcast stations both network affiliates and independents operate in the specific television markets they are authorized by the fcc to serve copyright owners were ab before the advent of cable retransmission to market exclusive rights in their works in ea ch television market that

copyright owners who licensed broadcast rights to broadcasters also strongly objected to cable retransmission of distant signals because it eroded their ability to license exclusive broadcast rights in given television market28 in order to protect broadcasters from th perceived unfair use by cable systems of broadcast signals the fcc in 1966 asserted jurisdiction over cable systems29 at first the fcc required cable systems to obtain fcc approval in full administrative hearing for importation of distant signals into major television market this rule had the practical effect of freezing distant signal importation except for grandfathered signals in late 1968 after the supreme court ruled against copyright liability for cable retransmissions30 the fcc began its experimentation with retransmission consent the fcc proposed rules wh ich were implemented experimentally but never adopt ed in final form requiri ng cable systems to obtain retransmission consent from the broadcaster to

experts generally criticized the courts assertion that viewers do not perform when receiving works on ordinary home television sets copyright experts generally argued that viewers have copyright liability because they engage in private performance the copyrigh t law restricts public performances of works lower appellate courts had so ruled if the s upreme court had followed this principle cable operators would probably have been held liable for retransmission of broadcast programming alternatively the court could ve decided that the term perform in the 1909 act could not be stretched to cover chnology not even contemplated when the 1909 act was passed 37415 us 394 1974 38415 us at 408refused consent to allow cable retransmission32 following this experiment the fcc in 1972 promulgated its major body of cable carriage rules33 in the congress the copyright liability of cable systems became stumbling block in the effort to enact general revisi on of the copyright law the last general revision had been enacted in 1909 legislation was passed in the 1960s as broadcasters and copyright ow ners attempted to obtain judicial relief by suing cable operators for copyright infringement under the existing 1909 act34 while broadcasterscopyright owne rs won some lower court cases the cable operators ultimately prevailed before the supreme court in two historic copyright cases in fortnightly corp v united artists television inc35 the court applied functional test to determine whether cable operators performed copyrighted works in retransmitting those works as embodi ed in broadcast signals noting that broadcasters perform in transmitting works and asserting that viewers do not perform in receiving wo rks embodied in signals36 the court found cable systems in the 1960s functioned as viewers and d copyright liability for retransmission of essentially local broadcast signals when the issue of distant signal importation finally came before the supreme court in columbia broadcasting system inc v teleprompter corp37 broadcasters lost and cable systems prevailed again the court said that the reception and rechanneling of these broadcast signals for simultaneous viewing is esse ntially viewer function irrespective of the distance between the broadcasting station and the ultimate viewer38 the fortnightlyteleprompter decisions gave cable systems complete exemption from copyright liability for retransmission of broadcast signals the practical effect was not to end the polic debate which now returned to the legislative forum since the general revi sion of the 1909 act was yet pending buthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98320crs10 39indeed copyright owners were in the weakest posture of any of the contending interests among cable operators broadcasters and rightsholders cable operators had prevailed in court broadcasters had prevailed before the fcc whose 1972 rules seriously restricted cable carriage of distant signals but required carriage of local signals rightsholders were not getting any money from cable for retransm ission and would have difficulty negotiating increased payments from broadcasters rights holders could not get regulatory relief they had to obtain relief from the congress through an amendment of the copyright law 40the distant signal rules governed the perm issibility of importing broadcast signals from distant television market into the service area of the cable system the rules established rigid quotas for the number of distant indepe ndent station signals that is commercial non network signals that could be carried by cable system based on the division of television markets into top50 lower50 smaller market and outside all markets categories the distant signal demarcation was drawn by pplication of the mustcarry rules if the broadcast station could insist upon cable carriage the signal was local all other signals were distant these rules were eliminated by the fcc effective june 25 1981 but remain highly significant under the copyright act for calculation of the copyright royalties payable by cable systems 41the syndicated exclusivity rules allowed broadcast station to object to cable carriage of specific nonnetwork programming for which the broadcast station had purchased exclusive transmission rights within its television market most of this programming was syndicated that is marketed by independe nt producers to one broadcast station in each television market under an exclusive license these rules remain in effect on modified basis 42the network nonduplication rules prohibit cable importation of network signal into service area already served by that network for example if an nbc affiliate station operates in the television market served by the cable system the system may not duplicate the network programming by importing another nbc station whether network owned and operated station or an affiliate station in to that television market the signal can be imported to retransmit the nonnetwork portion of the broadcast day ie local news local television shows and syndicated programming these rules remain in effect 43the mustcarry rules in effect on april 15 1976 were incorporated by reference into the copyright act in the section 111f definition of local service area of primary transmitter which essentially defines local signals under these rules broadcast station licensed to operate in particular co mmunity served by cable system could insist upon carriage by that system within certain lim its the principal criteria were i geography mustcarry rights applied within 35 mile radius from the transmitter site ii continuedto place the cable operators in strong position in forging compromise concerning their copyright liability under the proposed revision39 1976 copyright revision congress legislated the cable compulsory license in 1976 to resolve the copyright policy i ssues stemming from retransmission of copyrighted works by wired cable systems since the fcc had engaged in substantial regulation of wired cable the congress em ployed the fabric of fcc regulations to shape the contours of the cable compulsory license in essence the fccs cable regulations infused the copyright law and were incorporated by reference almost bodily into the copyright law these regulations included the distant signal carriage rules40 the syndicated

cable or satellite service providers that are eligible for the co mpulsory licenses or by obtaining local government franchise to operate as cable system those telephone companies that do not gain access to the compulsory licenses will be at serious competitive disadvantage in providing video services it is not likely that they could obtain the right to retransmit the broadcast programming

free of copyright liability under the passive carrier exemption of 17 usc 111a3 the conditions of that exemption are that the carrier have direct or indi rect control over the content or selection of

communications act had legalized home dish reception of unscrambled satellite signal s unless the program owner had licensing marketing plan to which the public could subscribe the satellite carriers and many program owners scrambled their transmissions to assert proprietary control over them by scrambling their signals satellite carriers were able to control the particular recipients of the secondary transmission which violat ed the conditions of the section 111a3 passive carrier exemption satellite carriers were longer passive at this point they asserted their eligibility for the cable

1994 congress expected that the satellite carriers and the broadcasters would agree among themselves about the detailed procedures and standards for the signal intensity test for example where will the measurement be take n inside the household or on the rooftop antennae how high must the antennae be wher must the antennae be located how will the measurement be taken for condominiums and other multiple dwellings the negotiations did not result in any agreement and the bill in the 104th congress hr 3192 which would have compelled arbitration was not enacted consequently if satellite carrier delivery of network signal is challenged within the st ations predicted grade b contour the satellite carrier ordinarily deactivates service for that signal the householder is then left with the options of receiving the signal over the air if possible of subscribing to cable service if it is available or of doing without the signal the senate judiciary committee report stated the provisions are designed to be mechanism for resolving disputes without litigation over whether existing subscribers are unserved within the meaning of the act63 within the predicted grade b contour the satellite carrier had the burden of conducting signal intensity measurement to determine whether the household was unserved if the network station challenged the satellite service if the test had shown the household was not unserved the carrier immediately d to deauthorize the service if however the test showed the household was unserved the broadcast affiliate challenging the service had to reimburse the carrier for the cost of the signal measurement within 45 days of receiving the bill64 within the predicted grade b contour network affiliate c ould have conducted its own signal intensity

microwave in between wires and cables the purpose of this change was to make mmds or wireless cable systems eligible for the cable compulsory license the question arose however about co mputation of the royalties payable by wireless cable under the cable license as noted earlier wireless cable was not subject to the fccs cable carriage regulations since most of the regulations had been abolished by the fcc before wireless cab became operational in the mid1980s yet these fcc cable carriage regulations are indispensable to the computation of the cable royalties congress resolved this dilemma not by statutory text but by comments in the committee reports the senate judiciary committee report says the committee intends wireless cable and traditional wired cable systems to be placed on equal footing with respect to their royalty oblig ations under the cable compulsory license so that one not have an unfair advantage over the other due to differences in their regulatory status under fcc rules69 the senate report therefore directed the copyright office to treat wireless cable systems as if they were subject to the same fcc rules and regulations that are applicable to wired cable systems and wireless cable systems must file their royalty paym ents and statements of account accordingly in order to qualify for the section 111 license70 local signals under the cable license the shva of 1994 made one other adjustment to the section 111 cable compulsory license the definition of local service area of primary transmitter that is the definition of local signals71 was amended the change in essence expanded the concept of local signals to include not only signals entitled to mus tcarry status under the fccs 1976 rules the former law but also those entitled to mustcarry status

between the effective date of the statutory mustcarry rules apparently december 4 1992 and passage of the shva of 1994 on october 18 1994 the obligation was largely theoretical since br oadcast station was unlikely to insist upon carriage if the carriage meant the station had to reimburse the cable operator for copyright royalty fees attributable to the difference between the two statutor definitions of local signals in lieu of mustcarry the 1992 cable ac t gave broadcast station the right to grant or deny its consent to retransmission of its signal by cable systems retransmission consent to date this broadcaster right has also been largely theoretical cable systems have refused to pay money for the privilege of carrying nonmust carry signals some broadcast networks may have obtained nonmonetary benefits such as additional cable channels or favorable channel positions in exchange for their retransmission consent 74under the cable compulsory license broadcast signal is either local or distant the definition of local service area of primar transmitter governs the demarcation between local and distant if broadcast signal is not local it is distant 75in essence copyright royalties are paid by cable systems for carriage of local signals under the section 111 cable license copyright royalties are paid only for distant signals except for small systems who pay

by replacing the copyright arbitration royalty panels with administrative law judges make the satellite license permanent allow satellite service subscribers w ho terminate cable service to receive

copyright act title 17 of the us code while the bills would reform the administrative structure for rate adjus tments changes are proposed in the statutory criteria for the cable and satellite license rate adjustments in the case of the satellite license this means that th fair market valu of the secondary transmissions is the guiding principle for adjusting the rate the cable license rates however

competition act of 1998 s 2494 would amend only the communications act new section 337 of title 47 usc would essentially mandate localtolocal retrans mission of broadcast signals by directto home

by cable systems and wireless cable in the case of the 111 license and by satellite providers including direct broadcasting entities in the case of the 119 license the licenses have some common features such as rate adjustment and distribution of royalties under ad hoc arbitration panels supervised by the copyright office and the librarian of congress the licenses differ markedly however in their overall structure signal coverage conditions of carriage and copyright royalty payment mechanisms the satellite home viewer act of 1994 shva of 1994 amended both the satellite and cable licen ses it extended the life of the 119 satellite license for 5 years until december 31 1999 the extended satellite license begins with compulsory phase royalty rates set by statute which is followed by vol untary negotiationarb itration phase royalty rates set by voluntary agreement or as last resort by compulsory arbitration 1997 public proceeding by copyright arbitration royalty panel adjusted the satellite rates and fixed the new rate at 27 cents per month per signal per subscriber the panel applied the statutory criterion of the fair market value of the retransmitted signals under the shva of 1994 satellite carriers have the burden of proving that household is unserved by given networ k to justify the 119 license special transitional procedures in effect for 2 ears have now expired they were intended to facilitate nonjudicial enforcement of th satellite licenses re striction to white areas for retransmission of network programming but were never implementedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98320crs27 because agreement was reached on signal measurement standards and procedures restriction of sate llite service to uns erved households determination of

direct broadcasting services dbs for the satellite license for the first time more recently the public broadcasting service has sought amendment of the 119 satellite license to allow national distribution by direct broadcasting entities of pbs own satellite feed some dbs entities seek expansi on of the 119 license to allow them to retransmit local broadcast signals other recent developments include submission to congress by the copyright office of report in august 1997 revi ewing the cable nd satellite licenses adjustment of the royalty rates by carp proceeding which was
