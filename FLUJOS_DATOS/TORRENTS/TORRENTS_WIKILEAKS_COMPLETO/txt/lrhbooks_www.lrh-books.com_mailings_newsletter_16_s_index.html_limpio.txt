bridge publications inc newsletter date immortality why was it that the invalidation of past death produced such terrific sag in tone well thats very simple immortality survival is the answer if person runs past death or past life which he is certain and incontrovertibly knows is completely real and that it happened he all of sudden is holding in his two hands proof of his own immortality and it consequently reduces the fear of death very markedly what is the fear of death derived from the fear of death is not derived from pain but only from the fact that you only live once that you are finite and that the future is very uncertain but when person runs past life that he knows is real he all of sudden realizes it goes out for long time into the future too and it goes out for long time into the past and hes pretty hard to handle in terms of control if he has high reality on past lives why because whats the worst thing you can do to him the worst thing you can do to him is kill him l ron hubbard excerpted from the scientology milestone one lectures before time an article by l ron hubbard now the race to which we are nativethe theta line to which we are nativewas actually highly mystic it was capable of lot of thingstelepathy teleportation odds and ends stuffand concentrated rather heavily in that this invader race came in and sayswith lot of electronics and said boys all youve got to do is take this little jimdandy whizzer and you know you will be twice as thetesque as before they sold you all bill of goods and evidently we didnt penetrate their minds their thoughts or their intentions because one right after the otherbang bang bang bang bangthey knocked us off they knocked us off with very simple apparatus and that simple apparatus consisted of something that went around your head and across the top of your head and under your chinunder your throatand back of your head and everything pointed at the pineal they turned on the juice and something came in the middle of the head toward the pineal three points on the top of the head toward the pineal from under the throat up at the pineal from the back of the head into the pineal and from the sides of the jaws into the pineal in other words every point of entrance toward the pineal was hit suddenly and hard and very excruciatingly the net result the pineal gland which at that time occupied what you had as skull and was practically all the skull there was practically folded up and your mystic powers more or less went by the boards then you went ahead and dramatized it and there are lot of overt acts on it and pretty soon you got so bad as race thatperhaps you were elsewhere by this timeyou were hauled upoh some long long long long time later maybe even million years lateryou eventually wound up before another crew and this other crew said we dont want you around anymore and were going to send you to jail and so they packaged you up and shipped you off and that is an incident we call before earthbe thats before earth and they shipped you off and you wound up here and all they did was transport your theta line here and you joined in on the mest body line here i dont know too much about the modus operandi that worked at that time but they evidently had it in mind it contains by the way sort of being put in an ice cube state its quite nice and by the way the early christian hell was painted up as hot hell and cold hell and you see the early christian paintings have guys up to theice cube up to the neck now thats two hundredabout two hundred ad you find them doing this now when you got down here to earth theres probably joinup line and then there is seriesprobably theres some overt acts here on earth and overt act facsimiles and then theres present time but the incidents youre trying to run on case are actually heavy facsimile one and be as the principal incidents really and dont get them mixed up here because theres bt before timeand you can reach this on preclear by asking before timeand theres facsimile one which is back here someplace its about million years ago or million two hundred thousand years ago it varies from person to person but its in the order of magnitude of million years and then theres rejection be being kicked off onto earth and earth is hell and youre here i guess until you get reformed but theres race existing right now out in outer space and this race is not very interested in younot very interested and some of you by the way without much trouble can do contact across because some of your theta line stayed out there but there are the incidents which you will find of principal interest in the preclear and these are the incidents which you will have to run out of the preclear if youre going to take somebody off the top of the dial im sorry if it stretches your credulity i do hope however that it doesnt stretch it to the point where you wont operate on it l ron hubbard from the lecture principal incidents on the theta
