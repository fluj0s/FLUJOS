fair election president alberto fujimori of peru won third term on may 28 the united states urged sanctions but the oas sent highlevel mission to press peru for democratic reforms instead corruption scandals and lessened support led fujimori to agree to new elections in april 2001 and then on november 20 to resign the 106th congress called for the review and modification of us relations with peru if elections were not judged free and fair by international observers and then for the withholding of aid if democratic progress was not made other concerns particularly the curbing of illegal drug trafficking and protecting security interests affect how the united states responds to the situation in peru options for congress range from cautious approach aimed at protecting security interests to applying greater pressure on the government of peru to respect and develop democratic processes background to perus elections1 perus first round electi ons were held on april 9 2000 all 120 seats of the unicameral legislature were contested along with the presidency incumbent president alberto fujimori ran for an unprecedented third term first elected in 1990 fujimori did much to tame destabilizing factors such as terrorism drug trafficking hyperinflation and border disputes but fujimoris efforts to maintain power created constitutional crises in peru and left its democratic institutions extremely weak traditional political parties were discredited in the 1980s and current parties are mainly vehicles for an individuals candidacyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20536crs2 basic elements of democracy include effective and independent legislative and judicial branches of government freedom of expression respect for human rights and free elections broad array of organizations both domestic and international have criticized fujimori for impeding the development of these democratic elements fujimori effectively controls both the legislature and judiciary inhibiting the development of either as independent democratic institutions freedom house classifies peru with population of 25 million as the only country in the hemisphere besides cuba where the press is not free the state departments 2000 human rights report says that despite some improvements the peruvian governments human rights record was poor in several areas in 1999 including in the protection of civil and political rights extrajudicial killings by security forces and lack of accountability within the armed forces in terms of the electoral environment an international preelection delegation to peru organized by the national democratic institute for international affairs ndi and the carter center stated on march 24 2000 that the conditions for fair election campaign have not been established irreparable damage to the integrity of the election process has already been done but improvements still can and should be made because candidates and parties are competing citizens are participating in the process and the electoral outcomes are not assured in early march support for one of the other eight presidential challengers alejandro toledo began to rise dramatically suddenly calling into question the longheld assumption that fujimori would win the election in the first round toledo former adviser to the world bank holds doctorate in economics from stanford university and emphasizes his humble origins he is one of 16 children from poor family and shined shoes as boy and his indian ancestry continued economic reform and ethnic pride were key issues in his campaign candidate won more than 50 of the votes so second round of elections were to be held for the presidency may 28 but both peruvian and international observers reported that conditions for free and fair election still did not exist the organization of american states oas observer mission and peruvian monitoring organization transparencia withdrew from monitoring the election the week before the runoff toledo withdrew from the race and called for national boycott of the elections all said they would reconsider participating in the elections if they were delayed to allow time to resolve computer problems and other irregularities fujimori would not delay the vote official results showed that of total votes cast fujimori won 512 toledo 177 toledo had called on voters to boycott the vote or spoil their ballots almost 30 of ballots were spoiled the electoral environment opposition candidates and many other observers believe that electoral conditions in peru did not represent level playing field but an environment that heavily and often unfairly favored the incumbent numerous peruvian and international election monitoring organizations and press coverage indicated areas of concern such as the executive branchs manipulation of the judicial system to achieve its desired outcome questions regarding the independence and impartiality of the electoral bodies responsible for organizing perus elections and use of public resources for campaign purposes concerns regardinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20536crs3 freedom of the press and access to information involved unequal media access media bias and harassment of candidates and domestic election observers the reelection issue many civic groups and other observers question the constitutionality of fujimoris bid for third term the controversy revolves around whether fujimoris first term should be counted toward the current constitutions two term limit and fujimoris manipulation of the political system to ensure he could run for third term the constitution under which fujimori was first elected in 1990 limited presidents to one term in what became known as selfcoup fujimori dissolved congress and took control of the judiciary in 1992 he then oversaw the drafting of new constitution that went into effect in 1993 and which allowed president to serve two consecutive terms fujimori ran again and won second fiveyear term in 1995 in 1996 the legislature dominated by profujimori majority passed law of authentic interpretation which stated that fujimoris election under the old constitution did not count against the twoterm limit of the current constitution essentially paving the way for fujimori to run for third term in 1997 the constitutional tribunal issued an opinion that the law of authentic interpretation was not applicable with three members of the court signing and four abstaining the three members who signed the opinion were removed from the tribunal by the congress the interamerican commission on human rights recommended in 1998 that the government reins tate the three dismissed justices and restore the tribunals power to rule on constitutional issues the government announced it would not comply with the recommendation leaving the tribunal without the quorum needed to rule on laws constitutionality its main function civic organizations wished to put the matter of third term to national referendum and collected some 14 million signatures more than the 10 of registered voters signatures required to do so the national elections tribunal jurado nacional elecciones or jne thwarted this effort by reversing an earlier decision and declaring that congress had to approve the referendum issue before it could proceed congress then killed the referendum by voting against it citizens ability to challenge such actions was further hampered by the constitutional tribunals inability to act and by fujimoris withdrawal of peru from the jurisdiction of the interamerican court for human rights when president fujimori registered his candidacy in december 1999 18 motions challenging it were immediately filed before the jne by civic groups opposition political parties and the bar association of lima the jne which according to the constitution resolves all electoral controversies rejected all 18 motions within days according to the ndicarter centers second report all of these steps appeared to be an orchestration aimed to ensure specific legal outcome on the issues of the president standing for re election irrespective of the merits of the legal arguments taken as whole the report said these measures undermine the credibility of the political process in peru freedom of the press concern over the lack of freedom of the press in peru did not begin with the election campaign period members of the peruvian press have repeatedly complained of government interference in their work throughout much of fujimoris tenure journalists there have been threatened to the extent that some have sought political asylum in the united states two have been killed in recent years since 1992 accor ding to freedom house many print and broadcast journalists have been pressured into selfcenso rship by broad government campaign of intimidation whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20536crs4 includes death threats libel suits withholding of advertising police harassment arbitrary detention and physical mistreatment the oas special rapporteur for freedom of expression reported receiving evidence that would indicate that certain sectors of the peruvian government including the peruvian intelligence service have the intention of silencing journalists who have expressed opinions critical of authorities throughout the election period smear campaigns against leading opposition candidates were waged in the tabloid press domestic election monitors the ombudsmans office and news media critica l of the government were also vilified by elements of the media according to various international reports many observers believe these efforts were orchestrated by government officials access to the media was also reported to be highly imbalanced opposition candidate toledo said modest improvements in media coverage just prior to elections were insufficient to make up for months of unfair and dirty tactics which in addition to the smear campaigns against him he said included phone taps harassment and death threats toledo said he would not reenter the race unless he was also guaranteed equal access to the media us interests in peru the united states and peru enjoy generally friendly relations the united states provided almost 120 million in economic assistance to peru in 1999 and the clinton administration requested about 121 million for peru for 2000 the stated goals of us assistance are broader citizen participation and more responsive government increased incomes for perus poor improved health of high risk population s improved environmental conditions and reduced production of illicit narcotics the primary us interest in peru has been the reduction of illicit drugs production and trafficking peru is considered fully cooperative in working towards the goals of the usperuvian counternarcoti cs framework agreement under fujimori peru reduced illegal production of coca leaf by 66 over the past 4 years nonetheless peru remains one of the worlds largest suppliers of coca leaf for cocaine in legislation and committee reports the 106th congress expressed concern however about the clinton administrations provision of counternarcotics assistance to the peruvian intelligence service which is widely reported to be responsible for wide array of human rights violations the united states has also been concerned about security in peru and the andean region fujimori enhanced security on national level although his government also had one of the worst human rights records in the western hemisphere he greatly debilitated perus two guerrilla insurgency groups the shining path sendero luminoso and the tupac amaru revolutionary movement mrta which at the time fujimori took office had terrorized the country for decade in 1995 longstanding border conflict between peru and ecuador flared briefly into armed conflict in 1998 the two countries signed an agreement to resolve the dispute peacefully us response to election conditions in peru early in perus electoral process the house and senate passed resolutions hres 57 passed october 4 1999 sres 209 passed november 8 1999 expressing concernhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20536crs5 over interference with freedom of the press and the independence of judicial and electoral institutions in peru the house called such actions threat to democracy in that country the clinton administration funded election monitoring missions by the ndi and carter center who at the invitation of peru s government began conducting evaluations of electoral conditions in peru in december 1999 in early march 2000 the clinton administration echoed the missions serious concerns about preelection conditions in peru outlining seven specif ic steps the peruvian government should take to establish confidence in the political and electoral processes including encouraging improved media coverage of the election process so voters can make informed and free choices at the ballot box and ceasing attacks on opposition candidates domestic election observers and peru s ombudsman late in march the ndicarter center mission acknowledged steps taken by perus government to respond to earlier recommendations but stated that many of these steps came lateand have not proven suffici ent to overcome the media disadvantage for the opposition to overcome the apparent lack of public awareness about voting procedures or to counteract perceptions of impunity for elector abuse the clinton administration concurred with these findings and similar ones by the oas stating that the governments actions still fall far short of what is required to ensure fully democratic process perus april 9 elections were followed by three tense days of delayed results widespread suspicion of fraud and public protests after international observers said they would not validate firstround victory by president fujimori peru announced there would be second round of elections though election officials denied there was any connection between the two acts runoff was scheduled for may 28 between fujimori whom election official s said won 4984 of the vote and alejandro toledo officially reported to have won 4031 because ballots were destroyed after being tallied as allowed by peruvian law proving ballot tampering or conducting recount was impossible president clinton signed congressional resolution emphasizing the importance of free fair and democratic elections in peru and warning that us policy toward peru would be reviewed in the absence of such elections see below leading up to the runoff election the ndicarter center delegation reported on may 5 that unless immediate and comprehensive improvements are made to the political environment surrounding the presidential runoff election as well as to administrative and technical proce dures required for election day and the consolidation of results perus election process will ultimately fail to meet minimum international standards for democratic electionsat this junction however the credibility of the election process is at risk the oass assessments were similar and the oas called for delay in the runoff elections to correct computer and other problems that left the process open to fraud the clinton administration said it supported the oass recommendations following the elections the clinton administration at first called the election invalid after other hemispheric nations refused to follow suit the administration softened its stance to an expression of deep regret that peru had proceeded with the vote under conditions judged as unfair by the oas observer mission the oas rejected us efforts to condemn perus elections and impose sanctio ns instead it passed resolution expressi ng concern over election irregularities and sent highlevel mission to peru to press for democratic reforms oas officials met with fujimori toledo and other members of the political community they issued an agenda calling for reforms to establish an independent judicial syste m guarantee press freedom correct flaws in the electoralhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20536crs6 process and provide oversight of the military and intelligence services the oas set up permanent office in lima to mediate national dialogue and oversee implementation of the reforms by late 2002 in the midst of negotiations with the opposit ion on the reform agenda corruption scandals broke relating to intellig ence chief vladimiro montesinos fujimori agreed to early elections in april 2001 in which he said he would not run and then as he lost more support he resigned on nov 20 constitutionally appointed interim government headed by president valentin paniagua is overseeing preparations for the april elections congressional policy approaches some observers advocate cautious response to the weakening of democratic practices in peru the united states should continue to encourage the government to take steps to further democratic processes in peru but not take strong actions against the government such advocates argue that the united states has greater concerns in the region such as economic and political instability in colombia ecuador and venezuela with crises fomenting in perus neighboring countries this view advocates avoiding stimulating crises in peru which under fujimori had become politically and economically more stable than in the past noting that historically the united states has had minimal influence on peru this approach would avoid antagonizing perus government in order to ensure continued cooperation on counternarcotics and other issues of us concern opponents to this approach argue that further erosion of democratic practices in peru is itself destabilizing force in peru and in the region and needs to be addressed aggressively to protect us interests others advocate applying greater political pressure on the government of peru to respect democracy this approach is buoyed by past us successes in conjunction with the international community in recent years in pressuring peru to enact democratic reforms such as the reestablishment of the peruvian congress in 1993 the holding of elections in 1995 and the creation in 2000 of commission to review allegations of innocent peruvians in jail on terrorist charges peru adopted some suggestions made by the department of state and the ndicarter center preelection delegation in the recent election process winning reelection under what have been judged to be unfair conditions would not by law automatically trigger formal economic sanctions as happens in the case of military coup but some observers said an election fraudulently won would be the equivalent of civilian coup détat and urged sanctions and withdrawal of recognition when observers deemed that to be the case in peru congress called for pressure to be applied if peru does not improve its respect for democracy sjres 43 pl 106186 called for modifying us political economic and military relations with peru and working with other democracies toward restoration of democracy in peru should elections be deemed not free or
