march 26 2004 marc humphries analyst in energy policy resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress oil and gas exploration and development on public lands summary the us congress and the administration are involved in major policy debate over oil and gas development from federal lands and from federal mineral estate underlying certain privately owned lands within the framework of us public lands policy restrictions and withdrawals have affected the amount of land that can be developed the energy policy and conservation act amendments of 2000 epca mandated study which was released in january 2003 to assess the oil and gas resource potential underlying restricted federal lands it concluded that although the amount of land prospected for natural gas that was completely offlimits for development was 356 other restrictions and lease stipulations are in place the conference report to the energy policy act of 2003 hr 6 as well as the scaled back senate version of the bill s 2095 contains provisions that would address restrictions and impediments to oil and gas development on public lands the bush administration has its own initiatives to expedite the permitting process considered by some to be major impediment on federal lands as part of the oil and gas leasing system lessees must file an application for permit to drill apd for each well the bureau of land management blm is required to process the apd in 30 days but delays may occur extending the average approval time to over 120 days some approvals have taken over three years new process to expedite the apds has been established at the blm that includes among other features the processing and conducting of environmental analyses on multiple permit applications with similar characteristics energy and mineral industry representatives maintain that federal withdrawals andor restrictions inhibit mineral exploration and limit the reserve base even when conditions are favorable for development they further contend that sufficient environmental standards are in place to protect public lands critics who oppose opening up more federal lands or the mineral estate under private lands argue that the general environmental requirements are not adequate and that some forms of development threaten water quality and quantity therefore certain restrictions and withdrawals are appropriate concern exists regarding natural gas supply and declining production rates as result there is increased interest in potential gas supplies in the rocky mountain region several resource estimates suggest significant amounts of natural gas on public and private lands in the region and rocky mountain natural gas may become much more important to the overall supply picture elsewhere the outlook is mixed for increased oil and natural gas production on us public lands while domestic natural gas production and natural gas imports are expected to rise it is unclear whether much of the domestic supply will come from public lands that are currently restricted or offlimits this report will not be updated contents introduction 1 oil and gas leasing on

oil and gas resources are projected to be on federal public lands see table 7 however energy development on some of these lands has been restricted because they are considered environmentally sensitive or unique these restricted areas may contain sizable amounts of oil and natural gas according to the us geological survey usgs and the energy information administration eia the conflict between environmental concerns and the need for increased domestic energy production from public lands is major policy issue for example the conference report on the omnibus energy bill hr 6 and the senate substitute s 2095 has provisions that would examine restrictions and impediments to oil and gas development on public lands including an evaluation of the current permitting process reportedly reflecting its energy task force recommendations the bush administration has its own initiative to expedite the oil and gas permitting process on federal lands oil and gas development practices have generated considerable debate in congress since the early years of the industry originally oil and gas resources on public lands could be transferred to private ownership patented under the mining law of 1872 essentially lands containing oil were sold at fixed price per acre to the first claimant1 conservationists contended that there was widespread abuse of the mining law that led to wasteful use of public lands in 1909 president taft withdrew 3 million acres of lands prospective for oil in wyoming and california from availability under the mining law of 1872 taft requested congressional approval for his action leading to the pickett act of 1910 43 usc 141143 which explicitly recognized executive branch authority to make such public lands withdrawals2 1 enactment of the oil placer act of 1897 29 stat 526 resolved the question of whether petroleum or other mineral oils were to be governed by the laws relating to other placer claims placer claims are those located on the ground not fixed to below surface rock 2 the pickett act was repealed by the federal land policy and management act of 1976 flpma which also modernized the law regarding withdrawals under flpma 43 usc 1702 j land withdrawal is defined as withholding an area of federal land from settlement sale location or entry under some or all of the general land laws for the purpose of limiting activity under those laws in order to maintain other public values in the area or reserving the area for particular public purpose or program or transferring jurisdiction continued crs2 congress eventually decided that defenserelated minerals including oil and gas should remain under federal ownership as result the mineral lands leasing act of 1920 30 usc 181 et seq removed oil and gas from the patenting process and placed it under leasing system under the leasing system the federal government has raised billions of dollars in revenues from royalties rents and bonus bids3 minerals owned by the federal government under lands held privately patented creates splitestate there are other splitestate situations as well surface and mineral rights held by different private interests or state owned mineral rights and privately held surface rights three major federal statutes4 allowed the federal government to issue patents to land but reserve the right to the minerals under these statutes the mineral estate became the dominant estate and the surface use servient there are specific policies and procedures that must be followed by the mineral estate holder in order to develop minerals generally for oil and gas federal lessee must meet one of the following conditions surface agreement written consent or waiver from the private surface owner for access to the leased lands payment for loss or damages or the execution of bond not less than 1000 5 about 11 of the public lands are under the splitestate category however in wyoming 50 of the lands are splitestate and in montana about 576 environmentalists have supported public land withdrawals and other restrictions because of concern that the mining law of 1872 and then the mineral leasing act of 1920 provided inadequate environmental protection recently ranchers and other groups have expressed similar concerns specifically about the impact of development on water and land conversely development supporters contend that numerous environmental laws are now in place to regulate oil and gas development on public lands they note that the federal government must comply with the national environmental policy act nepa in leasing oil and gas and that the oil and gas industry must comply with applicable requirements of the clean water and clean air acts safe drinking water act the resource conservation and recovery act and state and federal reclamation standards among other laws the industry complains that environmental and other reviews often create long delays in drilling exploratory and production wells on leased lands the proposed conference report on comprehensive energy bill hr 6 and s 2095 addresses some of the industry and bush administration concerns over 2 continued over an area of federal land from one department bureau

gas supplies title iii of hr 6 and s 2095 if enacted would establish white house office of federal project coordination to help expedite permitting on public lands and identify restrictions and impediments to resource development on public lands environmentalists and other public land users argue that these provisions would cause harm to the environment and prevent the land from being used in other productive ways the conference report has been approved by the house but not in the senate as result of cloture motion on november 21 2003 that did not get the required 60 votes 57 40 the senates scaledback substitute bill s 2095 is awaiting action this report provides general overview of the oil and gas leasing system on us public lands including information on permitting production and reserves the report describes the contribution of onshore oil and gas towards meeting us energy demand and discusses current estimates of reserves in restricted areas an appendix provides some historical background on lands withdrawn from mineral development the role of the bureau of land management blm and application of the federal land policy and management act flpma in the context of oil and gas development for information on us offshore oil and gas development see crs report rl31521 outer continental shelf oil and gas energy security and other major issues by marc humphries oil and gas leasing on public lands leasing of onshore federal public lands for oil and gas development is based on multipleuse sustained yield resource management plans rmps developed by the bureau of land management in the department of the interior in accordance with those landuse plans tracts of public land with oil and gas potential are offered for competitive leasing each quarter after lease is awarded drilling permit is required for each exploratory or production well industry has long complained that this process is too lengthy in fy2002 the federal government issued 1765 new oil and gas leases on public lands totaling about 14 million acres through the end of fy2002 about 186 million acres of public lands had been leased for oil and gas development land use planning under the federal land policy and management act flpma resource management plans or land use plans 43 usc 1712 are required for tracts or areas of public lands prior to development the bureau of land management blm must consider environmental impacts during landuse planning when rmps are developed and implemented rmps can cover large areas often hundreds of thousands of acres across multiple counties flpma requires that rmps reflect diverse uses such as timber grazing wildlife conservation recreation and energy and consider the needs of present and crs4 future generations7 impacts of various uses are identified early in the process so that they can be weighed equitably against one another the plans are also intended to weigh the various benefits associated with public lands to best serve the community rmps must be consistent with environmental regulations and allow meaningful public participation through the landuse planning process the blm determines which lands with oil and gas potential will be made available for leasing the mineral leasing act of 1920 as amended requires that all public lands available for lease be offered initially to the highest responsible qualified bidder by oral competitive bidding these auctions are held quarterly by the blm the objective of the competitive bid is to provide fair market value return to the federal government for its resources if bids are received or the highest bid is less than the 2acre national minimum acceptable bid oil and gas leases on these lands are offered on noncompetitive basis within 30 days the tracts remain available on noncompetitive basis for two years tracts available for noncompetitive leasing may be obtained by the first qualified applicant upon payment of nonrefundable application fee of at least 75 simultaneous simo noncompetitive lease applications filed on the day following the competitive lease sale are prioritized through lottery system lease applicants filing on subsequent days are given priority according to the time of filing for more details on leasing terms see appendix geophysical exploration permits on unleased public lands may be issued by blm such exploration does not include drilling for core samples or drilling for oil and gas the permittee must file notice of intent with the blm and must comply with specific practices and procedures spelled out by the surface managing agency sma8 once lease is obtained the lessee is given exclusive rights to further explore develop and produce on that land drilling permits after lease has been obtained either competitively or noncompetitively an application for permit to drill apd must be approved for each oil and gas well9 as noted in the mineral leasing act section 226 g permit to drill on an oil and gas lease issued under this chapter may be granted without the analysis and approval by the secretary concerned of plan of operations covering proposed surface disturbing activities within the lease area the application form apd form 31603 must include drilling plan surface use plan and evidence of bondsurety coverage the surface use plan should 7 see 43 usc 1702c for the definitions of multipleuse and sustained yield 8 the surface managing agency or private surface owner has jurisdiction over surface activities including surface disturbance surface managing agency may be the us forest service or the state in which the leasing is going to take place private surface owner may be an institution or an individual 9 43 cfr 316231 drilling application and plans crs5 contain information on drillpad location pad construction the method for containment and waste disposal and plans for surface reclamation the apd is posted for review for 30 days within 5 working days after the 30 day period the blm consults with the surface managing agency whose consent is also required then notifies the applicant of the results blm is required to process the application within the 35day period the application may be approved approved with stipulations rejected or delayed for additional analysis or information the applicant is informed when final action is expected despite the 35day review requirement recent study by trade association the independent petroleum association of mountain states ipams found that in its region it took an average of 137 days to approve an apd in 2002 up from an average of 84 days in 200110 delays in the permitting process one of the major reasons for delays in the issuance of drilling permits cited by both blm and ipams is the need to rewrite outdated rmps because the surface disturbance anticipated under approved activities may exceed the limits in the old plan because increased natural gas leasing and development is taking place in these cases oil and gas leases may have been awarded under an old rmp that must be revised before drilling permit can be issued according to the blm there are several such plans currently being revised under flpma section 1712 regarding land use plans the secretary of the interior shall with public involvement and consistent with the terms and conditions of this act develop maintain and when appropriate revise land use plans which provide by tracts or areas for the use of the public lands current planning regulations require preparation of an environmental impact statement eis under the national environmental policy act 43 cfr 160106 after draft eis is issued for public comment an rmp can be approved by the blm state director and published with an eis and record of decision and filed with the environmental protection agency epa in testimony before the house committee on resources ipams asserted that rewriting rmps can take as long as three years when less than decade ago the average time was less than one year the association contends that the usefulness of an rmp is now seven years when in the past they may have been in place for as long as 20 years11 the rapid pace of coalbed methane cbm development in particular has generated new land use concerns that some argue have not been previously incorporated in the rmps environmentalists contend that 20yearold 10 harvesting energy report on natural gas and oil development in the intermountain west ipams february 2003 11 testimony of marc w smith independent petroleum association of mountain states ipams public lands advocacy before the us house committee on resources subcommittee on energy and mineral resources march 7 2001 crs6 plans are not good basis for land management decisions the need for revisedamended rmp would necessarily delay any sitespecific analysis conducted in the drilling permit process by the blm and the surface managing agency thus even when an application for permit to drill apd is in process the blm often waits until the new rmp and eis are complete before proceeding to any sitespecific analysis needed to grant the permit in april 2003 blm announced new strategies to expedite the apd process these include processing and conducting environmental analyses on multiple permit applications with similar characteristics implementing geographic area development planning for an oil or gas field or an area within field establishing standard operating practice agreement that identifies surface and drilling practices by oil and gas operators allowing for block survey of cultural resources promoting consistent procedures and revising relevant blm manuals12 leasing restrictions on oil and gas resources the availability of public lands for oil and gas leasing can be divided into three categories lands open under standard lease terms open to leasing with restrictions and closed to leasing areas are closed to leasing pursuant to land withdrawals or other mechanisms much of this withdrawn land consists of wilderness areas national parks and monuments and other unique and environmentally sensitive areas that are unlikely to ever be reopened to oil and gas leasing13 some lands are closed to leasing pending land use planning or nepa compliance while other areas are closed because of federal land management decisions on endangered species habitat or historical sites some of those restricted areas may be opened by future administrative decisions blm study14 determined that of the approximately 700 million acres of federal subsurface minerals under the agencys jurisdiction in 2000 approximately 165 million acres have been withdrawn from mineral entry leasing and sale subject to valid existing subsurface mineral rights15 lands in the national park system except national recreation areas wilderness preservation system and the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr are among those that are statutorily withdrawn also of the 700 million acres mineral development on another 182 million acres was subject to the approval of the surface management agency and must not be in conflict with land designations and plans according to the blm wildlife refuges 12 doiblm instruction memorandum 2003152 application for permit to drill apd process improvement 1 comprehensive strategies 41403 13 statutory and other types of withdrawals are discussed in greater detail in appendix b 14 public lands onshore federal and indian minerals in lands of the us responsibilities of the blm by sie ling chiang us doi blm december 1 2000 15 when valid existing rights are in place producers are sometimes allowed to continue or begin production on these lands sometimes they are provided compensation either through buyout or land swap by the federal government crs7 except anwr wilderness study areas and roadless areas are examples of lands in this category although many other wildlife refuges also are withdrawn from leasing public lands that are open to leasing may be subject to variety of restrictions imposed by the department of the interior such restrictions include leasing with surface occupancy areas generally offlimits with the exception of directional drilling leasing with timing limitations which protect wildlife during certain times of the year and leasing with controlled surface use which requires mitigation plan for specific areas under the lease industry sources claim some of these lease stipulations are so stringent that they constitute facto closures to oil and gas development however development has proceeded under some of these stipulations energy and mineral industry representatives maintain that federal withdrawals inhibit exploration and limit the reserve base even when conditions are favorable for production the industry argues that substantial amounts of public land have been unnecessarily withdrawn through administrative actions to pursue preservation goals however environmental groups and others generally contend the withdrawals are the most effective protection for the nonmineral values of public lands rocky mountain region the rocky mountain region accounts for 37 of the natural gas and 17 of the crude oil projections of the technically recoverable resource base on public lands in the lower 48 states16 according to the epca study noted below 60 of the undiscovered resource base in the five basins studied in the rocky mountain region is on public lands and about 40 of that amount is not accessible or is subject to lease stipulations and restrictions17 because of increased interest in access to natural gas the protection of public lands and bush administration policies the rocky mountain region has become focal point for us oil and gas policy three recent reports have studied restrictions on natural gas in the rocky mountain region natural gas volume 1 summary report by the national petroleum council npc 1999 energy policy and conservation act amendments epca study 200318 16 us natural gas markets midterm prospects for natural gas supply analysis of federal access restrictions doeeia 2001 17 of the total federal land base used in the epca study 36 is closed and 26 available with restrictions 18 the epca study scientific inventory of onshore federal lands oil and gas resources and reserves and the extent and nature of restrictions or impediments to their development was required by the energy policy and conservation act amendments of 2000 pl 106469 section 604 prepared by the us departments of interior agriculture and energy january 2003 crs8 us natural gas markets midterm prospects for natural gas supply 2001 by the eia while the eia and npc studies include data for total domestic natural gas supplies the epca report more narrowly confines itself to five major geologic basins within the rocky mountain region19 the most direct comparison of data on the rocky mountain region would be between the eia and npc studies because they define the region as essentially the same20 even though the resource base was different in each of the three studies the relative amounts of natural gas on federal lands found to be either closed restricted or open to development was about the same data from the 1999 npc study indicate the natural gas resource base in the rocky mountain region is 335 trillion cubic feet tcf more recent data from eia estimates technically recoverable21 natural gas resources excluding reserves to be 2936 tcf22 the epca study found 1385 tcf in the five major geologic basins in the region although oil and gas reserves are not included in the eia report the relative amounts of natural gas closed and restricted is similar to the amounts found in the other studies for example the npc reports that 9 of the regions natural gas resource base is closed and 32 restricted while the eia data shows that 115 is closed and 37 restricted see table 1 the npc and eia studies report more significant difference between the amount of natural gas open to leasing 60 and 515 respectively also shown in table 1 this difference is probably because larger portion of the proven reserves excluded from the eia report are available for leasing for instance the epca study found that about 26 tcf of proven reserves are on federal lands out of 43 tcf total in the five major geologic basins of this total 63 is open under standard lease terms if the rocky mountain reserves were included in the eia report then the percentage of natural gas open under standard lease terms would likely increase and the percentage of natural gas characterized as under restrictions would likely decline oil resources in the rocky mountains that were examined in the epca study have somewhat less significance relative to us oil supply the study concludes that about 600 million barrels of oil resources about 30 days of total us consumption fall under the access category another 32 billion barrels would be available 19 the five major geologic basins in the interior west are as follows the paradox san juan basins in colorado utah and new mexico uintapiceance basins in colorado and utah the greater green river basin in wyoming colorado and utah the powder river basin in montana and wyoming and the montana thrust belt in montana 20 the rocky mountain region includes the following states arizona colorado idaho montana nevada western new mexico north dakota utah and wyoming 21 these are inplace resources that are producible using current recovery technology but without reference to economic profitability 22 us natural gas markets mid term prospects for natural gas supply eia department of energy 2001 crs9 for leasing of which onethird have restrictions about 25 billion barrels of oil are estimated to be available on nonfederal lands in the basins studied the total oil resource included in the epca study represents about 7 of all technically recoverable oil in the united states as mentioned earlier the numbers in the epca study are based on much more selective area of the rockies that included the five major geologic basins and thus the numbers were smaller however as shown in table 1 the relative rate with access was similar to the other reports 116 the amount of restricted gas was less 26 and the amount of natural gas under standard lease terms was slightly higher 624 both the npc and eia studies conclude that development of natural gas in the restricted land use category would be at minimum likely to face costly delays the eia also concludes that if there were greater flexibility in some of the federal regulations about 29 tcf could become immediately available from this restricted category additionally if certain lease stipulations were removed about 51 tcf would be less costly to develop thus freeing up total of 80 tcf according to the eia report environmental groups argue that there is an ecological basis for most of these restrictions and that environmental assessments or impact statements are incomplete from this perspective to relax these development restrictions would put the environment at greater risk table 1 rocky mountain natural gas resources npc 199923 eia 2001 epca 2003 tcf of tcf of tcf of total total total

624 the npc study estimates that 41 137 tcf of the total amount of gas resources in the rocky mountain region is either closed 29 tcf or restricted 108 tcf thus 335 tcf would be the estimated total amount of natural gas resources in the region as of 1999 23 more recent npc study balancing natural gas policy fueling the demands of growing economy volume 1 september 25 2003 concluded that 69 tcf were effectively offlimits and an additional 56 tcf 125 tcf total were affected by regulatory requirements which could lead to development delays or plan cancellations crs10 significance of access restrictions substantial oil and gas reserves are located on public lands but there are major policy disagreements about the potential importance of those reserves in meeting us energy needs the rocky mountain region represents an estimated 37 293 tcf788 tcf of the unproved technically recoverable natural gas resource base in the united states onshore lower 4824 if the estimated 108 tcf of natural gas in the rocky mountain region currently restricted were produced it could last between 20 30 years assuming production rate of about 4 tcf to 5 tcf per year according to the eia this would meet about 15 of projected annual us demand currently us natural gas demand is being met with supplies from the outer continental shelf ocs 25 imports 15 the rocky mountain region 15 and other onshore 4525 testimony by the wilderness society tws before the house subcommittee on energy and mineral resources march 15 2001 based on the npc report asserted that the united states has sufficient natural gas supply to meet domestic needs for the next 40 years26 this conclusion was based on annual demand growing from 22 tcf in 2001 to 31 tcf in 2015 also based on the npc figure of 1466 trillion cubic feet as technically recoverable resources in the us27 of which 115 tcf is classified as offlimits 39 tcf onshore 76 tcf offshore tws concludes that 1351 tcf of natural gas could be available for development in the future in other words from this perspective ample supply is available now and possibly in the future without disturbing the resources in restricted or noaccess areas the npc report estimated that about 16 of the 1351 tcf cited by tws is subject to restrictions that may prevent development28 the npc argues that 70 tcf of rocky mountain natural gas is under restriction or lease stipulations and otherwise could be brought into production in the near term the npc contends that there are number of impediments that could be resolved to ensure access to this gas in timely fashion and proposes relaxing certain landuse constraints that would allow for more drilling on federal lands in the intermountain west among these constraints include the use of surface occupancydesignations that make resources effectively offlimits use of stipulations to protect environmental resources that it believes are too restrictive and old access restrictions 24 us natural gas markets midterm

and gas resources expected to be producible given current technology without regard to economic viability 28 this is based on 137 tcf restricted in the rocky mountain region and another 76 tcf restricted in the ocs see npc summary report volume i december 1999 pages 1213 crs11 that do not consider new technology that could minimize damage to the environment29 the rand corporation produced an issue paper in 200230 asserting that the debate needs to be more focused on the reserve category of the resource base rands view is that access restrictions should be considered only for the resource category that is most viable or most likely to be produced under this view the amount of the resource considered to be restricted becomes much less however the analysis would be complicated by the rate at which oil and gas resources were assumed to be converted to reserves during the next 1520 years oil and gas resources and production on public lands federal onshore oil and gas

production from federal onshore leases was estimated at 54 of all us oil production see table 232 federal onshore oil production is concentrated in three states which produce 79 of onshore federal oil wyoming 33 new mexico 29 and california 17 oil production from onshore federal leases has fluctuated over the years but has generally been in decline over the past 10 years falling from 1335 million barrels in 1992 to about 100 million barrels in 2002 according to the eia us production of natural gas varied between 1820 tcf annually between the years 19932002 various projections show us natural

coalbed methane gas is natural gas dissolved in water and trapped in coalbed there are several important variables that determine the quantity of methane gas including the depth of coal pressure temperature thickness and composition to extract coalbed methane cbm water must be removed from the coal by pumping which drops the water pressure that traps the gas and allows the gas to flow some operators fracture coal formations and allow water and gas to move out of the coal concerns have arisen concerning groundwater contamination the usgs reports that the water pumped out of coal beds can vary in quality some water can be discharged near the surface for reuse if sufficiently fresh or if the water does not meet reuse standards it can be disposed of by subsurface injection or surface crs16 discharge into wetlands streams or impoundments44 water quality and water disposal have become central concerns in the production of cbm 1980 tax credit section 29 for unconventional fuel production provided major incentive for cbm development significant production of cbm began in 1987 production has increased fourfold since 1991 and coalbed gas accounted for about 8 16 tcf of the 188 tcf of natural gas produced in 2002 in the united states45 in 2002 there were 10000 cbm wells also producing 165 million barrels of water46 per day the leading producers are in new mexico colorado and wyoming production rates vary widely because of the heterogenous geology of coalbeds doe estimates that out of the 39000 new wells anticipated by 2010 23900 will be on federal lands47 cbm reserves are still largely undeveloped of the estimated 700 tcf of coalbed methane in the united states only about 100 tcf are classified as economically recoverable the previously discussed eia study of us oil and gas resources found that of the 293 tcf of unproved technically recoverable unconventional fuels in the rocky mountain region about 46 tcf are coalbed methane of which about 20 would fall under the access category coalbed methane proved reserves were 185 tcf in 2001 which was 10 of us dry gas reserves cbm reserves have more than doubled since 1991 two states colorado and new mexico account

others contend they are not compensated fairly for surface use51 number of concerns has come up regarding surface use agreements between the surface owner and the mineral lessee or mineral owner the central concern for the surface owner is receiving adequate compensation for damages from cbm or production from other extractive industries in wyoming stakeholders such as the petroleum association ranchers and the farm bureau federation established the wyoming splitestate initiative in 2002 they have created new framework to help resolve conflicts between surface owners and mineral owners or lessees52 cbm environmental issues environmental concerns about cbm production focus primarily on land disturbance and water both surface and ground water issues production of cbm can involve not only wells but also access roads power lines compressor stations and waste water impoundments major issues include surface infrastructure the net amount of water removed effects on the water table and the salinity levels and disposal of the water removed which may affect wildlife land and surface water resources the process of hydraulic fracturing53 for cbm production has come under closer scrutiny because of concerns over the possible impact of the injected fluids such as diesel fuel used in the process on underground drinking water draft epa report54 concluded that there is evidence of contamination of drinking water wells from cbm hydraulic fracturing however the epa did express concern over the use of diesel fuel as an injection fluid because it contains many of the epas constituents of concern chemicals thus the epa and the major companies using diesel fuel entered into an memorandum of agreement moa in december 2003 to end the use of diesel fuel as an injecting fluid proposed energy legislation hr 6 and s 2095 include provisions that would prohibit epa from regulating underground injection of fluids for hydraulic fracturing purposes under the safe drinking water act see crs report rs21673 dennis hemmer of the wyoming department of environmental quality explained in an energy newsletter that most water from cbm production does not 51 oversight hearings

for drinking water may become polluted with sodium tainted water cbm production resulted in water discharges of 602 million barrels annually or 165 million barrels per day in 2002 typically into surface waters or holding ponds water is also reinjected underground environmentalists contend that holding ponds are like wastewater treatment ponds that are unlined and leak into groundwater there is concern about the lowering of the water table and the effects on wells and water sources used by wildlife the wildlife management institute of washington dc argues that cbm production and the disposal of high volumes of water may lead to among others things the depletion of underground aquifers the loss of natural vegetation and aquatic life within waterways that receive cbm water further the infrastructure required by cbm production may threaten wildlife habitats56 in response to concerns over the impact of cbm on groundwater quality and quantity blm has required cbm producers to drill two monitoring wells per township with cbm leases since 1992 the cost of drilling each well is about 50000 plus an additional 5000 for monitoring equipment after blm review it was established that one set of wells one shallow and one deep is required per four townships with cbm leases the wells monitor both the water quality and water levels from cbm production on private lands monitoring wells are not required57 the interior board of land appeals ibla invalidated three leases in april 2002 because environmental issues related to cbm production as discussed above were not evaluated sufficiently supplemental environmental assessments ea were prepared for the powder river basin to help determine where to develop cbm in areas already approved for leasing58 generally the results have allowed more cbm drilling to occur however there have been new conditions imposed upon some producers an environmental group the wyoming outdoor council woc sued blm to withdraw additional leases

increased oil and natural gas production from leases on us public lands or areas where the united states holds mineral rights while domestic natural gas production and natural gas imports are expected to rise it is unclear how much of the domestic supply will come from public lands that are currently restricted or offlimits the bush administration has initiated actions to ease restrictions in instances where this can be done administratively how much opposition these initiatives will generate is unclear the media has reported challenges based on alleged violations of blms multipleuse

significantly more wells and highercost deeper wells will be drilled onshore unconventional natural gas over 70 located in the rocky mountain region is forecast to increase its share from 32 in 2002 to 43 of production in the lower 48 by 2025 the central concern for industry is to have greater access to federal lands believed to possess oil and gas potential and to expedite the permitting process environmental groups and some surface owners are concerned that drilling and production would damage sensitive lands wildlife habitat and surface water and groundwater quality and quantity meeting us

yellowstone national park and since that time congress has created other national parks at regular intervals61 the national park system nps was created in 1916 to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life in national parks and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means to leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations 16 usc 162 in the early days of the nps its philosophy was not synchronized with the forest service fs the fs philosophy was that all the resources of the forest reserves are for use and where conflicting interests exist the issue will be resolved based on the greatest good for the greatest number of people in the long run early tension arose between conservationists promoting national parks and utilitarians promoting national forests63 sources of withdrawal authority during the early 1900s the focus of the public lands withdrawal debate was on whether the commanderinchief had authority to make the withdrawal order based on national security withdrawals were defined as an administration actionorder that changed the designation of specific parcel of land from available to unavailable for activities ranging from homesteading to resource exploitation the president acted as chief custodian of the public lands and with tacit approval of congress withdrew public land from entry or location by the private sector the constitution vests authority over public lands in congress rather than with the executive but presidents have repeatedly exercised an inherent power to withdraw or reserve some lands prime example is the establishment of military reservations out of public lands 61 federal public lands and resources law george cameroon coggins et third edition 1992 p 116 62 federal public land and resources law p 116 63 ibid p 117 crs22 withdrawals also occurred under the antiquities act of 1906 16 usca 88 433431 the taylor grazing act of 1934 43 usc 315 et seq the organic act of 1897 16 usca 473 the alaska native claims settlement act of 1971 43 usca 1601 et seq and the wilderness act of 1964 16 usca 113136 national monuments can be created by the executive branch through statutory delegation under the antiquities act the president can reserve the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the protected sites on federal lands that contain historic landmarks prehistoric structures and other objects of scientific interest under the taylor grazing act 140 million acres were withdrawn from homesteading laws the organic act was used to regulate and designate recreation and primitive areas under flpma withdrawals can be made by the executive branch or the congress congressional designations as wilderness were later considered essential by many because an administrative wilderness designation could be revoked administratively any time the alaska native claims settlement act withdrew large areas of alaska from availability for resource use or development pending congressional disposition the wilderness act required that the forest service study 54 million acres of designated primitive areas and report on wilderness suitability wilderness is generally defined as an area off limits to development to avoid destruction of pristine characteristics of nature64 the wilderness act states that federal lands shall be designated as wilderness areas except as provided for in the wilderness act or by an act of congress 16 usc 1131 currently there are four types of withdrawal first there are instances where congress has the sole authority to withdraw or reserve public lands for example creating national parks and wilderness areas and in some cases national wildlife refuges can only be done by an act of congress second the executive branch has used power delegated to it by congress under the previously mentioned antiquities act of 1906 and the pickett act of 1910 third congress may withdraw specific resources such as when oil gas coal and like minerals were removed from the general mining law of 1872 lastly there is the general congressional withdrawal65 which allows lands to be removed from potential development pending final disposition66 withdrawals under flpma modern executive withdrawals are governed by flpma67 flpma68 established federal land use management policy that includes land use planning based on multipleuse approach that allows for significant public and congressional input sections of flpma detail procedures see 43 usc 1714 d for the sales and acquisition of public lands

flpma withdrawals can be made by the executive or the congress the withdrawal can be temporary or permanent flpma replaced the implied authority of the executive branch to withdraw public lands with specifically defined procedures withdrawals of parcels exceeding 5000 acres require congressional approval the land can be withdrawn for 20 years subject to renewal proposed withdrawals must be submitted to congress with report explaining the reasons for the withdrawal in detail effects on the economy and environment alternatives to withdrawal how blm is consulting with other agencies and groups and the geological and mineral potential of the areas proposed the secretary of the interior however can make emergency withdrawals of any size for up to three years report must be available three months following withdrawal flpma mandated review of public land withdrawals in 11 western states to determine whether and for how long existing withdrawals should be continued 43 usc 1714l there were millions of acres withdrawn prior to flpma under the law the secretary of the interior can determine whether and for how long the continuation of existing withdrawals are consistent with statutory objectives of the programs under which lands were dedicated in the first place blm continues to review approximately 70 million withdrawn acres giving priority to about 26 million acres that are expected to be returned by another agency to blm or in the case of blm withdrawals become available for one or more uses as of november 2000 blm had completed reviewing approximately 7 million withdrawn acres mostly blm and bureau of reclamation land the withdrawals on more than 6 million of these acres have been revoked according to the blm manual retention of withdrawal requires compelling show of need and an agency manager recommending that lands not be opened to multiple use particularly mining and mineral leasing that manager must convince the blm director the secretary and watchful segments of the public that there is reasonable alternative to continued withdrawal or classification the review process is continuous over the next several years in part because the withdrawals must be considered in blms planning process and be supported by documentation under the national environmental policy act nepa some lands through revocation and terminations could be developed for oil and gas resources other areas deemed not suitable for mineral development will likely remained closed or restricted for other versions of this document see
