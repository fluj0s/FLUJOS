guided navigation is basically way to discover produc ts by filtering out irrelevant results the application offers menu items also known as fil ters on people places organization and events results are filtered out by choos ing things from the menu items for example looking for information on person with the st name of grigorev go to the person filter section and choose the last name grigorev from the menu list the application removes all the records that dont have match for last name grigorev the application also reconfigures to display additional item s to filter on there may be several people with the last name grigorev but the applicati on will now only show the first names of the grigorevs to filter on as well as only the vents and locations that the grigorevs are associated with when all selected filter s are applied results matching the filtered query appear at the bottom of the application and c an be selected and viewed individually the next sections will step through the process caution on filtering not all data sources support the same information fields t herefore not all data sources can support the same filtering options for example data source may contain record for john smi th with his phone number and address while data source b has john smi ths height weight and hair color if first name john last name smith are selected two rec ords will appear one from data source and one from b however adding hair color brown to the filter list would produce only one record fro m data source b since that is the only data source that supports hair color the record on the same john smith that had his home address and phone number is n ow excluded changing or removing some filter selections may be necess ary to get the desired resultsreturns aliens future
