or describe patently offensive hard core sexual conduct1 the supreme court has created the threepart miller test to determine whether work is obscene the miller test asks whether the average person applying contemporary community standards would find that the work taken as whole appeals to the prurient interest b whether the work depicts or describes in patently offensive way sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law and c whether the work taken as whole lacks serious literary artistic political or scientific value 2 in pope v illinois the supreme court clarified that the first and second prongs of the miller testappeal to prurient interest and patent offensivenessare issues of fact for the jury to determine applying contemporary community standards however as for the third prong the proper inquiry is not whether an ordinary memb er of any given community would find serious literary artistic political or scientific value in allegedly obscene material but whether reasonable person would find such value in the material taken as whole 3 in brockett v spokane arcades the supreme court held that material is not obscene if it provokes only normal healthy sexual desires to be obscene it must appeal to shameful or morbid interest in nudity sex or excretion 4

prohibiting interstate commerce in obscenity 18 usc 1462 1465 to apply to the use of an interactive computer service for that purpose it defined interactive computer service to include service or system that provides access to the internet 47 usc 230e2 these provisions were not affected by the supreme courts decision in reno v aclu declaring unconstitutional two provisions of the cda that would have restricted indecency on the internet 5 in reno the court noted in dictum that the community standards criterion as applied to the internet means that any communication available to nationwide audience will be judged by the standards of the community most likely to be offended by the message 6 this suggested that at least with respect to material on the internet the court might replace the community standards criterion except perhaps in the case of internet services where the defendant makes communication available only to subscribers and can thereby restrict the communities in which he makes posting accessible subsequently however the court held that the use of community 1 miller v california 413 us 15 27 1973 for additional information see crs report 95804 obscenity and

visually depicts sexual conduct by children below specified age8 it is unprotected by the first amendment even when it is not obscene ie child pornography need not meet the miller test to be banned9 the reason that child pornography is unprotected is that it is intrinsically related to the sexual abuse of children indeed there is serious contention that the legislature was unjustified in believing that it is difficult if not impossible to halt the exploitation of children by pursuing only those who produce the photographs and movies10 federal law bans interstate commerce including by computer in child pornography 18 usc 2252 2252a defines child pornography as any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving minor and defines sexually explicit conduct to include not only various sex acts but also the lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person 18 usc 2256 g5g145g146g149g141g561g18g152g155g151g152g144g155g138g153g145g162g497g561g20g142g140g142g151g157g561g6g142g159g142g149g152g153g150g142g151g157g156g561 in 1994 congress amended the child pornography statute to provide that lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person is not limited to nude exhibitions or exhibitions in which the outlines of those areas were discernible through clothing 18 usc 2252 note then in the child pornography prevention act of 1996 cppa congress enacted definition of child pornography that included visual depictions that appear to be of minor even if minor was actually used 18 usc 22568 the statute thus banned visual depictions using adult actors who appear to be minors as well as com puter graphics and drawings or paintings done without any models in ashcroft v free speech coalition the supreme court declared the cppa unconstitutional to the extent that it prohibited pictures th at were not produced with actual minors 11 child pornography to be unprotected by the first amendment must either be obscene or depict actual children engaged in sexual activity including lascivious poses or actual children whose images have been morphed to make it appear that the children are engaged in sexual activity the court observed in ashcroft that statutes that prohibit child pornography that use real children are constitutional because they target the production of the work not the content the cppa by contrast targeted the content not the means of production the governments rationales for the cppa included that pedophiles might use the materials to encourage children to participate in 7 ashcroft v american civil liberties union 535 us 564 2002 8 new york v ferber 458 us 747 764 1982 italics in original for additional

thereby increasing the sexual abuse and exploitation of actual children the court found these rationales inadequate because the government cannot constitutionally premise legislation on the desirability of controlling persons private thoughts and may not prohibit speech because it increases the chance an unlawful act will be committed at some indefinite future time the government also argued that the existence of virtual child pornography can make it harder to prosecute pornographers who do use real minors because as imaging technology improves it becomes more difficult to prove that particular picture was produced using actual children this rationale the court found turns the first amendment upside down the government may not suppress lawful speech as means to suppress unlawful speech in response to ashcroft congress enacted title v of the protect act pl 10821 2003 which prohibits any digital image computer image or computergenerated image that is or is indistinguishable from that of minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct it also prohibits visual depiction of any kind including drawing cartoon sculpture or painting that depicts minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct and is obscene or lacks serious literary artistic political or scientific value12 it also makes it crime to advertise promote present distribute or solicit any material in manner that reflects the belief or that is intended to cause another to believe that the material is child pornography that is obscene or that depicts an actual minor13 the adam walsh child protection and safety act of 2006 pl 109248 amended 18 usc 2257 which requires by producers of material that depicts actual sexually explicit conduct to keep records of every performers name and date of birth it also enacted 18 usc 2257a which requires essentially the same thing with respect to simulated sexual conduct the effective child pornography prosecution act of 2007 pl 110358 title i and the enhancing the effective prosecution of child pornography act of 2007 pl 110358 title ii expanded existing law by among other things making it applicable to intrastate child pornography violations that affect interstate or foreign co mmerce pl 110358 was signed into law on october 8 2008 g11g151g141g142g140g142g151g140g162g497g561g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 the federal communications commission defines indecent material as material that describes or depicts sexual or excretory organs or activities in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast media 14 12 to the extent that the prohibitions described in the two preceding sentences apply to nonobscene child pornography that was produced without the use of an actual child they would apparently be unconstitutional under ashcroft 13 in united states v williams 128 s ct 1830 2008 the supreme c ourt upheld the constitutionality of this prohibition it noted that under the provision an internet user who solicits child pornography from an undercover agent violates the statute even if the officer possesses child pornography likewise person who advertises virtual child pornography as depicting actual children also falls within the reach of the statute id at 1839 the court found that these activities are not constitutionally protected because offers to engage in illegal transactions as opposed to abstract advocacy of illegality are categorically excluded fr om first amendment protection even when the offeror is mistaken about the factual predicate of his offer such as when the child pornography that one offers to buy or sell does not exist or is constitutionally protected id at 1841 1842 1843 14 in the matter of industry guidance on the commissions case law

constitutes obscenity or child pornography except on broadcast radio and television indecent material that is protected by the first amendment may be restricted by the gove rnment only to promote compelling interest and only by the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest15 the supreme court has recognized that there is compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological wellbeing of minors this interest extends to shielding minors from the influence of literature that is not obscene by adult standards 16 there are federal statutes in effect that limit but do not ban indecent material transmitted via telephone broadcast media and cable television17 there are also many state statutes that ban the distribution to minors of material that is harmful to minors material that is harmful to minors under these statutes tends to be defined more narrowly than material that is indecent in that material that is harmful to minors is generally limited to material of sexual nature that has serious value for minors the supreme court has upheld new yorks harmful to minors statute 18

communications decency act of 1996 that would have prohibited indecent communications by telephone fax or email to minors and would have prohibited use of an interactive computer service to display indecent material in manner available to person under 18 years of age 19 this latter prohibition would have banned indecency from public ie nonsubscription websites the cda was succeeded by the child online protection act copa pl 105277 1998 which differs from the cda in two main respects 1 it prohibits communication to minors only of material that is harmful to minors rather than mate rial that is indecent and 2 it applies only to communications for commercial purposes on publicly accessible websites material that is harmful to minors is defined as material that is prurient as determined by community standards b depicts describes or represents in manner patently offensive with respect to minors sexual acts or lewd exhibition of the genitals or postpubescent female breast and c lacks serious literary artistic political or scientific value for minors copa never took effect because in 2007 federal district court found it unconstitutional and issued permanent injunction against its enforcement in 2008 the us court of appeals affirmed finding that copa does not employ the least restrictive alternative to advance the governments compelling interest and is also vague and overbroad

winning an award said this is really really fing brilliant the f cc found the word to be indecent even when used as modifier because given the core meaning of the fword any use of that word or variation in any context inherently has sexual connotation 21 the question arises whether this ruling is consistent with the first amendment in light of the fact that the supreme court has left open the question whether broadcasting an occasional expletive would justify sanction22 in 2006 the fcc took action against four other television broadcasts that contained fleeting expletives but on june 4

station affiliates for broadcasting janet jacksons exposure of her breast for nine sixteenths of second during superbowl halftime show24 the court found that the fcc had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in finding the incident indecent the court did not address the first amendment question
