however the growing frequency of such attacks in the middle east raises the specter that similar attacks could occur in other parts of the world fbi analysts have compiled the following information based on characteristics of suicide bomb attacks in the middle east fbi bulletin 10 religiously motivated terrorist organizations almost exclusively use males as sui cide bombers by contrast politically motivated terrorist organizations have been known to use female bombers as has been seen recently in attacks on israeli targets b generally the only identifiable characteristic when persons carry bombs on their bodies is that they wear coats or large garments in order to conceal the device bombers have also concealed devices in backpacks and shopping bags ritual or symbolic clothing is generally avoided by suicide bombers in an effort to avoid suspicion c suicide bombers are under tremendous mental pressure that often manifests itself by unusual and suspicious behavior such behavior could include but not be limited to excessive perspiration muttering prayer under ones breath or darting ones eyes continuously d at the time of an attack suicide bombers are generally clean shaven with closely cropped hair this helps attackers fit into western surroundings and it also serves as purification ceremony that islamic terrorists undergo prior to conducting their attacks
