government appropriations bill 2005 the bill included provision that directs each agency to acquire chief privacy officer to assume primary responsibility for privacy and data protection policy these officials appeared to be very similar to the privacy officers prescribed in the intelligence reform bill as introduced by senator collins initially however this requirement seemed to apply only to agencies funded by the bill such continued to be the case when the legislation was included in the consolidated appropriations act 2005 hr 481812 within division h section 522 stated each agency shall have chief privacy officer to assume primary responsibility for privacy and data protection policy and specified nine particular activities to be undertaken by such officers the section prescribed privacy and data protection policies and procedures to be established reviews to be undertaken and related reports to be made located in title v of the division the requirements of the section appeared to be applicable only to agencies directly funded by the division furthermore it did not appear that the section created new positions but instead prescribed privacy officer responsibilities to be assigned to an appropriate individual in an existing position13 the president however declined to implement the section14 february 11 2005 memorandum to the heads of the executive departments

that they had not exercised adequate independence when they accepted extensive redlining by administration officials of the boards first report to congress18 efforts to refine the mandate and mission
