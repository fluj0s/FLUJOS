the gpm lecture given on 28 march 1963 how are you today this is the 28th of march ad 13 i dont have any messages here saying any of you people have gone clear or anything like that here today i guess you must be all slowing down huh well its getting towards the end of the week springs here thats itspring youre suffering from spring fever we have new arrangement here today weve got ai got board here i can draw you some pictures on and its about time because if you cant get it verbally you can always get it through pictures huh 1 all right now lets see want to talk to you today about the gpmthe gpm the composition of the gpmthe gpmsand the composition of any single gpm actually marvelously enough can be found in dianetics the modern science of mental health in the description of how an engram is formed and were right back to basics every time weve had anything that was true and anything that was very useful and usable to us it is traced back oddly enough to the dynamic principle of existence is to survive that is the primary takeoff point to survive and of course the oddity of that problem is how can thetan be so fixated on the effort to survive when actually he cant do anything else and that is his basic problem his basic problem is he cant do anything else and therefore he works at it truthfully some thetan worries about will he get through or will he make it he worries about that in processing well ive been wrapped around few telegraph poles myself in processing pioneering the way as you very often are pioneers fall into ice crevasses and that sort of thing ive had my share of ice crevasses but the basic problem here is that you havent got any other place to go thats something for you to remember thats something to keep in mind some pc says i dont know whether i should be processed or not haha hahaha huh thats silly thats silly thing whether i should be processed or not well you see he in actual fact hasnt got any choice in the matter hes definitely in trouble he may tell you he isnt but he is and hes trying very hard to survive there one time after i wrote the first book i thought there was dichotomy here and i thought that it was succumb was the opposite to survive and it isnt there isnt any the trap of this universe is you cant quit now weve hadweve had student who arrived over here and he isnt student really and hes been playing footsies with the idea that maybe he shouldnt go on course he thinks maybe he ought to quit did you ever try to quit let tell you something you cant its not possible to quit youll always rise up again and try again because there isnt anything else you can do now if you digest that basic datum how can man quityou go back on the track and what do you find you find hes still trying to fight the battle of antietam or something hes still trying to fight this battle he has not been able to quit you go back hundred thousand years and hes still trying to play the game of knighthood was in flower only right now hes still trying to play this game he wants to be gentleman or he wants to treat the ladies nicely or something of that sort whats this impulse stem from hes still trying well this games been over for ages in fact the first game of this nature i know is about hundred trillion years ago and theres another sort of knighthoodinflower game earlier on the track than that even and he hasnt ever quit oh become degraded become miserable become bogged down but he never quit he cant even though he says well i quit well thats it well lets take businessman and the government officials are all over the shop and all day and all night every day and so forth and the tax people and the licensing board and the food surveyors and the this and thatas and hes always mixed up in some way or another and he just cant get the help to go on and after while why he says well the hell with it ill quit hahahahaha let him try let him try you know you always can pick up such person few months later and you can ask him whether or not they should have quit well you see theyve had to work twice as hard because all the papers that had to be filed have now got to be refiled and so forth and bankruptcy or something like this is the most overworked activity you can possibly engage in people come around and they say well how about this tin of sardines that you didnt sign receipt for in 1952 he says 1952 tin of sardines were we even in the sardine business back then oh well yes yes yes yes yes well youll have to figure that out and so forth he cant quit you take box fighter he has been in there shifting around in the ring and hes gotten himself well up toward the championship and so on and then one fine day why he loses fight so he says ill quit ill quit only he hasnt got any finance with which to quit and here he is fooling around trying to quit and he has few minor fights so he can have enough money to quit you know and he has few other fights so that he can have enough money to quit eventually here he is sparring partner you see for five dollars to go three minutes or something like that and he hasnt been able to quit there and eventually there he is walking around in the street with the birds going tweet tweet tweet on every side of him still trying to quit the fight game these fellows who quit the war are all very interesting to they quit the war they stopped fighting the war they stopped and by god theyre still in the war every place thetan has ever been he is still trying to be or trying not to be but as far as an absolute succumb this he cannot obtain and his basic problem on the track is that he cant quit i say that very advisedly he is not permitted to quit i remember one time pulling gag on the stellar organization theres an organization they used to have you know they used to have ships on the sea before they had missiles you probably wouldnt remember that its long time ago and they had these ships and they went around and shot at each other that sort of thing interesting game and i finally worked out how to be left alone i decided i was tired and day after day why i just laid down on the job i was on base and i didnt care anything about it and so forth andwhy i really got reamed out i was supposed to be in there every morning and read that bulletin board and that sort of thing i found out about as close as you can come to quitting and i said this commanderi mean he had gold lace and all sorts of thingsand he says to he says youre supposed to be here every morning youre supposed to read that bulletin board youre supposed to go out here and muster ohoh ahrruoww you know rocks and shoals perils of the sea and i looked at him and i said oh commander its been long war oh he says you cant talk like that you cant talk like that oh come on now well we can find an easy billet for you and so forth and be good boy and so forth and you cant just quit you know and god after that why anything i wanted on the base they let have because they thought i was about to quit so all life actually conspires to keep people in there pitching now thetan exteriorizes out of some mangled body that has unfortunately got in the road of some scientific achievement and he gets out of the skull and he looks around and he says ive quit well he may have quit but what are you and i doing as auditors finding this guy still exteriorizing and still trying to quit i dont care whetherif it was hundred trillion years ago or otherwise we find the engram of him doing that isnt that interesting now engramsengrams are there to provide methods of survival methods of survival theres long discussion of this in dianetics the modern science of mental health hes long since found out that he cant quit so he adapts methods of survival and these methods of survival are quite interesting he learns lessons which he instantaneously applies the one thing he finds out is that life permits him time to confront if he were given unlimited time to confront he could then work out any situation he is likely to encounter do you see that you know that with reality if you just had time to confront everything in your environment you would then be able to get yourself enough familiarity with it in order to handle it well the one thing which this universe and life omits in the platter of goodies they give youthe one thing they omitis enough time to confront thats the main thingenough time to confront thats the whole crux of the situation lacking enough time to confront you have to develop instantaneous reaction gradually the individual becomes convinced that he longer has tune to confront so therefore he builds house which will instantaneously react on given stimuli heres the way this works fish swims into an area which has yellow sand floor and gets bitten so he just solves the whole problem of being bittenhe hopes since he cant solve the problem he didnt have an opportunity to confront it and he just never seems to get around to having enough time to confront being bittenthat every time he gets over yellow sand floor he goes away that is his solution to the problem yellow sand floors are dangerous so you dont stay around them you leave so he has this engram and he keeps this engram up so that if he doesnt leave over yellow sand floor if he doesnt leave he experiences the pain of being bitten so when he experiences this pain he is reminded that he had better leave so he gets out of there you see that mechanism thats an engramic mechanism then he develops crazy jerryrigbuilt house whereby when he sees certain stimuli he then replies with certain response and youve got stimulusresponse mechanism which is built in in the form of engrams father speaks loudly drop food on floor well its good answer it sure shut the old man up he stopped talking about that didnt he huh so theres whole little series of pictures here that go along with this and they operate as stimulusresponse basis its all survival mechanism it may not look that way but it is remember all the data of the service facsimile the service facsimile was one the fellow used to get out of trouble this is how he operated well it was very useful very useful by observing certain stimuli he recognizes danger may be present lacking the time to adequately confront that danger he is now placed in situation by the engram of reacting in some way or feeling the pain of former accidents in other words he sees the stimuli and he gets the response and he either executes the response or he forces himself instantaneously to execute the response by inflicting upon himself painpain unconsciousness something like this theres alwaysthese things are infinite in the number of ways they can be worked out this is all discussed in dianetics the modern science of mental health well now whats this got to do with the gpms or gpm well were dealing with the engram on very easily recognized and recognizable level but the engram is hardly lock on to an item in the gpm every single item in gpm is to some degree active and the ris are compulsively active and they all have the same purpose when confronted by certain situation the thing to do in order to survive is the terminal ri when confronted by the oppterm ri one then assumes the terminal ri this is survival one knows what to do when confronted with too many loud voices one becomesor when confronted by hostile audience one becomes cabaret singer thats the dictates of the ris well what about this goal well thetan was going along minding his own business and he finally found out he couldnt trust himself that is always the common denominator of the formulation of any pattern such as gpm an engram or anything else the lesson he learns is that he cannot trust himself he did not have enough time to confront so therefore he could not properly react thats elementary he found out that his efforts in some direction became nullified through an incompetence in himself well now its slightly more gruesome than this thats his first determination before he enters these things but before he enters that theres slightly earlier one and that is he gets the idea of possession and protection this is compounded later by using things to create an effect with but early on he is simply trying to protect what he has and he protects what he has and eventually he has areas as thetan you know like king of the wood talked about in frazers golden bough so on he plays this game of king of the wood and hes protecting the wood dont you see and somebody comes along and decides to cut down the wood and he protects the wood hes playing game there of havingness and havingness is an integral portion of this and then he finds out he cant trust himself to protect the woods so he fixes up an automatic mechanism when confronted with an axman he becomes storm something like that oppterm axman terminal storm all right thats solution to the situation and hell put it into effect he knows that he wont have enough time to confront the situation and analyze it hes lost trust in himself as an analytical mechanism he has made mistakes is what he has done so then he longer can quite be himself in other words he can only continue to be himself as long as he had reliance upon his own judgment and upon his ability to protect things which he considered his those are the mechanisms on which he is operating and when he finds out that he cannot trust himself he has made mistake he then as being himself thetan tends to degrade and tends to become some other thing and these then are repeated over and over withthat is to say his disasters are repeated over and over with consecutive removals here you have the individual himself right here now here he is and as himself he is being perfectly happy here hesso ongot nice halo and so on hes just happy thetan and hes not bothering anybody particularly so on somebody comes along and they say to him that halo looks silly and he says well its worn by all the very best saints and so forth and they say its still silly and he says well he says imimgot perfect right i have perfect right to wear this halo and he gets mixed up in glare fight of some kind or another and so on and instead of being himself here totally capable of having halo or not halo he becomes fixedlyhe becomes fixedly an identity thetan with halo confronted by critic so critic here appears critic when confronted by critic he becomes thetan with halo now hes had some wins this way dont you see hes had some wins this way he finally manages to spread the word around that thetans with halos are actuallyare actually the chosen of the big thetan and the critics are actually daring the wrath of the big thetan if they criticize thetans with halos hes had to then adapt secondary thing over here which is an imagined force or an imagined power but hes now an identity thats an item hes longer actually feels safe as just himself see hes protecting the havingness of the halo and he is quote thetan with halo unquote well thatd be some kind of way backtrack sort of glare fight area thing and we wouldnt have any gpms yet but he finds out through many encounters of this character he finds out that eventually that he had better have purpose in life and that is about the first identity that he assumes that he never really gets rid of and the common denominator of all thetans who have ceased to trust themselves is thetan with purpose it is easier to survive with purpose he thinks and hes got this all worked out but hes always thetan with purpose therefore he never becomes himself he never becomes himself hes always thetan with purpose what is this purpose well its any postulated action which he feels will get him out of the trouble hes been in that is his purpose and one of these purposes is characterized just that way its postulated purpose which will get him out of the trouble which he has been in now i covered that briefly i said here he was and one day he mocked up halo and somebody somebody criticized it and so forth well eventually eventually he will have goal to be godly hes now thetan not only with halo but hell have purpose of course this is way back later on he gets this idea of having purpose and hed better have purpose or else thats the thing to have purpose or else so he saysabout the time he adopts god herehe says to be holy or to be holy person or something of that sort well to be holy this is perfectly all right theres nothing wrong with this but in the process of to be holy he starts out as thetan with purpose there he is hes thetan with purpose all right thats fine now whats his next action is to assert the purpose hes doing this all for survival dont you see hes already learned the lesson that he cant trust himself hes already learned the lesson that he had better protect things and hes already learned the lesson that the real way to survive is to have purpose so here he is thetan with purpose now lets take our next progressive action here and he isnt thetan who has purpose hes thetan who is purpose now this we just have as the stated purpose thisll just be the purpose here to be holy but this by the way will be an alldominating thing and hell call this the goal to be holy now this becomes the thing you see thats becoming moremore important than he is and now lets take it one more stageone more stage here and weve got purpose and then we also have him as somebody somebody with the goal to be holy or somebody who wanted to be holy something like this and we get the first three stages of evolution of goal first its just the goal you see it all by itself its just the stated postulate and then the postulate gets little more massy and becomes the goal to and then gets little more massy somebody with the goal to you see and that succeeds in every case there is variation from this now he goes further than that and as he goes up the line here he eventually finds himself in very fine state of affairs lets take it the way you find it heres purpose and over here some kind of provocation and here is the goal stated as the goalpurpose you know the goal to that has some kind of an opposition and then over here here is somebody with the goal to and more opposition and then so on and then so on and then here he is his terminal lines dont you see well lot of these thingsbut when we look this over we find out that he is down here hes down here and thats just the stated purpose and then it becomes the goal to and then somebody with the goal to and now look if this is holy this will be holy person see the purpose is now getting more and more massive dont you see its interiorizing more and more in other words the more he conflicts with these things over herethese opposition terminals which are the difficulties he finds in lifethe more he conflicts with these things why the more massive he himself becomes and then of course conflicts with something else and then the more massive he becomes and then he conflicts with something else and the more massive he becomes he conflicts with something else dont you see and then to assert that he becomes more massive like this and there he goes you see rather fascinating the way this thing winds itself up along the line in other words hes asserting this same thing based on the fact that he cant trust himself based on the fact that he wants to protect or defend something or to survive in general and based also on the fact that he cant quit now he gets up the line here andwell holy person you see and now hes liable to go into some postulate character like this hes being holy you see he cant quite be holy person but hes being holy well thats fine thats fine now whats our whats our evolution up here at the top as we get into the top of this thing here he is being holy and what hes confronting here what hes confronting you see is critics was the first one you see and then critical people was the next one and when we get up here why wed say sneering overwhelming people and then over here see this is being holyin sequence to the other one that we just hadthis is being holy and over here are critical church people oooh whats this well his purpose is beginning to cross over here dont you see ishes getting crossover purpose so hesnow hes got critical church people you see waah whats this golly hes now fighting critical church people so what you resist you tend to become and he gets up here and hes got here new identity which is crusader well thats not quite holy man you know thats somebody who fights and over hereover here hes got religious bishops who excommunicate or excommunicators or something of the sort and now as we go on up he finally gets to these top terminals and here you have him being critical thetan thats critical thetan see and then over here what do we find we find holy people you see the evolution of what he did there see and here we have critical thetan now what have we got what are we looking at were looking at the bottomtothetop proposition were looking at situation here where the individual is being called on to defend mass he postulates himself new identities in order to do this he cant trust himself so he has to postulate these new identities to keep it going and of course he starts in critics and he gradually mingles his identity until the whole thing crosses over and changes over well what do you know this is still survival situation just as the bottom of the thing was survival situation how did you handle critic that was his problem and he solved it by becoming holy person and he winds up here fighting holy people now there is the course of existence as far as hes concerned to some degree he becomes these too dont you see so hes less and less his goal and more and more the enemy becomes his goal now you ask in running off goals you say m rightheres oppterms what would be the goal of holy people see and hed say to be holy bang and youd get the thetans goal you ask what would be the goal of critical thetan hed say to be critical and it wont check out because thats actually the goal of the oppterm throughout now this is very interesting these things contain i havent drawn the complete number of items which are actually to be found in one of these gpms whatever it is twenty thirty forty and it all takeshow long it takes them to graduate you see and here he goes right up to the top now when he gets here hes got new problem hes got new problem he longer considers this survival activity this he doesnt like its violation of his own purposes so he has to do something new and this becomes extremely important to him heres the bottom of one of these heres the same two that you just saw heres holy people right here and heres critical thetan this game is worn out this game is worn out the old game you see thats gone thats gone hes not got anything more to do with this how do you get out of spot like that how do you get out of spot of being critical thetan well you do it by postulatingyou go into sort of blank area and you say im completely lost now i havent got goal its all gone get into this blank areayouve still got however over here holy people how do you handle these dogs not as critical thetan thats all unsuccessful and he feels pretty degraded hes got to postulate new goal new goal has got to be postulated here which handles these holy people how are you going to postulate this goal well you just up and postulate it but you see postulating and insisting upon is quite interesting you dont just sit offyouve gotprobably got an idea of thetan sitting off in space in the blackness of space saying oh i think i will postulate goal yes to be good boy yes thats what ill do all right now thats postulated man that isnt the way that goal is postulated that goal is postulated something on this order see he says its gone i just feel like the devil you know and everythings gone to pieces here and these confounded holy people god what are you going to do about them theres only one thing that would work im sure only one thing that would work only one thing that would work haarrrrrrrr to be devil hahahahaha that would work yes yes yes i think i think ill try it out tentatively well how are you today father you probably dont recognize im devil oh holy people say eeek god almighty oh he says thats terrific he says thatll handle them so he says to be devil all right thatll handle it to be devil to be devil to be devil to be devil im going to be devil devil im going to be devil now you got that now you hear now you know listen im going to be devil devil devil rrrrrrr im going to be devil ive got to concentrate on that you see to be devil thats the thing to be brrrrr finally finally thats pretty good you know thats pretty good and it handles this there it handled it and he finds hes now the enemy of good people hes got new enemy he handled these holy people but now all the 49 good people in the community turn on him as man and they say oh oh hes devil hohoho and he recognizes these are good people so he begins to detest good people so he dramatizes this one and of course he has to become the goal to be devil and he runs into selfrighteous people and then of course he has to be much moremore mass involved in the thing and hes got to say i am somebody who is somebody with the goal to be devil thats who i am im somebody with goal to be devil who else i am thatthats somebody with the goal to be devil i mustnt forget that and of course runs square into inquisitors and there we go again and what does he finally wind up at the top of the next bank just amputating this winds up at the top of the next bank devilish peoplea good thetan you see how this goes its his effort to survive you dont even have to mild it up to the point of saying the effort to have game you understand it is frankly very correct that at the bottom of this bank it is violent effort to survive hes finished hes absolutely finished at this point hes critical thetan he hates himself he is faced by holy people he cant stand that its an intolerable pair so he postulates himself brandnew goal now how come thetans do this how come they do this time after time after time with such great regularity how do they do this why do they always do the same thing well they are faced with exactly the same problems the problems are identical you have the problems of this universe you have the problems of formulation of mest and mass matter energy space and time you have the thetans effort to cope with this situation you have common denominator that he actually cant quit you have common denominator that he will wind up not being able to trust himself you have the common denominator that he inevitably will try to protect some of this mest and as result he winds up with the identical solutions and it actually rattles off on whole set of axioms these axioms are unwritten at the moment but they are whole set of axioms like the mest universe axioms and they consist of nowimsupposedtos or laws and he actually forms his gpm by law and that law is all agreed upon andat any time that its this and that actually they are very simple laws and they are based on the very elements which i gave you earlier in the lecture now thats how that gpm parades to some degree you see each time he becomes holy people to some degree he becomes here good people to some degree he becomes in each case the opposition terminal so when hes finally throughwhen hes finally through this mess and mass and potpourri we have you and actually have and when we start going on the backtrack what do we run into we run into the top of the bank or we should and we find the thetan in his most degraded form opposing an exalted opposition terminal and then by opposition we go on down through and we finally come down to the bottom and in every case you find somebody with the goal to be devil someyoull find somebody with the goal to be devil or somebody who wanted to be devil youll find in every case an item down here which will be the goal to be devil in every case you will find right here to be devil thats inevitable over here you get variation this is variety at the bottom of the bank you say well listing these things out if the pc knew they were there he could simply put them on the list yes pcs who know they are there put them on the list but the trick is just thisif youre not overlisting madlythe one that belongs in the position will fire let us say at this position of the bank weve got an item here devilish fellow see this is this item here thats devilish fellow all right and the pc says well lets get down to the bottom of this thing and get the show on the road and lets put to be devil on the list see well hell also of course list devilish fellow and hell list two or three other things and hell also list to be devil and it wont fire whatll fire on your short list is devilish fellow all right very well and good our next action in here when we come down the pc says well i i i know what this would be i know what this would be this is obviously somebody or something who wanted to be devil thats obviously that so he puts that and two or three other things on the list and if he at that same time put on the goal to be devil and to be devil on the same list only the one in sequence will fire youre saved from this embarrassment we dont care how hewell he knows the bottom of the bank in fact id prefer him to know that there are three down there at the bottom of the bank when he puts them on the list if hes way up here somewhere devilish fellow they just dont fire you say well thats the goal of course that will fire the goal wont fire as an ri when expressed as an ri withif its not in proper sequence in other words it will come out by 3m correctly unless you are overlisting but thats what occurs on the bottom of bank and theres border between these two banks like that and you actually go over the border of the banks well itstheyre two different gpms they exist as great big black masses in their own right which is compounded squeeze together of all of these items ive been talking about in other words one goal one black mass well what happenswhat happens if you have four or five goals all jammed together they still come apartone goal one black mass one item one black mass oneinside the goal but part of the black mass in other words every gpm is black mass and the gpms if theyre apart or separate or stuck together or anything else constitute what looks at first glance like mass but as the pc begins to run them his perception picks up he begins to recognize one mass from another mass quite interesting well why are they so burned down why are they so black well its just that hes exhausted all the energy out of them thats all youll find hell still dramatize these things they are apparently moving on forward into present time and always under formation hes always in some stage or another of the gpm in its formation hes always forming the top of it but he also very often dramatizes that which has gone yesterday you see he couldnt quit so hes just as likely to use this goal of his to be holy in some given circumstance well he goes into church and all of sudden hes restimulated he feels kind of weird and kind of sick but hes restimulated he goes into this church and at first hewell lets say he starts to church as career and oh he gets along all right he goes to church for little while he goes lota lot of sundays year or two or something like that and one day he starts to feel kind of sick he gets into the sits down in the pew and he starts to feel kind of sick and he looks around and suddenly he realizes that that priest is pretty critical pretty critical of him or maybe the priest did say critical thing and hes all set you see and the next thing you know why he gets this horrible feeling that he had better do something devilish inexplicable all of sudden he does something devilish in other words he just picked up an old area in an old gpmwas restimulated momentarilyhe lived through it did its responses and so forth why because its the nowimsupposedto hes got whole system of nowimsupposedtos and these nowimsupposedtos routinely will give him the right answers and the right responses for any given condition instantaneously without further inspection on his part he just knows what to do man and then he will survive the only trouble is these things have never been very survival and formulated to match the times of charlemagne they dont go very well in the days of khrushchev they dont match anymore i know what im supposed to doa swordsman haha golly aint nobody wielded sword for long time he feels sort of out of place he feels upset he is faced with something and it says to him that he must be swordsman but thhuh he cant make it he goes and reads books about sword collections thats about as close as he can come to it the more he reads the more hes got to read the more he reads the sicker he gets but hes still got to read these books about sword collections but hes in an interplay here of the universe around him and these things still have survival answers this girl is faced by loud man and she knows what to be she knows what to be cabaret singer and she goes ahead and tries to be cabaret singer and fails at it most gorgeously whereas the girl could probably be an opera singer with difficulty at all the onesee opera singer that isntwasnt going to be very upsetting but cabaret singer ohhohoho thats the thing shes got to be and cant make youll find people all the time trying to do things that they cant do whereas they can do something superior to them superiorly and wont do it thats one of the puzzles of human behavior well those puzzles of human behavior are contained in this you can explain these things by engrams for the excellent reason that that which sticks and has command value in an engram is actually one of these gpm items underneath the engram kicking in and when you ran the engram you actually ran it off the top of the gpm item and it didnt trouble the pc old repeater technique or something like that will as likely as not as often as not key the thing out and free it this is why processes have worked where they have worked and also why they havent worked where they havent worked because these items here the fellow has lived hes lived those things with ferocity those goals havent just been well i now think i will put goal in to be devil yes i think i will postulate that all right to be devil thats postulated ah god man he worked at the postulation of this goal day in and day out week in and week out year in and year out and he just got it so it would stick never never again is he going to be caught in any such situation as into be holy never never to be devil thats the thing to be to be devil now you hear now you hear now now listento be devil and so on this is toin other words he trains himself into the thing and then of course he inevitably gets its enemies and then he partakes of those enemies and then he partakes of those and those and those and finally this thing betrays him and he can longer have that goal or basic purpose thetan has basic purposea thetan has basic purpose when thetan can longer trust himself after trying to protect something in the physical universe that gives him system of goals and out of that system of goals you give him the piled up system of items which you get in gpm when gpm fails to survive anymorei mean to serve anymore as survival mechanismwhen the gpm fails our next immediate action after that is to create new goal and to go the limit on it as long as it is useful and is when that one wears out and one is longer able to see anything in it but totally degraded form to achieve the nextto postulate the next goal to solve the gpm thats just past so we just have nothing but solution to solution to solution to solution to solution in other words the cures become the illness now we go back and look over this situation and we find out that the reason this fellow cant stand this universe cant stand closed places cant stand anything in dress cant stand this and cant stand that and yet cant stay away from them is because of this goal to be holy and the reason he cant do that of course is because hes got goal to be devil im sorry if anybody has these actual goals im sure they will be found im not using synthetic goals in this lecture but theres the whole mechanism theres the whole mechanism of the gpm theres why it exists theres how it evolves and so on it is far simpler than you would believe now when you realizei said why they were blackwhen you realize that this item here the goal to be devil may very well consist of lifetimes each lifetime having full array of pictures and that that has all been burned down and charred to nothing but cinder by the hammer and pound of existence youll see why its black lump and youll see why the gpm is black lump actually the gpm is lump of burned up residue but its postulates are still there the charge is still in it and it still separates and it still squares away now as you recognize an individual has gone through great many very weird and terrible adventures on the course of postulating goal and becoming the various items in the gin gpm and you recognize also that he has been through gpm after gpm after gpm in order to get where he is today and so on and hes got lot of overts and hes got lot of difficulties on the backtrack and hes having lot of difficulties in present timethat it is not easy it is not easy to find the goal to find the top item to go back on exactly the right number of items and to walk all the way through the gpm to never skip to never jump out into another gpm to get down to the bottom of the gpm and list it out and find your next goal and so forth none of this none of this could be considered to be easy it isnt easy but oddly enough these gpms are so much carbon copy one to the next from pc to pc they only vary in the significance of the goal and the significance of the items they dont vary in the pattern of the goal youll find the persons goal there and youll find the the item the goal to be devil or the goal to catch catfish or the goal to be tiger somebody or something who wanted to be tigeryoull find that there youll find out up here tigerish person or devil or something like that and we go up the line and we get up to the top of the thing we inevitably find in this column of terminals we find saint something like that saintly person something its totally reversed from the situation we find out that the similarity of items in this gpm here well lets say we have an item people who care for nothing nothings pile up more than anything else we have people who care for nothing as an oppterm here and down in the goal to be good people who give up nothing or something and those two items are liable to collapse one on the other and because theyre liable to collapse one on the other the gpms bang in other words very similar items sometimes group and youll be auditing along minding your own business and all of sudden the pc will go whop or whoop or urp and so on and hell have felt couple of gpms smashed together youll have excitedthrough some wrong listing or something of the sortyoull have excited similar item in another gpm and have collapsed it on well all this is avoidedthe randomity is avoidedby being particularly careful to get the items that belong in sequence in sequence and that is normally done by not overlisting on an ri opposed list and not underlisting on source list theres nothing much to it you can even find on the last rthe goal as an ri oppose is source list and you can even find the next goal on that if that last source list from here down into this bank is completed theres all kinds of mechanical arrangements here and we havent even really begun to exhaust the number of possibilities that you could do to get gpm it very possibly is not necessary to do goal oppose terminal to get this top gpm up here you just say all right tell an item who or what would be the least likely to have the goal to be devil and the guy says saintly person it rrs and you put it in as beginning terminal line i mean these thingsthese possibilities are great but they areare mostly assistive in recovery if you do the goal right in the first place you dont run into these things and then theres the admonition that in actual fact you should make clear before you try to make an ot youll find auditors will go on at fantastic rate of speed gpm after gpm after gpm and they never clean up the gpm theyre in and they never look for these various items they dont try to get the pc they dontthey find something still ticking so they just list it further they dont go back and patch it up they dont try to find any of these bypassed items they dont try to get these bottom items in the goal line they dont try to neat this thing up before they go along as result youve got three or four or five gpms alive and they frankly are maybe not as easy to patch up as it would have been if you had just patched up one and done it right in the first place you havent lost any time you can patch these things up you can take care of them the way to take care of them best however is to know the anatomy of the gpm to know what you expect to find in the pc not go on expecting that every pc is different that every pc is going to have different pattern that all of these things are going to be so difficult and so on well i saw gpm just today which well i wont try to quote the items out of it but its something like this the goal to be lady and the first oppterm steam locomotive and the first terminal astronomy well come out of it i mean how does this relate the auditor has banged off into three different gpms hes got goal for something but he hasnt got any terminals for anything in other words hes very dispersed on the thing if you know you get experience as to what these are all about and you know what the thing should look like and you know whether youre right or not and you know how this thing should add up youll all of sudden become aware of the fact that youve skipped somethingboth by the pcs arc break and behavior and so forth and because you cant go on and for other reasons but also because you just know your stuff on the anatomy of gpm the easiest way to run gpm is know what youre running ive given you the picture of the gpm its basis modus operandi and repetitive characteristics of the gpm if you know these things quite well you wont have too much trouble clearing anybody how many gpas are there i dont know youve sure been around long enough i can hear you now on marcab and on this place and in that age and that age all right so thats failed so i can longer be holy person and so forth im going to be devil yes to be devil now listen carefully to be you know youve been doing it for long time i dont know how many gpms youll cook up in somebody id say the more complicated the gpm first found sounds as goal the more gpms there are in the bank i think youll find out thats working rule if the first onethe first goal you find of person is to be somebody who plays pipe on various clouds and looks sad i think youve got an awful lot of gpms in the bank theres the other factor the first gpm you encounter is sometimes truncated there so you just have new thetan he looks like his behavior will be very brash next one will be truncated up here someplace and hell be conservative hell be backing up the conservative and up here someplace it just happens to be where you find him in that gpm and you get him up here at the top ranks of the thing he will inevitably be beatnik its funny how coincidentally we have so many people who are just winding up their banks in this present society at this particular time but remember we also have the new ones so that we have somebody cycling down the track at some time well have the fellow being great success well hes in this part of the bank the lower part hell be rather conservative mediocre hes in this part of the bank and well have somebody very degraded hell be in this part of the bank actually his current conduct depends to large extent on where he sits in his first gpm all right well thats all the data i had for you on the subject i hope itll do you lot of good i know its been very difficult to dig the stuff up and get it hinged together and make sense and get processes that make it work but were at this point and the information is there and it is stable and its yours thank you very much thank you good night 1 editors note the diagrams mentioned by ron in this lecture can be
