survey from which it derives estimates of the distribution of household income the census bure aus official measure of income is based on the concept of money income and includes earnings social security interest dividends and other forms of social insurance it excludes the value of nonmoney benefits such as food stamps and housing subsidies it does not include capital gains and it is pretax income1 table 1 shows the distribution of income in 2007 by quintile using this official measure of household income each quintile represents 20 of the total number of households in 2007 there were 116783000 households so each quintile represents 23356600 households the top 5 the top 5835150 households are also shown independently because they alone account for significant share of household income the census bureau publishes these estimates by quintile to provide concise snapshot of the overall distribution of income it should be noted that there is official definition of middle class but one approach that has been used is to group together the three middle quintiles in 2007 that included those households with incomes between 20291 and 100000 the concept of middle class however remains entirely subjective2 t able 1 distribution of household income 2007 quintiles lowest second third fourth highest top 5 share of hous eholds 20 20 20 20 20 5 range of income class less than 202

income table 3 presents the distributions by quintile for these alternative definitions of income the first row money income shows the income shares using the same definition of income as that shown in table 1 market income includes money income except for government cash transfers capital gains and losses and an imputed return on home equity it also subtracts an estimate of workrelated expenses3 postsocial insurance income includes money income except government meanstested transfers capital gains and losses and estimated return on home equity and it subtracts workrelated expenses the difference between market income and postsocial insurance income is that the latte r excludes meanstested government transfers disposable income includes money income the value of noncash transfers such as food stamps and subsidized housing capital gains and losses and estimated return on home equity it subtracts 3 work related expenses includes items such as child care union dues permit and
