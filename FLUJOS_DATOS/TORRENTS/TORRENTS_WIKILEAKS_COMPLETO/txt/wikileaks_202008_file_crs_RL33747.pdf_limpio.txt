once were discrete areas of emergency response are increasingly sharing common technologies first responders and other emergency workers not only have access to better tools but also by adopting new technologies find themselves confronted with the need to rethink their internal organizational structure and the ways that they communicate with external groups most emergency communications in use today have been built on core technologies such as twoway radio for emergency responders telephone line switches for 911 calls and broadcastin g for emergency alerts operated independently of each other these th ree pillars of emergency response have developed along separa technology tracks advances in information technology and particularly the ubiquity of the in ternet have laid the groundwork for connecting the functions of communica tions for emergency responders 911 call centers and public alerts for example digital broadcasting used for emergency alerts can also be used to deliver info rmation to emergency responders the use of internet protocols ip provides st andard for networ k interconnectivity interoperable radio networks used by fi rst responders can open channel for real time participation by operators in 911 call centers these same call centers can be used to generate local alerts over all type s of communications media to virtually any enabled device1

described in several sections of the 911 commission report final report of the national commi ssion on terrorist attacks upon the united states the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states washington gpo 2004federal policy and congressi onal action tend to treat these three important areas of emergency communications through different agencies and different committees some observers cite crossagency coor dination at the fede ral level and cross jurisdiction cooperation at the congressional level as areas where rapprochement could facilitate homeland secu rity because the prepondera nce of incidents involving emergency workers occurs at the local level local state and regional participation and coordination are included in federal solutions encouraging the right balance of cooperative policy and federa l leadership to support both daily operations and national response in catastrophic situations is one of the goals of congress through legislation congress has propos ed methods for blending the use of advanced technology with the changes in or ganization that shifts in technology tend to foster in time the convergence of co mmunications technology may lead to new approaches in policymaking and oversight based on recognition that both function and technology are interconnected first responders and emergency communications congressional interest in the federal governments support of interoperable emergency communications capability s increased since september 11 2001 chaotic situations at the pentagon and the world trade center were exacerbated by inadequate communications s upport for local state and federal responders at the sites radio communications systems in particular were not interoperable hampering coordination of re scue efforts the

the fcc did not make specific recommendation for additional spectrum allocations in the shortterm although it stated that it ag reed that public safety c ould make use of such an allocation in the

above congress initially responded to the 911 commission recommendation about emergency communi cations with provisions in the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act in addition to the recommendation wh ich urged the release of spectrum creation of better communica tions connectivity in highrisk urban areas and high priority for federal funding for communicati ons capacity the section containing this recommendation mentione d other concerns67 the commission report commented on the impact on emergency response capacity when an attack is large enough and the need for teamwork collaboration and cooperation as well as regular joint training sessions the report states th at public safety organizations chief administrative officers state emergency management agencies and the department of homeland security should develop regional focus the commission expressed the opinion that the problems of communications at all three crash sites provided strong evidence that compatib and adequate communications among public safety organizations at the local state and federal levels remains an important problem both the 108th and 109th congresses provided author ities and funds to address the commissions concerns the 110th congress has continued the work meeting democratic campaign pledge to implement fully the 911 commissions recommendations with the passage of im plementing

efforts such as femas regional emergency communications coordination recc working group the three goals are bolstered by seven objectives for improvi ng emergency communi cations for first responders dealing largely with organization and coordination74 each of these objectives have supporting initiatives and milestones some of the initiatives do not specify what entity is to accomplish the step described in the necp but many of them include commitment from fema to deliver product by deadlines ranging from six months to three years providing the 111th and successive congresses ample opportunity for oversight proposed legislation the homeland security trust fund act of 2007 senator biden s 345 would establish and fund homeland secur ity and neighborhood sa fety trust fund expenditures from the fund would go for gr ants to support programs that fulfill recommendations by the 911 commission in particular provisions are made for 1 billion annually in grants for fiscal years 2007 through 2011 for state and local interoperable communications to be dist ributed through the office of community oriented policing services the bill also contains requirement for the immediate release of the 24 mhz of spectrum for pub lic safety use now scheduled for 2009 discussed above also in the senate senator charles schumer introduced bill to ensure adequate funding for hi

released in the transition to digital tv the network plan is linked to the auction of remaining block of analog spectrum known as the d block the responder act would place the entire net proceeds of

grants this separate fund would receive th proceeds remaining from the auction required by the deficit re duction act after the payments required by the act had been made it would also receive up to half of the net proceeds of future auctions although this share coul d be reduced in addition total of 15 billion would be authorized for appropriations over three years beginning with fy2008 the grant program would be administered by the ntia with board created for that purpose with five member s appointed by the secretary of commerce grants would go for communications critical to public
