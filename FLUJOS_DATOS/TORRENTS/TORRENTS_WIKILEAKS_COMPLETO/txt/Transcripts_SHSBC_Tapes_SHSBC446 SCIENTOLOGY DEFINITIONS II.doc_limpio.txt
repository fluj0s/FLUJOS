scientology definitions ii lecture given on 6 december 1966 thank you thank you well we have today what date audience 6 december ad 16 the what audience 6 december ad 16 six december audience member ad 16 ad 16 what planet audience earth thats very interesting this saint hill special briefing course lecture and i have just heard that scientology is very bad the minister of health said so in parliament but he isnt going to do anything but we are they shouldnt do it but its typical of suppressives that they elect executioners that doesnt mean that any assassination attempt is going to be made upon anybody it isnt necessary but you find out that down through the ages that sps have had ball now for the first time in known history theres thing called ethics you cant lie in order to do people in that is the motto of ethics very interesting somebody looks at ethics and they say thats terrible you know whos selecting out whos suppressive its perfectly simplethe suppressed and then they say whos to determine who is suppressive well im afraid the suppressive determines that because if anybody had exact characteristics its suppressive youve got them in bulletins but there are more exact case statistics itd be very hard to find out whether or not somebody was sane but its very easy to find out who is suppressive case doesnt change they speak in nothing but generalities they take posts like minister of health its very positive but this universe began to go to pieces and got formed actually on suppression and nothing else but and all these ages we all been waiting around and ruing the day that we didnt act when we could act and were not going to spoil that chance once you get another chance could be perfectly good universe it didnt have to be suppressive formed universe it could be perfectly happy good universe but ethics would have had to have gone in very early and because every thetan was an individual acting on his own and suppression was organized all we have to do is reverse it so that thetans without foregoing their independence yet operate on their own and organize the other side just little bit because actually its very easy to beat suppressive organization theyre beingyou see theyre busier because their percentages are out theres 80 percent who arent so that at once gives you numerical superiority furthermore they cant think straight and you can just go down the list on the number of counts with which theyd win and rd put my money any day of the week on the game that is now moving up to knock out the game that wasnt gameany day of the weekbecause the majority usually has an advantage over the minority on that principle youll find out many fights get resolved very suddenly it doesnt matter how good swordsman is he maybe handles two swordsmen three four standing in front of him five maybe maybe six he wont handle twenty hes going to get it thats for sure now an organized minority is all that has been making this universe mess so why not an organized decent majority so when they play fast and loose with scientology all theyre doing is running up their range flag they think theyre running up battle flag theyre not theyre just running up range flag our range is 2600 miles if hit even faintly with dried peas we would sink code flags flying at the yard now of course suppressive always hits the wrong target he never can complete cycle of action so it wasnt even wellorganized minority they dont even know who theyre fighting you see basically suppressive is stuck somewhere on the track fighting the martians and when you walk along youre martian so you have to be suppressed you see you automatically are martian even when you come from venus give you an idea of identification it doesnt matter how often you tell these ministry of healthyoud only have to clip it out of the tape so i just wont say itit doesnt matter how often you tell them youre not in the healing business theyre very sure that you are so they attack our healing activities well we dont have any thats very simple battle isnt it so anyway never forget that you were very lonely on the track for very very long time and the opposition seemed fantastically hard to dent seemed very very rough and its been very rough universe thats for sure but the weather vane has turned and the wind is blowing in the opposite direction and the opposition dont like it they are not sending for whom to find the bell tollsthey know its for them we actually have overt intentions toward them whatsoever i was taught punch by judo instructor one time whereby you simply stood there and held your fist out need i describe it more but we are not fighting revolutionary activity were just trying to go about our own business but we do have thing called ethics and ethics happens to be out in this universe and if you were to go into mental institution and count noses you would find only ptsesone two or three totally insane suppressives perhaps but the vast majority merely their victims i think theyve had ball and it isnt that theyre just now caved in enough to take over or handle thats not true theyve been that caved in all along only we didnt notice so we at the moment are numerically in the universe minority that is for sure we are minority but we intend to live decent lives and forward decent programs and go ahead along our way as straight as possible without getting knocked out of line by suppressives and that will eventually result in im afraid an organized majority now i didnt get through any wordsthis is some more dictionary lectureand i didnt get through any words to amount to anything with you the other day because all i wanted to do was to give you basic look at the two big words on the line which was ot and clear and l hope that itself clarified something now there are however great many other words and they neednt be described that long and theyre probably in this stack of cards that im holding in my hand right now of words submitted by students and very nicely printed indeed when i said legibly itthey interpreted it as gorgeously so your cards look very nice but there are things here possibly that we will encounter that in an evolving science something named early before total information on it is present may leave something little ragged around the edges and the first one im looking at right now is of that character want definition of the analytical mind as opposed to thetan well now thats not asking for definition thats asking for dissertation but we could ask for an analytical mind as definition and an analytical mind would be anything that thetan set up it could even be computer which collected data and used it to resolve problems and the basic purpose of the quote mind unquote is the resolution of problems relating to survival thats original thesis and thats what mind is its something that does this now if thetan does this you could say he is mind but let give you an idea of what an analytical mind would consist of one it cannot exist independently of thetan that is not possible man has been so caved in on the subject of the reactive mind which was mind which was working which he knew not what ofsee it was mind of which he was not awarethat he then discredits the whole idea of mind mustnt be any such thing as mind at all ill just do it all myself you get it now the difference between reactive mind and an analytical mind would have to be discussed to answer this question reactive mind is an unknowing unwanted series of aberrated computations which bring about an effect upon the individual and those around him in other words its got some aberrated computation that all horses sleep in beds and therefore in any attempt to build stable equips it with beds do you see but the fellow doesnt know why he this this way he does not know why he has to do this so you would say that the reactive mind is an obsessive strata of unknown unseen uninspected data which are forcing solutions unknown and unsuspected on the individual its subawareness activity and you can see thats very bad if the definition of operating thetan is knowing and willing cause over thought life matter energy space and timeknowing and willing well the analytical mind would be perfectly usable and could exist if it was knowing and willing mechanism for instance much of dianetics and scientology was resolved by the constructioni use that word advisedly since it was diagrammatic and so on on graphs and things like thismuch of it was by what you might call philosophic machine now philosophic machine would be something you would draw up which gave some data which you could then combine with some other data and get some sort of an answer but youre setting down the data and youre aligning it all up and all youre doing is doing think which is recorded in other words youre doing recorded think so that you can knowingly observe relationship of data and get an answer so an analytical mind would be the knowing and willing resolution of problems related to survival now thetans sometimes set up things that do this and that somewhat gets them in trouble because they make these things of lasting duration and the only time that an analytical mind ever gets in trouble is when its set up to run forever without inspection or observation so an analytical mind cannot exist without inspection and observation see by definition mind which is running without observation is reactive so mind which is running with observation and so forth is analytical so if you had big computerlets get two differences hereyou got big computer and we feed data to this computeran operator feeds data to the computer and he gets answers out of the computer he knows where the moon is going to be at such and such an oclock on such and such date and two minutes later he knows where the moon is going to be and two minutes later he knows what this is typical astronomical calculation they have computers like this all the time now hes there feeding the data to the machine and the machine is simply tallying what its fed and crossrelating it in such way that he can inspect it and then he knows what answers hes getting if he doesnt know what answers hes getting hed shut the machine off but then he can make these tabulations and they can turn out thing called an air almanac or nautical almanac ifor an astronomical almanacwhere the moon is going to be for any given minute during the next twelve months see which is useful to know and then somebody can consult this table which has been drawn up by this computer and hes flying along in an airplane and he hasnt got time to figure outbecause he needs his sight right awayhe hasnt got time to figure out where the moon is going to be in every minute and where the moon is this minute now if he knew where the moon was this minute he would know where he was right this minute and therefore he wouldnt need to do this at all do you see but he has to know the exact position of the moon so that he can get his relationship to the moon and then he can get his position in relationship to the earth do you follow so he is in actual fact using an analytical mind he is inspecting the moon and then inspecting the table which was drawn up and then he gets an answer which is his position do you see all right now lets take gobbledygook affair whereby oh this is the superscientists special see its machine that uninspected picks up the data to resolve problems that had not been suspected and turns out answers uninspected which then by law become total effect upon the population do you see i mean thats silly and yet they dream about such machines and they even write sciencefiction stories about such machines as though this would be great thing all right now we take shipnow lets take little air car see or something like that that runs on trolleys or somethingwe set this thing up to know when its loaded with passengers know when to start know when to stop when to turn around when to come back and what course to follow and we set up this air car to run from to b to b to to to b to b to to to b to b to forevermore now the question is is this thing reactive as matter of fact it isnt reactive there isnt passenger that gets aboard it that doesnt inspect it and you can just hear the angry catcalls which come from the passengers whenever the machine does not get to b or back to its an inspected machine automatic elevatorssame way if you ever want to hear ruckus in big office building the automatic elevator stops halfway between floors thats inspected reason it usually breaks down is it hasnt been inspected lately people know what that thing is supposed to do dont you see they know what its purpose is and what its supposed to do and it gets inspected and so forth so it nevertheless has sort of mind it knows its supposed to depart every time the weights on it become umpteen kilos it knows its supposed to shut its doors and travel to the other end of the track and when it arrives at the other end of the track by some gimmickry or other it knows ifs supposed to stop but it knows were not interested in what it knows and what it doesnt know if it were totally independent of life of course the machine could run from to b to b to to to b to b to and it could even load things and run them from to b to b to and back and forth and thered be nobody around and life was served and nobody ever got the product that came to b and we have the kind of world that sciencefiction writer very often dreams up as the ideal theres nobody there at all well i point out that somebody had to be there to begin with and sooner or later something is going to happen along such line that this thing will become aberrative supposing you inherited civilization that you knew nothing about how it worked at all and it was all on automatic this is another sciencefiction dream see you walk into this universeand you walk into this planet and all the doors open and close and the things crowded and so forth but everything is just going on and the machines are therejohn w campbell special hes one of these characters boy he loves it im going to get him to write sciencefiction story someday i was robot everybody else writes confessions why shouldnt he but the machines repair the machines you see and the machines wait on the machines and the machines the machines the machines the machines now that very thought and that idea that universe can exist entirely of machines that would be of any benefit of any kind whatsoever is of course complete nonsense because itd just be childs toy and the one who built it would be the one who built it and if it broke down eventually hed have to come back and fix it up again do you follow but population which inherited one of these things and didnt know how it ran and so on would be very mystified along the whole line and so forth its reactive its reactive the human body falls under the character of machine which one does not know the directions of he doesnt know how or why it operates as it operates and therefore we have the medical doctor i might go so far as to say therefore we tolerate the medical doctor the body is so unknown that we dont know he doesnt know either but you get the difference now you find that body is fairly aberrative does unexpected things gets sick at unexpected moments and so on its got somebody there but that somebody cant keep it inspected because it has reactions and effects upon him which he cannot predict he does not know the construction of it he really does not know how it got there in the first place and he doesnt know at what moment the thing is going to stop and have to be buried at vast profit to the undertakers do you see now therefore speaking of machines that would be an aberrative machine now the body line is apparently running uninspected it is its running uninspected nobody inspects it and therefore you get ministers of health and all kinds of aberrative things thats correct now if you at this moment were going to mock up body which you out of courtesy were going to display to people and have talk and you put it on the drawing board and you drew it up both as to how it should look and how its to function im sure you would leave more parts out and consider them unnecessary than the body has i dont think you would put it together this way at all you would probably put together very simple functional body you would probably also put together disposable body in case the paint got scratched but you see then you would be knowing and willing cause now you didnt have to be the one who built it but let us say that you could buy bodies down at the store well beware of buying bodies which dont include any directions in them and thats essentially what youve been doing for some time and it just shows how idiotic fellow can get that he picks up machine with instruction book and you think of the trial and error you had to learn how to run the body youre pushing right this minute its quite remarkable the number of chairs you fell into and the number of times you bumped its nose well thats trial and error you had some familiarity with it and you somehow or other but it was great surprise to man that the heart beat and circulated the bloodjust about 300 years ago he found out that his heart beat and circulated blood up to that time he thought he kind of existed by the ocean tides or something the blood tided out to the extremities of the body and untidied back that was the theory of galen and harvey came along and says it goes pocketapocketapocketa and there was great row over this because the medical profession thought that it might leadthis piece of knowledgeinto not having heart trouble which constitutes 50 percent of their income actually there are treatments for heart trouble right now which are not being used because heart trouble is 50 percent of medical income thats statement made by the way by the shute institute of canada now the difference then between an analytical mind and reactive mind would be mind that was running without inspection its aunwilling to have it run get it and you dont know its there and so on now that when you try to disseminate to people about scientology is what you run into you are talking about the reactive mind and they dont know its there you have to actually show them its there before they sort of understand what youre talking about and its very funny to see somebody who is very green sit down and start to run his analytical thoughts and computations when youre trying to get him to run his reactive mind i could see there aremore auditing time gets burned up just on that basis only the fellow is busy supposedly running an engram well the fellow is running an engram and the engram is yesterday when he walked from office to office b now he knew he was at office and he knew he arrived at office b he also knew why he was going there and so forth and im afraid the whole operation was completely unaberrative but he will sit there and he will run that with the greatest of enthusiasm and the greatest greatest thoroughness but if hes too absorbed in it you can then realize that any living moment to him is reactive moment that it was an engram containing pain and unconsciousness to eat his wheaties and there you would get where the fellow was so overwhelmed he was aware of nothing now the way you handle reactive mind and attain up to an analytical mind status the way you handle this is simply to increase the thetans awareness this is the difference actually between dianetics and scientology the reactive mind is handled by increasing the thetans awareness now by increasing his awareness he becomes aware of this thing so its now under inspection and as he goes along he can then handle this thing and so it is under his control and it ceases then to be reactive matter whats in it but youall you have to do is increase the awareness of thetan to overcome the reactive mind by merely destroying the machine you really dont accomplish much you could probably get some kind of pill called lsd robinsonyoull have to take that out of the tape because those are not his initials they are the initials of the fellow who invented all the crazy machinery in england you know in america you have rube goldberg you know the rube goldberg machines well actually in england isnt it keith robinson and isnt that the minister of health now anyway now therefore as his awareness increases of what is going on he can handle it but if you had syringe that you shot him in the gluteus maximus which youre sitting on at the moment this restimulates my medical degrees matter of great shame i have to confess to the fact on the backtrack that i was contaminated to that degree for while anyway if you shot him in the gluteus maximus with some kind of fluid which simply wrecked the reactive mind you would find the individual would not get well or anything else you might find some physical characteristics change but he wouldnt know theyd changed and he wouldnt know theyd not changed and once in blue moon you can run heavy engram on preclear and have the preclears arthritis or lumbosis or something disappear utterly and the preclear be in this fascinating state not to have known he had lumbosis or arthritis to begin with and not to know its gone when you have finished now what are you handling there youre handling somebody who had awareness of any part of the machinery so the man was very unaware so therefore everything was reactive now as an individual disappears down the awareness scale he could get into position where the whole world was reactive so when youre talking about analytical or when youre talking about reactive and so forth youre actually talking about the awareness scale of the individual now an individual who doesnt occasionally set up an analytical mindnot to run for him and work for him and so forth but who does not use an analytical mental processis having rough time for instance im fairly good at guessing products of two multiplied numbers but i would rather multiply them do you see id rather multiply them and get an exact answerparticularly when im paying my bills well now that operation is an analytical mental operation the machine in that particular character is the arithmetic tables thats sort of philosophic machine and the various tables of multiplication and so forth and the rules of addition and subtractionthis is an arithmetic machine and of course most kids in school consider this totally reactive mind so you see the difference between these two things now there is analytical mind opposed to the thetan only the reactive mind is because the question ofis what is the analytical mind as opposed to the thetanthe definitions of these two things well the joke in this case is that the reactive mind opposes thetan the analytical mind doesnt so youdo you see the difference between these two things and it simply comes when youre asked for very rapidfire definition of the thing an analytical mind would be mind that is temporarily set up willingly and knowingly by thetan to assist in the resolution of problemsproblems inevitably relate to survivaland anything that he set up to do this whichof which he was aware and which was inspected and that would be an analytical mind committee set up to get data and coordinate the activities of another area or bodyof factory or something like thatwould be the mind of that factory even though they are thetans doing it but there would have to be thetans doing it to be analytical now thats one of the reasons why for instance in an organization you should know policy because otherwise the solutions and combinations and so forth unknown to you make it have an effect on you because its somewhat reactive do you see if you dont know about it and if youreand then if policy isnt inspected and if it isnt reformed to meet the conditionsyou see its very set but it gets reformed to meet the conditions of operation as you go alongif these things dont happen why then it too could become reactive mind but it would become reactive just to the degree that one wasnt aware of it do you see so therefore its very very good thing that if youre operating on set of data of some kind or another to make them known now scientology is somewhat reactive mind to the society particularly health ministers in the first place their awareness level would have to be it would have to exist somewhere on the awareness scale but if they didnt have an awareness level you could talk at them and talk at them and talk at them and talk at them and give them data data data data data and if they were still not aware they would simply be acted on the way reactive mind acts if we didnt disseminate and yell so hard do you know that the societies of the world would never really become aware of our existence at all any more than they are aware of the existence of thetan and if we really had something up our sleeves we would simply continue to operate in that framework it would be totally reactive action as far as the planet was concerned and it wouldnt be very good for man now we have tendency to go out in this particular direction because as our awareness of individuals come up they fail to be aware of how unaware the populace at large is and when you get into ot operations you will find very often that you run across this factor i wouldnt bother to solve it if the solution got in the road of it i wouldnt bother to solve it because theyve already got so many reactive minds that one more area of reactivity to them wouldnt matter much now when you have to explain all of your motives to somebody you realize that you really shouldnt bother because if theiryour motives are not visible to them when you dont intend to hide your motives then an explanation of your motives are not very likely to do very much to them because their level of awareness of you already doesnt exist do you see it almost comes down to it that hea thetan could make hard and fast ruleonly he never should make hard and fast rulesbut its good one to observe is never explain be as obvious as you please and be as plain as you please and as straightforward as you can be and if the ordinary evidences which lie around then dont justify your actions and so forth theres sense in explaining it to the person who is challenging them for the good reason that he wouldnt be able to understand them anyway so reactivity and analytical are relative to the awareness potential of the individual any analytical mind can become reactive mind and therefore such minds when theyre set up are just little bit dangerous do you follow i dont think theres any reason to define thetan after all youre sitting there now power power just has physical definition and i could give you i suppose if i thought hard the textbook physical definition its the amount of work which can be accomplished in unit of time or the amount of force which can be applied in unit of time it contains within it the idea of potential power is not something which is being exerted whereas force tends to be do you follow power has the connotation of being potential therefore person is powerful when he is able to use power not when he is necessarily not using power or using power he is simply powerful in other words its potential that he could behe could use force do you see so therefore he is powerful but you would say he is forceful you would get the immediate action that he was using force hes using force right now so we use the word power because power does not necessarily mean application of ituse or application of it and the smarter fellow gets why the lessthe less force he in actual fact employs in order to accomplish difference or change of opinion on the part of others and thetheres limit to this when somebody is tearing up your mockups faster than you can put them up and so forth why you can change from being powerful to for moment being forceful and it was your failure to do this very early on the track which got you in trouble now when somebody says implants he means an unwilling and unknowing receipt of think the most ordinary example of an implant now theres difference between an implant and an engram an engram is simply those perceptions unknowingly contained in the force duress pain and unconsciousness you see of an incident now fellow gets hit in the head with an axitsintent is the difference see fellow gets hit in the head with an ax and at that moment there is mill wheel going and somebody says look out now hell have the sound of mill wheel and look out and the texture of the ax and the general scenery so cluttered up and generalized and impressed upon him that he will havea wog willa stuck picture not only wog but he will have stuck picture of this he will make mental image picture now he makes mental image picture by reaction of resistance he goes wruhh with energy see out you know stop it and at that moment he goes unconscious and hes made sort of stuck wave because of course he didnt prevent it and actually just as you sort of would make an embossed impression of something he sort of embosses the environment do you see how hed do that you know for instance if you put your hand up against brick and pushed it very hard and then looked at your hand you would oddly enough for split instant you would have almost an exact picture of the brick and moment or so later why you would have the indentations of the brick you see well that was because you pushed on the brick you pushed something at the brick well thetan is potentialwell he is able to exert energy he can make and exert energy so when he tries to fend something off he rather reactively pushes back against what is pushing against him or he pulls in against what is leaving him now if he does this why then hes left with not just picture but series of pictures but he certainly has got one of those pictures stuck harder than the other pictures and it was at moment when he resisted hardest against the force which was influencing upon him or pulled back hardest against the departing force do you see so it sort of automatically took picture now lets get the difference between that and an implant an implant he is put under duresshe is resistingand somebody is intentionally giving him fixed perceptions and ideas it is an intentional wreck of somebodys ability to make pictures perceive and remember its intentional now we could have an implant on the basis somebody hit joe over the head with an ax and knowing now that joe was going to resist at this moment at the moment he does this he also says you are fool you gibber and drool now thats intentional that was an intention to aberrate him and what do you know it actually will work out that joe after that will at least be afraid of gibbering and drooling because its part of the impression it overwhelmed him so therefore the thought is overwhelming now implants are of very different kinds and types and so forth but they all contain this in common they are an intentional installation of fixed ideas contrasurvival to the thetan some people make an impression of it psychiatrists now thats not just dirty statement they do this today they will give athey will pour the whole powerhouse full of juice into somebodys skull and they never bother to tell him that hes going to fthat afterwards that they have told him hestheyre going to take care of him youre going to feel all right and youre going to want another one of these and they have never bothered to inform even the public that they do that but they quite commonly implant and they use implantings now you could definitely take shock machine any shock machine in any psychiatrists officeby which they tell the person theyre going to be better and so forth they gave him an implant in other words make it reactive fixed idea you could take an implant machine you could clamp it on the head of some guy who was pretty loopy and give it the works and say at the same time you are going to go to the state house and get job as page and on such and such date you are going to take knife and kill dr vervordt you will do this but forget you have ever been told and turn the shock machine off and he would possibly do it any use of duress against the insane delivers into the hands of those who are legally practicing it or practicing it without legal check the power to accomplish any criminal act in the society its worth knowing isnt it but if man does not know that there is even such thing as reactive mind if he does not know there is such thing as potential implantingsee i dont say that is what happened this is technical subject you see and if man is not aware of anybody having reactive mind hes not aware of implanting or how you can implant suggestion if his closest awareness of it is hypnotism and if he considers at large hypnotism fake and if he is also told carefully by all the hypnotists that only some people can be hypnotized then people think theyve got hypnotism mixed up with it well actually all hypnotism is is restimulation of past implants stop that now our next one is gpm and gpm are the initials of goals problem mass and it was named that arbitrarily because when an individual has an intention and something else has another intention or when there are two intentions counteropposed he has problem for the definition of problem is intentioncounterintention purposecounterpurpose goal countergoal and that is problem for instance our trouble with such dissident elements and suppressives in the society is we have goal of making people well they have goal of holding people down now those two things get together and theyre counterintentions so therefore they make problem now there can be two or more intentions in conflict and when those two things are in conflict one with the other they tend to produce mass now the russian statement of this is called dialectic materialismthat all ideas are born out of the meeting of two forces theyve got it actually backwards when two ideas oppose they create force they say two forces create ideas if you hit guy hard enough hell think funny part of it is ive seen an awful lot of schoolboys taught that way that didnt actually succeed very well in life goals problem mass its simply statement that when you have two opposed ideas there will be resulting mass or mass is held by two opposed ideas now the reason the mass holds is because thetan cannot as is either side in other words he cant see which side is which now pandeterminism which well get around to is the ability to see both sides of something or asis both sides of something when one is totally pandetermined he has mental mass because hes seen both sides of everything he can see two ideas at once even though they are opposed selfdeterminism is very laudable since it is very rare but nevertheless is below pandeterminism because the individual can only determine something from his own viewpoint so when you talk to somebody and he justifies what he does you know immediately that he is selfdetermined not pandetermined thats the quickest test there is see thats the quickest test there is little boy you says you spat at johnny he says he hit well the reason hes in trouble with you is because hes self determined well he didnt determine you did he he didnt handle the other little boy from his point of view so the other little boy wouldnt hit him so therefore he had to react to the other little boys having hit him well you always get into conflicts one with the other way in lifetheyre sort of inevitable life is sort of conflict of some kind or another but it neednt be total conflict and it doesnt mean that one opposes every idea that comes along now you take somebody whos totally reactive he will inevitably oppose any idea put to him we normally call such person conservative or reactionary or tory or somethingits sort of that hes agin it see and its very funny handling such people to start putting his own ideas to him because his first impulse is to be agin em because youre putting them to him and this foxes him up most horribly and normally that is such horrible trick that its usually looked on as fight talk you think youre pretty good dont you now that makes the guy resist his own idea you think youre right but you are wrong you see that foxes him up see because although its low scale thing its the low scale mockery of pandeterminismtake both sides of the argument and sometimes you can see one of these low scale mockeries of somebody taking both sides of the argument theyre just rattling on at mad rate when theyre giving all of the questions all of the challenges and all of the answers and the other person is saying absolutely nothing and this is one of the wildest things to watch which youve ever watched and im sure you have seen it somebody is standing there with the whole dialogue now youve got it all figured out that you know starts that sort of thing and now youre going to say but but the other fellow hasnt said anything and thats sort of lowerscale harmonic there is ability of thetan in actual fact which does not have lowerscale mockery or lowerscale exaggeration you know if you can see up on the upper scale if you can see then somewhere down on the lower scale below blindness the individual sees things see thats the lowerscale harmonic he sees things that arent there of course but still thats an exaggeration do you see of the upperscale ability and so do all abilities person begins to single out only one ability out of all of his abilities and then this becomes exaggeratedbecomes aberrated and then exaggerated and then this is all he can do but he does that far too well see you could see dragon if it walked in but he doesnt have to have one walk in he can become so bad off that he sees scientologist under every chair the guy is right we are after him were after him the guy who believes that youre martianhes seeing but hes seeing in very aberrated way dont you see so anyhow coals problem mass is simply the problem created by two or more opposing ideas which being opposed balanced and unresolved makes mass so its peculiar kind of mass its mentalenergy mass but actually can exist in the physical universe if you have tractor being driven north and tractor b being driven south they cease to be tractors and merely become mass now heres one the difference betweenit should be amongst because there are three things you see you cant have two thingsyou have three things with betweenthe difference amongst affinity emotion and intention well i should think anybody should know that an emotion an emotion is response by wavelength affecting an individual or another which produces sensation and state of mind and an intention is something that one wishes to do he intends to do it its an impulse toward something its an idea that one is going to accomplish something its intentional which means he meant to do it he means to do it and affinity has nothing to do with the other two at allhas nothing to do with the other two because affinity is the ability to occupy the space of or be like or similar to or to express willingness to be something you say i like you youre immediately saying well id just as soon be you do you see i like you would also say id just as soon occupy your space and affinity carried forward in ne plus ultra i suppose between two thetans you could mock up the conversation of lets occupy the same space now when two individualsthere is scale of affinity which doesnt just include likebut when two individuals do not like each other it means they wont occupy each others space they wont occupy each others viewpoint they dont want to be like the other person and so forth the dissimilarity must exist if one wears blue the other has got to wear green its expressed dissimilarities and when this becomes sufficiently strong then they enforcedly become like the other fellow which is an overwhelm now when you say home universe youve asked here is question what is home universe well its the universe thetan made for himself and here is the rock and the rock was something which we audited for and assessed outmeaning shape of something which we could then run process onand we at that time were running on the theory that it was the first object that the fellow had made on the track and thats what we were researching for and when we found that we could run help on that in 5 way bracket and you can make very very stable fast release with the process it produced i dont know some large percentage of releaseswe called them clears in those daysof very high order in one acc it doesnt take long to find it and research it but now that we have actual clearing there is point in doing it religion now that is something that has had many definitions but it means basically the search for truth deddedex the deddedex sequence now ive forgotten exactly what those two words exactly mean but its deduced somethingorother but what it is its very necessary phrase its very necessary title and its almost impossible to get decent word for it but it means that the overtmotivator sequence went backwards so deddedex is an overt motivator sequence that is the wrong way to so that you hit joe andyou hit joe and then he hits you well thats really deddedex in other words that is the straight line of it now the actual original connotation was although it went this way you had it figured out that he must have hit you first so you invented something that he did to you to motivate your hitting him and thats ded dedex ifs phony its phony overtmotivator sequence do you see now theoretically thetan would say i was hit in the chops so i hit him in the chops now thats just totally reactive you see and thats perfectly ordinary easytounderstand overtmotivator sequence see he ran into you you ran into him see well the reason why you ran into him is perfectly well explainedhe ran into you but how about when you are the fellow who did the first running into now you cant say he ran into because i ran into him thats too honest and makes you wrong so therefore the common human error is when youve run into joe and then hes run into you or regardless of whether he ran into you or not but when youd committed the first action all out of your ownoff your own bat and so forth is to invent what he did to you that made you run into him and its sometimes very hard to do sometimes youve never met the chap before and that was deddedex and what it means actual fact is the overt act explained the ex i remember is explained its the action is explainedthe reason why you did it and so forth but its simply explained and it really doesnt carry in its title enough connotation of explained phonily now youll get more data on this if you look up in the book where it occurs and so on but that is the original idea is how did you explain your having hit first without provocation and that explanation and hitting him is both in combination called deddedex the somatic mind was something that was added to the first book by mr uh ive forgotten the name of the publisher and i remember discussing all this and then i found it in the glossary so there it is its the mind that runs the body independent of it would be physicalcoordination switchboard system that ran the human body in view of the fact we dont really know how the human body runs weve really got business declaring mind we dont know where it exists do you see so there were diagrams put in about this somatic mind and so forth you get the idea that i didnt write all that book well actually i wrote all that book except itsdianetics modern science of mental healthexcept its introduction i wrote the basic introduction but the real early introduction that describes the book and says what kind of book it is and the wheel and the arch and all that sort of thing was actually originally written bythe first lines of it were written by walter winchell who was very excited about the subject and then the rest of it was written by the publisher and then there were some addenda which were written by some other people now somebody wants to know what buttered all over the universe means and it probably is more technical than most of you realize when you set an individual who is very badly disoriented and dispersed you can get type of case that is very dispersed they dont know whether theyre here or in christmas see and when you get them to spot spots in space as to where they arewhere they are not where they are not which is the proper processbut when you get them to point around in space as to where they are they will point all over the universe if you run that auditing question on them they will do that and it is the reaction of this very dispersed case in response to the question that gives us this colloquialism or this technical term tattered all over the universe well they are they think theyre everywhere they dont know anyplace and the last place they look now the person who tells youwhen you exteriorize them or theyre exteriorized or something like thatim over there thats great you know they say i am over there now how could i be over there you see thats impossible that person might be also buttered all over the universe they think theyre everywhere at once i dont know how they get this way i suppose its leaving anchor points all over the universe and appearing in one anchor point and another anchor point and doing that sort of thing anchor point would be something he put out to make space so thats an oldtime processabout 1954 i think it was tiger drill thats one of the drills which are run and is adequately covered in bulletin and its simply drill that has to do with the fact that we use the word tiger in it to keep from using reactive word because im sure that nobody has had ever anything to do with tigers somatic mind again computation theres supposed to be compwell itheres another connotation to this in dianetics and scientology theres such thing as computing psychotic and dramatizing psychotic there are two types of psychosis psychotic who from his reactivity figurefigures so hishes inconstant in his conduct hes computive in other words he figures it all out hes got explanations ratatattatatattatatat tat and his psychosis is derived because these are crazy explanations and these are all crazy and they have nothing to do with where he is or what hes doing or showing result or anything else and the other type of insanity is dramatizing so that the individual has one pattern action which is insane he might do that continuously but it is just one pattern action and its like playing off the same strip of film over and over and over its like he runs through the same thing he sits down in the chair pulls his hair out gets up runs over to the window and breaks the glass and jumps outside and actually when hes not doing that particular one is remarkably sane now that would be dramatizing in other words he goes through drama and computing psychotic would be one whose variations of the situation are fabulously weird the reason why you have just spilled tea all over him are and the only thing wrong with the statement is you havent spilled tea you havent given him any tea and the subject had nothing to do with tea and few minutes later he will figure it all out on some other basisand that is hes obsessively solving problem which does not exist as far as computation is concerned it means to figure out computation in its purest sense is two times two equals four arbitrary it means something which is introduced into the situation without regard to the data of the situation it means it is arbitrary arbitrary means stand alone and i suppose comes from tree which sits on hill or something like that in skeats but its something which is introduced into the situation without regard to the data of the situation you know youve probably had nursemaid or somebody in your raising that gave you consistent arbitrary situations you know you had drunk your milk and you were ordered to drink your milk well thats the introduction of an arbitrary into the situation because it didnt have anything to do with the data see but similarly somebody says in so many words that such and such is the case or such and suchit doesnt have to be an ordersuch and such must be done or such and such is true if thats introduced without observation and arbitrarily or without any refutation into formula situation administrative action or line will begin to cause ripple around it and this ripple has now got to be solved so somebody else will give an arbitrary solution to the introduced arbitrary for instance if you had law that two had to be introduced to every mathematical situaequation you had to say times two arbitrarily by the arithmetic book and what they had told you to do without any sense and it doesnt have anything to do with the problem but youre supposed to at this moment add times twoso you would have two times two and now youve got to multiply it by two so that would give you eight equals four two times sixteenbut now of course by arbitrary we have to introduce times twotwo times sixteen equals sixtyfour now if you had an adding machine which had piece of stuck solder in it or something like that that always added five into anything youd get four times five equals twentyfive two times six equals seventeen when you introduce arbitraries you get wrong answers you have to be careful about introducing an arbitrary now an order which is given which seeks to remedy situation which may be quite urgent might also be an arbitrary order thats our new system of urgent directives to get around arbitraries so that any exec sec or any member of an advisory council by getting majority of signatures can very quickly issue an urgent directive to remedy some kind of situation very pervasiveit doesnt much matter what its about but it stays in force only until data can be collected on it there are various ways in which you get rid of the urgent directive but the urgent directive must be gotten rid of it must be replaced by something which is based on observed factjust on the offchance that an arbitrary might be introduced into the situation an arbitrary would be an education that the boy never understood its arbitraryhe has to be educated thats very arbitrary statements by the way he has to be educatednot in what or anything like that or so he can or something like that harmonics harmonics is the fact that the musical scaleand any wavelength actionit means that if you struck the note of vibration one hundred even though you only struck one hundred you will also get two hundred and four hundred to some tiny degree it is very hard to take any scale particularly vibrational scale and not get reverberations up and down by doubles or halves thats where the word comes from actually in the field of art it means agreement with but what we mean by harmonicsit meansin scientology its possibly slightly differentit means the upper harmonics or the lower harmonics we use in relationship to welloff casesupper harmonics and lower harmonicsbadoff cases and when we say that the thing is lower harmonic we mean that it is lower similarity which is nutty which is actually based on something like it higher on the scale which isnt but it is all the tendency of wavelength to repeat itself and insanity the lower you go in terms of awareness why the more weird the repetition is but in music if you strike one note in music why that note unstruck in the piano which is double and the note unstruck which is half will also both hum so it means coaction or similar action and so on so we just take the word similar we say this fellow is going along fine this fellow is going along fine and hes able to figure out mathematical table and so forth then somehow or another somebody can get lower harmonic of this ability to figure out the mathematical table and he doodles do you see its similar action but which would be less aware so harmonic actually applies to the awareness scale i dont mean it to be too arbitrary because it actually is not much in use and is not very valuable what you really use in term like this you say lowerscale mockery and that expresses it doesnt it so some fellow dresses in very good way and comedian comes out on the stage and dresses overdone with the same characteristics that would be lowerscale mockery of person dressing well and you very oftenthe only reason the word is important to you is you very often can be made to feel somewhat foolish in the presence of this sort of thing you could be made to feel somewhat foolish by having yourself some intention and then having spinner tell you youve got that as an intention and it makes you kind of think like youre maybe nuts to have this intention see ill give you an example one day as mental exercise and so on i was trying to figure out you see its necessary when youre running organizations such as ours and so forth to figure out what to do with the locations of organization or future planning or predictionfor instance of whether or not money exchanges are going to remain the same and so forth well i was trying to figure out what england would do by trying to figure out what she should do politically in order to straighten things out to find out which way this was going to go so i could predict curve whether or not to expand the organization you see or whether or not to enter dollars into the country or hold them at the border do you understand so i had been spending some little time sitting there trying to figure out what should england do now and what she could do and i was going on like this and i ran into fellow just outside the door and he told he was disraeli and he washad been disraeli and he was going to help england and i had to therefore clear him so that he could save england see well now the fact that i had been thinking about what england should do or would do you see sort of put on the same level as this you know but made feel so weird you know this guy telling you know and they should get the brooklyn bridge rebuilt you know and he did have one good idea to throw westminster in the thames but i had to fix him up because england had met her hour of peril and unless he was in the saddle why it was all going to go to hell i agreewhether he was in the saddle or not he was right but it made feel very very peculiar because i had just been having some similar some similar thoughtswhat england should do and what england is doing do you get the idea that was to get some kind of an idea framework in which we were operating which way is this cat going to jump you see it was way back we werent sure about howwhat recovery measures were going to be taken and some guy comes along and gives you few seconds later few minutes later he gives you gives you all of these solutions about what they should do except theyve got mad glaring eye and are completely nuts and you walk up the street saying to yourself am i nuts you see youve had this happen to you im sure you felt then that the ideas you had must have been very very daffy indeed if joe blow had them youre supposed to react this way to comedian who comes out and mimics your accent and so forth in disdainful or contemptuous way lowerscale mockery ridicule is all based on lowerscale mockery anyway there is thenow im going to vary the situation andvary the situation and try to give you just few more lectures on this particular lineup and the people that are here are going to be introduced at the next lecture i see i was giving them bad time heregiving alan bad time last time about not having all these things written up and so forth so he did beautiful job actually before probably copied them painstakingly so i could read them now hes got them on beautiful cards so ill give them to my aide to make sure that we get them at the very next one and bid you this afternoon very good afternoon thank you
