rate of saving may not be in the spotlight as often as other policy issues but it nonetheless has important effects on many issues that are including the trade deficit and the future ability of social security to secure the wellbeing of retirees by saving more and consuming less there are more resources available to expand the capital stock growing capital stock is important because it adds to labor productivity and promotes rising living standards by economic definition saving equals investment it is not where the saving comes from but how much saving is available that determines the level of domestic investment while it may not matter for overall investment where saving co mes from other consequences follow from how much of domestic investment is financed from domestic sources of saving if saving from domestic sources is insufficient to finance total investment then the shortfall is made up by importing saving but being net importer of saving also means that we are net importer of goods and services there are three sources of domestic saving households business and government the targets of past efforts to raise national saving have been households and the federal budget of the two households may be less susceptible to policies intended to stimulate saving the response of households to saving incentives is still open to question and if household saving does not rise by more than any reduction in tax revenue the net effect on national saving will be minimal or could even be negative increased saving by the federal government is much more likely to raise the national rate of saving an increase in taxes may result in decline in household saving but any reduction in household saving is likely to be small relative to the increase in government saving this

of saving may not be in the spotlight as often as other policy issues but it nonetheless has important effects on many issues that are it is an accounting identity in economics that saving must equal investment by saving more and consuming less there are more resources available to expand the capital stock growing capital stock is important because it adds to labor productivity and rising living standards in an economic sense there is best saving rate the rate at which we save is reflection of our relative preferences for consuming now or deferring consumption to some future time but when the issue of saving arises in public policy context it is usually because of concern that we may not be saving enough to promote longrun economic prosperity1 if raising the national saving rate is public policy goal what are the options this report discusses the various sources of saving in the united states and factors that determine the rates of saving it then examines policies that might affect saving decisions in each sector of the economy and for the nation as whole

economic sense however consumption is not the same as expenditures translating the theoretical notion of saving into statistical measure is challenge this section uses basic economic accounting framework to show the importance of saving to the overall economy us saving is part of the national income and product accounts nipa published by the department of commerce bureau of economic analysis bea the nipa constitute the accounting framework used to produce quarterly estimates of gross domestic product gdp gdp is the total value of goods and services produced and it can be calculated in two different ways one way is to add up the value of all the goods and services produced the product side of the accounts and the other way is to add up all of the income earned in the production of those goods and services the income side of the account on the product side gdp is the total value of those goods and services produced for personal consumption c investment i government g as well as for export x on the income side the income earned in the production of those goods and services can be accounted for as consumer spending c taxes t private saving s and spending for imported goods and services m since both of these approaches measure the same variable gdp they can be set equal to each other in this way cigxctsm 1 for recent saving data see crs report rs21480 saving rates in the united states calculation and comparison by brian w cashell httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32119g5g138g151g561g18g158g139g149g146g140g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g20g138g146g156g142g561g157g145g142g561g21

consumption c from both sides simplifies the equality igxtsm this can now be rearranged by subtracting government spending g and exports x from both sides which gives is tg m x this equation illustrates the importance of saving total investment is equal to the sum of private saving s public saving tg and the net inflow of capital from abroad mx2 to put it more simply investment equals saving in the broadest sense saving is income less consumption consumption is typically taken to mean spending on goods and services by households but consumption can also refer to the wear and tear depreciation or capital consumption on the capital stock that occurs in the production of those goods and services thus some saving must be allocated to the replacement of the existing capital stock as it ages or wears out only if saving is more than sufficient to replace the existing capital stock as it wears out or becomes obsolete will the capital stock grow for this reason saving data distinguish between gross and net saving the difference between the two measures is the estimated deterioration in the existing capital stock in some cases such as computers capital may be completely depreciated in very short period of time while in others such as buildings or heavy equipment capital may take long time to wear out g25g145g162g561g21g138g159g146g151g144g561g15g138g157g157g142g155g156g561 given this accounting framework it is easy to see the importance of saving to the economy by definition saving equals investment it is not wh ere the saving comes from but how much saving is available that determines the level of domestic investment however the composition of saving does affect the ownership of the capital stock and determines who has claim on the income generated by that stock to the extent that domestic investment is financed by importing saving from abroad foreigners will have claim on the interest and dividend income produced by those investments the amount of saving that flows into the country also affects the balance of trade in goods and services in order for foreigners to invest their savings in the united states they must first buy dollars in foreign exchange markets an increas in the inflow of foreign savings means an increase in the demand for dollars and an increase in the supply of foreign currency in currency exchange markets that tends to push up the value of the dollar relative to other currencies 3 2 just as there is balance between the income and product sides of the nipa there is balance in international payments if americans buy more goods and services from abroad than they export then at least in this simplified example the net outflow of dollars will be used by foreig ners to buy dollardenominated assets which thus helps to finance domestic investment 3 this does not necessarily mean that the value of the dollar will rise over time but rather that it will be higher than otherwise would have been the case httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32119g5g138g151g561g18g158g139g149g146g140g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g20g138g146g156g142g561g157g145g142g561g21

the exchange value of the dollar in turn makes us exports more expensive to foreigners and imports less expensive to american consumers that stimulates an increase in imports while discouraging exports the result of increased imports and reduced exports is larger trade or current account deficit thus along with the increased net inflow of foreign saving there is also an increase in the net inflow of foreign goods and services while it may not matter for overall investment where saving comes from there are other consequences that follow from how much of domestic investment is financed from domestic sources of saving if saving from domestic sources is insufficient to finance total investment then the shortfall is made up by importing saving but being net importer of saving also means that the united states is net importer of goods and services g10g152g158g156g142g145g152g149g141g561g21g138g159g146g151g144g561 the standard model of consumer spending used in economic analysis makes the basic assumption that consumers seek to avoid large swings in their living standards over the course of their lifetimes thus as incomes rise and fall both in the short and long term individuals will vary their saving rate in order to minimize the effect on their consumption typically over the course of an individuals lifetime income has tendency first to rise over the course of career and then fall in retirement the life cycle model presumes that in order to dampen the effects of this income cycle on consumption and living standards individuals vary the rate at which they save saving will thus tend to be relatively higher during their peak earning years and less at the beginning of their careers and during retirement 4 any analysis of household saving must account for those factors which cause incomes to vary over the course of lifetime one is retirement ideally if the assumptions of the life cycle model are valid the purpose of saving is to avoid drop in living standards after retirement insofar as retirement saving is paramount the individual sa ving rates will tend to vary with age and the overall household saving rate will tend to vary in response to demographic changes another consideration is referred to as precautionary saving the life cycle pattern of income described above is only generalization individual incomes may vary substantially over periods of time in ways unrelated to the life cycle the more likely and the more extreme those variations are may affect how much more individuals may save above and beyond what is needed for retirement thus variations in confidence about overall economic conditions and individual career prospects may influence the saving rate recent history suggests that major shifts in equity values may also affect the overall household saving rate an increase in equity values that is perceived to be durable may allow households to continue accumulating wealth while saving less out of current income 5 4 the life cycle model was developed in order to reconcile two apparently contradictory observations the first is that at any point in time people with relatively more income tend to have relatively higher saving rates the second was that as incomes rise over time there is tendency for saving rates to rise the life cycle model holds that saving is more function of age than income 5 saving rates derived from the nipa are based on current income and expenditures they do not reflect changing asset prices for that reason some analysts consider changes in net worth more meaningful measure of saving httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32119g5g138g151g561g18g158g139g149g146g140g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g20g138g146g156g142g561g157g145g142g561g21 g138g159g146g151g144 g561g20g138g157g142g501g561

policy which suggests that governments ability to influence household thriftiness may be limited one approach that has been tried is to offer tax advantages for those households that save in 1982 individual retirement accounts iras were introduced as way to st imulate household saving whether they did so has become subject of some controversy6 after the introduction of iras substantial amounts of funds flowed into the new accounts but that alone was not evidence of any effect on the total amount of household saving the question is not just whether household saving rose after the introduction of iras but rather whether households saved more than they would have in the absence of iras comparing an actual outcome with hypothetical base is common problem in economic analysis sometimes theoretical argument can be made as to what the effects of specific policy are that is not the case with respect to the effects of iras on household saving change in the rate of return of saving has two different and offsetting effects on the amount an individual chooses to save which of them dominates is an empirical question rise in the rate of return may motivate an individual to save more simply because it makes saving preferable to consumption it raises the cost of current consumption relative to saving in much the same way as rise in the cost of beef relative to chicken will tend to increase the consumption of chicken and reduce the consumption of beef this is referred to in the jargon of economics as substitution effect but there is another way in which rise in the rate of return may influence saving behavior perhaps the easiest way of explaining this is in the context of what is known as target saver if the goal of saving is to accumulate given level of wealth by retirement age higher rate of return on saving means that goal can be satisfied while saving less in the jargon of economics this is referred to as the income effect because the increase in income as result of the higher rate of return allows individuals to meet their goals while saving less which of these two effects dominates and what the ne t effect of an increase in the rate of return on saving is have been the subject of some controversy that the personal saving rate fell following the introduction of iras did little to encourage those who hoped that giving tax advantages to saving accounts would encourage new saving there is another consideration with respect to iras that needs to be taken into account in theory economic incentives are effective only at the margin at their introduction the tax benefits of ira contributions were limited to the first 2000 that limit increased to 5000 in 2008 7 substantial share of total household saving is accounted for by households that save more than 5000 it is unclear why benefit limited to the first 5000 of saving would motivate those who would save that much in the absence of iras to increase the amount they save rather it seems more likely that people in those circumstances would simply change where they put their savings in order to take advantage of the higher after tax rate of return 8 6 see crs report rl30255 individual

household saving the provision of the tax advantage results in reduction in federal tax revenues increasing the budget deficit and cutting the saving rate of the federal government for iras to raise the national saving rate any increase in household saving would have to be larger than the reduction in federal revenues empirical studies of the effects of iras on saving have come to different conclusions poterba venti and wise examined the financial holdings of similar households over time after the introduction of iras they found that the nonira financial assets did not decline as would have been the case if households simply shifted saving from nonira investments into iras they argue that the bulk of contributions to iras represented new saving9 but some of that increase in household saving was still offset by reduction in federal government saving in contrast engen gale and scholz found the opposite they begin by pointing out the many difficulties involved in separating new saving from saving that would have occurred anyway in particular they argue that one reason for the growth of nonira assets after the introduction of iras was the boom in the stock market they found that saving incentives have strong effect on the allocation of saving and wealth but that there was little or effect on the overall level of household saving10

funded that means that part of the benefits now being paid to retirees are funded from their earlier contributions and part are transfers from the working population to the extent that social security operates on payasyougo basis it tends to reduce aggregate household saving because it transfers income from workers who tend to be savers to retirees who save relatively less shift toward fully funded retirement system would require some combination of increased contributions and reduced benefits but the net effects of those changes on household saving are uncertain households might reduce their saving in order to pay higher contributions reducing benefits might prompt households to save more to make up for the lost future income it is also conceivable that some current household saving is motivated by uncertainty regarding the future of the social security program to the extent that any social security reform inspired greater confidence in future benefits saving might fall however any reduction in household saving that might result is likely to be outweighed by the increase in public sector saving resulting from either benefit cuts or increased contributions 11 9 james m poterba

saving as it appears in the national economic accounts is the sum of undistributed profits and capital consumption or depreciation how much firm contributes to saving is consequence of how it allocates its income it can either pay it out as dividends use it to replace its existing stock of capital as it wears out or becomes obsolete or can use it to increase its total net stock of productive capital how firm decides to allocate its income will be in large part determined by whether or not it is in an expanding or shrinking market if the market for firms production is increasing its dividend distribution to stockholders is likely to be smaller than would be the case for firm in stagnant or diminishing market the fact that households are the ultimate owners of the business sector implies that business and household saving rates are linked for example firm may invest in replacing worn out capital and further expanding its stock of capital rather than making large dividend distribution the increased capital stock of the firm raises its prod uctivity and profits increasing the wealth of the stock holding households if the goal of household saving is to accumulate wealth they may have reason to be indifferent between saving out of dividend distributions or ving the value of their stock holdings increase firms in an expanding market with increasing investment and profit opportunities will likely face less demand for dividend distributions than will firms in shrinking markets whether changes in business saving affect household saving is an empirical question there is evidence to suggest that business and household saving are closely interrelated bosworth for example found that business and household saving were closely related in number of countries in the united states he found strong evidence that variations in business saving influenced household saving decisions 12 if an increase in business saving causes households to save less then any policy intended to stimulate business saving might have little effect on total private sector saving g18g158g139g149g146g140g561g21g138g159g146g151g144g561 the public sector can also be source of saving saving by both the federal and state and local government is simply the difference between revenues and expenditures when the public sector is in deficit it is absorbing funds that might otherwise be available to the private sector to finance investment spending when the public sector is in surplus the excess of revenues can be used to reduce outstanding public debt debt reduction is equivalent to saving instead of buying the debt issues of other institutions government can buy back its own debt issues just as household saving may be affected by changes in business saving changes in the public sector saving rate can influence household thriftiness one way this might happen was initially suggested by barro 13 consider the case of an increase in government

regard the wellbeing of their children equally with their own it should not matter to them whether the spending increase is financed by increasing taxes or by borrowing if the new spending is financed by borrowing instead of raising taxes households will expect that at some time in the future taxes will have to raised to pay the increased interest on the debt or to pay off the debt knowing that if they are perfectly rational and if they are farsighted they will increase their saving so as to be able to meet that future burden if this assumption of extreme rationality were correct then any change in government saving would be completely offset by change in household saving there is little empirical evidence however to suggest that households react in this way to changes in government saving14 that is not to say that household saving is unaffected by variations in public sector saving any change in household income affects both saving and consumption consider tax increase which would raise the public sector saving rate in order to pay the increase in taxes households must either reduce consumption or saving how much of tax increase is paid by reducing saving may depend on whether the tax increase is perceived to be temporary or permanent the life cycle model described above assumes that one purpose of saving is to help insulate households from substantial variations in consumption over the course of their lifetimes if that assumption is correct an increase in taxes that is perceived to be permanent is more likely to be paid by reduction in household consumption permanent tax increase would reduce income over the course of an individuals entire lifetime and it is likely that lifetime consumption would be reduced as well an increase in taxes that is perceived to be only temporary is more likely to be paid by temporarily reducing saving if it were paid entirely out of saving then there would be net effect on the national saving rate one complication of any government action to increase public saving be it increases in taxes or spending cuts is that it may contribute to slower economic growth in the short run it is periodic dilemma for policymakers that the short run goal of promoting full employment conflicts with the longterm goal of increasing national saving

is the unified budget surplus or deficit for some purposes the budget is divided into two accounts one of these is referred to as onbudget and the other is offbudget the socalled offbudget account consists almost entirely of social security receipts and outlays other things being equal an increase in tax revenues will raise government saving it makes difference to government saving whether the revenues are in the on or offbudget accounts revenues that are credited to the social security trust fund contribute to government saving in exactly the same way as revenues that fund current federal

larger and the federal governments borrowing needs would be larger as well any reform of social security that shifts away from payasyougo towards more fully funded program would necessarily involve some combination of increased contributions and reduced benefits any such change would raise the public sector saving rate it might be that households would reduce their saving in order to meet the pa higher contributions but it is unlikely that any reduction in household saving would completely offset the rise in public saving g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 from macroeconomic perspective it makes difference who saves but how much households businesses and government save collectively affects the level of domestic investment inflows of foreign saving and the balance of trade economic theory offers single standard against which to assess the national saving rate as too high or too low however some of the consequences of how much or how little we save are often seen by policymakers as signs of economic weakness the three sources of domestic saving are house holds business and government households and the federal budget have been the targets of past efforts to raise national saving of the two economists have greater confidence in the latter the response of household saving to past efforts is still open to question and if household saving does not rise by more than any tax revenue lost the net effect on national saving will be minimal or could even be negative increased saving by the federal government is much more likely to translate into higher national rate of saving an increase in taxes may result in decline in household saving but any reduction in household saving is likely to be small relative to the increase in government saving
