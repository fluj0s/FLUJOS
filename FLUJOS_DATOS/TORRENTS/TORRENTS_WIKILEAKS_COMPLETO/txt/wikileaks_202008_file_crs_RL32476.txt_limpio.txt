defense foreign affairs defense and trade division us armys modular redesign issues for congress summary in what the army describes as the most significant army restructuring in the past 50 years it is redesigning its current active duty division force to 48 brigade combat team bct force the army national guard and army reserves will also redesign their forces in similar fashion the planned addition of active duty brigades and the conversion of army national guard brigades could provide larger force pool of deployable combat units to ease the burden on units presently deployed and possibly to shorten the length of time that units are deployed on operations the army has three other concurrent initiatives underway that it considers inextricably linked to its brigadecentric redesign rebalancing to create new high demand units stabilizing the force to foster unit cohesion and enhance predictability for soldiers and their families and cyclical readiness to better manage resources and to ensure ready force for operations these initiatives involve substantial cultural policy organizational and personnel changes some experts believe that modular redesign selective rebalancing stabilizing and cyclical readiness are prudent actions that should provide the army with additional deployable units and also eventually bring stability to soldiers and their families as long as additional significant long term troop commitments arise many feel that these initiatives could help ease the stress on both the active and reserve forces as the army continues its modular conversion it may have to contend with budget personnel and equipment shortages which could impede plans to build this new force as intended some also question if the army can afford both its future combat system fcs program and its modularity program the 110th congress might decide to examine these and other concerns in greater detail this report will be updated contents issues for congress 1

organizational redesign of its combat and support units to better meet current and future operational requirements this redesign effort as well as associated rebalancing stabilization and cyclical readiness initiatives are deemed important by proponents as they are intended to sustain both the active and reserve army through potentially long term manpower and resource intensive war on terror the overall issue facing congress is how well the armys modularity program is progressing and what are some of the issues affecting this major redesign effort also of critical importance is the armys ability to fund both the future combat system fcs program and its modularity program concurrently key potential oversight questions for the 110th congress can be summarized as follows how will the administrations proposed increase of 65 thousand soldiers impact the modularity program are some brigade combat teams vulnerable to enemy armor is the armys overlyoptimistic in its ability to fully fund modularity and the future combat system fcs how are the armys rebalancing stabilization and cyclical readiness efforts progressing and what are their associated costs how does the armys force generation model impact the manning and equipping of army modular forces the 110th congresss decisions on these and other related issues could have significant implications for us national security army funding requirements and future congressional oversight activities this report addresses the us armys redesign of its current force structure based on large divisions into one based on smaller

18000 soldiers and brigade consists of approximately 3000 to 5000 soldiers crs2 background what the army intends to achieve by modularization the army maintains that by organizing around bcts and support brigades it will be able to better meet the challenges of the 21st century security environment and specifically jointly fight and win the global war on terrorism gwot2 accordingly the army hopes that modularization will result in at least 30 increase in the combat power of the active component of the force an increase in the rotational pool of ready units by at least 50 army operating forces that require less augmentation when deployed reducing the requirement for ad hoc organizations creation of deployable jointcapable headquarters and improvement of joint interoperability across all army units force design upon which the future network centric developments future combat system can be readily applied reduced stress on the force through more predictable deployment cycle one year deployed and two years at home station for the active component one year deployed and four years at home station for the reserve force one year deployed and five years at home station for the national guard force and reduced mobilization times for the reserve component as whole3 2 army strategic planning guidance 2005 january 15 2005 p 9 in addition the army staff operations division g3

current issues lessons learned about modular forces in combat8 the army has compiled number of lessons learned about modular units in combat commanders maintain that modular bcts are better in interacting with other services tactical elements and that the permanent task organization of critical core components has eliminated multiple bosses thereby simplifying command and control modular bcts have also exhibited significant increase in situational awareness for brigade commanders based on increased battle command systems commanders also provided favorable comments on the enhanced bct staffs and organic combat support and service support elements within modular bcts commanders also identified areas in need of improvement additional earthmoving capability was identified as need as was more capability in the bcts armed reconnaissance squadron to fight for information commanders also maintain that additional intelligence analysis capability is needed in the bcts and that bcts lack organic engineer assault breaching and gap crossing capability of critical concern to commanders was the need for greater bandwidth capacity to support battle command systems the army plans to continue to evaluate lessons learned from combat experiences and to make changes to personnel equipment and force structure when appropriate the army has initiated changes for both the bcts and modular support units in terms of force protection navigational capability physical site protection as well as convoy security and improvised explosive device ied protection based on these lessons learned as well as independent analysis by other army organizations modular brigade combat team firepower9 an army study conducted by the army training and doctrine command tradoc reportedly concludes

without explosive reactive armor at extended ranges out to 6600 meters identify vehicle targets up to 5500 meters from the shooting platform and achieve desired effects against other armored vehicles with active protection systems proposed solutions to these deficiencies include modifying tactics such as employing volley fires to overwhelm active protection systems and developing better equipment

between fy2008 and fy2001 15 but modularity costs are spread among wide variety of army programs which makes it difficult for many to characterize an exact figure for army modularity fy2007 national

the full costs of army modularity modularity cost estimates17 army cost estimates have increased significantly since january 2004 when the army initially estimated that it would cost 20 billion from fy2004fy2011 to increase the number of active army brigade combat teams from 33 to 48 according to gao in july 2004 the army added 8 billion to reorganize the reserve component bringing the estimated cost for the entire force to 28 billion in march 2005 the army revised their figures and estimated that modularity would cost at total of 48 billion from fy2005fy2011 71 increase over the earlier 28 billion estimate in april 2006 the army once again revised its modularity cost estimate to 525 billion 41 billion for equipment 58 billion for military construction and facilities and 57 billion for sustainment and training18 this most recent total does not reflect requirements for creating modular forces for the armys recently announced 65 thousand soldier endstrength increase modularity versus the future combat system fcs19 there has been longstanding concern that the army will be unable to afford modularity and the future combat system fcs the armys 230 billion modernization program also competing for army resources are equipment reset20 and the costs of the wars in iraq and afghanistan program cost growth in both the modularity and fcs programs has also contributed to skepticism that the army will be able to afford both programs given current and projected budgetary pressures the army contends that modularity fcs and equipment reset are affordable while the army has made variety of program adjustments to continue funding modularity and fcs the armys main argument is based on the army receiving larger share of programmed defense resources noting that during world war ii 16

defense spending was 38 of gross domestic product gdp but in fy2007 defense spending was only 39 of gdp21 while it is likely the army will receive additional resources for modularity fcs and equipment reset there do not appear to be any advocates to increase military spending as greater percentage of gdp this apparent lack of support calls into question the armys underlying argument on the concurrent affordability of modularity and fcs nonbudgetary issues affecting modularization selected personnel issues22 prior to dods january 2007 announcement that it would increase the size of the active army by 65 thousand soldiers23 there were concerns that it would be difficult to fully man modular forces the armys decision to convert to modular force structure significantly changed the requirement for army officers the armys previous plan to convert to 42 modular bcts increased the armys requirement for officers by 4131 approximately 88 of this increase 3635 represent requirements for captains and majors this requirement for captains and majors has resulted in projected shortage of 2708 in fy2007 and an additional shortage of 3716 in fy2008 in these grades the recent announcement that the army would now create 48 bcts and additional modular support brigades will undoubtedly exacerbate these projected shortages in the grades of captain and major and might also create additional shortages in both officer and enlisted grades these potential shortages might significantly affect the ability of the army to adequately man not only bcts but also modular support units if this is the case the army might be hardpressed to create the additional 6 bcts that it needs to relieve the stress on the army equipment issues as previously stated the army is also faced with equipment shortages as it implements its modularity program according to gao modular brigade combat teams will require significant increases in the levels of equipment particularly command control and communications equipment wheeled vehicles and artillery and mortars24 command control and communications equipment are of particular concern as they constitute what the army considers the key enablers for the modular brigade combat teams for example by 2007 the army expects to have only 62 of 21 information in this section is taken from army transformation army g3 january 8 2007 p 31

yet announced the designation of the new units or where they might be stationed but given dods global basing strategy and 2005 base realignment and closure brac decisions it is possible that there might be difficulties in finding adequate facilities both at home and overseas to station these additional units rebalancing and stabilizing the force and cyclical readiness other critical army initiatives the army has three other concurrent initiatives underway which have been described as critical enablers in the armys brigadecentric reconfiguration rebalancing and stabilizing the force and cyclic unit readiness these initiatives involve substantial policy organizational and personnel changes and some observers contend that these initiatives may be more be difficult to achieve than the creation of modular bcts and support brigades as they require significant cultural changes for the entire army rebalancing the force in what the army describes as its most significant restructuring in 50 years the army is presently converting number of units deemed less relevant to current requirements into units more appropriate to the types of operations ongoing in iraq and afghanistan this change involves over 100000 active and reserve personnel and involves decreasing certain types of units while increasing others as described in table 5 below table 5 restructuring of

us army modular force for the 21st century the association of the united states army ausa march 2005 p 19 the army maintains that rebalancing will increase its capabilities sufficiently to relieve the stress on high demandlow density units this rebalancing is also intended to place more combat support and combat service support units back into the active component from the reserves to improve overall deployability and crs12 sustainability as well as to reduce requirements for immediate mobilization of reserve units28 stabilizing the force this initiative transitions the army from an individual replacement manning system to unitfocused system this stabilization initiative is applicable only to active component forces the objective is to keep soldiers in units longer in order to reduce historically high turnover rates of soldiers and their leaders and to foster unit cohesion and operational effectiveness29 in addition this initiative is intended to provide stability to army families and could ultimately save the army money as it could result in fewer moves for soldiers and their families cyclical readiness army force generation30 in fy2006 the army implemented new readiness system modeled on the cyclical readiness systems of the other services to replace its old tiered readiness system which according to the army created haves and haves not culture with most of the haves not consisting of army national guard and reserve units under this readiness system called the army force generation model units will move through structured progression of unit readiness over time intended to produce predictable periods of availability of trained ready and equipped units available for deployment under this model units will fall into one of three pools the resetretrain pool the ready pool and the available pool in the resetretrain pool units will not be ready or available for major combat operations but could conduct homeland security and disaster relief operations units in the ready pool are conducting training and receiving additional personnel and equipment to bring them up to full strength and units in this pool can be deployed to meet surge requirements if need be after passing the ready pool units are assigned to the available pool for one year where they become eligible to deploy for combat and other operations the army hopes to maintain 20 bcts 14 active and 6 reserve in the available pool on continuous basis the army maintains that the army force generation model for readiness will result in steadystate supply of 20 ready fullyresourced bcts and supporting units stabilized personnel to join train deploy and fight together in the same unit 28 us armys 2005 posture statement unclassified feb 6 2005 p 9 29 ibid 30 information in this section is taken from an army information paper congressional engagement army force generation june 24 2005 crs13 assured and predictable access to national guard and reserve units for operational requirements better ability to allocate constrained resources particularly equipment based on unit deployment schedules more predictable unit deployments for soldiers their families and employers and opportunity to synchronize unit readiness with wide variety of institutional army requirements such as professional schooling needed for promotion and military specialtyspecific training potential oversight issues for congress how will the increase in the size of army impact modularity congress may decide to examine how the proposed 65000 soldier increase will impact the armys modularity program while there are few details available dod officials have proposed creating six additional active component bcts about 21000 soldiers which would leave 44000 soldiers to be used for other purposes given personnel shortages in the existing bcts and modular support units it is reasonable to assume that an unspecified number of the remaining 44000 soldiers will be used to fill these shortages this scenario could result in the inability to create other types of units either functional or multifunctional that are needed to support the addition of six additional bcts another consideration is the equipment issue reports suggest that current modular forces are significantly short of equipment in wide variety categories these shortages combined with equipment loses from operations in iraq and afghanistan have compelled the army to adopt the army force generation model where units are only fully equipped when they deploy on operations these circumstances call into question the armys ability to even marginally equip new units for example new heavy brigade combat team would require the procurement of 177 armored vehicles and 870 wheeled vehicles of all classes if new army units are less than optimally equipped there is potential for significant increase in wear and tear on the armys existing equipment as more units use disproportionally smaller amount of equipment with this increase in equipment wear and tear will likely come an increased requirement for funds for reset and equipment replacement an expansion of 65000 soldiers might also have an impact on current and future basing plans new units will likely require additional training areas barracks and motor pools as well as family housing even if funds are available today to accommodate these needs the real estate at home or overseas may not be available and the requisite physical facilities may take many years to construct thereby precluding the armys ability to station these forces where intended crs14 infantry and stryker bct vulnerabilities infantry units historically have been vulnerable to enemy armored forces and even when equipped with antitank systems are considered to be at disadvantage when attacking enemy armored units these vulnerabilities however could be exacerbated when enemy armored forces are equipped with explosive reactive armor and active protection systems because infantry and stryker bcts constitute early entry forces they might conceivably come up against these enhanced enemy armored forces before the heavy bcts can be deployed and find themselves at distinct tactical disadvantage congress might decide to examine this issue of infantry and stryker bct firepower vulnerabilities with the army in greater detail such an examination could address potential organizational or weapons systems changes to provide enhanced lethality or changes to employment doctrine that might mitigate these bcts vulnerabilities the armys funding assumptions the army contends that it can afford both modularity and the fcs program but this affordability appears to be predicated on an increased army budget more in line with historical precedents while it is not unreasonable to assume that the army may receive greater share of the defense budget as it attempts to reorganize the army and at the same time modernize some consider it highly unlikely that the defense budget will increase relative to gdp to world war ii levels as the army suggests congress may wish to address the armys apparent assumption to insure that the army is not basing the funding of its modularity and fcs programs on what many believe are unrealistic expectations rebalancing and stabilizing the force congress might act to review in greater detail the armys rebalancing and stabilization initiatives the army has characterized these initiatives as critical to the modular transformation of the army but little is publically known as to how well they are progressing in terms of new units that have been created or how stabilization is affecting unit cohesion or family life for soldiers given that these two initiatives involve significant structural and cultural change for the army they also likely have significant budgetary implications that some feel are not adequately discussed as part of army modularity cyclical readiness congress may decide to examine the armys force generation model of cyclical readiness in greater detail this new model departure from the longstanding tiered readiness system will supposedly provide the army with trained and ready force pool of 20 active and reserve bcts at all times such change will likely have significant impact on how the active and reserve army staffs equips and trains its units and will almost certainly have budgetary and resource implications that congress might decide to review some argue that while it is beneficial to reduce readiness standards in wartime others maintain that it permits the army to under resource units in terms of personnel and equipment while advertising 48 brigade combat team army that in reality it does not have in terms of soldiers and equipment crs15 additional reading crs
