florida patient theresa schiavo who had suffered severe brain da mage the treatment of this patient brought new atte ntion to the right to die issue although the issue of right to die has many common themes the individual aspects of each case may have significant affect on the outcome of any proceeding while detailed examination of the schiavo case is beyond the scope of this report the case is briefly addressed under the topic of passive euthanasia one of the greatest scientific achievements of this century has been the development of medical technology to cure disease and to prolong lives before 1900 most deaths in this country were the result of communicable diseases such as influenza or pneumonia which could kill people of all ages1 today in contrast deaths due to these illnesses have decreased dramatically and most people succumb to chronic degenerative diseases related to age such as heart disease cancer and cerebrovascular disease2 these advances however do not come w ithout burdens chronic degenerative diseases tend to be manifested years befo re death occurs and because some medical intervention often exists persons with thes conditions tend to die more slowly and often painfully3 the advent of aids has also re sulted in an increase in the number of deaths which occur after extended periods of pain and physical disability consequently patients are in creasingly being confronted with decisions regarding whether to pursue or decline aggressive medical treatment further there are indications that some patient s are making decisions which

other means4 the increase in the number of endof life decisions has coincided with the expansion of patients rights and involvement in medical decisionmaking yet the legal community has not yet come to terms with the implications resulting from this increased patient autonomy state legislatures have ma only piecemeal attempts to confront endoflife decisi ons federal involveme nt has been minimal and the courts which have attempted to re solve some of these legal issues are faced with little precedent inapplicable legislation murky constitutional theory and clashing legal doctrines prompt resolution of these i ssues is frustrated by lack of political consensus among major societal institutions5 for those reasons the law in this area may be less reflection of coherent legal structure than reaction to the immediate concerns and societal pressu res surrounding specific cases for example majority of patients with terminal illnesses or their guardians will face decisions as to whether lifesustaini ng medical treatment should be refused or withdrawn allowing the individual to die6 by design or necessity most such decisions are made by agreement among interested parties such as the patient his or her family attending doctors and hospital administrators7 on occasion however because of fear of legal liability disagreem ent between the institutions and individuals involved or because of moral objections th decisions are made only after litigation in state or occasionally federal courtshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs3 8 loving v virginia 388 us 1 1967 9 griswold v

influential legal doctrines in the area of right to die is the constitutional right of privacy and of bodily integrity the limits of which are anything but clear under the socalled privacy cases the supreme court has established certain individual rights regarding the issues of marriage8 contraception9 and abortion10 the court has also entered the right to die area provisionally approving of the termination of medical treatment but setting limits at which the states interest in viab life cannot be overridden11 this decision however may be seen as an outgrowth of line of cases pr otecting bodily integrity other decisions by the court regarding the breadth of the right to privacy which are now generally called liberty interests under the fourteenth amendment12 bring the establishment of broader privacy based right to die into doubt for example the supreme court rejected an argument that statutes prohibiting assisted suicide violate either the equal protection clause or protected liberty interest under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment two united states courts of appeals had determined that severely ill patie nts have right under the fourteenth amendment to seek medical assistance to cause their own deaths both of these cases quill v vacco13 and compassion in dying v washington 14 were reversed by the supreme court by resolving the issues in quill and compassion in dying the supreme court effectively ended th likelihood that significant expansion of the right to die will arise through the courts it did not however preclude such expansion by legislatures b how broad is the right to die although the popular term right to die has been used as label to describe the current political debate over endoflife decisions the unde rlying issues include variety of legal concepts some distinct nd some overlapping for instance right to die could include at minimum suicide passive euthanasia allowing person to die by refusal or withdrawal of

instance the ited states court of appeals for the ninth circuit in reviewing an assisted suicide st atute characterized the constitutional right at stake as the liberty interest in determinin g the time and manner of death compassion in dying v washington 79 f3d at 801 as stated by the court however this broader right would seem to encompass any of the several ways of choosing death from termination of medical treatment to euthanasia 19 for instance while some persons would rest rict the assisted suicide debate to the terminally ill the distinction between the terminally ill and persons with incurable conditions was one of the first distinctions to fall when courts considered the issue of termination of medical treatment see cruzan v missouri 497 us 261 1990constitutional rights to termination of medical treatment apply to persistently vegetative patient note supra note 17 at 2026 thus one co mmentator has suggested that if right to assisted suicide is established for the terminally ill principled distinction could be made to prevent similar acts by persons who are handicappe d in physical pain or even clinically depressed yale kamisar supra note 18 at 748 1995 continuedbe an uncertain blend of assisted suicide or active euthanasia undertaken by licensed physician15 yet exercising one or another of th rights to die may have drastically different legal consequences some currently have lega l consequence some are violation of commonlaw some are violation of statute some may have contractual consequences some may result in civil acti on such as confinement some are currently protected by legislation and some may be protected by the united states constitution it should also be noted that the legal nd moral status of these rights may vary dramatically depending on the medical stat us of the individual patient while early legal discussions of the right to die were primarily associated with terminal illness more recent discussions have focused on medical situations involving high levels of pain futile prognosis diminished quality of life or even on mental suffering16 while some advocates would find little distinction between these various methods of termina ting persons life17 and would give the pa tient the discretion to decide what is sufficient basis for exercising that option other commentators find that maintaining distinctions between different situations is important to prevent abuses or to conform to professional societ or moral concerns18 one of the major policy arguments made regarding the right to die is the concern that recognizing right to die in one circumstance will be generalized to include other circumstances where different considerations may be relevant in other words there is concern that granting right to die is the first step down slippery slope19httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs5 19 continued concerns have also been raised that once right to die has been legally established society may begin to expect thos who are old poor or sick to take advantage of this right as matter of duty in this context it is not ed that many disabled people withdraw suicide requests when given adequate care id at 744 for example in mckay v bergstedt 801 p2d 617 nev 1990 thirtyone year old co mpetent nonterminal quadriplegic obtained court order permitting the removal of his respir ator despite clear

valued by civilized men to protect that righ t every unjustifiable intrusion by the government upon the privacy of the indi vidual whatever the means employed must be deemed violation of the fourth amendment 277 us at 473 23 381 us 479 1965 24 the facts of griswold are relatively straightforward griswold the executive director of connecticut planned parenthood was arreste d along with the medical director of the organization and charged as accessory to crime the defendants in question were accused continuedc the constitutional genesis the right to privacy in glucksberg v washington the supreme court evalua ted the holding of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit in compassion in dying v washington that the fourteenth amendment to the constitution protects the right of an individual to seek and obt ain physicianassisted suicide20 in doing so the court revisited controversial area of constitutional law the socalled right to privacy this relatively amorphous right was first substan tively addressed in the contraceptive area but has subsequently been expanded to incl ude other decisions of personal nature the right of privacy sought permanent home in the constitution for number of years first proposed in an 1890 article in the harvard law review by samuel warren and louis brandeis21 it reappeared years later in supreme court dissenting opinion regarding the fourth amendment22 however in 1965 in the landmark case of griswold v connecticut 23 the court established the concept of constitutional guarantee of privacy which emanated from the bill of rights even if it was not specifically identified in it in griswold the court struck down law which prevented the use of contraceptives the supreme cour t ruled that the right of married couples to make decisions regarding procreation was guaranteed by the constitution24 thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs6 24 continued of having aided and abetted the violation of connecticut law which prohibited the use of any drug medicinal article or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception the defendants challenged whether such law could be constitutionally enforced by state and the supreme court ruled that it could not as the right of married couples to use contraception was guaranteed by the constitution 25 justice douglas in the plurality opinion noted that the supreme court had previously found that fundamental rights could be extende d to establish penumbral rights or rights whose enforcement would protect the underlying right finding that privacy rights are contained in the first amendment the third amendment the fourth amendment the fifth amendment and the ninth amendment justice douglas held that the institution of marriage was protected by these penumbral rights and was thus exempt from such regulation 381 us at 484485 in concurrence justice goldberg found the right to privacy to be contained in the ninth amendm ent which states that the enumeration of rights in the constitution shall not be construe d to deny or disparage those rights retained by the people and to be applied to the stat through the fourteenth amendment 381 us at 499 justice harlan also in concurrence f ound that the contracepti on statute violated the fourteenth amendment as it violated basic values implicit in the concept of ordered liberty 381 us at 500 while justice white also found the right in the fourteenth amendment it is these last two opinions that would eventually come to be the basis for the modern right to privacy 26 410 us 113 1973 27 see 410 us at 152 28 the court found that in the first trimester th risks of abortion were less than the risk of childbirth and thus the mother was to be unrestricted in her ability to choose the less medically risky route of abortion during the second trimester the risks to the mother increase thus allowing the state to interven for purposes of regulating those aspects of an abortion which may affect mothers health and safety 410 us at 163 such factors would include the particular qualifications of the physician performing the procedure the facility where the procedure should take place and licensing requirements id finally in the third trimester when the fetus may be capab of life outside of the mothers womb and thus be viable the state may ban abortion completely idholding was supported however by variet of competing theories set forth by different justices which left the scope of the right to privacy in an unsettled state25 in the case of roe v wade26 the court expanded the theory of the griswold case to the issue of abortion the opinion of th court in that case focused on the medical and legal history of aborti on and appears to have relie d to large degree on the medical consequence of deci sions concerning pregnancy27 the court ultimately concluded that the constitution provided protection for aut onomy in reproductive decisions and set forth substantive struct ure to evaluate laws restricting abortion28 the court has subsequently established the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment as the basis for the protection of these and other liberty interests preferring to avoid the parlance of generalized constitutional right of privacy the holding of roe v wade was modified by the case of casey v planned parenthood ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs7 29 505 us 833 1992 30 the court in casey upheld the provision of information to women seeking abortions the twentyfour hour waiting period and the requireme nt that minor obtain the consent of parent or judge the court however struck down the section of the law which dictates that woman must notify her husband of her intent to have an abortion the court also upheld the medical reporting requirements on clinics and doctors performing abortions although requirement that women report why she di d not notify her husband of the abortion was struck down the core of the plurality opinion is section iv which upheld the right of woman to have an abortion but rejected the trimester structure established by roe v wade under roe states were prevented from imposing any restrictions designed to protect potential life on abortions performed in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy only in the third trimester could the state impose re strictions to protect potential life under casey however the court held that laws restri cting abortions to protect potential life could be imposed at anytime prior to viability if such laws did not pose an undue burden on the womens ability to have an abortion consequently the court found that certain of the abovenoted restrictions which applied during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy and would have been unconstitutional under roe v wade and subsequent supreme court cases see city of akron v akron cent er for reproductive health 462 us 416 1983 thornburgh v american college of obstetricians and gynecologists 476 us 747 1986 were now constitutional on their face 31 bowers v hardwick 478 us 186 192 1986 overturned by lawrence v texas 123 s ct 2472 2003finding that homosexual activity historically forbidden by legislation is not fundamental liberty implicit in the cept of ordered liberty and is therefore not protected by the 14th amendment in the cas of abortion for example the interest of individuals in making their own medical cisions and in making their own decisions regarding their family are cited as strong hist orical reasons for leaving to the individual the decision whether to have an early abortion thus an affirmative answer to this first question will generally serve to inhibit governmental intervention 32 id 33 see supra note 28 southeastern pennsylvania 29 but the central holding regarding the existence of liberty interest in choosing whether or not to terminate pregnancy is unchanged30 it is not always clear when the right to privacy is likely to be extended to activities not previously addressed by supreme court decisions if general test can be discerned as to when right of privacy or liberty interest can act as shield against governmental action it would appear to require that two basic questions be considered first is the activity to be regulated one which is deeply rooted in the history of the nation31 or second is it so central to personal autonomy that neither liberty nor justice would exist without constitutional protection32 in the abortion context however this protection appears to be subject to an exception if there is viable life being threatened by the activity33 when life is at risk because of protected activity such as when an abortion is sought in the third trimester concerns about right of privacy ma be outweighed by the need to protect that viable lifehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs8 34 in ancient times as today suicide was generally disfavored roman law generally forbade suicide and imposed penalty of forfeiture of property upon the estate of

note 37 at 349 1986 compassi on in dying v washington 79 f3d at 809ii five types of right to die this section will examine the legal status of five distinct issues concerning the right to die 1 suicide 2 passive euthanasia 3 assisted suicide 4 active euthanasia and 5 palliative care the hi storical tradition surrounding these will be examined with an eye to the supreme courts preference that constitutionally protected liberty interests be rooted in the nations history and tradition this section will also examine present statutor and constitutional implications of each of these areas it should be noted that some legal doctrines in th is area are settled while others are still evolving suicide 1 historical precedent from the sparse record of ancient times we can discern that the attitudes of the greeks and romans toward suicide were ambiguous34 by the middle ages however the influence of the catholic church wa s dominant and the practice was condemned as violation of religious and civil law35 english common law inherited this aversion to suicide and would sometimes impose posthumous deprivation of religious ceremony and significant penalties were generally directed against the estate of the person committing suicide36 there are indications however that suicide in the face of suffering was treated less harshly37 the founding fathers of this country on the other hand were uninterested in imposing punishment upon the innocent heirs to the estates of persons committing suicide38 and the legal tradition of punishing suicide was generally abandoned soon after the adoption of the constitution39 consequently in the american legal tradition there has been little or punishment imposed for suicide or attempted suicide40httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs9 41 compassion in dying v washington 79 f3d at 847 j beezer dissenting 42 see infra notes 8689 and accompanying text 43 for instance many life insurance contracts include exclusions for suicide compassion

and voluntary decision by physically able adult to starve to death 46 catherine d shaffer supra note 37 at 356357 for instance whether or not person attempts suicide is often affected by the quality of relationships with others id at 3572 state legislation although there are currently criminal punishments associated with suicide or attempted suicide this does not mean that these acts are without legal consequence the trend of modern american law has gene rally been that person who is suicidal should not be treated as criminal but as mentally ill41 further person who assists such suicide may be prosecuted under the laws of many states42 thus while suicide is not punished per it is not free of signif icant legal consequence43 in practice however the way in which person engaged in suicidal attempt is treated may vary based on context where suicidal attempt appears to be the result of depression or mental problems the state will generally intervene and the person will be confined until such time as their suicidal urges have subsided on the other hand certain public political acts such as fasting have sometimes been engaged in without government intervention nor is it cl ear that court is likely to intervene in the cases of terminally ill patients who take their own lives44 3 constitutional status although there are criminal penalties associated with suicide the threat of confinement might be seen as an infri ngement on ones personal autonomy as consequence of making an important and fundame ntal life decision thus it could be argued that the right to commit suicide should be found to be liberty interest protected under the fourteen am endment there has been little litigation of this issue in the courts however and supreme court dicta seems to favor the notion that the state has constitutionally defensible interest in preserving the lives of healthy citizens45 however the issue of the constitutional status of suicide of the seriously ill has not been squarely faced one of the strongest conceptual problems with constitutional right to suicide for the seriously ill is how such right would be limited suicide is often associated with depression and certain life events ch as terminal illness may trigger depression in some individuals and not in others46 on its face it is not clear how constitutional right to act on suicidal impulses related to

generally alien to the establishment of constitutional rights47 b passive euthanasia refu sal or terminat ion of medical treatment 1 historical precedent common law battery passive euthanasia or the refusal or termination of medical treatment by patient has historical roots in criminal law under common law doctrine an unauthorized touching was the basis for char ge of battery in the medical field this has been applied to prevent and punish th application of medi cal treatment without the full and informed consent of the indi vidual involved or itable representative48 even when the government seeks to im pose unauthorized medical treatment the courts have generally required that the government show compelling needs to impose such treatment49 2 state legislation treatment directives as the right to refuse medical treatment existed at common law and has with few notable exceptions50 generally been honored by the courts decisions by competent patients to terminate treatment do not appear to have attracted the attention of state legislatures however the situati on often arises that patient with serious medical condition will become so ill that he cannot communicate or he is not competent to make medical care decision this situa tion is prevalent enough that model code entitled uniform rights of the terminally ill act was developed and most states have adopted some procedur by which medical treatment decisions can be made by individuals in advance the living will option most states have statutes based on the uniform rights of the terminally ill51 which authorize an individual to execute treatment directive directing thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs11 52 see marguerite chapman the uniform right of the terminally ill act too little too late 42 arkansas law

arise most often because patients have not prepared such wills id 53 gregory gelfand living will statutes the first decade 1987 wis l rev 737 794 1987withholding or withdrawal of lifesustaining procedures52 these treatment directives referred to as living wills are generally only applicable when the individual sometimes referred to as the declarant or principal is terminally ill and death is imminent the required form of living will may vary from state to state but properly executed living will shoul d be easily enforceable in the state in which it was drafted these living will statutes also offer significant legal protections for instance those involved in termination of dical treatment are generally immunized by statute from liability for allowing patient to die further life insurance benefits which might be jeopardized by termination of medical treatment are generally protect ed finally the applicati on of penal laws which might prohibit suicide are generally voided by the operation of these statutes b appointment directives all states provide that an individual can delegate legally binding authority to another individual this delegation of authority is sometimes referred to as the delegation of the power of attorney durable power of attorney which is also provided by state statute is drafted so as to be effective when person is incompetent to make decisions for himself some st ates have specifically provided that these durable powers of attorney may be used to delegate the authority to make medical decisions even where such decisions may lead to the death of the individual thus using durable power of attorney pers on can appoint another individual to make medical decisions for him if he becomes incapacitated53 durable power of attorney often set forth in an appointment directive offers number of advantages over living will person who delegates health making decisions using this procedure doe s not have to anticipate every possible medical situation which may arise by utilizing power of attorney the medical treatment decision can be deferred until such time as the medical situation has occurred in this way the appointed deci sionmaker can evaluate the specific details of the medical situation before making decision an appointment directive can also contain directions to the ppointed decisionmaker descri bing what medical treatment should or should not be used as with li ving will the appointed decisionmaker need not be professional attorney rath er the appointment can be given to any competent adult with some exceptions whether they be family friend or other health proxy is similar to durable power of attorney but is generally contained within treatment directive as with the durable power of attorney the health proxy may be given specific instru ctions by the declarant regarding what medical treatment should be provided or the proxy may be given the discretion to make these decisions generally the only significant

right to refuse dical treatment has been addressed by legislation at the state level however even in those cases where medical directive has been completed or where the state law does not cover particular medical circumstance individuals or their guardians have still sought to make medical decision which will ultimately cause the death of the patient in this type of situation implementation of patients wishes might be sought under the fourteenth amendment of the constitution this was th litigation posture which lead to the case of cruzan v missouri department of health 54 at the time of the litigation in cruzan nancy cruzan lay in hospital bed55 in what is called persistent vegetative state56 in nancys case there was sufficient brainstem activity to control unconscious activities such as breathing and heart functioning and sometimes sh would respond to pain or noise nancy apparently went through sleep and wake cycles but when her eyes were open they moved randomly and she did not seem aware of he r environment her body was stiff she lay in fetal position and her arms and legs were permanently contracted medical opinion was that she would never interact significantly with the world around her again57 although nancy was able to take nutrition through spoonfeeding following the accident it was determined that artificial nutrition nd hydration were medically indicated thus approximately three weeks after the accident with the permission of both her parents and her husband feeding tube was surgically implanted in her stomach it is this medical decision which nancys parents sought to reverse with this feeding tube in place nancy cruzan c ould have lived up to another thirty years without it she would die most likely th rough dehydration at the time of the

pointed out in its opinion how this case differed from many previous medical decision cases nancy was not dead nor was she terminally ill and she could have lived up to thirty years in her condition essentially the decision as stated by the court was whether the hospital should be allowed to cause nancy cruzan to die by starvation or dehydration the supreme cour t of missouri considered the case as one of first impression for missouri nd declined to allow the hospital to withdraw nutrition and hydration cruzan v harmon 760 sw2d 408 427 mo 1989en banc 60 cruzan v harmon 760 sw2d 408 426 1988en banc 61 the court found that it was not constitutiona lly required that guardians or family be allowed to effectuate such decision cruzan 497 us at 284 rather the court determined that not only could state requi re that patients own personal wishes be examined but that absent clear and convinci ng evidence of such wishes state could decline to allow withdrawal of treatment to bolster this argument the court cited other instances in which state may require certai n formalities prior to implementing the wishes of an individual such as the requirement that will be in writing id however it does not appear that the missouri supreme court requi rement of clear and convincing evidence was based on the assumption that most individua ls would prefer life to death rather the requirement would appear to have been based on nonindividualized state interest in life irrelevant of the wishes of the individual id at 280281 as the court concurred that there was clear and convincing evidence of na ncy cruzans wishes the supreme court held that missouris generalized interest in the pres ervation of life allowed the state to refuse the guardians wishes to terminate treatment id at 28687 although the state of missouri has living will statute58 it was not in effect at the time of nancys accident nor did nanc write out such will the statute was relevant however because it specifically excluded the possibility that patients living will could provide for the withdrawal of nutrition or hydration tubes thus the missouri legislature appeared to have made decision that the withdrawal of nutrition and hydration was not within the realm of acceptable conduct even with the written consent of the patient59 based on this finding the missouri supreme court held that the states interest in protec ting life would require clear and convincing showing of nancys wishes prior to withdrawal of medical treatment60 the cruzan case because of its facts presented two legal issues to the supreme court first whether nancy cruzan had the constitutional right even absent legislative approval to consent to the withdrawal of nutrition and hydrati on second whether this right could be exercised by guardian and what standard of pr oof would be required to show that such course of action was th intent of the patient the supreme court ultimately decided that the state may requi re clear and convincing evidence of her wishes and as her guardians did not have sufficient proof the nutrition and hydration could not be withdrawn61 the supreme court did not technically decide the issue whether the missouri court could have act ed contrary to clear and convincing expression of nancy cruzan to withdraw medical procedures lthough as discussed later the implication of the case is that it could nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs14 62 355 a2d 647 nj 1976 cert denied 429 us 922 1976 63 the cruzan court noted that since the case of quinlan many other courts have found legal grounds to allow termination of medical treatment it would appear however that these cases have been based on two distinct lin of legal reasoning the first consistent with in re quinlan is the finding that there is constitutional right of privacy which protects decisions made concer ning lifesustaining treatment the second line of reasoning is based on the common law right to refuse medical treatment expressed as the requirement of informed consent under commonlaw physician who performs medical procedure without valid consent is performing battery and the law will act to prevent and punish such treatment hershley v brown 655 sw2d 671 676 mo app 1983 thus the argument is made individuals who wish to decline medical treatment even if such will result in their death have the right to do so 64 497 us at 280 65 the majority opinion states the following petitioners insist that under the general holdings of our cases the forced administration of lifesust aining medical treatment and even of artificiallydelivered food and water essential to life would implicate competent persons liberty interest although we think the logic of the cases discussed would embrace such liberty interest the dramatic consequences involved in refusal of such treatment would inform the inquiry as to whet her the deprivation of that interest is constitutionally permissible but for purposes of this case we assume that the united states constitution would grant competent person constitutionally protected right to refuse lifesaving hydration and nutrition continuedthe court in deciding the cruzan case first examined the case of in re quinlan 62 one of the first state court cases to examine these issues karen quinlan similarly to nancy cruzan had suffered severe brain damage as result of oxygen starvation and medical opinion agreed that she would not regain cognitive function karen quinlan unlike nancy cr uzan was both attached to respirator and provided nourishment by feeding tube and her guardians sought only removal of the respirator in quinlan the new jersey supreme cour t found that karen quinlan had right of privacy to terminate her life in its vegetative state this right however was not found to be absolute but wa s to be balanced against the rights of the state the quinlan court found that the states interest in preserving life diminishes as the degree of bodily invasion increases and as the prognosis dims ultimately there comes point at which the individuals rights overcom the states interest the court further found that the only practical way to give ffect to this right would be to let the guardian and the family use their best judgment in making decision63 the majority opinion of the cruzan court authored by chief justice rehnquist and joined by justices white oconnor scalia and kennedy appears to have implicitly accepted the primary holding of the quinlan and related state cases which was that patient has constitutional right to refuse medical treatment that sustains life64 however the language of the opinion did leave some ambiguity as to the general application of this right65 justice oconnor in her concurring opinion leaveshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs15 65 continued the second sentence of this quote appears to hedge the question as to whether refusal of medical treatment by patient should always be respected at least when the consequences may be dramatic arguably this may be because another case could occur where state interest would outweigh the patients liberty interest in fact in the supreme court cases cited in cruzan medical treatment was imposed over objection of competent patient based on an overriding state interest see washington v harper 494 us 210 1990state interest in maintaining order ove

their use in medical contexts has generally not been addressed by statute unlike most living will statutes advance directives may be us ed to address medical questions during any period of incompetence not just those pe riods association with terminal illness 67 see unif rights of the terminally ill act 3 9b ula 615 1980 68 generally states may not act so as to unr easonably burden the exercise of constitutional rights thus state may not er ect procedural barriers for pa tient to express his intent to exercise his constitutional right to refuse medical treatment cruzan 497 us at 305 j brennan dissenting while the supreme court was willing to accept requirement of clear continuedno such ambiguity and sets forth an extens ive opinion of the basis and scope of this right further justices brennan marsha ll blackmun and stevens in dissent also recognize the existence of this right only justice scalia in concurrence signals that he would have resisted the court s acceptance of this constitutional doctrine thus despite the ambiguous language contai ned in the majority opinion five justices oconnor brennan marshall blackmun and stevens appear to support the establishment of right to termination of medical treatment 4 implications of cruzan the statutes of the various states do not generally pr ovide for the implementation of any form of directive other than living wills and durable powers of attorney yet there may be other instructions which pe rson desires to leave regarding his medical treatment66 and cruzan appears to have upheld persons constitutional right to refuse any medical treatment even if the result will be death thus under cruzan an individuals right to refuse medical treatment may be broader than the rights which are granted by most state statutes for instance as noted earlier many states living will laws deal only with terminal illness and thus do not apply where the patient is in persistent vegetative state but in immediate danger of death67 theoretically an advance medical directive could be drafted wh ich set forth the procedure to be followed if patient became persistently vegetative but it mig ht not qualify under states living will statute the holding in cruzan however implies that state may not prohibit clear advance medical directive at least regarding lifesustaining technology68 thus to behttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs16 68 continued and convincing evidence it did so only afte r significant analysis consequently the implication of the cruzan case would appear to be that state may only act to facilitate patients desires and not to restrict or arb itrarily nullify them for this reason any state statutes or court opinions whic h restrict the use of advanced medical directives and durable powers of attorney might be held to overly burden patients intent and desire to refuse medical treatment 69 an issue not explicitly addressed by the court was the type of limitations that may be placed upon an individual appointed by the patie nt to make medical decisions such an appointment called durable power of attorney because the ppointment remains applicable even after an individual has become incompeten t generally leaves considerable discretion to the appointed individual to make decision for the principal such an appointment may be preferable to living will as the appointed surrogate can make detailed evaluation of the medical situation and make determination as to the patients treatment what is unclear is whether such surrogate could be held to best interest of the patient standard or whether the fact of the appointment of the i ndividual by the patient to exercise his or her constitutional rights would preclude any challe nge to the decision made by that individual the cruzan court stated that we are not faced w ith the question of whether state might be required to defer to the decision of surrogate if competent and probative evidence established that the patient herself had expresse d desire that the decision to terminate life sustaining treatment be made for her by that individual cruzan 497 us at 287 n12 concerns were raised prior to cruzan that living will or other advance directive executed in one state might not be honored in another state the cruzan case would appear to dispel most of these concerns assuming that an individual had cl early set out his wishes with sufficient detail to cover particular medical situa tion it would appear that any state court would be required to acknowledge the docum ent and give effect to it absent some indication of fraud or changed circumstan ce the imposition of specific technical requirements such as to the form or number of witnesses would appear to be inconsistent with an individuals constitutional right to refuse medical treatment as established under cruzan it is not yet clear what type of evidence state can require before it will implement directive which is not authorized by its statut it would appear however that written directive which complied with the procedural requirements of states living will or durable power of attorney statutes woul d be strong evidence of patie nts medical intent and would ultimately be enforced by court 70 the supreme court opinion in cruzan contained almost di scussion concerning why this particular type of medical technology provision of nutrition and hydration could be withdrawn even though the distinction betwee n nutritionhydration s upport and other forms of medical support engendered considerab discussion in the court below cruzan v harmon 706 sw2d at 42324consistent with cruzan state may be required to fully implement an advance medical directive despite its own statute69 question left unresolved by cruzan however is what type of medical treatment may be refused unde r the fourteenth amendment70 while refusing to be attached to respirator or heartlung machine is clearly within patients right to refuse treatment it is not clear that the same can be said for diabetic who refuses to take insulin an individual who declines the provision of antibiotics or an accident victim who refuses attempts to stem arterial bleeding of even greater concern is the possibility that an individual can attempt suicide and leave suicide note invoking constitutional right to resist medical treatment httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs17 71 much of the case law in the area of refu sal or termination of medical treatment to competent patients involves the refusal of patients to accept medical treatment because of religious beliefs these often involve jehovahs witnesses who are prohibited by their religion from accepting blood transfusions although court will often weigh religious belief in making its decisions many of these cases resulted

example the application of antibiotics in an otherwise healthy individual which cures dangerous infection and returns that individua l to sustained health would appear to be lifesaving technology on the other hand continual doses of antibiotics to fight off recurring infection in an elderly nursing home patient may be seen an lifesustaining technology id this question may be especially crucial to the lower courts in disposing of cases such as have arisen in the past where otherwise healthy indi viduals have rejected medical treatment for relig ious or other reasons71 there is little indication that the court considered whether these distinctions would still be valid after cruzan however close scrutiny of the language of the opinion reveals notion that there is difference between providing lifesust aining treatment to dying patient and lifesaving treatment to healthy patient lifesustaining treatment does not appear to be term of art but is used differently in different contexts72 for purposes of this discussion however we will define lifesustaining technol ogies as those drugs medical devices or procedures that by continuous application can keep an individual alive who would otherwise die within the near future73 lifesaving technology on th other hand could be defined to include those treatments which will keep an individual alive but need not be maintained on continuous basis because the underlying condition is arrested reversed or cured these definitions represent points on continuum and some treatments may appear to fall in between depending on the context in which they are provided74 under common law the right to refuse dication represents one of the longest standing individual rights bolstering the argument for constitutional right to refuse lifesustaining intervention where technology is lifesaving however courts have been less reluctant to override patients wishes pecially when the underlyinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs18 75 see supra note 71 it should also be noted th at there appears to be common law precedent for suicide in our legal system see thomas p marzan supra note 34 at 1 1985 arguably the refusal of lifesaving dical technology may in some cases represent form of suicide for instance where prot est fast becomes lifethreatening thus arguably the constitutional right that can be inferred from cruzan would not extend as far as refusal of all lifesaving medical technology 76 in re guardianship of theresa marie sc hiavo 780 so 2d 176 fla app ct 2001 77 unlike coma person in persistent vegetative state is not unconscious but is characterized by cycles of wakefulness nd sleep without cognition or awareness see supra note 56 and accompanying text 78 chapter 765 deals with health care advance directivescondition is medically treatable75 thus the question arises what did the court approve of and what lines implicitly were drawn let us speculate for the moment that the court assumed that the administration of artificial nutriti on and hydration was found to be form of lifesustaining technology as the withdrawal of all nut rition would ultimately kill any patient and there was indication that the nutriti on and hydration could be successfully withdrawn without threatening the life of nancy cruzan the court by inference appears to be sanctioning re fusal of lifesustaining t echnology however during general discussion of state s interest in preserving life and preventing suicide the court makes the following statement we do not think state is required to remain neutral in the face of an informed and voluntary decision by physicallyable adult to starve to death mphasis added this dicta appears to represent some concern that in different fact situ ation such as where health individual atte mpted suicide by fasting states may intervene such intervention which might include the use of medical technology thus appears to be distinguishable from the cruzan case thus the court does appear to recognize that some lifesaving as opposed to lifesustaining medical technology might be imposed on an individual despite his or her constitutional rights under the fourteenth amendment 5 the schiavo

laws however roughl parallel laws which protect minors and incompetent persons from exploi tation such as laws against statutory rape88 thus while state may decide that treatment would be more

the courts substantive due process under the fourteenth amendment liberty interest may only be infringed if there is sufficient state interest to justify such if liberty interest is deemed to be

right in hastening ones own death and consequently struck down the assisted suicide statute as restriction on fundament liberty interest109 the supreme court rejected this interp retation of the fourteenth amendment noting that the court moves with utmost care before breaking new ground in this area of liberty interests110 generally the court which distinguishes between heavily protected

the broad interpretation of fundamental ri ghts suggested by the circuit court in glucksberg i whether assisted suicide is fundamental rightfirst the supreme court rejected the argument that suicide or assisted suicide is rooted in the nations history and traditi on as noted above suicide and assisted suicide have long been disfavored by our judicial system and even the absence of criminal sanction for suicide has not prevented the legal system from using the civil commitment system as route to prevent suicide further there is deep societal resistance to suicide that includes many major religions and many groups associated with health care 113 the court easily dismissed the historical approach noting an almost universal rejection of the practice in the nations history114 as to the second element whether the right at issue is so central to persona l autonomy that neither liberty nor justice would exist without them th court rejected the applica tion of this broad language and distinguished cases regarding personal autonomy such as casey v planned parenthood of pennsylvania and cruzan v missouri department of health the district court in glucksberg which struck down the assisted suicide statute felt that the right to die was similar to the right to abortion that court found many similarities between the two s ituations including the intimacy of the decision and the susceptibility to untoward influence by other persons115 but unlike abortion which involves the competing interests of the moth er and the fetus the court emphasized that assisted suicide involves only the indi vidual and his or her own interests116 the banc court of appeals which upheld the distri ct court also relied heavily on language in casey which affirmed the right to abortion as one of the most intimate and personal choices person may make in their lifetime choices central to personal dignity and autonomy117 the supreme court rejected this use of casey noting that while many of the interests protected by the due process clau involved personal autonomy this didhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs24 118 521 us at 724 119 the court speaking in roe in 1973 made it clear that despite the

historical rejection of assisted suicide declined to extend the reasoning of casey to cover this practice this was consistent with the courts previously expressed relu ctance to extend the reasoning of roe v wade into other areas of personal autonomy119 the court had even less trouble dis tinguishing the instant case from cruzan v missouri department of health 120 which addresses the right to terminate medical treatment121 in cruzan the supreme court was developi ng that line of cases which derived from the right to bodily integrity the cruzan case was important because it dealt with the small but significant subcateg ory of informed consent cases that involve the refusal of medical treatment when it is apparent that withdr awal of the treatment would result in death that is separate issue from whether person can affirmatively request that another person cause his death all cases which have dealt with the right to die have recognized and maintained the distinction between active and passive medical intervention122 and the supreme court declined to eliminate this distinction ii state interests in preventing assisted suicideif the court had determined that fundamental liberty in terest exists in assisted suicide then it would have examined whether there was compelling governmental interest which was narrowly tailored to justify an infringement on this right however as the court found that there was fundamental right to assisted suicide the state needed only to show that its interests were rationally related to any infringement the court found numerous st ate interests including 1 general interest in the preservation of life and specific interest in maintaining barriers against suicide 2 an interest in avoiding situations where it would be to the advantage of third party to influence person to commit suicide 3 an interest in maintaining the integrity of the medical prof ession and 4 an interest in preventing acts such as voluntary or involuntary euthanasia historically the state has been found to ve legitimate intere st in discouraging physically healthy individuals from committing suicide 123 the district court in glucksberg argued that interest was insufficient when applied to terminally ill persons and suggested that legislature could define the appr opriate circumstancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs25 124 id at 1455 125 521 us at 729 126 yale

compelled to make such distinctions regarding quality of life125 unlike termination of medi cal treatment which by its nature involves terminal or incurable persons assisted suicide can be extended to larger population126 thus the argument has been made that societal pressure against devoting resources to the poor elderly infirm or disabled would resu lt in subtle or unsubtle pressure for those persons to seek assisted suicide rather than face an uncertain medical or economic future127 here the court held that state could rationally consider as too high the risk that an assisted suicide statute would be manipulated to encourage person to commit suicide128 the court also held that state may assert an interest in allowing its medical profession to set sta ndards to protect both its integrity and the trust of the populace129 many medical organizations consider doctorassisted suicide to be incompatible with doctors hippocratic oath nd would be concerned that such role for doctors would lead to conflict with their roles as healers130 there is also concern that if assisted suicide were considered trea tment option the progress in the ability of physicians to combat serious disease would be undermined131 finally the court held that permitting assisted suicide could start society down the path to active euthanasia both voluntary and involuntary132 as noted earlier advocates for physicianassisted suicide often do not distinguish between assisted suicide and euthanasia despite the potential for abuse where the patient does not control the final administration of the lethal treatment the court noted that allowing assisted suicide would create the potential for this line to be crossed without detection and that it would be extremely difficult to police or contain this distinction133httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs26 134 quill v vacco 80 f3d at 726 135 id 136 id at 725 137 vacco 521 us at 799 138 id at 801 139 80 f3d at 747 140 idb equal protection in quill v vacco separate argument was made that enforcing statute banning assisted suicide would discriminate against individuals who are terminallyill but are not on life support this argument relies on the fact that individuals with terminal diseases have constitutional right and often statutory right to request termination of medical treatment which will ultimately cause their deaths if terminallyill patients not on life support are found to be s imilarly situated then the denial of the right to assisted suicide is arguab ly violation of equal protection as with due process fundamental rights analysis equal protection analysis uses different standards by which to evaluate law depending on the class of people being discriminated against while high level of scrutiny is reserved for certain suspect classifications such as race or religion134 and an intermediate level of scrutiny is applied to certain others such as gender classifications135 distinctions based on other characteristics such as medical conditi on woul d generally be evaluated under rational basis test thus if court can ascertain any rational governmental interest in making such distincti on the law will be upheld136 the court in vacco noted that the class of individuals being discriminated against here termin ally ill patients not on life s upport would not constitute traditional suspect classification137 consequently court would need to look only at whether there was rational basis to distinguish between the treatment of persons who are on life support and those who are not the court noted that the distinction between assisting suicide and withdrawing lifesustaining treatment was widely recognized both legally and medically and comported with fundamental legal principles of causation and intent138 thus the court held that maintaining distinction between letting person die by natural means and causing their death was certainly sufficient rational basis to precl ude successful equal protection challenge d active euthanasia active euthanasia or administering leth treatment to person could arguably be treated in the same way as assisted suicide certainly the line between assisted suicide and active euthanasia has been blurred by commentators and the media in their discussions of the right to die139 for instance the phrase physician assisted suicide has often been used without distinguishing whether doctor was prescribing lethal treatment or administering it140 further the argument can be made that if person hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs27 141 id 142

washington 79 f3d at 839 j beezer dissentingthe right to selfadminister lethal treatme nt then he should have the right to seek such treatment from others141 the distinction between assisted suicide and active euthanasia is however both legally and practically significant and is maintained in almost all legal jurisdictions in the case of assisted suicide the actual fatal procedure is completed by the patient thus shielding the person assisting from direct legal responsibility for the death although many states have speci fic statutes that ban assis ting in suicide the act is not treated as homicide is rarely prosecuted and has relatively low criminal penalties142 the situation is different if another person actually implements the fatal procedure since person cannot generally consent to crime killing patient even if he asks to be killed is considered murder serious crime in all fifty states143 even prominent proponents of the right to assist ed suicide have been uncomfortable with advocating active euthanasia144 although others argue that maintaining distinction between the two would be difficult145 ultimately the most significant distinction between assisted suicide and active euthanasia may be the susceptibility of active euthanasia to abuse while person who provides patient the means of committing suicide may be in position to bring pressure on that person to do so the decision would ultimately lie with the patient and thus there is issue of consent where another party commits the act however the issue of consent must be ddressed and it may be difficult to establish such consent when the patient is dead because active euthanasia appears to be more susceptible to abuse than does assisted suicide state could reasonably distinguish between these two practices as matter of public policy enforcement prohibitions on active euthanasia may be difficult however as the practice appears to most often occur under the guise of palliative care146 palliative care another form of medical treatment wh ich can result in hastened death is palliative care palliative care is medical treatment to relieve pain but in terminal cases the escalating levels of pain medica tion can ul timately reach toxi c levels killing the patient147 this type of treatment is less controversial than the other categories andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs28 148 at least one judge has

in glucksberg has indicated that patient may have constitutional right to palliative care149 because palliative care can ultimately resu lt in shortened lifespan however it would appear to raise policy concerns similar to the other right to die issues150 further the line between palliative care and active euthanasia is extremely difficultto monitor and it appears that to the extent that unsanctioned euthanasia is being practiced by doctors much of it may occu r under the guise of palliative care while palliative care by itself may raise few policy issues its susceptibility to abuse may make it the most likely area where evasion of the law might occur iii who decides individuals guardians and the court medical decisionmaking regarding terminally or chronically ill persons has the additional complication that many such patients are comatose or so disabled that they are not legally competent to make health care decisions consequently the issue arises as to whether the various rights to die can be exercised by others on behalf of the legally incompetent individual and what standards should apply while virtually all the law in this area relates to the termination of medical treatment such situations could also arise if active euthanasia became legal option151 differing standards have been adopted by various courts to address the problem of discerning an unresponsive patients desires for medical tr eatment some courts attempt to discern the subjective intent of the patient either through 1 written documents such as living will advance medical directives or durable power of attorney 2 specific oral st atements 3 generalized i nquiries regarding patients prior attitudes and past statements or 4 attempts to discern what patient would decide if cognizant and given the re levant facts regarding her prognosis152 there is also another line of cases which focuses less on the subjective intent of the patient and more on the objective condition of the patie nt under this objective test the issue becomes whether the burdens of patie nts condition are such as to justify ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs29 153 see eg in re storar 52 ny 2d 363 420 ne 2d 64 cert denied 454 us 858 1981 154 relying solely on these two factors the trial court appeared to expand what would normally be considered proof of consent under commonlaw right to refuse treatment generally for there to be true informed cons ent to refuse medication patient would need to be specifically aware of the possible circ umstance of his or her physical condition and would need to indicate specifica lly what could or could not be done apparently the trial court faced with conflicting social mores was attempting to balance the benefits of continued treatment against the burdens of tinued treatment this attempt at balancing sometimes becomes even more overt under the objective test 155 see supra notes 5861 and accompanying textwithdrawal the opportunity for oppression and abuse however generally leads court to take hard look at the facts of such case using the above standards many cour ts have found ways to approve the withdrawal of medical treatment from termin ally ill or persistently vegetative patients some courts however have resisted these efforts especially in the more difficult cases where there is clear indication of the intent of the individual this for example was the case when the missouri supreme court refused to allow the parents of nancy cruzan to authorize the wit hdrawal of nutrition and hydration in cruzan however the united states supreme court did little more than decide that requiring proof of nancys intent by clear and c onvincing evidence was acceptable what is unclear is whether there are any alterna tive tests which may be overly burdensome to this newly identified constitutional right the subjective intent test prior to the supreme courts decision in cruzan many courts had determined that an incompetent patient who did not wish to have lifesustaining medical technology used indefinitely as evidenced by previous statements made by that patient when competent should have those wishes given effect153 for instance in the cruzan case in order to fulfill this subjective inte nt test the trial court had attempted to discern what nancy cruzans attitude was toward sustained medical interventi on the court found that nancy cruzan was vi vacious active outgoing and independent person who preferred to do everything for hers elf about year prior to her accident nancy apparently had discussions in which she expre ssed the feeling that she would not wish to continue to live if she couldn t be at least halfway normal based on these two factors the trial court found that nancy cruzan would have rejected her existing medical treatment154 as has been discussed previously155 the missouri supreme court reversed this decision holding that nancys intent had not been shown by clear and convincing evidence this standard which had been utilized previously in other jurisdictions was ultimately upheld by the supreme court but in doing so the court did not indicate whether more burdensome requirement th an clear and convincing evidence couldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs30 156 in contrast to missouris clear and convinci ng standard majority of the states that have considered the issue allowed form of substituted judgment

an eightytwo year old resident of nursing home and her only surviving relative nephew was appointed as her guardian ms conroy beca use of an organic brain syndrome had become increasingly confused disoriented and physica lly dependent as with nancy cruzan feeding tube had been implanted to provid nutrition and hydration when her nephew brought suit seeking termination of medical tr eatment ms conroy was confined to bed in semifetal position she suffered from heart di sease hypertension diabetes gangrene and variety of other infections on the other hand she could move her head neck and arms could scratch herself and would attempt to pu ll at her bandages medical doctors testified that ms conroy was not comatose or in chronic vegetative state although her mental condition was severely deteriorated 486 a2d at 1221 to resolve the case the new jersey supreme court tried to balance the interests of the state against the burdens of treatment the court identified four state interests in such circumstances preserving life preventing suicid safeguarding the integrity of the medical profession and protecting innocent third parties see satz v perlmutter 362 so2d 359 360 fla 1980 the court indicated that the burden of being maintained on lifesupport system could in some instances outweigh the interests of the state in refusing to allow the withdrawal of ms conroys feeding and nutrition the supreme court of new jersey noted the vuln erability of nursing home populations and the sometimes grossly inadequate care and concern that they receive the court further noted that ms conroy although resistant to medi cal intervention throughout her life had not specifically addressed or provided for the c ontingency of being incapacitated and in need of medical intervention ultimately the cour t found that there was insufficient evidence to support finding either that ms conroys wish would be to terminate treatment or that the burdens imposed by continued treatment outweighed the state interest in life consequently the court declined to condone the removal of the feeding tube even while contemplating the possibility that absent an xpression by the patient as to the withholding of health care court might allow the w ithdrawal of medical care by guardianbe required and thus did not explicitly address the degree to which state could hinder this newly recognized right156 b the objective test more difficult question arises if patient has left prior written or oral indications as to his or her medical wishes in the case of serious illness number of lower courts when confronted with patient who has left little or indication as to his intent have develope d rationales to objectively establish what the patient would want if he were aware of his circumstance

of conroy case157 the new jersey supreme court re fusing to terminate lifesupport for an incompetent but conscious patient158 established two alternative standards to the subjective test to be used when the patient in question had not made his wishes clear concerning the withdrawal of medical treatment the limited objective and the purelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs31 159 486 a2d at 1233 160 id 161 under the limited or purely objective test courts appear to be introducing the concept of balancing the benefits of life against the b enefits of death albeit still within the context of individual rights for instance the conroy court restricted its balancing to the physical pain being felt by the patient because of continuing treatment arguably this would limit the application of the test to the conscious pa tient as the value of life in vegetative state or in coma is outside of our daily evalua tion of benefits and burdens privacy bodily integrity pain and suffering would not appe ar to be of particular relevance to determination of what was in the best interests of vegetative or comatose patient 162 486 a2d at 1243 163 cruzan 497 us at 281 164 because the missouri supreme court focused on the subjective intent of nancy cruzan the cruzan court did not have the opportunity to evaluate any objective consideration which court might ultimately weigh in this area because these fundamental life decisions regarding dying have been debated primarily in the courts and not legislatures the focus has been on individual rights versus the states in terest the ultimate balancing decisions which society as whole might make on these issu have been avoided by many states ultimately society may need to reconcile indi vidual wishes the interests of the immediate family and the interests of society at large on the use of medical resources and this would appear to be role for the legislaturesobjective tests159 under the limited objective test lifesustaining treatment may be withheld when there is trustworthy evidence that the patient would have refused treatment and where the decisi onmaker is satisfied that th burdens of continued life outweigh the benefits for the patient160 under purely objective test where there is evidence of subjective intent not only mu st the burdens of tr eatment outweigh the benefits but the medical treatment must cau such recurring vere and unavoidable pain that administering the lifesust aining treatment would be inhumane161 under these tests the conroy court found that there was insufficient evidence to allow the withdrawal of ms conroys feeding tube162 the fate of the objective intent tests after cruzan is uncertain the tests are clearly not overly burdensome to the right of the patient to refuse treatment as they are only invoked when there is little or indi cation of subjective intent whether the test is sufficiently attentive to the actual wishes of the patient or whether the objective test instead bypasses the need for an expressed desire by patient and merely applies the desires of the guardia n the careprovider or the court however remain valid questions as the court pointed out in cruzan there is as much due process right to life as there is to death163 and there may be situations where guardians are not acting to protect the pa tient thus although unstated the courts cruzan decision by relying almost entirely on individual autonomy may signal that objective decisions which rely on thir d party choices do not have the same constitutional protections based on cruzan therefore state might ban its courts from considering any factors except the expressed desires of the individual164httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs32 165 the cruzan opinion upheld the missouri supreme cour t stating that missouri has established procedural safeguard to assure th at the action of surrogate conforms as best it may to the wishes expressed by the patient while competent cruzan 497 us at 280 166 see eg superintendent of belchertow n state school v saikewicz 373 mass 728 370 ne 2d 417 1977 the reasoning of this court was that the patient 67 year old profoundly retarded man would have refused trea tment if he had been competent and aware of his circumstance this holding has however been criticized as circular 167 the cruzan court summarily dismissed an equal protection argument that its holding would unjustly discriminate between the rights of competent patients and the rights of incompetent patients cruzan 497 us at 261 the court held this argument inapplicable because the issue being discussed was the choices made by competent person versus the choice made for an incompetent person if lucid but incompetent person could make his wishes known however the r easoning of the court in cruzan might be distinguished 168 this police power does not arise from the constitution but is an inherent attribute of the states territorial sovereignty 169 article i 1 of the constitution provides that all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in congress of the united stat unlike typical grant of power to states article i 1 does not grant to congress all legislative power but rather grants to congress only those specific powers enumerated in 8 and elsewhere in the constitutionc the nevercompetent patient an unaddressed implication of the cruzan opinion is that state may provide that only competent expressions of the desire to resist medical treatment need be honored165 thus arguably minor child or an individual permanently incompetent because of disease or mental disability c ould be effectively prohibited from exercising his right to have medical treatment withdr awn some state cour ts have allowed such individuals to have medical treatment withheld based on variations of the objective tests166 if however an incompetent patient were sufficiently lucid to make his or her wishes known an argument could be made th at to deny the right to have treatment withheld would be an qual protection violation167 iv the federal role congressional authority as discussed above the vast majority of regulation of the right to die has been done at the state level this regulation is an outgrowth of the states authority to legislate generally on all matters within their territorial jurisdiction168 the powers of the federal government on the other hand are limited to those enumerated in the constitution169 these powers have been interprete d broadly however so as to create large potential overlap with state authority for instance 5 of the fourteenth am endment gives the congress the power to enforce the guarantees of the fourteenth amendment including the right to duehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs33 170 state shall make or enforce any law wh ich

since the due process clause applies to cases litigated at the state court level that congress can regulate the manner in which courts consider cases invol ving the termination of medical treatment as discussed below however the supreme court has imposed significant limitations on congress authority under this provision the congress also has broad authority over the commercial interests of the nation including the power to regulate commerce171 the commerce clause discussed below is one of the most farr eaching grants of power to congress and would appear to allow the regulation of most commercial enterprises including hospitals and hospices however as discussed below limits imposed on the commerce clause may prevent the application of such power to all cases of termination of medical treatment final authority that congress has of ten relied upon is the spending clause172 the purposes for which congress may tax and spend are very broad and are not generally limited by the scope of other enumerated pow ers under which congress may regulate173 in addition the courts have found that congress has broad authority to condition the conferral of federal benefits while there may be limits to this authority the conditioning of the spending power is one of the more powerful means by which the congress can regulate certain beneficiaries of federal dollars 1 congress authority under 14th amendment 5 the 14th amendment provides that state may not deprive person of their right to life liberty or property without due process of law174 section 5 of the 14th amendment provides that congress has the au thority to enforce the provisions of the 14th amendment175 the supreme court however requires that legislation enacted under 5 of the fourteenth amendment be congruent and propor tionate to pattern and history of constitutional violations176 for instance since only states are limited by restrictions of the 14th amendment constitutional violations generally only occurhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs34 177 the court has long held that the fourteen th amendment provides that congress has the authority to regulate states but not individuals see shelley v kraemer 334 us 1 13 1948 178 united states v mo rrison 529 us 598 2000 179 529 us at 619620 180 521 us at 526 181 529 us at 626when the actions are undertaken by state actors behavior or activ ities of private parties acting in their indi vidual capacities are not genera lly found to violate of the due process clause of the 14th amendment and are not generally vulnerable to congressional regulation under 5177 thus identifying state actors in the context of the termination of medical treatment becomes important in determining whether particular legislation is congruent and proportionate as the legislation must be in response to history and pattern of constitutional violations by such actors for instance in united states v morrison 178 the court evaluated 42 usc 13981 which provides federal private right of action for victims of gendermotivated violence against their attackers the court considered whether the statute was within the power of the congress to enact under 5 of the fourteenth amendment cons idering that the suit was brought against private person not against the state the plaintiff attempted to avoid the problem of state action by arguing that there is pervasive bias in various state justice systems against victims of gendermotivated violence and that providing federal privat right of action was an appropriate means to remedy this state acti on although the court found that this bias was supported by voluminous congressional record179 the court nonetheless rejected this argument finding that the remedy did not meet the city of boerne test of congruence and proportionality to the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end180 since the federal private right of action was not aimed at the allegedly discriminatory actions by state officials but was instead directed against the individual engaging in the violence itself the court found that the action could not be supported by reference to the fourteenth amendment181 thus the power of congress as regards the termination of medical treatment would appear to be limited base d on the nature of the proposal for instance consider proposal that is intended to limit or restrict s courts power to direct that patients medical treatment be terminated such as requiring prove of clear and convincing evidence that patient would want treatment withdrawn at first glance such proposal might seem narrowly focused to ddress just state ac tion as it is limited to disputed cases that are tr ied before judges who as will be discussed later are state actors however relatively small number of disputed cases involving termination of medical treatment are resolved in court so it may be difficult to establish pattern and history of constitutional violations based only on disputed cases thus it may be important for purposes of identifying patte rn and history of constitutional violations to determine if constitutional violations of patients rights sometimes occur outsidehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs35 182 where the right at issue is fundamental right the court has allowed the introduction of evidence related to

procedural due process rights which are implicated by the instant proposal fall more closely into that category 183 when the rights of suspect class ar at issue which are protected by higher standard

incapacitated patients are considered suspect class 184 of course in some instances state actors ca n be involved in these decisions for instance if state hospital sought to remove nutrition and hydration from patient over whom it had guardianship there would clearly be state actionof the courtroom182 the first step to this process would be identifying likely scenarios outside the courtroom where state actors would be involved in these decisions183 it may also be important for pur poses of congruence and proportiona lity to identify any state actors who are involved in these disputed cases apart from the judges since it can be argued that under morrison directing legislative fix against nonstate actors is not congruent and proporti onate if these actors are not the source of constitutional violations arguably in the hypothetical proposal the burden of proving case by clear and convincing ev idence will fall upon patient health proxy of guardian if none of these parties are state actors however then it might be argued that they are inappropriate targets for such legislation state action in morrison the court found voluminous cong ressional record of bias based on state actions regarding the investigation and prosecution of criminal sex offenses suggesting the state activities may have been in violation of the 14th amendment however unlike the criminal cases that were at issue in morrison most termination of medical treatment decisions are not initiated by the state nor are they generally resolved in courtroom thus the question arises as to whether the congress can rely on possible abuses in the termination of medical treatment outsi the courtroom to justify the exercise of its 14th amendment authority despite the fact that the medical treatment or the termination of such trea tment is generally initiated by designated proxies or appointed guardians one typical scenario that can be analyzed is where health proxy or guardian seeks to have treatment withheld from patient who is being treated in private hospital or hospice184 private parties can sometimes be state actors if 1 their actions rely on governmental assistan ce and benefits 2

covenant found to be violation of 14th amendment the incidents of governmental authority185 it does not appear however that this standard would be met by any of the typi cal parties in decision to withhold medical treatment consider for instance health proxy authorized by patient to make medical decisions while the parameters of this relationship are certainly amenable to regulation by state law the decision to appoint guardian with certain powers would be the act of the patient and not of the state further the proxy can generally direct the withdrawal of medical treatme nt without going to court and it does not appear that the proxy would be perfor ming traditional governmental function in doing so finally whatever injury might be at issue it does not appear to be aggravated by the incidents of gove rnmental authority since indicia of governmental interest would appear to be present here health proxy would not appear to qualify as state actor closer question is the constitutional st atus of guardian who was appointed not by the patient but by court for inst ance courts have held that the appointment of guardian is state action and must co mply with the dictates of procedural due process186 thus the parameters of the appoin tment process by state would appear amenable to constitutional challenges or legislative oversight by the congress however once guardian has been appointe d most courts have held that since guardians legal obligation is to represent the interests of their ward that the guardian is not state actor and thus is onl bound by statutory not constitutional constraints187 the next question is whether state action arises if health proxy guardian or other party initiates legal proceeding regard ing the termination of medical treatment it is certainly the case that the behavior of judge in case is state action for purposes of due process188 or suit brought by private pa rty in court room may give rise to state action if judicial enforcement of th ruling is seen to be in violation of the constitutional rights of another189 however in typical proceeding to terminate medical treatment for an incompetent patient it is unlikely

500 us 614 62728 191 thus for instance if state law authorized parent to countermand decision to terminate medical treatment of an adult patient an ar gument might be made that the parent was imbued with the authority of state actor see shelley v kramer 334 us 1 1948 192 since the legal position of opposing partie s only becomes state action upon enforcement by the courts the following analysis will focus on the court as state actor 193 see john d hodson judicial power to or der discontinuance of lifesustaining treatment 48 alr4th 67 2005 kristine cord ier karnezis patients right to refuse continuedascribed to health proxy seeking to terminate treatment since it is the patients decision to have that person speak for them nor as noted earlier would the behavior of even an appointed guardian in court room typically be found to be state action unless it was determined that the guardian was acting in collusion with the government190 generally only actions by private parties opposing the exercise of patients right to pursue termination of medical treatment would be amenable to such an analysis191 thus it would appear that the only stat actor in the court room in these cases would be the judge although as noted certa in opposing parties ma also take on this character based on judicial enforcement of their legal positions as noted 5 of the 14th amendment can only be exercised if cong ress can establish pattern and history of constitutional violations since only st ate actors can violate the constitution this determination would seem to be limited to instances in which the rights of incapacitated patients are bein g violated in the courtroom by judge or opposing parties the next step in evaluating where there is history and pattern of constitutional violations would be determining which constitutional rights these state actors are most likely to have violated in termination of medical treatment cases the principal constitutional right at issue is the right to direct ones medical treatment thus under this constitutional theory establishing ba sis for exercise of congress power under the 14th amendment would appear to require tablishing record of state judges disregarding an individuals expressed wi shes regarding medical treatment whether based on the petition of the pa tient or in response to th request of opposing parties192 in the alternative one might consider the patients right to pro cedural due process in proceeding regarding termination of medical treatment and whether such due process rights have been respected by courts b substantive due process rights of incapacitated patients the number of reported court decisions regarding the termination of medical treatment appears to number in the low hundreds193 and despite the existence ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs38 193 continued treatment allegedly necessary to sustain life 93 alr3d 67 2005 194 see kenneth r thomas the schiavo case legal issues crs report rl32830 195 see text accompanying notes 153164 supra some high profile cases where the subjectiv intent of patient was disputed such as the theresa schiavo case194 it is not clear that significant number of these cases involved seriously disputed testimony or other evidence thus for congress to establish record of constitutional violations by judges in these cases it would need to be shown that the courts disregarded th expressed intent of the patient in some significant number of cases it may however be difficult at least based on reported decisions to establish numerous examples of past constitutional violations arising from court orders directing medical treatment be terminated for instance review of these cases does not reveal instances where court rejected clearly expressed intentions such as written living wills or advance directives instead the cases principally concern situations where there was some oral or other evidence regarding subjective intent or where the decision was made based on an objective intentstandard evaluating the best interests of the patient195 there is case law indicating that application of either subjective intent standard or an objective intent standa rd is on its face violation of the 14th amendment thus it would appear that in order for congress to establish that significant number of patients rights to direct their medical treatment under the 14th amendment were being violated it would need to establish that the factual decisions in some portion of these cases were dis puted and that various courts evidentiary conclusions were incorrect it may be diffi cult however for congress to establish that significant number of persons wishes were disregarded where written directives were left since even the courts sitting in these cases generally have difficult time discerning persons intent even if congress could establish that th ere is pattern and history of courts disregarding the wishes of patients then court would need to determine whether the hypothetical proposal would be congru ent and proportionate to the problem limiting or restricting the ability of court to order termination of medical treatment would appear to have the effect of increasing the chance that persons desire to have medical treatment continued would be honored however the legislation would also appear to have the negative effect of bur dening the right to direct that medical treatment be discontinued in order to justify this disparity congress might need to establish record that the courts evaluating such cases are more inclined to incorrectly ascertain the intent of incompetent patients who wish for the continuation of such treatment than they are of patients who wish for termination further the fact that this burden falls on private party the patient as represented by the health proxy or guardian rather than on state actor may under morrison also detract from thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs39 196 thus while federal court review of state termination of medical treatment cases under prevailing state standards might be seen as di rected at states not adequately protecting patients

patients substantive due process right to direct their medical treatment but should also be characterized as involving right not to be deprived of life by the state without due process of law197 under this argument to the extent that guardian is seeking particular course of medical treatment and to the extent that the case is being entertained in the court system such c ourse of action must be done in accord with due process further the argument can be made that congress using its 5 authority can act to ensure that due process rights are protected although the supreme court has often addressed the requirements of due process as regards deprivation of liberty or property there is little case law relating to the requirements of due process as it relates to the deprivation of life in the civil context198 for instance the argument might be made that the hypothetical proposal is consistent with due pro cess requirements since it requires more careful analysis of course of action which may

the objective intent tests after passage of the instant proposal is unclear since the proposal appears to rely exclusiv ely on the subjective intent of the patient objective decisions which rely on

denaturalization proceedings202 civil commitment proceedings203 and proceedings for the termination of parental rights204 it should be noted however that the cases in which the court has held that clear and convincing evidence is required are ge nerally where governments seek to take unusual coercive action against an individual205 the instant proposal by contrast would appear to involve the federal govern ment seeking to protect the due process interests of an individual against the petition of their guardian or other private party the supreme court held in cruzan that states interest in protecting an incapacitated patient could be the basis for the state to raise the level of evidence of the patients intent however it does not appear that any court has held that states are constitutionally required to raise the standard for withdrawal of medical treatment thus the question arises as to whether congress could establish that there is pattern and history of incapacitated patien ts being denied procedural due process rights so that congress can legislate clear and convincing standard under 5 as noted previously state courts currently use variety of standards in evaluating cases involving withdrawal of dical treatment including bot h subjective intent decided by either preponderance of or clear and convincing evidence and the objective test206 often associated with best interest sta ndard it does not appear however that any court has held that using these standards violates the incompetent patients constitutional rights thus it would appear that congress would have to establish that courts have unconstitutionally ignored the procedural due process rights of individuals in specific cases thus viol ating their due process righ ts as noted above it may however be difficult to establish that si gnificant number of patients wishes were disregarded by court in cases where written directives were left finally courts would need to determine

wher the treatment is withdrawn certainly to the extent that constitutional violations were shown to exist in the application of the current sta ndards to particular situations the raising of the standard of evidence would make such deprivations more unlikely on the other hand court in evaluating the congruence and proportiona lity of the proposal might also note that raising the evidentiary standard could lead to more situations where patients wishes to terminate medical treatment were not implemented in essence proposal such as requiring clear and convincing evidence in order to withdraw treatment would appear to raise the protection for one constitutional right while limiting the other this might undercut an argument that the constitutiona l rights of the incap acitated patients were being protected by the instant proposal 2 the commerce clause an alternative constitutional basis for the proposed act might be the power of the united states congress to regulate co mmerce as noted above the united states constitution provides that the congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the various states207 this power has been cited as the constitutional basis for significant portion of the laws passed by the congress over the last fifty years and it currently represen ts one of the broadest bases for the exercise of congressional powers starting in 1937 with the decision in nlrb v jones laughlin steel corporation 208 the supreme court held that the congress has the ability to protect interstate commerce from burdens and obstructions which affect commerce transactions in the nlrb case the court upheld the national labor relations act finding that by controlling industrial labor strife the congress was preventing burdens from being placed on interstate commerce209 thus the court rejected previous distinctions between the economic activities such as manufacturing which led up to interstate economic transactions and the interstate transactions themselves by allowing congress to regulate activities which were in the stream of commerce the court also set the stage for the regulation of variety of other activities which affect commerce subsequent court decisions found that congress had consider able discretion in determining which activities affect interstate commerce as long as the legislation was reasonably related to achieving its goals of regulating interstate commerce210 thus the court found that in some cases events of purely local commerce such as local working conditions might

may 8 1995 219 the court failed to note that to some exte nt the three categories are intertwined for instance the first category the regulation of streams or channels of commerce allows regulation of the creation movement sale and c onsumption of merchandise or services but the initial extension of the streams of commerc analysis by the court to intrastate trade was justified by the effect of these other activities on commerce see nlrb v jones laughlin 301 us 1 31 1936 similarly the second category which allows the regulation of such instrumentalities of commerce as planes trains or trucks is also based on the theory that threat to these instrume ntalities affects commerce even if the effect is local in nature southern railway company v united states 222 us 21 2627 1911regulation of intrastate rail traffic has substantial effect on interstate rail traffic thus the final category identified by the court appears to be catchall for all other activities which substantially affect commerce 220 514 us at 559regulation of interstate commerce and thus would be susceptible to regulation211 the court has also held that an activity which in itself does not affect interstate commerce could be regulated if all such activities taken together in the aggregate did affect interstate commerce212 under the reasoning of these cases the court has upheld many diverse laws including laws regulating production of wheat on farms213 racial discrimination by businesses214 and loansharking215 more recent cases have found some limits to these powers in the 1995 case of united states v lopez216 the supreme court struck down the gunfree school zone act of 1990 in which congress had made it federal offense for any individual knowingly to possess firearm at place that the individual knows or has reasonable cause to believe is school zone217 the lopez case was significant in that it was the first time since 1937 that the supreme cour t struck down federal statute purely based on finding that the congress had exceeded it powers under the commerce clause218 in doing so the court revisited its prior cases sorted the commerce power into three categories and asserted that congress could not go beyond these three categories 1 regulation of channels of commerce 2 regulation of instrumentalities of commerce and 3 regulation of ec onomic activities which affect commerce219 within the third category of activitie s which affect commerce the court determined that the power to regulate co mmerce applies to intrastate activities only when they substantially affect commerce220 still

provisions in group health plans nd health insurance coverage that impose certain preexisting condition exclusions impact the ability of employees to seek employment in interstate commerce thereby impeding such commerce 2 health insurance coverage is commercial in na ture and is in and affects interstate commerce 3 it is necessary and pr oper exercise of congressional authority continuedguests the court also recognized that while some intrastate activities may by themselves have trivial effect on commerce regulation of these activities may be constitutional if their regulati on is an essential part of larger economic regulatory scheme thus the court even approved what has been perceived as one of its most expansive rulings wickard v filburn which allowed the regu lation of the production of wheat for home consumpti on since the aggregate of the home grown wheat which was regulated would have substantial impact on the market for wheat221 the court has since noted that the aggregation princi pal has only been app lied to regulation of economic activities222 regulation of how hospita ls and hospices care fo r incapacitated patients however would appear to fall easily into the power of congress to regulate commerce the activity regulation of the care of patients by hospitals who are providing such care as commercial service would clearly be commercial in nature223 the care of patients in hospital involves th use of significant amount of goods that travel in interstate commerce224 and most hospitals treat outofstate patients225 since the activity of running hospitals and hospices are economic in nature the substantial effects test can be met by aggregation of these activities by all regulated hospitals the argument could be made that congress has rational basis to find that regulating the termination of medical treatment woul d preserve the integrity of the medical industry and consequently the market fo r such services consequently it would appear that congress has significant aut hority to regulate hos pitals and hospices226httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs44 226 continued to impose requirements under this title on group health plans and

230 317 us 111 1942thus for instance it would appear that congress would be within its authority to require that hospitals and hospices in providing services to incompetent patients follow certain standards regarding how such patients are treated while such power would still be limited by other constitutional constraints such as the right to direct ones own medical treatment it would appear that congress could still regulate within those constitutional parameters so for instance congress might have the authority to require that hospitals or hospices prior to terminating medical treatment for patient seek court order showing by clear and convincing evidence that this was this wish of the patient if congress were to impose such requirement on hospitals and hospices however the guardians of patients might s eek to have those people discharged from hospital and brought home to avoid these restrictions thus the question arises as to whether such regulation could be exte nded beyond hospitals and hospices to reach the actions of private individuals at fi rst impression regulation of the health care of private individuals who are not being cared for in commercial setting would not be amenable to federal regulation since the activity was not economic the effects could not be aggregated and it would be difficult to show that the economic impact of such activity had substantial impact on commerce the question could be asked however wh ether regulation of individuals who sought to terminate medical treatment outside of hospital or hospice setting could be reached as necessary and proper part of larger regulatory scheme in the case of gonzales v raich 227 the court evaluated an as applied challenge to the controlled substances act as regard s obtaining manufacturing or possessing marijuana for medical purposes the case was brought by two seriouslyill residents of california who used marijuana in co mpliance with the california compassionate use act of 1996228 the challenge was based on the argument that the narrow class of activity being engaged in the intrasta noncommercial cultiv ation and possession of cannabis for personal medical purposes as recommended by patients physician pursuant to valid california state law did not have substantial impact on commerce and thus could not be regulated under the commerce clause229 in upholding the application of the controlled substances act in the raich case the court relied on its decision in wickard v filburn 230 which held that even if appellees activity be local and though it ma not be regarded as

have on the illegal market for marijuana232 of even greater concern was that diversion of marijuana grown for medicinal purposes for other uses would frustrate the federal interest in eliminating commercial transactions in the interstate market233 in both cases the court found the regulation was within congress commerce power because the congress had rational basis to determine that production of commodity meant for home consumption be it wheat or marijuana could have s ubstantial eff ect on supply nd demand in addition since exempting the use of medi cal marijuana could undercut enforcement of the controlled substances act the court found that the application in this case was within congress authority to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper234 to effectuate its powers the use of the commerce clause to regulate an individual or their guardian seeking to terminate medical care outside of hospital or hospice setting however is not as clear as it was under wickard and raich unlike these cases it is not apparent that the treatment of patients outside of medical setting has any significant impact on the market for medical services in general for congress to regulate an entire class of activities it must find that the t otal incidence of ch practice poses threat to national market235 here congress could arguab ly exclude patients outside of hospital or hospice settings without undercutting the goal of preserving the integrity of the medical community what might be more relevant question is one alluded to by the majority but directly addressed by justice scalia in his concurrence in raich to what extent is the challenged regulation of non economic activity necessary and proper to the larger economic scheme in raich the fungibility of marijuana served to make regulation of locally grown marijuana vital to the larger regulatory scheme in the instant case however if patient is not in hospital it does not appear that the regulation would have any effect on enforcement of th larger economic scheme although raich held that congress need only have rational basis to discern an economic impact from noneconomic activities regula tion of this

legislation prevents federa l monies from being paid for any goods or services related to assisted icide euthanasia or mercy killing the law also prevents use of federal funding to support legal

and safety because these terms are not further defined by the statute we must look to the purpose of the csa to understand their scope the csa was intended to keep legally available controlled substances within lawful channels of distribu tion and use it sought to prevent both the trafficking in these substances for unauthorized purposes and drug abuse there is evidence that congress in the csa intende d to displace the states as the primary regulators of the medical profession or to override states determination as to what constitutes legitimate medical practice in the absence of federal law prohibiting that practice indeed the cs is essentially silent with regard to regulating the practice of medicine that in volves legally available drugs except for certain specific regulations dealin g with the treatment of addicts the state of oregon has reached the cons idered judgment that physicianassisted suicide should be authorized under narrow conditions and in compliance with certain detailed procedures under these circumstances we have concluded that the csa does not authorize dea to prosecut or to revoke the dea registration of physician who has assisted in icide in compliance with oregon law the doj press release noted that physici ans who dispense controlled substances beyond the course of profe ssional practice may be subject to criminal penalties and that those who engage in conduct which ma threaten the public health and safety may have their authority to prescribe c ontrolled substances revoked although the press release did not provide citations for these standards the phrase the course of professional practice may be found in 21 cfr 130604 which provides that prescription for controlled substance to be effective must be issued for legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of his professional practice an order purporting to be prescription issued not in the usual course of professional tr eatment is not prescription within the meaning and intent of section 309 of the act 21 usc 829 and the person issuing it shall be subject to the penalties provided for violations of the provisions of law relating to controlled substances some variation of the other phrase used in the doj press release conduct which may threaten public health and safety was relevant to two differe nt sections of the code 21 usc 823 and 824 under 823 th attorney general shall register or authorize physician to prescribe or dispense controlled substances if it is consistent with the public interest in

participation in medicare or state health program pursuant to 42 usc 1320a7a 241 the five factors specified under 21 usc 823f are 1 the recommendation of the appropriate state licensing board or

appointed attorney general john ashcroft reversed the doj position and issued directive indicating that physician assisted suicide serves legitimate medical purpose under 21 cfr 130604 and that specific conduct authorized by oregons death with dignity act may render practitioners registration inconsistent with the pub lic interest and therefore subject to possible suspension or revocation242

only difference between s 653 and s 686 appears to be the addition of the following language it is the sense of congress that the 109t h congress should consider the status and legal rights of incapacitated individuals who are incapable of making decisions concerning the provision w ithholding or wit hdrawal of foods fluid or medical careauthority under the act to th field of drug abuse247 which does not include physicianassisted suicide thus the court suggested the lack of an unmistakably clear indication that congress intended to authorize the attorney general to regulate the practice of physician assisted suicid precluded regulation of this practice the court further found that the attorn ey generals authorization to revoke prescription privileges from physicians for conduct deemed inconsistent with the public interest could not be invoked based solely on phy sician participating in physicianassisted suicide under the oreg on regime the court noted that when determining what conduct is inconsistent with the public interest under 21 usc 823f the attorney general mu st consider five factors248 these factors include the recommendation of the appropriate state licensing board the applicants experience with controlled substances the applicant s conviction record regarding controlled substances compliance with applicable state federal or local laws relating to controlled substances and such other c onduct which may threaten the public health and safety here the cour t found that the attorney general had only considered whether the conduct was such as would threaten public health and safety249 consequently the court struck down the promulgation of the directive as being outside of the attorney general s authority under 21 usc 823f 4 for the relief of the

the law first as discussed previously there was question as to unde r what circumstance federal court would find sufficient state action to invoke constitu tional concerns secondly it is not clear what laws of the united states would be implicated by this issue in general the federal courts have ju risdiction over violations of fede ral constitutional provisions and statutes under federal question provisions thus it was unclear how this law would change existing law256httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs51 257 us const art 1 sec 9 cl 3 provides th at bill of attainder or ex post facto law

held that if th ere is rational basis for legislative classification and punitive intent then the cong ress may go so far as to legislate against one named individual 433 us at 472a bill of attainder there was also concern that the specificity of this law might raise constitutional concerns article i of the constitution prohibits passage of bills of attainder257 under this provision congress is prohibited from passing legislation which applies either to named individual or to easily ascertainable members of group in such way as to inflic t punishment on them without judicial trial258 generally the prohibition on bills of attainder is intended to prevent the congress from assuming judicial functions and conducting trials259 the two main criteria which the courts will look to in order to determine whether legislation is bill of attainder are 1 whether specific individuals are affected by the statute and 2 whether the legislation inflicts punishment on those individuals260 an argument might be made that the schiavo law was bill of attainder but the precedent for this is very limited althoug h the bill itself specifically addressed providing benefit to the parents of th eresa schiavo it coul d have theoretically affected the reputation of chael schiavo and could be s een as interfering with his role as legal guardian of his wife lthough michael schiavo was not named in the law the supreme court has held that legislation meets the criteria of specificity if it applies to person or group of peopl who are described by past conduct261 by specifying theresa schiavos parents limiting the law to facts which related to pending case and providing that the suit must be filed within 30 days the law seemed to establish criteria which only app lied to the case regarding theresa schiavo however the supreme court has found that piece of legislation which is narrowly focused is not bill of attai nder merely because the statut might have been set at higher level of generality262 in order to find that legislation is bill of attainder court would have to establish that the gislation was intended to inflict punishment on this individual or individuals while it is true that the law had the potential to disrupt the proceedings in the particular state court case the mere fact that focused legislation imposes burdensome consequences does not require that court

burdens imposed cannot r easonably be said to further nonpunitive legislative purposes and 3 where the legislative record evinces congressional intent to punish thus questions could have aris as to whether the potential burdens on michael schiavos right to act as her guardian fit into one of these three categories the supreme court has identified vari ous types of punishments which have historically been associated with bills of attainder these traditionally have included capital punishment imprisonment fines ba nishment confiscati on of property and more recently the barring of individuals or groups from participation in specified employment or vocations263 there are indications by the court that harming persons reputation or interven ing in guardianship rights is type of punishment traditionally engaged in by legislatures as means of punishing individuals for wrongdoing the supreme court has also indicated that some legislative burdens not traditionally associated with bills of attainder might nevertheless functionally serve as punishment264 the court has stated however th at the type and severity of legislatively imposed burden should be exa mined to see whether it could reasonably be said to further non punitive legislation purpose265 intervening in guardianship rights does not appear to have been addre ssed but there has been legislation regarding affecting persons pos ition of responsibility various supreme court decisions have invalidated as bills of attainder legislation barring specified persons or groups from pursuing various professions where the employment bans were im posed as brand of disloyalty266 for instance in cummings v missouri 267 the supreme court noted that disqualification from the pursuits of lawful avocation or from pos itions of trust or from the privilege of appearing in the courts or acting as an executor administrator or guardian may also and often has been im posed as punishment an opinion by the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia has specifically addressed the issue of whether congressional bill limiting custodial rights was bill of attainder in foretich v united states 268

child while the case or other actions relatin g to the case was pending the court may not deprive the person of custody or visitation rights over the child or otherwise impose sanctions on the person

child 2 the child has resided outside of the ited states for not less than 24 consecutive months 3 any of the parties to the case has denied custody or visitation to another party in violation of an order of the court for not less than 24 consecutive months and 4 any of the parties to the case has lived outside of the district of columbia during such period of denial of custody or visitation 270 844 f2d 800 814 dc cir 1988written so narrowly as to apply to just one case269 this case involved protracted custody battle where allegations of sexual abuse by the husband had been made because the child in the case was longer minor the issue of removal of custodianship was declared by the court to be moot however the court found that act imposed punishment under the functiona l test because it harmed the fathers reputation and because it coul d not be said to further nonpunitive purpose to the extent that the proposed law would rm michael schiavos reputation these arguments could have been found applicable b due process although it was not considered by the courts reviewing this statute due process argument could have been made that the bill required that theresa schiavo comply with an additional set of proce dural requirements in order to effectuate constitutional rights the bill would appear to require named individual to comply with set of procedural rules that are not required of any other individuals this may raise issues of whether substantive due process right the right to terminate medical treatment can be specifically burdened further it could have raised the issue of equal protection as seen in the context of the substantive due process right to terminate medical treatment for instance in news america publishing inc v fcc 270 the united states court of appeals for

of 2005 the proposed incapacitated pers ons legal protection act of 2005273 hereinafter proposed act amends existing federal habeas corpus procedures to deem that an incapacitated person is in the

person who fits in the described category would be given the opportunity to challenge such withdrawal of nutrition hydration or medical treatment in federal court the ultimate impact of this legislation is not clear the existing federal habeas corpus procedure is federal reme dy available to persons in the custody of state or the federal government274 it is available to effect discharge from any confinement contrary to the constitution or f undamental law even though imposed pursuant to conviction by court of competent jurisdiction275 for instance 28 usc 2254 provides for habeas corpus review of persons who are in the custody of state government this provision however has not generally been applied to medically incapacitated persons the courts have construed custody lib erally to include not only actual physical custody but restraints on personal liberty as well such as parole conditions276 it appears however that 28 usc 2254 is limited to situations where the person

solely in the custody of private parties278 for example although certain state laws dealing with child custody are called habeas statutes the supreme court has found that the federal habeas statute has general application to child custody cases in lehman v lycoming county childrens services agency 279 mother voluntarily placed three boys in the legal custody of county agency which placed the children in fo ster homes subsequently state court terminated the mothers parental rights over the children and the pennsylvania supreme court affirmed the mo ther then sought writ of habeas corpus under 28 u s c 2254 arguing that the sons were in custody pursuant to statecourt judgment in alleged violati on of the federal constitution the mother argued that habeas corpus should be available to her in this case because habeas is procedure used in childcust ody cases in various states and in england the court however noted that federal habeas when applied to persons under state control is procedure of uni potency within the federalstate framework having far differe nt and more farreaching cons equences than states utilization of habeas within its own system state utilization of habeas to test the legal custody of child is part of the fabric of its reserved jurisdiction over child custody matters if habeas remedy were not provided so other procedure would be needed to effectuate the states substantive interest in these relationships it is purely matter of procedural detail whether the remedy is called habeas or something else the federal government howev er has parallel substantive interest in child custody matters that federal habeas would serve280 it should be noted that in the above case the custody of the children had at least briefly passed through the stat legal control this would not appear to be the case with most incapacitated persons in hospital setting in order for custody to arise in such situation it would appear that th state would either have to have physical custody and control over the patients settings or that state would need to act to limit the legal rights of that individual as discussed in previous section most relevant state statutes and state case law regarding the right to die are directed to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs56 281 see text accompanying notes 5053 supra 282 flores v city of boerne 521 us 507 1997

action is found when legislature passes bill which violates the constitution 285 see discussion supraimplementation of individual rights not to their limitation281 thus it would appear even less likely that an incapacitated person would generally be considered to be in custody of state even if court order had been issued regarding their medical treatment the proposed act would appear to avoid these issues by providing that for purposes of the habeas corpus statute court that authorizes or directs the withholding of nutrition or hydration is d eemed to be the custodian of the patient thus the act would appear to bring such patient within the ambit of the habeas corpus provision however even if an in capacitated person was found to be in custody of state the questions would arise as to what constitutional authority would exist to review the state courts holding the findings of the proposed act suggest that the constitutional basis for the bill is section 5 of the fourteenth amendm ent as was noted previously in flores v city of boerne the supreme court held that secti on 5 of the fourteenth amendment is available as basis for statute when such law is congruent and proportional response to pattern and histor or constitutional violations282 this raises two issues 1 can congress establish pattern or history violations of the constitutional rights of incapacitated persons who are subj ect to court order withdrawing nutrition or hydration and 2 is the proposed act congruent and proportional response in order to address the first issue one must postulate what constitutional violation the proposed act is intended to remedy as was noted above it would appear that the constitutional right at issue is either the right of patient to direct ones own medical treatment as was at issue in the case of cruzan v missouri dept of health283 or concern about procedural due pro cess there is indication that state legislation and case law which is currently on the books regarding advance directives or guardianship significantly limits the exerci of either the right to direct medical treatment or denies incompetent patie nts procedural due process rights284 thus it would appear that congress would need to tablish that there is pattern of courts using neutral laws to disguise an effort to deny the constitutional rights of incapacitated person to direct their own medical treatment as discussed above under united states v morrison congress would also need to establish that such violation of constitutional rights occurred as result of actions attributable to the state not as result of private activity285 the court has long held that the fourteenth amendment provides the congress the authority to regulate stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97244crs57 286 see shelley v

capacity had executed written advance directive valid under applicable law that clearly authorized the withholding or withdrawal of food or fluids or medical treatment in the applicable circumstancesbut not individuals286 thus evidence regarding the treatment of pa tients who had nutrition and hydration withhe ld outside of the court context might not be deemed relevant rather the congress would need to establish that there was pattern and history of court cases dir ecting either the application or withdrawal of medical treatment in contravention to the incompetent patients desires also as discussed above an alternative constitutional basis for the proposed act might be the power of the united states congress to regulate commerce this power has been cited as the constitutional basis for significant portion of the laws passed by the congress over the last fifty years nd it currently represents one of the broadest bases for the exercise of congressional powers the proposed act however does not address channels or instrumentalities of commerce it contains requirement that interstate commerce be affected it is not part of larger regulatory scheme to regulate commerce nor does it regulate an economic activity rather it is law designed to regulate the activity of state courts in evaluating incapacitated patients regarding medical decisions consequently in order for the commerce clause to be established as basis for the proposed act the cong ress may need to take additional steps to establish relationship between the activity to be regulated and

deprivation of constitutional right or federal statutory right291 such determination will be made novo and the litigation of previous issues at the state level will not bar relitigation of these issues292 these provisions appear to differ sign ificantly from other federal removal provisions generally remova l is doctrine which is re served for defendants who have been sued293 while this bill would allow removal of cases involving incapacitated persons who are likely to be in court under guardianship proceedings second the b ill requires that all state pro ceedings be exhausted while removal provisions must be made within 30 days of the filing of the case294 in addition removal to federal court would not generally eliminate issues of abstention and issue preclusion as is done by the present bill there appear to be apparent constitutional issues raised on the face of the bill for instance an incapacitated person could be in the care of veterans administration hospital and

334 us 1 13 1948 299 idto withhold medical treatment despite an advance medical directive directing otherwise in that case an argument could be made that an agency of the united states was acting so as to violate the constitutional rights of that individual to direct their own medical treatment or if st ate passed law which had the effect of requiring termination of medical treatment ag ainst the direction of an individual this may also be violation of constitutional rights there also appears to be constitu tional problem on the face of the bill regarding the provision of next friend st atus for purposes of litigation the practice of allowing next friend to bring such suit is wellestablished295 and person with significant enough relationship with the patient such as parent296 would appear to be able to take advantage of its provisions despite issues of standing297 question does arise however whether this bill would have practical application to situations where an individual is not in government facility and is not challenging state law in such context the question arises as to what constitutional rights are at issue in general actions by private individuals or entities are not of constitutional significance only actions by government lead to the violation of constitutional rights298 so if hospital or facility caring for an incapacitated individual moved to terminate medical treatment of an individual patient constitutional rights appear to be implicated as noted previously more complicated issue arises when court has become involved in such situation and has directed or authorized the withdrawal of medical treatment in the case of shelley v kraemer 299 the supreme court found that state action could arise based on the contractual and property righ ts of private
