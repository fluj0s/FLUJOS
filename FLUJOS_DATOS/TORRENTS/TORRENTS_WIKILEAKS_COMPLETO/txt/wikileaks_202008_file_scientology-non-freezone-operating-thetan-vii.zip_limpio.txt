private version of information private message 1 hi guys so im sending this pm to both of you altho im guessing sending it to just one of you is plenty but i just want to be sure so what is coming tonight is something called solo nots this is ot vii to put it in perspective arnie got raided for ot iii this is not already on the net i know that theres doc thats been circulating that looks like its been made up to look like one of the tech vols with all the ot levels in it but i think that is some thing put together by the freezone guys and isnt official i have checked what i have against these and its not the same stuff all official dox have official headers like the 1000 page stuff in other words it will say hubbard communications office at the top and then either hco policy letter for policy or hco technical bulletin for tech these are original tech bulletins there are three correction lists one auditing issue and two more auditing lists that are attachments im talking in little scienospeak here as this shit is so integral to them that some of it has regular english that is simple the correction lists mean that if someone fucks up an auditing session they can correct it the lists are the processes and commands for the level these have not been up before that shit that is up is just something else or something created from someones memory that is different part or an older version that got changed or something it took over year to acquire these source is even more nervous and crazy paranoid than i am i have spent lot of time reassuring source that there are many layers that would have to be gone through to get to them honestly we have good reason to be freaked out think of organized scientology as humongous slowmoving but very dangerous beast its got lot of little things running around at its feet stabbing it and shooting arrows into it its listing this thing is going to make it stop turn and chase just one of those little things at its feet flat out as crazy arnie would say geddit thats the best analogy i can give you fuck were not going to try to tell you to be careful or take precautions blah blah blah i think wed just be making ourselves look like assholes but i decided to explain what will occur in full to both of you as forewarned is forearmed there are lot of really fun things that are going to happen as result of this 1 these released broadly make organized scieno pretty much obsolete having the repair lists to this stuff is what the freezoners were missing to having the full tech on their own free and in the public domain so you get to watch the nutball freezoners and the nutball organized scienos battle royal for the hearts and minds of the batshit crazy people who believe this crap this will start war woo hoo chaos is fun 2 everyone who has ever been subjectedexposed to this shit is going to be ordered to flag in florida for interrogations i mean everybody so if you have 100200 people in each org that have been on 7 or above were talking thousands of people my source is fully prepared to deflect this and is the one that explained this to basically they will all be sec checked at their own expense most of the people that have gotten that high and left have left because they got sick of this exact kind of shitbeing resold stuff ordered around getting unnecessary things done on them getting extreme out of pocket bills for all of it my analysis of this is that the scienos will have crazy kneejerk reaction to this and further alienate people who have already begun to question them that anonymous has gotten on the edge anyway it it will cause more of these people to leave 3 since this is the most sooper seekret stuff of all they will not be able to use all the little usual grunts in osa to handle this as hardly any of the sea org guys actually go up the bridge themselves they may suspend that dont look at ot materials crap and let them but this is so far up they may not be able to do that and will have trouble getting enough people on it 4 this is going to totally interrupt anything else any other attacks they are working on whatever shit osa is working on it will be shifted to this i am also guessing that moxon and whatever ps they have will be put onto this too i am not bullshitting i am not being alarmist 5 these will show that tommy davis and organized scilons are liars period its all the shit he was denying in their own fonts and formatting and shit so it could certainly be sent to cnn 6 7 profit private message 2 i would like to make suggestion as to how this is rolled out i would say that if you could put the lings in the thundercake like before and get as many people to downloadupload before you go post the lings live that might give you head start that would be good also the most hardcore thing you could do is actually post the whole pages in threads so anyone going into thread has the whole thing full on in their face this will fuck them up very hardcore will make the midgets sphincter pinch in whole new way there are only 17 pages so this is very doable with that said its up to you guys to do it as you see best and in whatever way keeps you the safest gotta go my camera tells the guy who is helping with this tonight just pulled up yes i have cameras everywhere paranoid exscieno is paranoid love you guys and stay safe private message 3 ok we are at the final countdown but we need to tell you something important inside of the dox is patsy yeah patsy imbedded into the code plox dont touch it this is personal v for ven point for us this was also leak request as well that serves us as well if anyone asks you about it like uh there is person imbedded say oh well fuckem for being stupid fags and leave it pretty please with fucking cherry on top kk revolution without dancing is not revolution worth having within the hour private message 4 i see people are asking questions that prolly shd be answered so heres couple answers 1 yes there is ot viii and the freezoners do not have it but it is not major level or action its little thing that takes short amt of time and is complete bullshit like the sunshine rundown which is done right after clear and consists of walking around outside for 20 minutes or so vii is the last major released level 2 yes it looks short but that shit gets done over and over and over on btsclusters one at time for years so it looks short but its repetitive thing they have to get them all public version of information so what is coming tonight is something called solo nots this is ot vii to put it in
