oios conducted an audit of t he united nations office on drugs and crime regional centre for east asia and the pacifi c rceap in bangkok thailand and its field office in phnom penh cambodia the audit covered activities with total expenditure of 51 million in 2003 and 2004 unodc has accepted the recommendations made and is in the process of implementing them role and responsibilities rceap developed evolutionarily its regional role and responsibilities have not been formalized and in practice rceap had overall r esponsibility for the activities of unodc offices in the region as stipulated in the working arrangement with undp country offices in the region did not report to rceap and although th ere was according to rceap good dialogue and communication among these offices the managerial functional and reporting responsibilities needed to be clarified and formali zed unodc has clarified in the working arrangement with undp that the regional centre pr ovides substantive guidance to country offices in the region in respect of programme and p roject matters and acts as centre of expertise project formulation the project portfolio had number of smaller proje cts which when compared to bigger but fewer projects could obtain donors funding more asily nonetheless smaller projects have inherent risks of overlaps scattered portfolio not being costeffective nonsustainability and termination of projects before an impact is mad rceap agreed and informed that fewer but larger projects will be considered as appropria in the preparation of the rspf and the formulation of new project proposals core activities such as advocacy and advisory role s were funded under projects making the sustainability of the activities rather questionabl these activities were not limited to time frame and therefore did not meet the criteria to be formulated under project g iven the demonstrated reluctance of donors to fund advocacy and advisory roles as core activities rceap has to prepare for fallback position if t here is lack of donor interest and response for nonproject funded activities they have to rev ert to projectrelated time bound advocacy and advisory activities to be bolstered by related policiesstrategies oios accepted the explanation and as suggested rceap undertook to sure that policies and strategies would be put in place to ensure continuity of core activitie s project management as suggested by oios rceap agreed to establish p roject management committee to review project implementation two major donors engaged rceap in an antimoney lau ndering project project rasg44 through competitive bidding while rceap considere d the overall project implementation as costeffective there were divergent views as to th appropriateness of rceap implementing the project excessive involvement by donors and ncompliance to their reporting requirements an evaluation mission was fielded in early august 2005 the division for operations will review the evaluation report and co nsider the development of policy and guidelines for field offices that engage in project s through competitive bidding in project rasg69 there was disconnect between the purpose duration and funding of this project and the actual activities that it funds th project objective was also much broader than the activities that were carried out as of may 20 05 only 15 per cent of the 780000 project budget had been spent and the project terminates in 2006 project rasg07 that aims at preventing ats abuse among youth lacked an impleme nting methodology resulting in such slow implementation that the 2004 allocation of 14 4000 was not requested from the donor who discussions with who had been initiated meeting was arranged for the respective representatives to hold preliminary discussions dur ing the second week of september 2005 and working arrangements were to be finalized during th project advisory committee meeting in november 2005 who and national counterparts will participate there was need for clearer strategies and strengt hened staffing in demand reduction and alternative development as suggested rceap drafted demand reduction stra tegy that is currently under review the existing staffing stru cture has also been modified identifying alternative development as separate and cross c utting programme staffing and consultancies core staff positions are funded under projects in the case of rceap project staff positions are also not project bound as projects have limited durations the situation has affected staff morale continuity and personnel practices rceap did not comply with andor undp rules rega rding ssas when engaging consultants important procedural requirements wer not complied with and overall there was assurance that the selection process was proper and the number of consultants engaged was warranted rceap developed an internal guideline for the recruitmen t of consultants administration and finance the general administration and financial management was found to be of high standard and an adequate system was in place for the reimburseme nt of costs for services locally provided by the

drugs nacd 5 rceap was last audited in 2002 when the profi system was not fully operational and expenditures were not tracked in projects the re was need for better inventory records and procurement responsibilities were not c entralized the procedures followed during the recruitment of consultants also needed t improve improvements were effected in the aforementioned areas except that the procurement responsibilities were not centralized and the weaknesses in the recruitme nt process of consultants remained 6 the findings and recommendations contained in t his report have been discussed during the exit conference held on 20 may 2005 with the representative draft of this audit report was shared with the director division for operations unodc on 18 august 2005 whose comments

furthermore administrative expenditures incur red in 2003 and 2004 totaling 800000 and the general administration at rceap wa s also audited 11 oios reviewed project documents and other reco rds related to operational and financial management in order to assess the adequac of project management and internal control systems in place to ensure that transaction s are accurately recorded and that the financial status of projects are properly tracked the audit team also visited the project office in phnompenh cambodia and audited project cmbf14 iv audit findings and recommendations rceaps role and responsibilities 12 rceap the only regional centre of unodc deve loped evolutionarily established in 1972 as the office of the programme for drug abuse in thailand then transformed into unfdac field office it was designated as th undcp regional centre for south east asia in 1992 in 1997 it became the unodc re gional centre for south east asia and in 1998 its coverage expanded to include the pa cific its evolvement from drug abuse programme in thailand to drug and crime off ice for the region meant large increase in operational responsibilities 13 the duties and responsibilities of the represe ntative of the regional centre were spelled out in the working arrangement with undp b ut it differed from the practice rceap did not have the overall responsibility for the activities of unodc offices in the 4 region as stipulated in the working arrangement the country offices in myanmar laos and vietnam did not report to rceap but direc tly to headquarters therefore oios recommended that the office of the executive d irector unodc clarify the role and responsibilities of rceap subsequently and in september 2005 unodc requested undp to append corrigendum to the working arrange ment that states the regional centre provides substantive guidance to country off ices in the region in respect of programme and project matters and acts as centre of expertise for unodc in the region through the outposting of experts from head quarters oios appreciates the clarification that rceap does not have the overall responsibility for the activities of unodc offices in the region b programme framework 14 the mou for the greater mekong subregion coun tries and the accord plan of action guided rceaps work the last regional prof ile profile for south east asia and regional strategic programme framework rspf w ere prepared in 2002 and 2003 respectively the project portfolio supported the ctivities as per the rspf that covered the period 20042005 rceap stated that rspf co vering the period 20052007 would be prepared by september 2005 based on updated regi onal profiles rceap added that there would be important issues outside the scope f the mou and accord geographically countries not included and areas f work such as crime and terrorism rceap viewed this as part of the evolutionary natur of the work 15 oios was of the opinion that the framework was not only matter of documentation and formalization and therefore viewed the process involved in preparing the profile and rspf and the subsequent updating thereof import ant recommendation head2right the unodc regional centre for east asia and the pac ific should update the regional profile and strategic programme framework rec 01 16 rceap accepted the recommendation and concurred th at regional profile and rspf were under preparation together with the acco rd plan of action that has strong bearing on the rspf the target date for co mpletion was set for the 4 th quarter of 2005 oios will close the recommendation upon confirmati on that the regional profile and strategic programme framework have been complet ed c project formulation 17 there were projects with cross cutting activ ities such as computerbased training cbt and data collection projects in respect of w hich oios raised the question as to whether less but larger projects were possible rc eap answered that it was easier to obtain funding for number of smaller projects tha n for bigger but fewer projects oios notes this last point but managing projects that overlap in efforts or scattered portfolio could be difficult managing number of smaller projects might not be cost effective because more projects would normally requ ire more administration and coordination efforts than fewer but larger project s 18 therefore oios recommended the concept of few er but larger projects especially the cross cutting activities such as cbt be conside red in the spf preparation rceap accepted the recommendation and stated that fewer b ut larger projects will be considered 5 as appropriate in the preparation of the rspf and the formulation of new project proposals also that cbt is now largely implemented as glob project and the development thereof done in close cooperation with and guidance from headquarters 19 rceap sustained core activities such as advis ory roles and advocacy that are normally institutionalized funded under core fund s under projects these activities did not meet the criteria for project because it was not undertaken within an established time frame and budget funding these activities u nder projects with limited time frames and budgets also presented risk that core activit ies especially in the case of advisory roles and advocacy activities could discontinue these activities should preferably have been carried out under core funds but if it was not possible strategy should have been developed to provide for followup projects to ensu re continuity 20 oios also suggested that core activities such as advocacy and advisory roles should not be limited to timebound projects if for fund ing reasons the activities have to be continued under projects then rceap should develop strategy to ensure followup projects rceap agreed the need for core funding will be r eflected in the rspf and related planning and fundraising documents given the demonstrated reluctance of donors to fund advocacy and advisory roles as core activities rceap will also prepare for fallback position should there be lack of donor interest in or response to non project funded activities they will revert to proj ectrelated time bound advocacy and advisory activities to be bolstered by related pol iciesstrategies 21 there was also an inherent risk that projects in general could terminate before the desired impact had been made without other means to continue the work either through followup projects or through the involvement of ot her parties or counter parts this was especially true in the case of sensitive issues in the thematic area of demand reduction such as hiv if such projects were discontinued be fore desired impact had been made it could send the wrong signal not only to donors bu t also to the general public 22 naturally the funding and duration of proje ct are the key factors to determine projects objectives and the extent of activities t hat can be carried out but the expected impact of the planned activities should also be det ermined at the formulation stage and assessed in the interim in particular during the interim evaluation if it is not certain that reasonable impact will be made because of lack of funding or if the duration is too short it could be better to reconsider the project rathe r than to continue it within the given constraints rceap agreed with oios view that the eventual impa ct of project in thematic area should be considered during the form ulation stage to determine as to whether expectations could be met the strategies and implementation methodologies to achieve the desired impact will be included in the project documents also that concurrence of project documents with the aforemen tioned requirements will be followedup by the oios proposed project management committee d project management 23 financial administration was strength in rce aps project management project budgets and workplans were in most cases properly p repared project records were in good order and financial statuses of projects were prope rly tracked we were particularly impressed by the manner in which budgetary control was performed through the keeping of pencil ledgers and the accuracy thereof 6 24 rceaps performance in implementing the curren t project portfolio had not been evaluated and some individual projects were also t evaluated either in the interim or at the end the financial implementation rate achieve d in project was not good indicator of what had been achieved in project during impl ementation or at the end an evaluation plan was needed recommendation head2right the unodc regional centre for east asia and the pac ific should develop an evaluation plan to ensure that projects are evaluated in the interim and at termination rec 02 25 rceap accepted the recommendation and stated that in addition to the annual evaluation plan that is monitored by the independen t evaluation unit at headquarters rceap would prepare separate evaluation plan for all its ongoing projects for all new projects the inclusion of an evaluation compon ent is obligatory 26 oios views this as positive step because th evaluation plan of the independent evaluation unit at headquarters provide coverage ov er period of time and does not include all projects rceaps approach will ensure that individual projects are systematically evaluated oios will close the reco mmendation upon receipt of the evaluation plan 27 as far as documentation is concerned we found that project documents workplans and budgets had been properly prepared semiannua l and annual reports were prepared but some of those reviewed were not detailed enoug h in the description of achievements and problems encountered 28 considering the number of selfimplemented pro jects oios was of the opinion that rceap could benefit from periodic selfassessments of progress made during implementation project management committee sisting of programme managers and project coordinators could carry out the assess ments thereby allowing projects to benefit from the views and expertise of staff in ot her projects and overall strengthen programme management it would also assist in avoid ing duplication of efforts and in providing project coordinators with insight in othe r projects recommendation head2right the unodc regional centre for east asia and the pac ific should consider establishing project management committe to assess the progress made in projects during implementation t he number of self implemented projects their centralized location an d number of project coordinators provide the opportunity to benefit fro m such an arrangement rec 03 29 rceap accepted the recommendation and undertook to establish project management committee also monitoring plan will be prepared for all projects and the project management committee will review the implem entation oios will close the recommendation upon receipt the terms of reference and composition of the project management committee 7 30 from the review of project documents and discu ssions with staff our assessment was that the majority of projects in law enforcement ma good progress in achieving objectives antimoney laundering was included in t he portfolio of law enforcement and experienced difficulties during implementation in demand reduction project rasg22 was the main project of which the implementation wa s stalled due to lack of funding project activities restarted in mid 2005 when funds became available there was limited activity in alternative development drug law enforcement 31 the main projects focused on support to drug l aw enforcement cbt crossborder law enforcement precursor control and project in the field of antimoney laundering the support project provided for the engagement of an advisor at the l5 level previously function performed by regular staff at the p5 level cbt evolved in strong crosscutting activity that expanded regio nally and globally twentyfour border liaison offices were established under the crossbo rder project and precursor control had good results rasg44 antimoney laundering project 32 the project was formulated in response to co mpetitive bidding process undertaken by the department for international development df id of the government of the united kingdom it was the first antimoney launde ring project at rceap until the end of 2003 the project completed six needs assessment s at cost of approximately 300000 in 2004 four financial investigation trainings we re held in the region one prosecutor training in thailand and the cbt programme was tran slated into five languages 33 project staff mentioned number of issues tha t they experienced during implementation that included divergent views as to the process by which funding was obtained excessive involvement by donors rceap di d not know that the european commission provided 50 per cent of the funds and wa s in fact third party to the project resulting in rceap not complying with the required reporting requirements uncertainty as to whether it is unodc or european commission project and exit strategy an external advisor was provided for and therefore rc eap was not required to have an expert in the field of antimoney laundering during the bidding process or at later stage rceap had clarity as to the role and responsibi lities of the external advisor and influence on his work to ensure timely delivery the consultants that conducted the needs assessments were engaged upon the advice of the ext ernal advisor 34 though the project management complied with odcs reporting requirements to demonstrate accountability the financial reporting arrangements under the memorandum of understanding between dfid and the european comm ission were originally not complied with resulting in discontent although r ceap was not aware of the additional reporting requirements as per the memorandum of und erstanding and therefore not responsible the discontent required rceaps projec t management to take corrective actions to ensure that the reporting requirements w ere met 35 the difficulties that the project staff experi enced during implementation could be attributed to the implementing methodology used th implementing methodology was different from that normally followed by unodc rc eap was engaged following bidding process and was the implementer of the proj ect on behalf of donors that had direct involvement in the project rceap had ex pertise in antimoney laundering and was mainly guided by an external advisor the memor andum of understanding and 8 decisions of the steering committee that comprised of the donors it could therefore be said that the donors and the external advisor were the main decision makers in the project with rceap having the coordination admini strative and reporting responsibilities according to rceap the overall project implementat ion was cost effective and the desired impact will be made this could however only be substantiated by comprehensive external evaluation also less ons had to be learned from the experiences of rceap especially regarding implemen ting methodologies when engaging in projects through competitive bidding recommendation head2right the unodc regional centre for east asia and the pac ific should arrange an external evaluation of project rasg44 nd subsequently request the division for operations to develop po licy on the implementing methodology that should be followed by field offices when engaging in projects through competitive biddi ng exercises taking into consideration the outcome of the evalua tion rec 04 36 an evaluation mission was fielded in early august 2005 and rceap is waiting for the report the division for operations will review the evalua tion report and consider the development of policy and guidelines for field of fices that engage in projects through competitive bidding oios retains the recommendation until the external evaluation report is issued and the division for operations has decid ed on policy if any rasg69 advocacy project 37 project rasg69 started in 2003 with an implem enting period of three years therefore until 2006 the associated agency was wh that signed the project document in september 2003 with budget of 780000 pro ject coordinator was not appointed until december 2004 rceap indicated that since then project activities have stepped up considerably since december 2004 38 there was disconnect between the purpose du ration and funding of this project and the actual activities funded the project funded p ublic information that was normally core function and not limited in duration although the project was the project document aimed to produce and distribute awareness building materials suitable for number of different media develop model campaigns support i nnovative communitybased special events and review and adjust public advocacy initia tives as necessary this is much broader than the publication of newsletter and th development of website at the date of the audit only 120000 of the 780000 had bee n spent mainly on the publication of the newsletter eastern horizons and the development of the rceaps web site 39 innovative community special events and the velopment of campaign strategies in support of the accord taskforce one outputs one an d four had still to be undertaken nevertheless the budget and available funding appe ared to be significantly higher than what was needed to achieve the planned outputs duri ng the implementation period 40 the implementing arrangements as per the proje ct document required the involvement of who and nongovernmental and communi ty based agencies and the establishment of project advisory committee that would guide the implementation oios could not find evidence that who was adequatel involved in the project and that the outputs were in line with what were agreed upon there was need to communicate with who as regards the duration of the project th funding and what was to be achieved and then to revise the project document work plans and budget accordingly 9 recommendation head2right the unodc regional centre for east asia and the pac ific should discuss the duration funding arrangements and obj ectives of project rasg69 with the world health organization in an ffort to secure the funding and to ensure that there is common derstanding on what is to be achieved in the project rec 05 41 rceap accepted the recommendation and stated that discussions with who had been initiated meeting was arranged for the resp ective representatives to hold preliminary discussions during the second week of s eptember 2005 detailed working arrangements will be finalized during the project dvisory committee meeting to be held in november 2005 who and national counterparts wi ll participate oios will close the recommendation once working arrangement with who ve been finalized demand reduction 42 oios viewed project rasg22 reduce hiv vulner ability from drug abuse to be well administered apart from the aforementioned project there was limited ongoing work 43 project rasf89 started in 2001 and intended t develop national competence of drug control agencies and promote regional partners hips for the prevention of drug abuse related hiv infection among selected countries expe riencing an increasing trend in abuse of injected drugs originally with oneyear impl ementation period the project was still ongoing with limited ongoing technical work proje ct cprh20 with budget of 90000 is pilot project in china with limited expenditur of 38000 incurred in 2004 in trainings and documentation in the area of drug abu treatments 44 the only substantive project at the date of th audit was rasi09 rasg07 preventing ats abuse among youth project 45 project rasg07 that aimed at preventing ats buse among youth lacked an implementing methodology which resulted in such slow implementation that the 2004 allocation of 144000 was not requested from the d onor according to rceap the then donor would likely have only provided 60000 per ear for the remainder of the two years 2005 and 2006 the project was the only assi stance project in the area of ats prevention that would most probably not be able to obtain half of the original budget of 450000 from the donor 46 this project demonstrated the difficulty in ma naging multiple projects without clear strategy andor clearly defined roles and responsib ilities of staff managing the projects 47 rceap stated that in may 2005 an inhouse task f orce team was appointed to manage the project since then the project met expe ctations objectives are likely to be achieved within the project timeframe in july 2005 the donor undertook to provide full funding for the remainder of the budget 10 alternative development 48 project rasc96s focused on reducing drug cro p cultivation through improving the effectiveness of alternative development projects b increasing knowledge skills and capabilities of policy makers and practitioners in national agencies at the completion of the aforementioned project project h84 regional collaboration on community based alternative development to eliminate opium producti on in southeast asia commenced in april 2005 apart from these projects there we re other ongoing projects in this thematic area there were however nonproject networking activit ies carried out by the representative 49 oios suggested that rceap develop clear strate gies for the thematic areas of demand reduction and alternative development that t akes into consideration facts data impacts countries and harm to focus on an d funding sources donors subsequently rceap drafted demand reduction stra tegy that is currently under review they are also in the process of raising the alternative development portfolio by formulating new projects to increase activities as well as human and financial resources the existing staffing structure has also been modif ied identifying alternative development as separate and cross cutting programme cambodia project office 50 project cmbf14 aimed at strengthening the sec retariat of the national authority for combating drugs and the national drug control progr amme of cambodia was well established and administratively and financially we ll managed there were also good financial internal controls in place staffing resources 51 with the exception of the three professional p osts ie the representative and two programme managers all other positions are funded from projects as long as the projects continue there is concern but project s have limited durations that could become problematic because the project staffs func tions are more closely related to the core work of rceap compared to other unodc field of fices especially in the case of project assistants 52 we observed that their positions were not pro ject bound meaning that although they are funded by project their work is not lim ited to that of the project this was applicable even for staff members that are core staff they were funded from the projects and although their work involved projects it was not possible to introduce any chargeout policy that would adequately distribute the costs between the projects so that the work done relates to the staff costs incurred therefore the staff costs incurred in particular month was charged to an individual proje ct 53 there were risks attached because number of projects were reaching their termination dates firstly it could result in pro jects to be created and funded to sustain the current staff compliment and not because the ac tivity is in line with established strategies the management of rceap disagreed with this and str essed that projects would not be developed to maintain staff componen t 11 54 secondly the situation could affect staff mor ale continuity and personnel practices this was particularly relevant in the case of proje ct assistants because they were engaged to perform administrative and financial functions nd not technical work therefore it is difficult to determine who is to be funded from wh ich project and when projects terminate whose contracts will be ended 55 although we recognized that projects had to fun d the positions in the absence of core funding the situation had negative effects rceap is considering pool of project assistants to work on projects and the costs would be charged to the projects given the circumstances it seemed to be the correct action i n respect of project assistants but would not solve the problem of funding it would s till be funded from projects with limited durations and chargeout policy would sti ll to be determined therefore oios was of the opinion that better solution should be found but unodc in general is increasingly funding posts from projects and is mo ving away from funding posts from core funds this is understood but oios felt that it is important to report on the implications of funding core staff from project f unds f consultancies 56 rceap did not comply with the andor undp ru ie undpadm9563add1 guidelines for use of special service agreements and stai19997 consultants and individual contractors when engaging consultants r individual contractors the non compliance included not utilizing the official rost er database to select candidates andor to establish an official roster it was also not evid ent that rceap properly verified academic and professional credentials and observed gender an dor geographic balances furthermore terms of reference tor that include tangible and measurable outputs and corresponding performance indicators for evaluations were not alw ays developed rceap made consolidated list of potential candidates merely fr om the applicants received which is used in the selection of candidates 57 overall we could not assure ourselves that th selection process ensured that the consultants met the required academic and professio nal credentials new graduates were being recruited as consultants and in one case an i ntern was engaged as consultant right after her internship with another international org anization also and based on available documents reviewed three of the five ald staff wer former interns and consultants 58 rceap engaged many consultants and given the i nherent risks attached to non compliance greater transparency was needed and trols had to be put in place to ensure that rules are complied with given the importance of the matter and to ensure transparency oios suggested that field offices should involve th division for operations in the engagement of consultants while the division for operations agreed with the t hrust of the recommendation they did not consider it feasible t review the engagement of consultants at the field offices other than on sample basis 59 following the audit rceap developed an internal g uideline for the recruitment of consultants under special service agreement the guideline covers the general principles step by step recruitment preparatio n and procedures as well as flow chart of processes and responsible agencies and units 12 60 oios welcomes the action taken by rceap but s uggests developing unodc wide guideline which could be used by all field of fices therefore oios recommends that hrms develop such guideline after reviewing that of rceap recommendation head2right the unodc human resources management service should consider developing guideline to strengthen controls over the engagement of consultants by field offices to provide greater tra nsparency and compliance with relevant rules rec 06 g procurement 61 procurement for rceap is handled by undp in most cases however rceap performed substantial part of the work that inclu ded bidding and in general the selection of the supplier the procurement process was adequate but there were control weaknesses on the part of rceap mainly because rce ap did not have focal point or liaison officer to coordinate procurements and comm unicate with undp project coordinators solicited the bids and communicated di rectly with undp they also approved the purchase orders on behalf of rceap wh ich did not comply with the internal control requirement of segregating the fun ctions of requisitioning and purchasing moreover procurement registers were not kept and the standard agreement standard purchase contract nor its general contracting condi tions was not used 62 rceap engaged cet digital productions in ser ies of contracts to develop computer based training modules for different pro jects the contracts totaled close to 900000 over fiveyear period of which contracts amounting to some 650000 was entered into after obtaining waivers from undps ad visory committee on procurement even when actual competitive bidding was carried ou t and cet was the lowest bidder except for one case where cet was the highest bidde r rceap explained that the supplier was selected because of competence and rep utation nonetheless we could not find adequate evidence such as proper technical evaluation report to demonstrate that cets bid offered the best value for money for the rest of the cases there was adequate explanation as to why waiver was necessa ry even when cets bid was the lowest rceap needed to ensure that the selection p rocess awards the contract not through waiver but based on proper evaluation of bids received 63 therefore oios recommended that rceap should establish focal point for procurement and introduce proper procurement proced ures and records that should ensure approval of purchase requests by programme managers use of procurement register and proper segregation of procurement functions rceap assigned focal point for procurement guidelines for procurement procedures and records had been prepared and shared with all staff oios received copy of the guidelines h administration and finance 64 we found the general administration and financ ial management at rceap to be of high standard records were properly maintained i nternal controls were in place and effective and the accounts were well managed also an adequate system was in place for the reimbursement of cost for services locally prov ided by the undp country office 13 v further actions required on recommendations
