development issues and policy options summary subsaharan africa has been focus for us development assistance for decades many believe that us interests in the region are increasing partly because of its oil resources and the international rrorist threat however at the beginning of the twentyfirst century africa faces grave challenges that potentially threaten longterm stability including the worl ds most serious hivaids pandemic widespread rural poverty and high levels of urban unemplo yment in constant dollar terms incomes in africa are only about 100 higher than in 1960 recently gross domestic product gdp has been growing but at rates well belo w the 7 or better needed to make significant headway against poverty the reasons for slow growth and pove rty in africa are the source of much analysis and debate some emphasize f actors largely beyond africas control such as difficult geographical endowment that has limited growth in manufacturing agriculture and trade dependence on pr imary product exports has made the region vulnerable to cyclical price trends nd global economic downturns meanwhile the hivaids pandemic and the brain drain to developed countri have taken away large numbers of adults in their most productive years the colonial powers made minimal investments in african infrastructure and left the region divided into some 48 separate countries veral of them landlocked complicating prospects for economic integration and growth trade ba rriers imposed by developed countries to africas exports of cotton and other primary products have also co in for criticism many analysts blame africas economic problems primarily on the limited capabilities of african governments ina ppropriate economic policies pursued into the 1990s and corruption they maintain that further free ma rket reforms are essential if the continent is to grow more rapidly some stress africas heavy burden of foreign debt which required the paym ent of 12 billion in debt service in 2002 africas difficulties have limited foreig n investment in the regi on hampering the development of an export manufacturing sect or that could provide jobs and growth development experts and advocates ar recommending number of measures to accelerate growth in africa including increased foreign assistance debt forgiveness the easing of trade barriers expanded hivaids programs and support for capacity building both in terms of human capital and infrastructure investment promotion programs and expa nded applications of resear ch and technology also have support each of these approaches s its critics and some could face political problems in the donor countries in both eu rope and the united states for example there is strong opposition to any proposal pe rceived as having the potential to export jobs as some fear would happen if tr ade barriers were eased moreover some experts doubt that existing ssistance agencies in the veloped countries have the knowledge and capacity needed to help africa grow thus africas ability to escape its current economic dilemma s remains very much in question for background on the us foreign aid program in africa and information

since the continent has number of strengths that w ould seem to give it considerable economic potential low wages prevail through most of the region and might be expected to attract investors in tex tiles and other manufacturing i ndustries as has happened in china and elsewhere africa is located closer than asia to most markets in the developed world so that it ought to be possible to export manufactured goods at lower cost than asian competitors ma ny countries moreover are wellendowed with natural resources including oil and could supply many of the inputs to production from domestic

to be met by 2015 in order to reduce poverty worldwide the goals were ndorsed at unconvened conference on financing for development that was held in monterrey mexico in march 2002 and attended by

that per capita gdp in the developing countri of the east asian and pacific region which include china indonesia and viet nam was lower than africas in 1960 but has since risen well above the african

success stories in africa where substantial growth has occurred despite problems elsewhere the success stories are seen as demonstrating that growth is possible in the african context and could become

willingness to discipline governments guilty of human rights violations and corrupti on the case of africas seeming reluctance to deal with the political and economic turmoil in president robert mugabes zimbabwe is often cited sources of slow growth and poverty the reasons for slow growth and pove rty in africa are the source of much analysis and debate among development economists and advocates part of the debate centers on the degree to which slow growth results from factors which are largely beyond africas control partic ularly trends in the global economy geographical realities and the special burdens imposed by africas history or from policies adopted by african governments in the postindependence period through the 1980s and beyond another debate focu ses on the degree to which the policies and policy recommendations of the major donors including the international financial institutions might be helping or hindering african development the following catalog of factors that have been put forth as contributors to africas slow growth and poverty suggests that the s ources of these problems are many and complex and that restarting african gr owth and development poses difficult challenge indeed trends in the global economy some analysts considering the course of gdp growth in africa as depicted in figure 2 above are struck by the coinci dence of africas downturns with downturns in the global economy two african economis ts thandika mkandawire head of the united nations research institute for social development and charles soludo of the african institute for applied economics in nigeria place great weight on the impact of global trends on growth in africa according to mkandawire and soludo the global recession following the first oil shock was the precipitating factor in africas subsequent stagnation18 the fact that there was lively growth in many previous yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32489crs7 18 continued perspectives on structural

borrowed heavily after the first oil shock this left them vulnerable to the next global downturn in the early 1980s19 following the second oil shock in the wake of the 1979 revolution in iran when the rate of growth in africa fell into negative territory negative growth occurred again in 1985 ethiopia and some other parts of africa were affected by severe drought at this time contributing to the regions poor economic performance but this was also period when according to the international monetary fund imf t he slowdown in industrial countries particularly in the united states was sharper than expected world trade was sluggish protectionist pressures intensif ied and real primary commodity prices declined steeply20 as will be noted below dependence on primary commodity exports agricultural produce unprocessed mineral ores and crude oil is key feature of africas economies and major source of vulnerability to trends in the global economy africas economic perfo rmance hit another low in 1992 following year of contraction in the ec onomies of the industrialized world21 but other regions faced the same international ec onomic environment as subsaharan africa and managed to grow at fast er rates overall thus ther must be additional factors that help to explain africas problems geography and demography widely discussed 1998 paper by da vid bloom and jeffrey sachs described number of obstacles to growth arising from africas geography22 bloom is professor of economics and mography at harvards school of public health while sachs formerly at harvard is director of the earth institute at columbia university and special advisor to the secretary general on the millennium development goals according to bloom and sachs at the root of africas impoverishment in our view lies its extraordinarily disadvantageous geography which has helped to shape the nature of african societies and africas inter actions with the rest of the world throughout the old world and the new world tropical regions have lagged far behind the temperatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32489crs8 23 bloom and sachs point out that the climat is moderated by monsoon rains or locations near the sea in tropical countries that are out performing africa in south and southeast asia 24 bloom and sachs p 23 25 paul collier and jan willem gunning why has africa grown slowly journal of economic perspectives 13 1999 26 bloom and sachs p 5regions in economic development and subsaharan africa is by far the most tropical of all the major regions in the world economy in the simple sense of the highest proportions of land nd population in the tropics23 moreover in several dimensions climate soils topography and disease ecology its environment is without parallel in raising obstacles to growth the consequences include chronically low agricultural productivity especially in food production high disease burdens and very low levels of international trade with trade concentrated in few primary commodities they further point out th at the earths highest centrations of people are in the northern latitudes creating larger mark ets there and offering higher payoffs to innovation in subsaharan africa itself much of the population in eastern and southern regions is concentrated on the inland plateau where higher cooler elevations make for healthier environment and better farming prospects but this raises what economists call transaction costs since the products of the highlands must be transported to the coasts before they can be shipped abroad transaction costs would be lower if people were concentrated at the coasts but the highest population densities are in rwanda and bur undi deep in the interior africas relatively low population densitie s overall and low levels of urbanization raise the relative costs of providing infrastructure such as roads and telecommunications24 bloom and sachs with other authors point out that much of africa is arid or semi arid and subject to recurrent drought that africa lacks rivers that are navigable from the interior all the way to the sea and that much of africas coastline lacks good natural harbors finally ag ain with other authors they note that several countries with significant economic potential such as uganda zambia and zimbabwe are landlocked placing them at perman ent disadvantage in world trade in subsequent article pa ul collier professor of ec onomics at oxford and jan willem gunning professor of ec onomics at the amsterdam ins titute for international development worried that the bloom and sachs approach might create the impression that slow growth is africas destiny25 they point out that switzerland is landlocked but prosperous as is bo tswana and argue that africa has certain advantages such as those noted above w wages potentially attr active to investors and location closer to most developed economy markets than asia acknowledging many of the problems described by bloom and sachs collier and gunning insist that african economies could grow if they changed their policies to attract investment an issue discussed below the extent to which there is disagreement between bloom and sachs on the one hand and collier and gunning on the other on these issues is unclear since bloom and sachs insist they believe emphatically26 that policy matters and that past mismanageme nt of policy by african governments has indeed been an obstacle to growth in nother coauthored pape r sachs argues that africas physical geography difficult as it is does not pose an

bloom and sachs believe that economists have tended to neglect the impor tance of geography and that good policies should take geog raphic realities into account enclaves and the resource curse david leonard and scott straus authors of africas stalled development note particular problem in africa enclave productionwhich entails the export of primary products such as minerals oil or stateproduced agricultural products from small geographic area28 leonard is dean of international and area studies at the university of california berkeley where straus former journalist based in frica is graduate student corrupt leader can thrive on the revenues deri ved from such production while doing nothing to boost overall productivity or wealthgeneration in society at large thus they argue mobutu sese

collecting foreign aid as the countrys economy disintegrated29 leonard and straus also point out that enclave economies have contributed to the conflicts that have troubled number of african states in the postindependence era30 many of these conflicts they argue as in sierra leone or the drc can be understood as contests between warlords and governments over control of enclave resources in quantitative study paul collier and colleague anke hoeffler have conf irmed that primary commodity exports can finance unrest and make rebellion feas ible and perhaps even attractive31 petroleum resources are coming in for particular examination worldwide as natural resource curse that leads to corruption weakens institutions and undermines both democracy and pr ospects for economic growth32 thus many are calling for measures to compel oilpr oducing countries to produce accurate and timely reports on oil revenues as first step in assuring that oil income is used to promote social and economic development catholic relief services in 2003 report argues that without greater transp arency in the petroleum sector africas increasing oil revenues in the years ahead may only worsen the

p 24 36 bloom and sachs p 25 can best be spent34 in this way per capita incomes would rise and the oil income would be kept away from government where it can be siphoned off through corruption delayed demographic transition africa like other developing regions achieved sharp declines in child mortality when modern public health practices and technologies were introduced after world war ii35 unlike other regions however africa did not subsequently undergo dem ographic transition from situation of high child mortality and high birth rates to one of low mortality and low birth rates instead birth rates remained high giving the region an unusually large proportion of children under 15 as compared to adults in their most productive working years 15 64 table 1 the reasons for the absence of demogr aphic transition in subsaharan africa may include the continuing value of child ren as source of labor in smallholder subsistence farming and as source of support in old age some speculate that socio cultural norms favoring larg families may remain unusually strong in africa due to the regions long history of losing large numbers to famine disease and the slave trade36 africas large population of childre n who can contribute little to production makes it all the more difficult for the region to make gains in per capita income and places heavy burden on education systems table 1

demographic transition of the classic sort seems unlikely to occur in the near future since the rate of fertility remained above 5 ch ildren per woman in 2002 far above the replacement rate of 21 and th population growth rate was at 22 per year rate that would double the populati on in just over 30 years the population growth rate is slowing somewhat probably reflecting the impact of the aids pandemic see below but demographic transition achieved through aids would be disastrous since the di sease primarily kills adults in their productive years consequently the proportion of children to working adults already large could increase further httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32489crs11 37 world bank can africa claim the 21st century washington 2000 p 44 38 delanyo dovlo the brain drai n and

development prospects recent authoritative data on the scale of the brain drain appear to be lacking but the world bank estimated in 2000 that 23000 professionals leave africa each year37 in 2002 according to one study 7915 african nurses applied for work permits in the united kingdom alone38 l arge numbers of physicians scientists and academics also leave africa to work abroad principally in europe and north amer ica those who depart may send home remittances from their foreign earnings to their families and to some extent the loss of expertise is made up for by foreigne rs brought in under development assistance programs39 but clearly the annual loss of sk illed personnel on large scale reduces africas capacity for dealing with its deve lopment problems resolving the brain drain problem would likely require not only hi gher salaries for professionals but also improvements in the quality of life including reductions in crime and enhancements in social services notably health care and education40 historical burdens many analysts believe that the 400year african slave trade must in some way lie in the background of africas econo mic difficulties an estimated 11 million africans were taken away in the atlantic slave trade and millions more were taken to the middle east and elsewhere41 the captives were typically in their most productive years just as is the case with those taken by the aids pandemic today and africa was deprived of the contributi on they might have ma to development moreover the traders brought firearms nd munitions into africa to be exchanged for slaves and these contributed to political instability as did the raids and wars waged by africans trying to acquire captives for the trade42 leonard and straus believe that the slave trade left behind

continent except liberia and ethiopia under european control while colonial rule brought some infrastructure and education to africa scholars are generally quite negative in assessing its impact the overall effect of the colonial era in their view was to leave the vast majority of africans with very low incomes and very low rates of savings in sort of poverty trap from which the continent has had difficulty escaping44 some point out that the european coloni zers expected the colonial governments they established in africa to operate on shoestring budgets so that when governance was transferred to africans the newly independent governments though coercive like their colonial pr edecessors tended to have very limited capabilities45 colonial governments were dedicat ed to extracting profits from africa for european elites rather than to the development of the people in the colonized territories setting pattern that may have influenced african elites when they took power transportation infrastructure was designed to facilitate the extraction of commodities from the interior of individual colonies to the sea rather than to promote the economic developm ent and integration of regi ons

the basis for the ethni c conflicts and divisions that trouble many african states today50 government capabilities according to many experts slow growth in africa has resulted in significant measure from the weakness of african g overnments nico van walle professor of political science at michigan state university is one of the leading proponents of this view he writes that since independence there has been progressive loss of state capacity51 african civil services are characterized by pervasive absenteeism endemic corruption politicization declining leg itimacy and low morale lowskill positions tend to be overstaffed with seve ral officials doing the work of single individual while highskill positions are left unfilled because of the absence of viable candidates at prevailing wages administrative services are plagued by the resignations of high number of th eir most experienced managers who have left for better paying jobs in the private sector working for donors or in the increasingly important private sector brain drain from the region is massive problem the resulting low state capacity has been major obstacle to development according to van walle52 van walle and others are concerne d that african governments do not depend on taxes raised among the population and ve little capacity to collect such taxes but rather rely on clientelism taxes on commodity exports and foreign aid to remain in power in this sense govern ments are not connected to their people and need not respond to the needs of the pe ople for economic development and higher incomes according

cynical implication that state officials politicians policymakers and bureaucrats do not have the slightest sense of duty leading to the denigration and vilification of african civil serv ants and their demoralization55 they fear that the van walle approa ch has led donors to the conclu sion that foreign institutions should take over the drivers seat in africa as result they maintain while

controls and an expansion of the civil service by the early 1980s consensus was emerging among development experts that this stat ecentered approach to development had been mistake and was responsible for th growth setbacks africa was experiencing this consensus was crystallized in the world banks 1981 report accelerated development in africa by elliott berg which argued that marketoriented domestic policy reforms were essential to returning africa to the growth path by the mid 1980s according to van walle bergs findings now known as the washington consensus had come to be widely accep ted among western development experts58 the washington consensus in broad term s called for the withdrawal of african governments from the economies of their c ountries through priv atization removal of price controls and other forms of mark et regulation free trade and free exchange rates to be accompanied by fiscal discip line in the form of balanced budgets and civil service cutbacks ravi kanbur formerly chief economist in the africa division at the world bank and now at cornell university points out that during the 1980s and 1990s many of the reforms advocated under th washington consensus were adopted59 it is now generally recognized that ther have been tremendous advances in key areas such as exchange rates and import quotas black markets in foreign exchange have basically disappeared from africa as have import licenses price controls in general are thing of the past but kanbur agrees with van walle and others in arguing that reforms in africa have not gone far enough in such areas as privatization civil service reform and financial market reform thes deeper reforms part of what is known as structural adjustment have been onl partially achieved van walle argues so that for example in some countries it can still take months to register new company and licenses and approvals may still require some sort of side payment60 according to van walle governing elites have resisted delayed and reshaped reforms that might threaten their sources of income and power privatiz ation has moved ahead slowly partly because many in africa continue to believe that strategic enterprises should be in state hands and b ecause of infighting among the elite along factional and ethnic lines over how shares will be distributed from this point of view

there are some critiques of the view that free market policy reforms are the key to faster growth in africa john sender professor of economics at the university of london argues that the fiscally

the nations economy by regulating th financial system setting minimum wages setting safety standards for the workplace nd other measures protection of infant industries with governmentimposed tariffs stiglitz argues played an important role in economic development in the united states and japan62 critics also maintain that in focusing on cutbacks and austerity the washington consensus failed to recognize the importance of building capabilities in africa van walle is in agreement on this point arguing that the reforms required of african governments trying to conform with the washington consensus meant cuts in public investment budgets even though inves tment was critically needed in road maintenance health facilitie s and other infrastructure during the 1990s according to this view states struggling to conform with donor demands for structural adjustment became far less capable of res ponding to the needs of the poor in health and education accord ing to van walle 63 the striking thing about the first decade of adjustment was the extent to which the longterm needs of institution buildin g in subsaharan africa were forgotten both by donors and by governments themselves the decay of the civil service was allowed to accelerate national statistics collection systems deteriorated and were all but gutted in some countries and little or attention was paid to the dismal quality of the judicial system although again it varied in quality across the countries of the region van walles view reflects what s eems to be the new consensus on african development among western

forthcoming in the foreseeable future given competing prior ities seems unlikely to many observers although advocates defend such an increase as good investment in africas stability and the welfare of its people they not that at the 1992 earth summit at rio janeiro the developed countries reaffirm ed their commitment to the united nations target of 7 of gdp as the appropriate level of development assistance they should be providing109 if met this target would make available substantial new assistance resources but critics point out that as of 2003 developed count ries were providing just 41

peacekeepers for example that are not counted as part of oda in any event some development experts might have reserva tions about large boost in aid to africa because of thei r concern over the phenomenon of aid dependence brautigam and botchwey argue that when country is heavily dependent on aid donor goals and vision can come to substitute for those of countrys lead ership foreign experts and technical assistants substitute for public institutions providing plans programs and policies the deep involvement of aid donors in the affairs of the government mean that accountability can become something between government and external actors rather than between government and its people110httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32489crs27 111 ibid p 29 112 world bank can africa claim the 21st

these outcomes is inevitable and recommend variety of m easures to reduce aid dependence like other experts they suggest abandoning project aid under which donors carefully supervise the expenditure of funds for speci fic projects and replacing it with aid for programs supervised by african gove rnments once underlying policy and governance fundamentals are in place111 the world bank argues that recipient country ownership of development prog rams is being promoted by the poverty reduction strategy paper pr sp process that is part of the hipc debt relief program112 prsps describe the po licies and programs count ry will pursue in order to promote growth and reduce poverty and prsp must be completed with the help of representatives of the bank and the imf before country can enter the program the papers are seen as requiring the governments to set their own priorities and to take responsibility for their own developm ent plans thus reducing aid dependence selectivity is the current watchword among large number of development experts who argue that aid is likely to be used most effectively and with least risk of aid dependence if it is focused on select ed governments with sound institutions and policies113 craig burnside and david dollar of the world bank in the seminal paper on this issue argued that their statistical analysis showed that aid had positive impact on growth in what they see as g ood policy environments featuring the free market practices transparency and fis cal discipline supported by the washington consensus they also found that thr ough the mid1990s b ilateral donors were not targeting aid to such environments although multilateral agencies were114 looking at the entire decade of the 1990s in follo wup paper burnside and dollar found that both bilateral and mu ltilateral donors were targeting countries with good policy environments115 underscoring the degree to which the selective approach to providing aid had become the consensus strategy it forms the basis of the administrations millennium challenge account which in the words of president bush is devoted to projects in nations that govern justly invest in their people and encourage economic freedom116 andrew natsios the administrator of the us agency for international development told the senate foreign relations committee in march 2003 that the themes of govern ance and country

cites similar findings by others the burnside and dollarresults are fragile and can disappear when different time periods are studied and different definitions of the variables are used easterly who regards the quantity of aid currently available as small maintains that there is next big idea that will make the small amount of foreign aid the cat alyst for economic growth of the worlds poor nations 119 burnside and dollar however in their followup paper respond that in their new data set extending throug h the 1990s the relationship between aid and economic growth in good polic environments is robust another concern is that selectivity may tend to reduce aid to most african countries and most african people since few countries can m eet rigorous policy environment criteria the millennium challenge corporation mcc which administers the millennium challenge ccount uses sixteen publicly available indicators including corruption index and an estimate of the number of days required to open new business to assess eligibility for the program120 in may 2004 the mcc announced that 8 african countries had met the require ments benin cape verde ghana lesotho madagascar mali mozambique and senegal this was more than many had expected and the frican countries made up half of the 16 qualifiers worldwide some analysts noted however that the african qualifiers account for

for improvements in the quality of aid such aid would have modest goal simply to benefit some poor peopl some of the time he urges donors to find ways of channeling ai d that will he lp poor people directly through smallscale water projects for example124 some see microcredit programs as an effective way to channel resources directly to the poor these programs make small loans to poor people often women to help them undertake incomegenerating activities125 debt forgiveness the various problems posed by africas debt have led some activists to call for complete debt cancellation the jubilee 2000 campaign claims that it collected 24 million signatures on petitions asking the developed c ountries to cancel the unpayable debts of the worlds poorest countries by the year 2000 though ultimately unsuccessful the campaign which remains active claims credit for the limited debt reduction that has occurred126 the american friends service committee continues to work for complete debt forgiveness for africa through its life over debt campaign127 the 50 years is enough campaign is also seeking 100 debt forgiveness128 some campaigners note that the administration is urging the international community to write off the vast majority of iraqs debt and argue that consistency should require similar treatment for africa administration officials however see iraq as uniquely in need of deep debt reduction129 as an alternative to complete forgiven ess some propose that debt sustainability should be determined not in terms of expor t earnings but in terms of the resources country requires to achieve the millennium development goals debt should then be forgiven to the extent necessary to provide these resources130 some analysts alsohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32489crs30

debt stock that is 150 of annual export earnings should permit country to repay its bts while at the same time allowing expenditures to be made on povertyreduction programs and social investments sponsors maintain there is evidence that th program has been successful in reducing debt stock and debt service paymen ts while boosting social spending133 another benefit of the program cite d by proponents is that afri can countries benefit from the planning and prioritizing that goes along with completing their prsps in preparation for debt relief moreover some maintain that the hipc process allows african countries to maintain their creditworthin ess which might be damaged by any sort of bankruptcy proceeding by assuring that the multilaterals will eventually be repaid the hipc process helps maintain stock of capital that can be lent out for development purposes in the future134 some also doubt that debt forgiveness or sharply expanded debt forgiveness woul d be politically feasible in the donor countries if like the hipc program it wa s based on donors paying into central trust fund in order to buy down the debts of poor countries some donor governments might object that such payments as well as additional foreign aid aimed at realizing the mdgs would be too great burden in view of competing priorities nonetheless critics see the hipc process as proceeding much too slowly for the african countries and as leaving the contin ent with too great burden of debt as of march 2004 7 african countries had r eached the completion point at which promised debt relief actually becomes ava ilable achieving reduction of about 7 billion in the stock of debt measured in terms of net present value and about 13 billion in debt service relief135 meanwhile 16 were still moving

agricultural research is already credited with the introduction of improved varieties of sorghum sweet potatoes ma ize rice and other crops173 meanwhile there is an expectation by many that recombinant dna technology or genetic engineering can produce genetically modified crops that are resistant to weeds pests and disease as well as rich in nutrients recombinant technology might also be used to develop vaccines and produce medicines cheaply174 biotechnology is controversial in bot h developed and developing countries because of health and environmental i ssues and this could tend to limit its contribution to african growth skeptics worry moreover that it may lead to the introduction of western monoculture in fa rming that will destroy indigenous crop varieties175 some are also

regions history and in the limitations imposed by its geography and demography africa has been vulnerable to global econo mic trends and this too has set back development politics have played their role as well as many governments in the postindependence era adopted ineffective or counterproductive growth strategies and later were slow to adopt needed reforms trade barriers debt corruption armed conflict and the hivaids pandemic have imposed their own burdens nonetheless development ex perts and advocates see number of strategies that might move the continent forward including increased aid deeper debt forgiveness reduction in trade barriers and variety of other measures including an expansion of hivaids programs increased privat investment and an intensification of research and development programs focused on africas needs each of these approaches has its limitations as we ll as its doubters and critics although reports and studies continue to urge that an integrated approach encompassing range of measures could contribute to an economic recovery in africa whether existing development institutions are up to the challenge is an issue currently in debate though it has not focus of this report according to georgetown universitys carol lancaster who has served in africa positions both at usaid and the department of state the primary problem is the lack of capacity on the part of aid agencies to undertake the kind of interventions they have attempted with the amount of aid they have attempted to disperse180 william easterly has written forcefully

operating at the international vel although their work is coordinated to an extent in various internationa l fora and through consultations in any event some argue that strengthening and expanding existing institutions is likely to be more effective than creating new institutions in promoting development185 in short while there are many obstacles to development that seem specific to africa itself and its position in the global economy there may be other difficulties in the very agencies responsible for help ing africa as result africas ability to escape its current economic d ilemma remains in question as does the ability of the united states to realize its humanitarian economic and security objectives in the region
