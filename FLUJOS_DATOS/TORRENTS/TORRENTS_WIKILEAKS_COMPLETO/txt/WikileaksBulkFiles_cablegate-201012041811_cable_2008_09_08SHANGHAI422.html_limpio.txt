department of state reason 14 b d 1 snf summary xxxxx are concerned about the current impasse in the sixparty talks but each varies in his diagnosis of its causes and prescriptions for us policy xxxxx claims that debate has emerged within the chinese leadership over the merits of quick us delisting as result of pyongyangs allegedly incomplete nuclear declaration these xxxxx agree that for the moment none of north korean leader kim jongils three sons is likely to be tapped to succeed him xxxxx north korea in august questions the world food programs wfp forecast of an imminent famine there end summary 2 u xxxxx korean politics and the ongoing sixparty talks xxxxx deadlock over verification 3 c xxxxx are concerned about the current impasse in the sixparty talks but each varies in his diagnosis of its causes and prescriptions for us policy xxxxx view washington is primarily responsible for north korean footdragging under the action for action framework xxxxx argues the united states promised to remove north korea from the state sponsors of terror list and trading with the enemy act twea restrictions in return for complete nuclear declaration from pyongyang after forty days it became legally possible for washington to delist the north koreans in august but this did not occur xxxxx continues the united states seems to want international inspectors to be able to access north koreas nuclear sites virtually at whim and to meet with its nuclear scientists these conditions have given pyongyang an excuse for their present inaction xxxxx north korea is truly disappointed with this development its leaders believe they did something and are owed something in return and xxxxx opinion it is difficult for the other sixparty states to blame them 4 snf xxxxx on the other hand dissents from this view according xxxxx the nuclear declaration north korea submitted in may was incomplete xxxxx claims that critical information about secret underwater nuclear facilities located on north koreas coast for this reason debate has emerged within the chinese leadership over the merits of quick us delisting xxxxx continues one camp believes that continued momentum in the sixparty talks is critical to their success and has concluded that washington must adopt more flexible attitude the other camp however has taken the incomplete nuclear declaration as evidence that the regime in pyongyang is truly ticking time bomb and regard washingtons tough stance on verification as potential opportunity to finally deal with persistent regional irritantxxxxx does not believe the united states should delist north korea yet though he argues washington needs to find some token action it can take now to demonstrate its good faith 5 c xxxxx is confident that if the united states removes north korea from the state sponsors of terror list and the twea even absent progress on verification protocol its negotiators will act quickly to reciprocate and permit some form of verification that north korea has been labeled state sponsor of terror is an ongoing source of embarrassment for the regime xxxxx argues and washington must not underestimate its desire for face xxxxx agree that despite north koreas recent moves to apparently renew its activities at the yongbyon nuclear complex including its removal of international atomic energy agency iaea seals on equipment pyongyangs threats are largely for show as part of the sixparty process the regime has already taken significant steps toward nuclear disablement xxxxx out so north korean leaders cannot shanghai 00000422 0022 of 003 actually accomplish very much in the short term kim jongils health 6 c regarding kim jongils kji purported ill health xxxxx admit they have been unable to divine what has actually happened noting such information is top secret even to north koreans xxxxx claims that kji has long history of recreational drug use that has resulted in frequent bouts of epilepsy and contributed to his poor health overall xxxxx recalls hearing an unconfirmed report that in the last several weeks team of five chinese physicians traveled to pyongyang perhaps to tend to kji xxxxx cautions against reading too much into what he considers pure speculation even if kji suffered some medical emergency illness does not necessarily mean he is dying or has lost political control or that regime collapse is somehow imminent 7 c at the present time xxxxx considers it likelier than not kji remains in charge and is making political decisions xxxxx is less certain quoting reports that long time consort and former secretary kim ok may be caring for kim and overseeing policy on his behalf kji puts lot of confidence in kim ok notes xxxxx recalling that she was member of the north korean delegation led by general jo myongrok that visited the clinton white house in october 2000 contenders for future leadership 8 c there is consensus among xxxxx that at least for the moment none of kjis three sons is likely to be tapped to succeed him xxxxx considers the two youngest sons kim jongchol and kim jongun far too inexperienced and incapable of effective governance xxxxx observing that kjis oldest kim jongnam is too much of playboy kim jongchol is more interested in video games than governing and kim jongun is simply too young additionally kji had been groomed for many years to replace his father and former north korean leader kim ilsung before the latter passed away in contrast xxxxx none of the sons has received similar preparatory treatment 9 c the most likely scenario for succession xxxxx is group of north korean military leaders including civilians with close military connections taking the helm from kji xxxxx also believes the military is probably best situated to run the country at the present time still if kji remains in charge for another five or ten years beijing might then prefer to see kim jongnam who is more of known quantity than an ad hoc lineup of civilmilitary elements rise to power xxxxx 10 sxxxxx that kim yongnam kyn the president of north koreas supreme peoples assembly and second in command seems the likeliest candidate to lead new regime in recent months kyn has received foreign leaders and represented north korea at many of the same events kji would normally attend xxxxx also reports that younger brother of kyns currently heads the propaganda department position once held by kji during his ascent to power while another relative runs north koreas intelligence outfit kyn is over 80 years old xxxxx so even caretaker leadership role that fell to him would be short lived xxxxx it is interesting that kyns family is seeded in the same power positions long considered important by the current ruling kim family perils and promise of external exposure 11 c xxxxx that north korea is struggling to resolve the contradiction between its need for international engagement and desire to maintain ideological purity objectively speaking exposure to the outside world its ways of thinking and quality of life is necessary to the regimes survival xxxxx points out from pyongyangs perspective someone who has seen the world as kjis sons have might best be equipped to undertake reform in north korea on his own terms at the same time the regime has traditionally feared external influence valued ideological purity and prized ongoing closeness to the regime in its prospective cadres as result xxxxx those who shanghai 00000422 003 of 003 have traveled internationally are often marginalized within the insular north korean leadership or ousted altogether in this respect xxxxx the regime actually resembles china during its ideological heyday it is coincidence that zhou enlai and deng xiaoping who both had overseas experience were later the victims of purges at home xxxxx glimpse beyond the yalu 12 c xxxxx extremely poor quality of the main road into rajin despite its role as the key route into that city one of north koreas special economic zones sez during the 1990s the rajinsonbong sez that is also equipped with harbor xxxxx recalls watching television news program commemorating north korean military holiday that coincided with his stay and found it strange that only still photo footage aired of kji reportedly visiting military unit that day 13 c xxxxx not have the opportunity to engage ordinary north korean citizens he spoke only with his minders but remembers observing many people walking on the streets riding bicycles and generally appearing healthy and happy xxxxx recognizes that xxxxx took him only to small corner of north korea he claims he saw signs of starvation during this time xxxxx skeptical of the world food programs wfp recent assessment that north korea may soon be hit by harsh famine perhaps its worst since 1997 xxxxx argues that whatever happens regarding the food situation famine will certainly not threaten the regimes political stability asserting that north koreans will sooner die quietly of starvation than defy pyongyang comment 14 c although difficult to verify xxxxx our discussions suggest variety of chinese opinions regarding how best to approach the north korean nuclear dilemma consensus on the subject continues xxxxx camp
