spending accounts fsas are benefit plans established by employers to reimburse employees for health care expenses such as deductibles and copayments fsas are usually funde d by employees through salary reduction agreements although employers are pe rmitted to contribute as well the contributions to and withdraw als from fsas are taxexempt historically health care fsa contributions were forfeited if not used by the end of the year however in 2005 the in ternal revenue service irs formally determined that employers may extend the deadline for using unspent balances up to 2½ months after the end of the plan year ie until march 15 for most plans the tax relief and health care act of 2006 pl 109432 llows individuals to make limited onetime rollovers from balances in their health care fsas to health savings accounts in the 110th congress as in previous congresses legislation has been introduced to permit part or all of remaining balances to be rolled over to accounts next year or to qua lified retirement accounts according to the 2006 medical expenditure panel survey 53 of privatesector employees could establish health care fs the accounts were not as common for workers in small businesses in establishments with fewer than 50 employees 9 of workers had access compared with 70 of workers in establishments with at least 50 employees access is more common 81 for state and local government employees however only minority of employees with access to an fsa actually participate in july 2003 fsas became ava ilable to federal employees for the first time in september 2008 bout 240000 federal employees had health care fsas these other points might be not ed about health care fsas fsas are limited to employees and former employees the irs imposes dollar limit on health care fsa contributions but employers generally do fsas generally can be used only for unreimbursed medical expenses that would be deductible under th internal revenue code but not for health insurance

plans which is available through the irs website httpwwwirsgovhealth care flexible spending accounts health care flexible spending acc ounts fsas are employerestablished benefit plans to reimburse employees for sp ecified health care expenses as they are incurred they arose in the 1970s as wa to provide employees with flexible benefit at time when the cost of health care was growing concern in contrast to traditional insurance plans fsas generally allow employees to vary benefit amounts in accordance with their anticipated health care needs fsas can be used for unreimbursed medical expenses and contri butions to fsas have tax advantages however fsa contributions are generally forfe ited if not used by the end of the year although employers may extend the deadline for using unspent balances up to 2½ months after the end of the plan ear ie march 15 for most plans this report1 describes fsas the basis for thei r tax treatment nd data on their use2 the report concludes with brief discussion of recent presidential and legislative proposals affecting fsas background fsas are employerestablished benefit plans that reimburse employees for specified expenses as they are incurred they usually are funded through salary reduction arrangements under which empl oyees receive less takehome pay in exchange for contributions to their account s employees each year choose how much to put in their accounts which they may use for dependent care adoption assistance or for medical and dental expenses howe ver there must be separate accounts for these three purposes and amounts unused at th end of the year must be forfeited to the employer if fsas meet these and ot her rules contributions are not subject to either income or employment taxes the focus of this report is on the fsas devoted to health care to illustrate the tax savings consider health care fsa funded for an employee through salary reduction arrangement before the start of the year the employee elects to reduce his salary by 75 month in exchange for contributions of thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32656crs2 3 the tax relief and health care act of 2006 pl 109432 provided that individuals may make limited onetime rollovers from balances in their fsas to health savings accounts 4 if the employees earnings exceeded the social security wage base 102000 in 2008 the only savings would be 13 from medicare taxe s ie 900 x 0145 reductions in social security taxes due to fsa salary reductions could affect the social security benefits that the worker later receives though not by much 5 in 2008 the 15 bracket for single filers applies to taxable income that is after exemptions and deductions are subtracted of over 8025 to 32550 for married couples filing jointly the bracket extends from over 16050 to 65100 the 25 brackets for these taxpayers are from over 32550 to 78850 and from over 65100 to 131450 respectively 6 the breakeven point for an employee in the 25 bracket who contributes 900 would generally be 606 ie 900 minus income tax savings of 225 and employment tax savings of 69 the employee comes out ahead if unreimbursed expenses exceed that amount assuming they would have been incurred in th absence of the fsa if expenses would not have been incurred except for the fsa then th breakeven point generally would be higher since the employee presumably values the obtai ned services at less than the market priceamount to the fsa other employees might choose to contribute more or less than 75 throughout the year as the employee incurs medical and dental expenses not covered by insurance or other payments he may use funds in the account to pay them his total draw which must be available at the start of the year is limited to 900 the sum of his monthly contributions for the year if all 900 is used the first nine months for example he cannot replenish the account until the next year any amount that remains unspent at the end of the year or after the 2 ½ month extension if available is forfeited to the employer3 if the fsa was funded by the employer as sometimes is the case the employees draw must similarly be available at the start of the year it is possible for fsas to be funded both by salary reductions and employer contributions if the employee were in the 25 tax bracket the federal income tax savings from the 900 salary reduction used to fund the acc ount generally would be 225 ie 900 x 25 in addition the employee could save 69 in social security and medicare taxes ie 900 x 07654 there could be state income tax savings as well if the employee were in the 15 tax brack et the federal income tax savings would be 135 threefifths as large while if he were in the top 35 bracket they would be commensurately greater 3155 the employer would also save 69 in employment taxes from the 900 salary reduction employers often use these savings to help pay the expenses of administering an fsa tax savings can exceed losses due to forfeiture of remaining balance at the end of the year thus not all of an account must be used for employees to come out ahead financially since tax savings are greater in the higher tax brackets higher income employees may be less concerned about forfeitures assuming they recognize they could still be better off than lower income employees6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32656crs3 7 in addition cafeteria plans may include some taxable benefits like cash these are taxable if the employee selects them 8 for critical discussion of the internal re venue services interpretation of constructive receipt with respect to employee benefit pl ans and section 125 see leon irish cafeteria plans in transition tax notes december 17 1984 pp 11351136 9 for many years the code had explicit reference to fsas the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 pl 104191 added definition in subsection continuedthe tax savings associated with health care fsa are not unlike those for traditional comprehensive health insurance which also allows employer payments to be excluded from the income and employ ment taxes of the employees as well as from the employment taxes of the employer basis for tax treatment fsas are one way that employment benefits can be varied to meet the needs of individual employees without loss of favor able tax treatment flexible benefit arrangements generally qualif for tax advantages as caf eteria plans under which employees choose between cash typically takehome pay and certain nontaxable benefits in this case reim bursements for health care expe nses without paying taxes if they select the benefits the general rule is that when taxpayers have an option of receiving cash or nontaxable benefits they ar taxed even if they select the benefits they are deemed to be in constructive receipt of the cash since it is made available to them section 125 of the internal revenue code provides an express exception to this rule when certain nontaxable bene fits are chosen under cafeteria plan7 fsas and cafeteria plans are closely related but not all cafeteria plans have fsas and not all fsas are part of cafeteria plans fsas are considered part of cafeteria plan when they are funded through voluntary salary reductions this exempts the employees choice between cash the salary subject to reduction and normally nontaxable benefits such as hea lth care from the constructive receipt rule and permits the latter to be received free of tax8 thus instead of receiving full salary for example 30000 the employee can receive reduced salary of 29100 with 900 fsa contribution and will need to treat only 29100 as taxable income however if fsas are funded by nonelective employer contributions then their tax treatment is not governed by the cafeter ia plan provisions in section 125 in this situation the employee does not have choice between receiving cash and normally nontaxable benefit instead the benefits are nontaxable since they are directly excludable under some other provision of the code for example nonelective employerfunded fsas for depe ndent care are taxexempt under section 129 while nonelective employerfunded fsas for health care are taxexempt under sections 105 and 106 regardless of how they are funded rules regarding fsas are not spelled out in the internal revenue code9 rather they were included in proposed regulations thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32656crs4 9 continued 106c2 when it disallowed coverage of longt erm care services through such accounts 10 49 federal register 19321 may 7 1984 49 federal register 50733 december 31 1984 and 54 federal register 9460 march 7 1989 the proposed regulations were not finalized but they remained the position of the irs with the august 2007 proposed rules cited earlier in this crs report the irs forma lly withdrew these proposed regulations the rules cover both fsas funded by salary reductions and fsas funded by nonelective employer contributions although em ployers generally do not permit annual reimbursements from fsas to exceed the amount sl ated for contribution during the year the proposed regulations do not require this the proposed regulations allow maximum annual reimbursement of up to 500 of th total annual contribution or premium including both employ erpaid and employeepaid portions of the contribution to the fsa an fsa operating in this way would be more sim ilar to typical health insurance in that the maximum benefit is not limited to the years contribution total however such an fsa would still differ from typical health insurance in that the maximum benefit is relatively low 11 65 federal register 15548 march 23 2000 and 66 federal register 1837 january 10 2001 the rules apply to cafeteria plans genera lly not just fsas the rules allow midyear election changes for changes in status mar ital status number of dependents employment status place of residence and significant ch anges in cost or coverage however midyear election changes for health care fsas are not allo wed for cost or coverage changes since the plans must exhibit the riskshifting and riskdis tributions characteristics of insurance these rules only permit employers to allow midyear changes they do not require them 12 thus an employer might refund the same dollar amount to every participant even though some used all their benefits while others forfeited unused amounts the internal revenue service irs i ssued for cafeteria plans in 1984 and 198910 final rules regarding circumstances in which employers may allow employees to change elections during plan year we re issued in march 2000 and january 200111 to be exempt from the constructive receipt rule participants must not have cash or taxable benefits become currently available they must elect specific benefits before the start of the plan year and be unable to change these elections except under specified circumstances with respect to health care fsas the maximum amount of reimbursement reduced by any benefits paid for covered expenses must be available throughout the coverage period coverage periods generally must be 12 months to prevent employees from contributing just when they anticipate having expenses reimbursements must be only for medical expenses allowable as deductions under section 213 of the code claims must be substantiated by an independent third party expenses must be incurred dur ing the period of coverage after yearend forfeitures any experience gains the excess of total plan contributions and earnings ove r total reimburse ments and other costs may at the employers discretion be returned to participants or used to reduce future contributi ons provided individual refunds are not based on participants claims12 andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32656crs5 13 54 federal register 9460 q and 7 some of the seven requirements listed in the text had been issued in 1984 14 72 federal register 43938 august 6 2007 15 5000 limit applies to dependent care fsas the latter are governed by section 129 which includes that limithealth care fsas must exhibit the riskshifting and riskdistribution characteristics of insurance13 the effect of the irs rules is to allow only forfeitable fsas under which employees lose whatever they do not spend each year the rules disallow three other types of fsas that had star ted to spread before 1984 benefit banks which refunded unused balances as taxable compen sation at the end of each year zebras or zero based reimbursement accounts under which reimburseme nts were subtracted from salaries each month thus re ducing taxable compensation at the time it was paid and ultimate zebras under which salaries already paid were recharacterized at the end of the year into reimbursements and ta xable compensation neither zebras nor ultimate zebras had accounts th at were funded and they we re criticized as abusive arrangements in august 2007 the irs issued new proposed rules for cafeteria plans that will generally be effective on january 1 2009 though taxpayers may adopt them sooner these rules have not yet been finalized14 the irs rules lay out what is permissible with respect to fsa plans but employers may add their own requirements for example the irs does not limit the amount that an employee can be reim bursed through health care fsa but employers may establish their own ceiling15 one reason they might do so is to limit the financial risk that employees might resign having received reimbursements that exceed their contributions similarly employers may exclude certain elective expenses from their plans fsas can provide tax savings for the fi rst dollars of health care expenditures that people have each year similar to the ta x savings associated with comprehensive insurance plans having neg ligible deductibles and copayments however taxpayers normally are allowed to duct outofpocket medical expenses only to the extent they exceed 7½ of adjusted gross income and then only if the taxpayer itemizes deductions the more favor able treatment for fsas might be justified since participants generally assume additional financial risk for their health care some might question however whether the savi ngs are proportional to the risk and whether they are equitable among people of similar incomes httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32656crs6 16 office of personnel management incremental summary for 2005 benefit period 17 us department of health and human serv ices office of the assistant secretary for planning and evaluation study of cafeteria and flexib spending accounts july 1985 pp 18 and 20 the study was mandated by sec tion 531b6 of the deficit reduction act of 1984 pl 98369 the three prototype hea lth plans on which the study was based had continueddata on use few surveys ask about fsas and thos that do obtain only limited information although surveys yield similar findings about the availability of fsas little is known about the number and characteristic s of workers who participate the 2006 medical expenditure panel survey meps found that 21 of privatesector establishments offered an fsa to their workers fsas are more common in larger firms they were offered in 67 of establishments with 50 or more workers but in only 5 of smaller establishments similarly greater percentage of employees had access to an fsa if they worked in large firm instead of small one in firms with fewer than 50 employees 9 of workers had access compared with 70 of workers in firms with at least 50 employees overall 53 of privatesector employees could establish an fsa according to this survey fsas are more likely to be offered in large firms than they were two years ago in 2004 62 of largefirm establishmen ts offered fsas compared with 67 in 2006 according to the 2006 meps more than lf 53 of privatesector employees have access to an fsa while 81 of state and local government employees do in july 2003 fsas became available to fe deral employees for the first time in september 2008 there were about 240000 federal health care fsas16 according to 2006 survey by mercer human resources consulting 81 of employers with 500 or more employees offe red health care fsa and an average of 20 of eligible employees participat ed among employers with 10 or more employees 30 offered health care fsa and an average of 36 of eligible employees participated the av erage amount contributed was 1208 reasons for low fsa participation include employee perceptions of complexity concerns about endofyear forfeiture s and limited employer encouragement younger employees particularly if single may not have enough health care expenses to make participation worthwhile for lower income employees the tax savings may be inconsequential the modest participation vels suggest that early concerns about the extent to which fsas would reduce tax revenue ma have been exaggerated in 1985 congressionally mandated study concluded that forfeitable fsas would increase health expenditures by pproximately 4 and 6 pending on an employees health plan and that revenue ss would be 7 billion in 1983 dollars17 howeverhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32656crs7 17 continued deductibles of 00 150300 and 150300 for i ndividuals and families respectively 15

the statutory provisions for these benefitsthe study assumed that all employees with employmentbased health insurance would eventually have fsas moreover the revenue estimate did not reflect any reduction in health care use from additional cost sharing requirements that employers sometimes impose when implementing fsas these reductions would partially offset increases in health care use due to funding fsas with pretax dollars18 principal rules regarding fsas eligibility eligibility for fsas is limited to employees whose employers offer plans people who are selfemployed or unemployed generally cannot participate however former employees can be eligible provided the plan is not established predominantly for their benefit19 employers may set additional conditions for eligibility fsas allow coverage of spouse and dependents fsas do not have to be linked with any particular type of insurance though it is said some employers establish fsas in order to win employee acceptance of greater costsharing in plans with higher deductibles contributions fsa contributions may be made by em ployers through nonelective payments employees through salary reduction plans or both fsa contributions occur during the plan year which is usually calendar year since most fsas are funded through salary reductions contribu tions typically occur prorata throughout the year the irs imposes specific dollar limit on health care fsa contributions though plans typically have dollar or percentage maximum for elective contributions made thr ough salary reductions20 employers set limits to reduce losses from employees who quit or die when their withdrawals which might total the years allowable draw exceed their contributi ons from salary reductions for 2008 each federal employee may contribute up to 5000 to his or her health care fsa httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32656crs8 21 allowable expenses are discussed in irs publication number 502 medical and dental expenses available through the irs website at httpwwwirsgov 22 since employees control how much is contribut ed through salary reduction plans in effect they can carry over amounts they do not anticipate using by not putting them into the account in the first placequalifying expenses under irs guidelines health care fsas can be used for any unreimbursed and unreimbursable medical expense that is deductible under section 213 of the internal revenue code with seve ral important exceptions21 one exception disallows their use for longterm care and for other health insurance coverage including premiums for any employer plan second excepti on is that fsas may cover nonprescription drugs employers may add their own limitations the restriction against paying health insurance premiums can be circumvented if the employer offers parate premium conve rsion plan this arrangement allows employees to pay their premiums through what are deemed to be pretax salary reductions for example if employees pay 600 year for health insurance with their employer paying the balance thei r payment can be considered to be made directly by their employer and so ex empt from income and employment taxes instead of included in their wages and so taxable premium conversion plans are common among businesses that offer health insurance particularly among large companies the federal government imp lemented premium conversion plan in october 2000 nonqualified withdrawals fsa funds may be used only for qualifyi ng expenses as defined above they generally cannot be withdrawn for othe r purposes to ensure compliance reimbursement claims must be accomp anied by written statement from an independent third party eg receipt from health care provider one exception to the rule prohibiting nonqualified withdrawal s is that military reservists called to active duty for at leas t 179 days or for an indefinite period may receive some or all of the unused funds in their account employers are permitted but not required to allow these withdrawals carryover of unused funds historically fsa balances unused at the end of the year were forfeited to the employer they could not be carried over22 on august 23 2004 senator grassley then chairman of the senate committee on finance requested the treasury department to assess whether it had the authority to modify the use or lose it rule without directive from the legislative branch on december 23 2004 treasury secretary john w snow responded by letter that congress had eff ectively ratified the rule and that changes woul d require legislative actionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32656crs9 23 irs notice 200542 available through th irs website at http wwwirsgov 24 irs notice 200722nonetheless on may 18 2005 the irs issued notice that employers may extend the deadline for using unspent balan ces up to 2½ months after the end of the plan year ie until march 15 for most plans23 fsas are still subject to the use it or lose it rule however the notice allows employers to offer access to the fsas for up 14½ months instead of 12 months the rationale for the new notice is ba sed on other benefits covered under the section of the internal revenue code d ealing with cafeteria plans section 125 cafeteria plans may not include benefit that defers comp ensation which is the basis of the use it or lose it rule however according to the new notice payment from plan is not considered deferred compensa tion even if the payment occurs after the end of the plan year if that payment occurs within short limited period after the end of the plan year the notice cites other regulations and rulings stating that benefits are not considered deferred if they are received by the employee on or before the fifteenth day of the third cale ndar month after the end of the employers taxable year that is march 15 consiste nt with these other areas of tax law treasury and the irs believe it is appropriate to modify the current prohibition on deferred compensation in the proposed regu lations under 125 to permit grace period after the end of the plan year dur ing which unused benefits or contributions may be used the employer has the option to offer this 2½month grace period but is not required to do so for implementation the cafeteria plan document must be amended to include grace peri od and the period must apply to all participants in the plan the irs notice does not alter other features of fsas so at the end of the applicable grace period unused balances still must be forfeited to the employer employers initial reaction to the rule change has been mixed with some welcoming the added flexibility but others concerned about add itional administrative burdens and exposure to in creased financial risk the tax relief and health care ac t of 2006 pl 109432 provided that individuals may make limited onetime rollovers from balances in their fsas to health savings accounts irs guidance issued in february 2007 provides details about the conditions under which these tran sfers can occur among other things employees must elect to make qualified hs distributions by the last day of the plan year reimbursements can be made to employees afte r that last day and the hsa distribution cannot exceed the lesse r of the balance in the fsa on 1 september 21 2006 or 2 the date of the distribution24 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32656crs10 25 archer medical savings account s msas could also be added to this list but since they have largely been replaced by hsas they were not included in this

with other health accounts it is possible for individuals to have health care fsa along with other tax advantaged health accounts health savings accounts hsas and health reimbursement ccounts hras25 however employers must coordinate how multiple accounts are used so that the ligibility requirements are not violated health care fsas cannot be used to pa the deductible of an hsas qualifying high deductible health insurance as result the fsa for those with an hsa must be either limited purpose fsa or postdeductible fsa limited purpose fsa is one that pays only for preventive car and for medical care not covered by the hsas qualifying health insurance for exam ple vision and dental care post deductible fsa is one that does not pay or reimburse any medical expense until the deductible of the hsa s qualifying health insurance has been met for those enrolled in an hra and fs at the same time the accounts cannot pay for the same expenditures amounts in the hra must be exhausted before reimbursements may be made from the fs except for qualifying expenses not covered by the hra when person is rolled in an hra and an fsa there is federal requirement that the fsa be limited in purpose or postdeductible however the employer has the authority to implement such policies as well as to require that the fsa be exhausted if the hra must also be exhausted before the arrangements health insurance begins hsas and hras are offered to federa l employees and annuitants through the federal employees health benefit program fehbp federal health care fsa is also available to federal employees t hough not to annuitants for 2005 the us office of personnel management opm pr ohibited enrollees in fehbps hsa or hra options from enrolling in health care fsa starting in 2006 however health care fsa limited to vision and dental care became availabl for enrollees with the hsa option starting in 2007 federal rollees can purchase separate vision and dental insurance as well health care fsas can conflict with the objectives of hsas and hras people with fsas receive tax advantages for the first dollars of health care expenditures without assuming the additional risk associ ated with the high deductible insurance that is required of hsas and that usua lly accompanies hras while they cannot carry over fsa balances for use in later ears this might not make much difference to those who would not be building up hsa or hra balances anyway as consequence those who believe that enrollment in high deductible health insurance should be encouraged might oppos further incentives for fsashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32656crs11 current legislation in the 110th congress as in previous congre sses bills have been introduced to allow unused health care fsa balances to be carried over

ealth care fsas could continue without the tax exclusion ie employees could divert part of their taxable wages into an account to be used for health care expenses but it is not obvious who would want to have them it is not clear what would become of current restrictions on health care fsas under the presidents proposal the elimination of health care fsas is part of the presidents broader proposal to replace the tax exclusion for employer paid health insurance with new standard deduction for health insurance whether the elimination is sirable public policy should be evaluated in the context of that larger proposal similarly identifying who would be aided or penalized by the elimination of health care fsas should be seen in the context of the larger proposal the next congress may consider legisla tion to expand health insurance coverage to people who are uninsured possibly comprehensive health care reforms will also be considered what role fsas might play in these initiatives is likely to be of interest to employers and employees alike
