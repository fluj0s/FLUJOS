530b requires federal prosecutors to follow state and federal rules of professional responsibility in effect in the states where they conduct their activities it also continues in place the sixty year old directive that federal prosecutors follow the ethics rules promulgated by the states in which they are licensed to practice proponents claim the change will confirm that federal prosecutors must follow the same ethical rules as other lawyers and will enhance the prospect of some protection against wayward federal prosecutors opponents charge that it will implicitly undermine the attorney generals authority to preempt state laws that conflict with federal law enforcement interests and that in doing so it will jeopardize the use of undercover techniques against terrorists drug kingpins and child predators because of possible interpretations of the socalled contact rule under the contact rule accepted in virtually every american jurisdiction lawyer in representing client may not communicate about the subject of the representation with person the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer or is authorized by law to do so the rule was designed to prevent lawyers from taking unfair advantage of their untutored opponents the justice department is troubled by judicial interpretations of the rule that indicate that it may apply 1 in criminal cases prior to arrest or indictment 2 to federal prosecutors whose only contact is through informants cooperative witnesses undercover agents or federal investigators 3 even though the represented client initiated the contact or 4 to contacts with the employees or agents of an organizational target of federal administrative and civil investigation the courts have thus far repudiated the efforts of the department to craft an exception for federal prosecutors administratively similar concerns stimulated by rules covering the disclosure of exculpatory evidence to the grand jury and the use of grand jury subpoenas against attorneys seem to have been eased by internal guidelines and more favorable jurisprudence at its heart the debate involves

would note however that in response to our concerns the leadership has inserted provision which will delay the implementation of this provision for six months at the very least this will give the department of justice and others the opportunity to educate the congress as to the serious effect this blanket provision will have on law enforcement it is my hope and expectation that during the next

ranking minority member the senate judiciary committee greeted section 801s passage with dismay9 during the 106th congress senate hatch introduced legislation repealing the amendment and codifying the requirement that federal prosecutors adhere the ethical standards of the bar to which they were admitted s25010 the subcommittee on criminal justice oversight of the house committee on the judiciary held hearings but further action was taken11 apparent points of disagreement while single source in the legislative background supplies full explanation or even full identification of the issues reflected in the mcdademurtha amendmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30060crs5 the legislative record taken as whole reveals the positions of proponents and opponents proponents maintain there are instances of federal prosecutorial abuse traditional checks on federal prosecutorial abuse have eroded the courts have been increasingly reluctant to use their supervisory powers to prevent or correct prosecutoria l abuse the check once afforded by scarce resources longer applies the incentives for abuse have become more attractive the judicial remedies available for prosecutorial abuse retrial are costly and do little to discourage or punish overzealous prosecutors the department of justices system of self discipline has not been effective the disciplinary mechanisms available for enforcement of standards of conduct for the legal profession offer an impartial means of deterring and punishing prosecutorial abuse the disciplinary mechanisms are more effective if they can be invoked where the abuse occurs rather than where the prosecutor is admitted to practice the attorney general lacks authority claimed by the justice department to waive the ethical standards to which federal prosecutors must otherwise adhere the enforcement of standards of professional conduct poses threat to effective federal law enforcement should such threat develop the appropriate response is federal legislation critics contend there are few instances of federal prosecutorial abuse charges of prosecutorial abuse are the work defense lawyers attempting to encumber effective law enforcement the justice department has an effective internal means of dealing with any wayward federal prosecutors federal prosecutors have and will continue to observe the highest standards of professi onal conduct but under the guise of ethical standards states have introduced policy determinations in conflict with existing federal policies into the rules ie contact rules that hamstring undercover and other legitimate investigative techniqueshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30060crs6 12 eg 144 cong rec h7229 daily ed aug 5 1998 remarks of rep murtha insidious and unethical tactics used against rep mcdade id at

the amendment disagree on its effectiveness there are at least in theory more than few devices to prevent and correct prosecutorial abuse the courts are perhaps the most obvious source they have authority to control criminal trials to exclude improperly secured evidence to overturn convictions to order new trials and to punish contempts committed before them by fine suspension from practice before them removal from particular case andor admonishments and reprimands the primary purpose of federal criminal trial however is to determine whether the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt buttressed by tradition and the constitution the courts have long exercised control over the proceedings to ensure that the determination is made fairly if prosecutors misconduct so infects trial as to render any verdict uncertain and unfair or otherwise breaches constitutional barriers the courts will respond16 in the absence of clear constitutional violation however the federal courts following the lead of the supreme court have shown growing reluctance to use their supervisory powers to exclude evidence dismiss indictments or reverse convictions in order to prevent prosecutorial overreaching17 yet courts and commentators alike have noted general judicial failure to embrace the alternatives to exclusion dismissal and reversal18httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30060crs9 of alternative

less convenient to contest this can be especially telling in the case of federal prosecutors who need not be licensed in the jurisdiction in which they are appointed nor in every jurisdiction in which they perform their duties the amendment seeks to overcome this difficulty by requiring federal prosecutors to follow the ethical standards of any jurisdiction in which they conduct their duties critics challenge not the effectiveness of the proposal but as discussed below at greater length whether federal law enforcement interests ought to preempt state dictates at least under some circumstances objections to the amendment the basic objections to section 801 seem to address what it does not do and what it portends rather than what it does the 1996 hearings on virtually identical language contain perhaps the clearest statement of the department of justices objections to passage of the amendment concern over state regulation of federal law enforcement and repudiation of the departments claim of authority to preempt state pronouncements that conflict with federal law enforcement interestshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30060crs12 hr 3386 does however have the potential to seriously compromise the publics interest in effective law enforcement among other things the bill could seriously hamstring the departments ability to conduct undercover investigations the primary manner in which hr 3386 would affect federal law enforcement would be by implicitly cutting back on the attorney generals preemption power although the department requires its attorneys to comply with state ethics rules the attorney general currently has the power to preempt those rules when they conflict with federal law enforcement and interfere with her ability to conduct necessary law enforcement operations by silently overriding the attorney generals power in this area hr 3386 could effect at least two important and undesirable changes in current law first it would leave federal law enforcemen t vulnerable to hostile state ethics rulings or decisions that interfere with the enforcement of federal law several states for example have tried to use ethics rules to alter the nature and function of the federal jury for example by dictating to federal prosecutors what evidence they must present to grand jury or by requiring that prosecutors obtain judicial approval before obtaining subpoenas for evidence from attorneys second and related consequences of hr 3386 would be to call into question the departments regulation on contacts with represented persons historically when investigations were carried out exclusively by the police and federal investigator ethics rules governing attorneys contacts with represented persons did not interfere with the legitimate needs of law enforcement lawyers simply werent involved over the past decades prosecutors have increasingly become more involved in the early stages of criminal investigations generally overwhelmingly the judicial response has been to recognize that contacts rules do not apply to prosecutors engaged in preindictment law enforcement investigations nevertheless prosecutors have increasingly faced contactsbased challenges to law enforcement techniques that were previously unquestioned over the past decade these developments have resulted in two highly significant problems for federal prosecutors first the expansive application of the contacts rule in some jurisdictions has threatened legitimate and essential law enforcement activities second federal prosecutors are facing

york department store owner based on the suspicion that he was claiming medicaid reimbursement for the sale of orthopedic shoes in instances when he had in fact sold ordinary shoes hammad retained the services of lawyer in connection with the matter and the prosecution knew he had done so the prosecutor armed goldstein one of hammads shoe suppliers with fictitious grand jury subpoena purporting to call goldstein as witness in the hammad investigation goldstein then engaged hammad in incriminati ng conversations that were surreptitiously tape recorded and videotaped by bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms agent after hammad was indicted for medicaid fraud mail fraud and obstruction of justice he moved to suppress the tapes based on an asserted violation of the contact rule adopted by new york bar authorities the resulting district and appellate court opinions brought into focus three of the four points at which interpretation of the contact rule might be thought to imperil existing or emerging law enforcement practices application during an investigation but before the client has been arrested or charged with the crime under investigation application to not only prosecuting attorneys but also to police undercover agents informants and others working with prosecutors and the sanctions are appropriate when violation occurs left for another day was the question of the rules application in the case of clients who are also potential witnessesinformants the district court concluded that under the circumstances at hand the contact rule applied even before an arrest or indictment that the rule applied because goldstein who was not lawyer had acted as the prosecutors alter ego and that suppression of the evidence was an appropriate sanction for violation of the rule united states v hammad 678 fsupp 397 edny 1987 the court of appeals rejected suppression as an appropriate sanction but agreed that the rule might be violated by informants acting as alter egos of the prosecutor prior to the clients arrest or indictment in its first more sweeping statement of violative preindictment conduct it declared that clearlly clandestine interrogation by an assistant united

ethical obligation to disclose exculpatory evidence to the grand jury the ethics of the legal profession have long demanded that attorneys address the courts candidly55 in this vein rule 33d of the aba model rules of professional conduct notes that in an ex parte proceeding lawyer shall inform the tribunal of all material facts known to the lawyer which will enable the tribunal to make an informed decision whether or not the facts are adverse in its comments upon the special duties of public prosecutors under rule 38 the aba makes it clear that the obligations of rule 33d include the responsibility of prosecutors to disclose exculpatory evidence to the grand jury prosecutor has the responsibility of minister of justice and not simply that of an advocate this responsibility carries with it specific obligations to see that the defendant is accorded procedural justice and that guilt is decided upon the basis of sufficient evidence precisely how far the prosecutor is required to go in this direction is matter of debate and varies in different jurisdictions many jurisdictions have adopted the aba standards of criminal justice relating to prosecution function which in turn are the product of prolonged and careful deliberation by lawyers experienced in both criminal prosecution and defense see also rule 33d governing ex parte proceedings among which grand jury proceedings are

consequences within the justice department of failure to comply in united states v williams 112 sct 1735 1992 the supreme court held that the federal courts supervisory powers over the grand jury did not include the power to make rule allowing the dismissal of an otherwise valid indictment where the prosecutor failed to introduce substantial exculpatory evidence to grand jury it is the policy of the department of justice however that when prosecutor conducting grand jury inquiry is personally aware of substantial evidence that directly negates the guilt of subject of the investigation the prosecutor must present or otherwise disclose such evidence to the grand jury before seeking an indictment against such person while failure to follow the departments policy should not result in dismissal of an indictment appellate courts may refer violations of the policy to the office of professional responsibility for review united states attorneys manual

substantial evidence that directly negates the guilt of subject of the investigation the prosecutor must present or otherwise disclose such evidence to the grand jury before seeking an indictment

is not privileged attorneyclient communication 2 while subpoena which seeks client billing records requires authorization subpoena which seeks internal law office business documents pay records of law
