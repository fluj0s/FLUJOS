funding slamer as requested reduced the jassm request by 4 million and increased the jsow request by 64 million these standoff munitions programs were funded in fy1999 and fy2000 essentially as requested with minimal differences between the house and senate in regard to these programs however there are continuing differences between the air force and the navy as to funding priorities and military requirements for jassm slamer and jsow issues before congress include the relative cost and performance of these missile systems tradeoffs between performance and cost that may be acceptable perceptions of inventory requirements emphasis on development of standoff munitions at the expense of other defense programs and whether derivatives of current munitions should be procured pending development and production of more advanced standoff missiles that may be needed in post2010 threat scenarios the quest for capable and affordable stando ff airtosurface missiles poses number of interrelated issues for congress in evaluating the proposed alternatives 1 the advantages of an entirely new design versus derivative of currently operational munitions or designs in fullscale

lethality have become matters of major emphasis in us defense plans since the 1991 gulf war and its aftermath of sporadic air attacks on iraq which highligh ted the value of airtosurface munitions that could be launched from safe standoff ranges and guided to their targets with precision the value of such munitions was further demonstrated by operations in the balkans in 1995 and 1999 during natos 78day air campaign against yugoslavia march 24june 10 1999 35 percent of the munitions delivered were precisionguided munitions pgms compared to 10 percent of those used in the 1991 gulf war1 the downsizing of us forces in the 1990s also underlined the need for more effective and accurate standoff weapons for smaller force structure in highthreat situations where the advent of more effective air defenses is expected to make delivery of airtosurface munitions increasingly difficult moving some of the tasks of weapons delivery from the aircraft to its munitions is seen as an effective way to attack welldefended enemy with reduced risks to us and allied forces2 similar results can be achieved with seabased or landbased missile systems that are not considered in this report on airlaunched airtosurface munitions3 standoff missiles with high accuracy and lethality raise the possibility of precision strikes deep in enemy territory with less risk of us and allied casualties and less likelihood of collateral damage to civilians advocates of programs to develop such weapons have emphasized their greater standoff launch range intended to keep us and allied forces out of harms way as well as their joint use by two or more services expected to reduce unit cost via shared development and highvolume procurement in general however the greater the standoff range the more expensive the missilehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30552crs2 4 braybrook roy surgical precision from safe distance armada international may 1994 p 810 morrocco john pgm strategy faces budget technical

although the procurement cost is somewhat offset by the smaller number of pgms needed to destroy target4 efforts to develop munitions with greater range accuracy and lethality have faced many obstacles including competing budgetary priorities major technological problems and differing perceptions of service requirements in regard to types and inventories of munitions maintaining program continuity to develop workable and affordable systems has thus been major challenge commonality of munitions to be launched by airsealandbased platforms has often been frustrated by conflicting service requirements for weight safety guidance and communications for example weight is more critical for airdelivered munitions than land or shipbased munitions safety factors are more critical aboard ship than on airbases and the services often use different guidance and communications systems effectiveness in adverse weather or darkness and resistance to jamming or other countermeasures also pose serious technological challenges to the development of standoff munitions5 the development and procurement of precisionguided airlaunched standoff munitions has been linked to the issue of buying more than the currently projected number of b2 stealth bombers longrange strategic aircraft based on an institute of defense analyses ida study of future bomber requirements the defense department concluded in may 1995 that it would be more costeffective to develop and procure more accurate standoff munitions than to buy more b2 bombers advocates of continued procurement of the b2 challenged the conclusions of this study however arguing that munitions programs have generally been underfunded in the past and are not likely to be adequately supporte d in future years some general accounting office gao analysts have also questioned the affordability of currently projected inventories of standoff missiles and precisionguided munitions pgms arguing that these may not be as inexpensive to develop and procure as predicted and questioning projected inventory requirements6 it has also been argued that standoff missiles and pgms if procured in adequate quantities could reduce requirements for stealth technology in new aircraft such as the f22 and fa18ef and the proposed joint strike fighter jsf according to this view munitions with greater standoff range would not require as much stealth radar evasion features in the launch aircraft yielding considerable savings in aircraft cost proponents of nextgeneration combat aircraft argue however that stealth aircraft

1994advanced fightera ttack planes will be needed for the most combateffective use of whatever standoff munitions may be available given the problems of technology and cost in acquiring pgms the numbers of pgms procured have often been reduced in the face of questionable performance rising costs or competing budgetary priorities that tend to favor aircraft over munitions finally it must be noted that the focus of this paper precise airtosurface missiles shoul d not be interpreted as either advocacy for or an indication of movement totally away from dumb bombs in the us arsenal it is expected that unguided or less than precisely guided airtosurface weapons will continue to be the weapons of choice well into the foreseeable future for variety of targe t sets in general military planners wish to destroy given target with the least expensive weapon possible ie seeking to avoid killing fly with sledge hammer dumb bombs cost less in some cases much much less than pgms and will remain as effective or even more effective than pgms against stationary unhardened targets where collateral damage is not likely also area munitions such as bomblets and combined effects munitions will long remain effective against highly mobile targets such as infantry and armor triservice standoff attack missile tssam program the agm137 triservice standoff attack missile tssam was to have been stealthy cruise missile launched from air force and navy aircraft as well as army launchers weighing about 2300 lb with 1000lb warhead it could have attacked heavily defended targets at ranges of over 100 miles and its allaspect stealth features would have made radar detection from any direction difficult if not impossible7 when the tssam program was canceled it was in fullscale development by the northrop grumman corporation development began in 1986 as classified triservice program for the air force navy and army with these services then planning to procure some 9000 missiles over five years in 1994 however the army withdrew from the tssam program stating that its requirements for longrange surfacetosurface missile would be better served by the mgm140 atacms army tactical missile system which was used in the 1991 gulf war by 1994 the tssam programs projected quantity was down to 4156 missiles 3631 for the air force 525 for the navy which would be procured over 11 years with development and test problems delaying the program about three years the estimated program cost rose from 89 billion in 1986 to 139 billion by late 1994 49 billion for development and 9 billion for procurement and military construction the procurement cost of each missile rose from an estimated 728000 in 1986 to an estimate of more than 2 million in 1994 some 35 billion had

precisionguided munition pgm programs defense analysts generally agree that some future combat scenarios will require better airtosurface munitions than those currently available9 since cancellation of the tssam program air force officials have emphasized that the service still needs standoff attack missile with similar characteristics that can be procured at lower costs according to this view such missile would enable launch aircraft to attack highvalue and welldefend ed targets while staying beyond the range of enemy defenses which are expected to be more robust than those of iraq in the1990s given the availability of russian air defense capabilities such as the sa10 surfacetoair missile system as well as some advanced european and chinese air defense systems the search for affordable and effective standoff missiles has involved derivatives of operational or developmental missiles that can provide some of tssams promised perfor mance at an acceptable cost such derivatives would be used in the interim prior to successful development and fielding of new joint airtosurface standoff missile jassm for the air force and the navy airlaunched standoff munitions

jointservice effort to develop missile to be carried initially by air force f16s and b52s and later by such aircraft as air force b1s b2s f15es and f117s and possibly by navy fa18efs the fa18ef was originally expected to use jassm but the navy has not funded the necessary modifications for the missile to be launched by the fa18ef15 the navys lack of interest in the jassm program is due to the fact that the navy has an alternative in an ongoing upgrade of its standoff land attack missile slam known as the slamer expanded response version after tssams demise the navy shifted its funding for tssam into the slamer program although since fy1998 navy funds earmarked for tssam have been used in the jassm program the navys procurement of jassms was projected in 1996 as just under 1000 missiles

estimated the missiles unit cost at around 375000 which would still be less than the 1996 procurement price goals of 400000 to 700000 per missile18 the air force views affordability as important as capability in the jassm program with the three most critical performance features being the missiles range its mission effectiveness and its ability to be launched from numerous and varied aircraft operational requirements have been described as including standoff launch range outside the enemys area defenses over 100 miles and reportedly 150180 miles precision accuracy eg within about eight

joint airtosurface stando ff missile should be substantially increased and the jassm should be high priority for integration on each of the bomber types21 in letter to congress on april 9 1998 secretary of defense william cohen stated that based on the defense depa rtments congressionallydirected analysis of alternatives he believed jassm would be more survivable lethal and costeffective than slam derivative against highpriority highly defended targets during the first phases of war accordingly he made available to the jassm program about 40 million of the funds provided in fy 1998 to pursue devel opment of slam derivative known as jslam to be used by both air force and navymarine corps aircraft secretary cohen added that both the jassm program and the navys slamer program would continue in the near term since slamer is proven and has demonstrated performance against many jassm targets and because jassm is not yet available may be too heavy weighing about 2300 lb to be carried safely in carrierlandings and lacks slamers pilotintheloop avionics capability22 in approving jassms entry into engineering and manufacturing development emd on november 9 1998 under secretary

derived from the alcm such as calcm would be considered nucleararmed and any us aircraft equipped to carry such missiles would count as 10 nuclear warheads under start i limits regardless of the number of missiles carried and their type of explosive unless that treaty were renegotiated the inventory of these cruise missiles was significantly reduced in the course of the nato air campaign

congressional issues the quest for capab and affordable standoff airtosurface missiles poses number of interrelated issues for congress in evaluating the proposed alternatives 1 the advantages of an entirely new design versus derivative of currently operational munitions or designs in fullscale development 2 acceptable tradeoffs between perceived performance requirements in regard to range payload accuracy and stealth 3 projecte d inventory requirements for future combat scenarios 4 the development and production costs and the delivery schedules of proposed alternatives and 5 reliance on interim standoff munitions pending development of new systems perceptions of threat situations that might require standoff munitions affect considerations of these issues it can be argued that nearterm threats require large inventories of affordable and readily available munitions with acceptable degrees of standoff capability precision guidance and warhead lethality it can also be argued that it is necessary to invest in the development and acquisition of more advanced weaponry that may be needed over the longer term which would include standoff munitions able to resist jamming and electronic interference and with stealth features to reduce detection by radar as well as greater range and speed capabilities than are currently available in addition to defense needs other considerations will be the budgetary impact and the effects of proposed alternatives on the us industrial base in some cases the selection among competing proposals and the awarding of development and production contracts may involve regional economic effects as well as transatlantic economic interests each of these proposals will need to be evaluated in light of the best guestimates about future threat environments combat requirements and budgetary priorities in evaluating contractor proposals and service plans for standoff munitions congress may consider some of the following lines of inquiry when and in what threat scenarios and combat conditions would the proposed standoff munitions be needed by us military forces what kinds of targets could be most costeffectively destroyed by the proposed munitionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30552crs21 what types of us aircraft could deliver these munitions and with what payloads what countermeasures to prevent accurate guidance of these munitio ns to their targets could potential enemies take and how could such countermeasures be frustrated what are the estimated costs of developing and producing the proposed standoff muniti ons total acquisition costs and unit production costs when would these munitions be available in sufficient quantities for use in major regional conflict what types and inventories of standoff munitions would be needed for specific conflict scenarios how would the development cost and delivery schedule of standoff attack missile that could be used by both air force and navy planes compare with that of one to be used by only one of these services what standoff munitions now in production could be relied on while something better is being developed and produced in quantities that might be needed what would be the regional economic implications of developing and producing the proposed munitions in regard to employment and the defense industrial base what would be the most costeffective mix of air land and sea based platforms for the delivery of standoff munitions in various combat scenarios navy ships and submarines can launch both the slam and tlam missiles which are applicable to the same target sets as airlaunched weapons these launch platforms enjoy some advantages over landbased aircraft but have negative aspects as well what is the best overall mix of weapons comparing standoff munitions every standoff missile program whether new start or an upgrade of current model faces an array of conflicting forces eg competing contractor interests different service priorities

jassm slamer jsow agm142 agm130statue milesfigure 1 estimated range of standoff weaponswhich may preclude or impair objective analysis of the relative capabilities and costs of these missiles given such problems this report does not attempt to provide rigorous comparison of speci fic performance and cost differences among the missiles discussed although some performance features are compared in general terms all of these munitions are subsonic traveling at less than the speed of sound mach 1 which varies with altitude eg 762 miles per hour mph at sea level and 664 mph at 35000 feet range is obviously critical performance factor in comparing standoff munitions effective range varies however with the altitude of the launch aircraft depending on launch altitudes the stated ranges of the systems discussed here would be as follows some 700 miles for calcm up to 180 miles as projected for jassm up to about 150 miles for slamer and about 40 or 50 miles for jsow agm 142 and agm130 depending on available basing options for launch aircraft as well as specific combat scenarios and targets each of these standoff munitions could be used effectively with longer range being better in regard to flexibility and targeting the combat effectiveness of standoff munitions is largely dependent on such performance factors as the lethality of the warhead and the proba bility of target penetration although numerous factors can contribute to lethality and the ability of missile to reach its target two simple formulas might serve as useful ways of comparing standoff munitions lethality may be measured by the following formula payloadcep circular error probability lethality in general the most lethal missile for instance would be one with very small cep and large payload formula for meas uring the probability of target penetration would be flight profilercs radar cross sectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30552crs23 penetration probability the flight profile refers to the altitude and speed of the missile and the altitude speed and maneuverability of the launch aircraft missile with large flight profile for instance would be able to fly at variety of altitudes be maneuverable and able to fly very fast given the rising cost of muni tions and aircraft and prevailing budgetary constraints cost has now become as critical factor as performance reflecting this view the concept of cost as an independent variable equates cost with performance as criterion in the choice of missile system or its launch platform thus tolerable cost is compar able to the price that the market will bear and the greater the perception of threat requirements the higher the tolerance of cost conclusions there are several interim solutions to requirements for airlaunched standoff munitions that can be delivered by us fighterattack planes and longerrange bombers in the short term some of these munitions could be funded while the services are developing more advanced precisionguided standoff missiles that may be needed in post2010 conflict scenarios if such future munitions can be developed and procured at affordable prices there may be less need to buy as many combat aircraf t as currently projected thus there may be tradeoffs between funding requirements and perceptions of the costeffectiveness of various aircraftmunition combinations whether us strike capabilities from the air should be based on cheaper platfo rms with more expensive missiles than are now available or on some combination of each has been posed by some as basic issue for instance following the effective use of the b2 during the kosovo conflict many in congress and elsewhere are wondering which combination of aircraft and weapons would be most cost effective against the preponderance of targets us warfighters are likely to face relatively expensive penetrating bomber like b2 armed with relatively inexpensive weapons like jdam joint direct attack munitionor relatively inexpensive stand off bomber like the b52 armed with relatively expensive weapons like the calcm for now the dod procurement and rd programs described above seem to provide us warfighters with some
