obtain their local and long distance tele phone services their highspeed internet services and their video rvices from competing technol ogies the convergence of previously distinct markets has required co mpanies to seek strategies for holding on to their traditional customers while seeking new ones one of those strategies is for companies to offer bundles of traditional and new services at single price that often represents discount off the sum of th prices of the indivi dual services these bundled service offerings are favored by many consumers they provide the convenience of one stop shopping and in some situations by providing the full panoply of services at fixed price make it easier for consumers to comparison shop they also are favored by many providers because they tend to reduce churn the rate at which customers shift to competitors and allow providers to exploit economies of scope in marketing but bundling also can create public polic issues for congress the bundled offerings typically provide some combination of interstate telecommunications services intrastate telecommunicati ons services and nontelecommunications services information services video services and even customer premises equipment for single price the fe deral universal servi ce fund the federal subsidy program that assures affordable telephone rates for hi ghcost rural and lowincome telephone customer s as well as for schools libraries and rural health facilities is supported by an assessment on interstate telecommunications revenues only but it is difficult to identify th portion of revenues generated by bundled service offering attributable to the interstate telecommunications portion of that bundle there is unambiguous way for providers to assign portion of the bundled price to interstate telecommunicati ons services or for fund administrators to audit that assignment in addition some taxes are assessed upon one or more but not all of the services included in various bundl ed service offerings this creates the same assessment and auditing problem for these taxes as exists for the federal universal service fund this has important policy implications at time when many members of congress seek to shelter intern et services which often are included in these bundles from taxation without placing any group of providers at competitive advantage or disadvantage some observers have been concerned that bundled rvice offerings could have anticompetitive consequences if they foster industry consolidation or if provider has market power for one of the services in its bundled offering and can use that offering to tie that service to competitive service in fashion that reduces competition for the competitive service leaders in both the house and

competitive entry and market convergence have increased the churn rate for all providers the costs associated with customer churn are substantial providers face up front costs to capture and serve

to foster competitive entry section 252d3 requires the ilecs to make th eir retail services available to new entrants at wholesale rates determined on the basis of retail rates charged to subscribers for the telecommunications service requested excluding the portion thereof attributable to any marketing billing collection and other costs that will be avoided by the local exchange carrier in implementing this requirement the fcc adopted rule instructing states to set wholesale rates by using methodology that subtracted from retail rates the ilecs embedded retailrelated costs which were in th range of 1520 of retail rates this is sometimes called the wholesale discount off re tail rates with competitive entry and the resultant customer churn however marke ting and sales costs for both entrants and incumbents have risen significantly and far exceed the 1520 discount off retail rates new entrants therefore have not found it viable to enter the market by reselling retail ilec services at the discounted wholesale rates the ilecs on the other hand have argued successfully in court that the discount off th retail price should be reduced not increased because some retail costs are fixed will not decline in proportion to the number of customers lost to the resellers and therefore will not be avoided iowa utilities ii 8th federal circuit court of appeals 219 f3d at 754 the 8th

access in order not to be impaired in their ability to offer local service this requirement that the ilecs unbundle the elements of their networks and make them available to clecs should not be

facilities from the ilec s in particular by leasing the unbundled network element une known as uneplatform or unep21 under terms set out in the 1996 telecommunications act as implemented by the fcc

httpwwwfccgovwcbstats presents data collected from both ilecs and clecs for the same period of time although it is not possi ble to directly compare the pace and fcc data they appear to describe consistent scenario according to the clecprovided data presented in table 3 of the fcc report in june 2003 585 of all clec enduser switched access lines were provided using unes 182 were provided by reselling ilec retail services and 233 were clecowned ie lfprovisioned acco rding to the clec provided data presented in table 2 of the report 62 of clec enduser switched access lines served residential and small business customers and 38 served large business customers according to the ilecprovide d data presented in table 4 of the report 13026000 of the 17231000 756 enduser switched access lines that ilecs have provided to clecs as unes were provided as part of unep as unes with switching virtually none of the access lines selfprovisioned by clecs serve residential or small business customers the exception being the unusual case of residential or small business customer being located on the same site as large business customer and virtually none of the clecs large business customers are served by resold ilec retail service ilec retail service would rarely meet the needs of large business customer also those clec large business customers not served by clecp rovisioned loops are far more likely than residential and small business customers to have been served by unbundled loops rather than unep since it is these large business customers that clecs can serve most efficiently with their own sw itching the fcc data suggest that approximately 147 of clec switched access lines used unes and served large business customers 38 minus 233 442 of clec switched lines were served by unep 585 756 and 143 by uneloop 585 minus 442 it is likely that virtually all of the 143 of clec uneloop switched access lines served large business customer s since it is far more efficient to serve these customers than residential and small business customers with uneloop thus only about 04 of clec switched access lines us ed uneplatform and served large business customers 147 minus 143 this suggest s that 438 of clec switched access lines served residential and small business custom ers using unep which would be 70 of the 62 of clec switched access lines serving residential and small business customers while this number may be slightly overstated because it implicitly assumes residential and small business customers are served by uneloops it is not out of line with the 80 pace findings the fcc data cover all clec lines the pace data cover only those lines sold as part of bundled locallong distance service offering while virtually all clecs that use unes are offering such bundles some of the cable companies which do not use unes offer local telephone service but not bundl ed with long distance service thus one would expect the figure constructed from the va rious fcc tables 70 to be lower than the pace figure 80 24 ilecs are not required to offer voice mail because it is an information service not telecommunications service and thus not subject to the 1996 acts unbundling requirements similarly privacy management services are provided through the ilecs advanced intelligent networks ain which are proprietary and which the ilecs are not required to make available to clecsofferings from clecs by including vertical features such as voice mail and privacy management to block lemarketers that are not part of the unep they are required to provide to clecs but that clecs are unlikely to be able to offer at equal quality or cost on their own24 another way that ilecs attempt to diffe rentiate their bundled service offerings from clec offerings is to offer highsp eed internet access service by using dsl technology to provide both voice and data services over the existing copper telephonehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32232crs8 25 to offer its own highspeed internet serv ice to customer over ilec lines clec must collocate its own dsl equipment dslams at particular poi nt in the

ilec location to place that equipment 26 communications daily january 8 2004 at p 6 27 in its september 2003 triennial review order the fcc ended the line sharing requirement that ilecs make the data

telephone lines have the following choices to receive both voice and internet access service from their ilec to receive voice service from their ilec and high speed internet service from provider such as covad with that internet service provider collocating its own dsl equipment in the ilecs network and leasing the data portion of the ilec line serving that cu stomer at negotiated prices that need not reflect costs27 or to receive the two services through line splitting arrangement28 under which clec that specializes in ffering highspeed internet access data service and another clec that specializes in offering voice services could jointly use the unbundled loop to provide the cu stomer both voice and internet access services this last option has allowed some clecs including att and

peed internet access or wireless service or even video service typically offer bundle of their traditional services at fixed price and then allow customers to add to that bundle by paying flat prices for additional services with the prices for those additional services typically being lower when purchased as part of the bundle than the standalone prices for those additional services similarly cable companies ty pically will supplement their subscription television offerings with highspeed inte rnet access and telephone services that have separate addon price that is lower than the standalone price for those services according to new york times article45 cable companies which face little competition from rival cable companies in many markets have great deal of leverage in pricing and are eager to ex pand their universe of highspeed internet customers because the business has higher margin than the video business cable customers who buy both the video package and highspeed internet access pay somewhat less than customers who buy only internet service perhaps more nuanced explanation for this pricing be havior is that cable companies only competitors for subscription television are the satellite companies which in most circumstances cannot offer their customers competitive highspeed internet access service cable companies thus can reduce competitive churn by offering highspeed internet service at discount that is available only when the customer also takes cable service for example cable customers who switch to directv to get their sports package likely will pay 49 for highspeed internet access from their cable company but would only have to pay 39 for that service if they bought it along with cable service46 the price for the bundle or for

falling under pressure in an effort to reduce local churn sbc has aggre ssively provided highspeed data and longdistance service at the expense of profitability49 bundling appears to be primarily stra tegy for deterring churn among high usage customers at the expense of prof it margins one possible consequence of bundling is that providers will feel the need to buttress their overall profit margins by raising the rates for their standalone services which are the services most frequently purchased by lowusage customers these customers tend to be less price sensitive than larger users and thus tend to be loyal to their traditional providers similarly lowincome and elderly customers are less likely than more affluent and younger customers to seek highspeed in ternet access and wirele ss

service fund the federal subsidy program that assures affordable lephone rates for highc ost rural and low income telephone customers as well as for schools libraries and rural health facilities is supported by an assessment on inters tate and international telecommunications revenues only50 but it is difficult to identify the portion of revenues generated by bundled service offeri ng attributable to the interstate and international telecommunicati ons portion of that bundle providers must assign portion of the bundled price to intersta and internationa l telecommunications services and the fund administrators must be able to audit the attribution to protect against companies gaming the system by unde rstating the interstate and international telecommunications portion there ofte n is way however to unambiguously assign portion of the revenues to interstate and international telecommunications and thus there is uncertainty fo r both providers and administrators this is not trivial problem with more than 40 of residential customers now purchasing bundled services and many business customers obtaining complex bundles of services or bandwidth51 it is longer simple task to identify interstate and international telecommunications revenues the federal universal service assessment on intersta and international revenues for the first quarter of 2004 is 8752 providers usually choose to recover this cost directly from their customers who would prefer to avoid the assessment providers therefore have the incentive to offer their bundled service fferings in fashion that allows them to minimize the portion of the bundled price attributable to interstate and international telecommunications reporting and auditing the interstate and international telecommunications portion of provi der revenues is difficult taskhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32232crs16 53 the universal service assessment base is total interstate and international enduser revenues

and the sufficiency of the universal service funding mechanism by th language in the act and by the fifth circuit decision57 some parties have claimed that alternative funding mechanisms would not meet the statutor requirements as interprete d by the court and that congressional action would be need ed to implement these options58 three options have been proposed to address the issues of bundling and the sufficiency of the universal service f unding mechanism expanding the assessment base to include intrastate as well as interstate and international telecommunications services replacing the current mechanis m with capacitybased assessment on all interstate connections to the public ne twork and replacing the current mechanism with an assessment on all telephone numbers the option to expand the assessment base to include intrastate as well as interstate and international telecommunications services would significantly expand the assessment base59 but would only address the reporting and auditing problems created by those bundled serv ice offerings that consist entirely of telecommunications services it would not address how to attribute the revenues from the interstate international and in trastate telecommunications portion of bundle sold at flat rate that also includes information services such as highspeed internet access video services or equipment many busine ss customers purchase fixed amount of bandwidth that they use to provide wide variety of services voice data internet access video conferencing etc currently many bundled residential offerings that include both telephone service and other services have parate prices for the non telephone services but provi ders will have the incentive to reduce the portion of the bundle subject to the universal service ssessment on telecommunications services one way to do this is to simultaneously lower the rate for the telecommunications portion of the bundle and raise the rate for the nontelecommunications portion but tie the former to the latter so that customers who do not purchase the non telecommunications services cannot take advantage of the lower telecom rate another way to do this is simply to set single rate for the bundled telecommunications and nontelecommunica tions services with the providerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32232crs18 determining the portion to be attributed to telecommunications services and thus subject to assessment given the fifth ci rcuit decision statutory change would be required to allow the fcc to impose universal service assessment on intrastate as well as interstate and international telecommunications revenues the option to implement capacitybased assessment on all interstate connections to the public network would avoid the reporting and auditing problem that currently exists for bundled service offerings because it w ould be based solely on the capacity of each enduser customer connection to the public network the fcc with guidance from congress could set assessment rates by weighing various public policy considerations to determine for example whether in order to foster broadband deployment the assessment on hi ghspeed connections at least for residential customers s hould not be set higher than that on standard voice connections or whether for equity reas ons there should be lower assessment for voice grade connections than for highspeed connections also since all end users ultimately must connect to some ne twork to communicate matter what technology they use the assessment base will be sustained over time capacity based assessment on all connections would be simple to implement and administer for residential customers but far more difficult for business customers who use many different connection c onfigurations some par ties have argued that connectionbased approach would require statutory change because some interstate carriers do not offer connections and thus ch charge would not meet the statutory requirement that all inters tate carriers contribute to the fund on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis the option to implement an assessmen t on all telephone num bers also would avoid the reporting and aud iting problem that currently exists for bundled service offerings because the assessment would be based solely on th number of telephone numbers provided to customers with each telephone number given the same weight this approach would treat more intensive and less intensive users of the public network exactly the same but there ar so many telephone numbers that the assessment per telephone number is likely to be relatively small it is possible that massive move to internet protocol tec hnology could result in many parties using addresses other than the traditional telephone num ber but presumably in that case there would be way to assess the new address some sort of address will always be needed in order to direct communications from sender to receiver since some interstate telecommunications carrier s do not provide lephone numbers some parties have argued that statutory ch ange would be required to implement telephone numberbased universal service assessment mechanism unless hybrid assessment mechanism were created that assessed on the basis of revenues those providers of interstate serv ices that do not use numbers such hybrid solution might not eliminate the need for statutory change however if the interstate services provided by those carriers are bundled in fashion that makes it difficult to identify unambiguously the interstate and in ternational revenue s generated currently bills have been introduced in congress that di rectly address the issue of the federal universal service ssessment base both section 3 of s 1380 the rural universal service equity ac t of 2003 and section 4 of hr 1582 the universal service fairness act of 2003 would require the comptroller general to submit report to congress on the need to reform the highcost support mechanismhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32232crs19 for rural insular and high cost ar eas including discussion of whether amendments to section 254 of the communi cations act of 1934 47 usc 254 are necessary to preserve and advance univers service section 4 of s 150 the internet tax nondiscrimina tion act of 2003 states that nothing in the internet tax freedom act shall prevent the imposition or collection of any fees or charges used to preserve and advance federal universal service or similar state programs authorized by section 254 of the communications act of 1934 bundling and taxes in addition to the federal universal rvice fund there are number of taxes that are assessed on one or more but not all of the services included in various bundled service offerings this creates the same ssessment and auditing problem for these taxes as exists for the federal universal service fund in particular many state and local ju risdictions assess ta xes on telephone andor video services how should those taxes be assessed on bundled services offered at flatrate that include lephone service and highspeed internet access service or cable service and highspeed internet access service how can providers identify and report and state and local tax collectors audit the taxable portion of such bundles the internet tax freedom act moratori um on taxing internet access pl 10775 has expired s 150 s 52 and hr 49 w ould make the moratorium permanent hr 1481 would extend the moratorium until 2008 since it is likely that internet access services increasingly will be bundled with ot her services that ar subject to local or state taxes if the internet tax moratorium is extended the challenge of appropriately assessing and auditing these taxes will grow bundling and competition some observers have been concerned that bundled rvice offerings could have anticompetitive consequences if they foster industry consolidation or if provider has market power for one of the services in its bundled offering and can use that offering to tie that service to competitive service in fashion that reduces competition for the competitive service although it is too early to determine which providers ultima tely will benefit most by the trend toward bundled service fferings the early market results suggest that the ilecs have been more successful at capturing long distance customers than the long distance companies have been at capturing local customers despite the fact that the long distance carriers had been able to offer bundles of local and long distance services for months or even years before some of the regional bell operating companies rbocs received fcc permission to offer long distance service within their services

griffin senior analyst with the yankee group the local providers have an edge the local relationship is worth more customers are more likely to look to the local provider for that bundled offering62 it may be too soon to conclude how this competition will play out however the rbocs success may be explained in part by the fact that for more than 20 years residential customers have been choosing among compe titive long distance carriers and thus they are not reluctant to switch to their ilec when that ilec begins to offer long distance service on the other hand residential cu stomers for the first time can choose their local provider and perhaps many simply are not yet ready to change their behavior as explained earlier bundles appeal primarily to heavy telecommunications users heavy long di stance users already are used to choosing among and changing carriers heavy local users however are just becoming accustomed to choice in local service also local service provides the lifeline to the outside and thus customers may tend to be more cautious about leaving their traditional local provider this pattern may change as customers become used tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32232crs21 63

telecommunications consumers continuedhaving local as well as long distance opti ons moreover as local and long distance telephone services become elements of larg er bundled offerings that include wireless video highspeed internet access and other services the competitive options available to consumers increasingly will come from nonwireline providers if there still are impediments to the competitive provision of one of the services included in bundled offering however bundling could allow those providers that are not constrained by those impediments to extend their market advantage beyond the market for that particular service into the markets for the other services included in the bundled offering according to study performed by coalition of small clecs63 the rbocs have 61 share of the customers currently using bundled service offerings that include both local nd long distance service and 80 of the remaining customers for bundles that incl ude local and long distance service are served by the unbundled network element known as the platform unep leased from the rbocs64 under current conditions if cl ecs were to be denied access to unep to offer local residential service many would not be able to compete with the rbocs for the provision of bundled local long distance service given the popularity of such bundled services this likely would allow the rbocs to extend their advantage in the local market by dint of their historical position as the monopoly providers with ubiquitous local ne tworks into the long distance market any harm to consumers from lack of competitive choice might be ameliorated however by the extent to which other pr oviders could enter to offer bundled local and long distance service for exampl cable companies or other potential competitors could use voice over internet protocol voip to offer competitive bundled locallong distance service such service may require customer to have highspeed internet access but the highu sage customers most attracted to bundled services often are the consumers most likely to have highspeed internet access number of clecs and clec customers have brought antitrust suits against rbocs

verizon communications inc v law offices of curtis v trinko llp 66 that failure to meet the unbundlinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32232crs22 66 continued cannot use antitrust laws to remedy acce ss violations of lecommunications act 67 communications daily november 17 2003 at p 7requirements in the 1996 telecommunications act which were intended to foster competition by aiding competitors does not meet the preexisting antitrust standards which relate only to acts that would lesse n competition and thus does not represent an antitrust violati on to the extent that access to unes are needed for the competitive provision of bundled service fferings then oversight can only be performed by federal and state regulatory agencies not by the antitrust authorities bundling also could affect the competitive environment if it provides vehicle for provider with some market power in the market for one of the bundled service elements to price in fash ion that undermines competition in the market for other services in the bundle dominant firms ty pically are constrained in their ability to practice predatory pricing or other poten tially anticompetitive types of strategic pricing against new entrants because it is very difficult to introduce selective price cuts for those customers they want to keep away from competitors without giving the same price discount to large portion of th eir customer base this could so dilute revenues and profits in the s hort term that such losses c ould not be recouped in the long term even if competitive entry were retarded or entirely eliminated to the extent dominant provider attempting to fend off competitive entry could limit the price cuts to those customers most likely to shift providers and to limited period of time the potential for anticompetitive predatory or strategic pricing increases bundling might be tool that could facilitate this for example observers have speculated that cable companies which are the largest providers of highspeed internet service might be able to impede ilec entry into that market by selectively reducing prices for their cable modem services when ilec entry is imminent such concern wa s kindled recently when comcast made targeted email offer to certain customers in california maryla nd and illinois for cable modem service at 1995 per month for year67 after the promotional period the price goes back to 4295 comcast ex ecutive vice president for marketing dave watson stated that this highly targeted email offer is test campaign aimed directly at dsl customers it is similar to other winbacktype programs weve conducted in the past this particular campaign is limited offer and we anticipate it to be onetime event as other offers of shorter duration such as 6 months have proven successful but if comcast or an other provider of highspeed internet access service or any other serv ice that is part of bundled service offering has the ability to selectively restrict price cuts to those customers most likely to shift to competitor and to the time period when competitor is entering the market some observers say then there is at least some potential for that dominant firm to strategically restrict competition in the market even if it is not practicing predatory pricing the lower prices benefit the selected customers in the short run but can be harmful to the public if they successfully forestall competitive entry consumers would then be denied the competitiondriven benefits of lower prices and more innovation in the long runhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32232crs23 another potential competitive consequence of the trend toward bundled service offerings is the incentive created for firms to consolidate in order to more efficiently provide broad bundled offerings or to deny competitors access to independent providers of services needed to offer complete bundle of services as explained earlier consumer preference for larger bundled offerings tends to favor large companies able to offer all or most of the services in the bundle on their own without reliance on independent entities but provider today has the capability of providing all these services this has fo stered marketing agreements and other relationships which could be precursor for more formal ownership consolidation such consolidation potentially reduces ad ministrative and coor dination expenses but such consolidation also potentially locks up suppliers for example consider the strategy of bundling wireline and wireless service discussed in the section on wireline wire less and video bundling strategies the three largest ilecs verizon sbc and be llsouth each have large equity interests in wireless carriers and each have bundle d offerings that combine wireless and wireline service other wire line carriers face strong mark et pressure to offer bundles of wireline and wireless services as well att has pilot program to offer bundled service in conjunction with att wireless which had been part of att but now is independent att wireless however has announced that it is accepting cingulars bid to acquire att wireless for cingular and its parents sbc and bellsouth acquisition of att wireless would provide economies of scale and needed spectrum in large markets such as new york where cingular has limited spectrum in addition such purchase w ould take away from att an
