bridge publications inc newsletter date the 1st saint hill acc indoctrination dont think youre going to get any new more marvelous strange things that are suddenly going to be dumped on your head in the middle of the course theyre not theyre not for this reason hgcs throughout the world using these processes at this time have been turning in fantastically good results and we are the last people in the world to argue with hundreds and hundreds of case results so youre not going to argue with those this time accs are normally experimentaltype courses this isnt an experimentaltype course this is the program for the uk and some other sections of the world this is were simply going to make some clears and youin the same moment teach you exactly how to make clears you can make anything else you want to with auditing thats beside the point but this exact groovemaking clearis an exact procedure it is fact right now it can be done easily and you might as well do it l ron hubbard excerpted from the 1st saint hill acc lectures recovering your causative ability on the seventh dynamic an article by l ron hubbard from the 1st saint hill acc lectures but the whole problem regardless of all its significancesfall apart on the seventh and the sixth dynamic the whole thing falls apart on the seventh and sixth the rest of these things are particularities of one kind or another now they existed and they exist as compartmented facts out along the top strata before you get an inversion now finally when the fellow gets too trapped in his own creations and so on all eight dynamics boil down to the sixth dynamic and at everything is sixth everything and theres still little seventh left though by which you can realize everything is sixth when this entirely disappears you get modern science but out of this sixth we get an inversion and the thetan tries to reconstruct or reestablish viewed and modified by his experience with the sixth the other seven dynamics in other words experience has modified his basic truth now do you get what im talking about experience has modified his basic truth he knows experience is very complicated he knows things are extremely harsh and complicated and full of duress and trappish thats fairly certain that therell be traps involved anywhere he looks that its mostly trap anyway and so on he doesnt like to get into things because you cant get out of them so they got it all rigged so its everything is easy to get into and everything is hard to get out of got the idea so we must assume basically that thetan likes to be in something but objects to not knowing what he is in and his main objection probably is along the line of his notknowingness of what he is objecting to now if you see group and theyre very badly enturbulated you can ask this group what it is upset about actually its upset because it doesnt have the gen and youll find out that any trade unionmanagement row is based upon the fact that neither the management nor the trade union have the gen and if you were to give them both bit of knowingness on the line youd tend to knock it out unless there was some more hidden knowingness lying around someplace in that the trade union was actually being pushed into it by the rival of the company theyre striking against or something of this sort then it wouldnt iron out but truth will iron out anything now these additive factors of experience and the complications of experience get us so involved that people do not disenturbulate on their time track simply by looking at the truth of the matter but the odd part of it is is that they do disenturbulate somewhat and knowing the basic datum against which they are traveling they disenturbulate rapidly the more data they inspect now what does this amount to its the seventh and the sixth and we find that person is as bad off as he has lost the ability to be causative if hes lost the ability to be causative why then he is an effect and being an effect he can cause nothing and this apparently makes him very unhappy now its then necessary to recover the causative and creative ability of the seventh dynamic with regard to the sixth dynamic before thetan is happy about it now theres where he goes and theres where he gets happy l ron hubbard excerpted from the lecture development of scientology data from the 1st saint hill acc lectures success story from the lectures after lectures one and three i learned the vital importance of the confidence of the auditor the presence of the auditor and the role this plays in session these lectures really put back the basics the data on presence is excellent ill probably listen to the fifth lecture more than once it was very snap pop and informative regarding the bank the importance of the auditor and whydata that i knew but hadnt heard lrh put it quite the way he does in this lecture he delineated factually the better auditors from the not so hot and needing improvement this acc is greatit is so full of basics lc auditor the 1st saint hill acc indoctrination recovering your causative ability on the seventh dynamic success story from the lectures 1st saint hill acc lectures altitude presence trust what every auditor must know these in fact are rons first fully embracive statement on auditor presence and altitudeessential factors by which an auditor gets the preclear to confront his case thus bringing into practical reality one of rons oldest auditing maxims auditor plus preclear are greater than the preclears bank here too was the full technology of presessioning the processes and procedures to get anyone fully insessionthat is willing to be helped in the control of an auditor in communication and interested in his own case while in what amounted to rons overriding datum he spoke of the ability to help as the greatest of human abilities and the destructive power of beings own failures to help finally and to cap it he presented theory 67 breakthrough on the 6th and 7th dynamics providing new insight into beingness havingness and why thetan introverts into the mest universe from the dawn of what ron called the jet age of scientology and the beginning of modern auditing this is rons first fully embracive statement on auditor presence and altitude and the technology to get preclear fully insession find out in these lectures how to put being in condition where hes living life hard and fast how do you gain preclears confidence how one handles the trillions and trillions of valences one has accumulated on the whole track why cant pc be audited by recording of commands or by computer what happens when people want to liveyet put dying on automatic how to get so good as an auditor that you just look at somebody and they disenturbulate what makes being invert on the 6th dynamic why

minutes how do you handle the deadly quartet in casual conversation how do you gain presence and altitude as an auditor the most basic definition of trap consisting of just two things thought and motion how do circuits and valences form why thetan feels comfortable inside body and uncomfortable outside of one hint on this onehe gets cold are there such things as good thetans and bad thetans how can you tell when the pc isnt doing the process is it better to have horrible experience and audit it out or never to have had the horrible experience in the first place whats the common denominator of mest of the bank of theta whats the best way to free prisonertake him out of the prison or tear down the prison and what does that have to do with the 6th and 7th dynamics there are 25
