is nsa fisaderived or fbi ct fisaderived while not every database contains fisaderived material it is reasonable to expect that analysts at the ccs wall perform mission with agility moving across targets and databases as mission demands and that sometimes that will mean accessing data within database that does contain fisaderived data access to these databases is restricted to analysts who hold the ragtime eci have specific need to know1 about the data stored within the databases and who are authorized by the data owner for some years ces has been the recipient of improperly markedclassified data but all analysts have been and are aware that data marked with the sigad us984j and case notation xksqf is fbi fisa data and that all other data marked with sigad 118984 is nsa fisa data ces believes that the appropriate remedy is to correct the classification of the data before it is fed into our systems this is an ongoing issue which should not impede the approval of this spf but the matter should be addressed ces will ensure that all analysts accessing these databases know that data marked with the sigad us984j and case notation xxsqf is fbi fisa data and that all

collection sv requirements nsacss tx nsacss ga and nsacss hi should commit to 1 ssi the creation of permanent fisa coordinator position to be staffed initially by person experienced with fisa procedures to ensure compliance with fisa minimization procedures build culture and climate of fisa awareness and facilitate onsite ability to train field questions and handle timesensitive fisa issues ssi nsacss tx has identified permanent fisa coordinator however that person has fisa experience the ces mission manager at tx who has fisa experience must perform oversight of ces activities

secretcomintnoforn2ö291123 s310908006 tssinf nsacss ga and ns acss hi have permanent fisa coordinators who have been supporting the counterterrorism analytic mission ces must work with those persons to ensure oversight of ces activities the fisa coordinators will ensure consistent fisa oversight across all cryptologic center activities 2 ssi the creation of core fisa workforce which at all times contains stable body of personnel who ideally have at least one years experience working fisa stable nontransient workforce ensures wellfounded culture for fisa as has been established at nsaw over many years such culture minimizes the number of fisarelated violations by reinforcing the requirements restrictions and sensitivities of accessing and processing fisa ssi the ces mission managers at texas georgia and hawaii have fisa experience and will have supervisory responsibilities over all ces employees at those sites ces will ensure that all cryptanalysts at texas georgia and hawaii will be trained on how to perform the ces mission and on how to handle sensitive materials all will be knowledgeable about ussid sp0018 and annex that describes fisa handling 3 ssi provide assurances and documentation that the onsite physical layout of terminals and the means to secure the fisa material is such that access is restricted to only cleared personnel with need for access to the fisa data ssi seating for individuals performing the cryptanalysis mission will be clustered together to ensure that they have visual and acoustical privacy for technical conversations and to ensure that their conversations and the data displayed on their computer screens is neither accessible nor viewable by those who do not have the appropriate clearances and needtoknow in addition these individuals will have one or more dedicated printers and combination safes for storage of any authorized fisa material 4 ssi provide assurances that fisa material will not be revealed or disseminated as part of site briefings or demonstrations or in any other format unless it conforms to and is handled in accordance with fisa court requirements and minimization procedures approved by the attorney general and nsa dissemination policies and procedures due to the sensitivity of the sources and methods used to obtain this collection it cannot be shared with site visitors or other uncleared personnel without proper minimization and attribution to protect those sources and methods qgc requirements ssi except in exigent circumstances all personnel that will have access to fisa material should receive initial ogc ussid sp0018 and fbi fisa minimization briefings in person the briefings given by ogc are interactive in nature and the personal setting gives ogc better opportunity to interact with all

in cess databases that must be addressed and fixed before additional access at the ccs is approved tssj it is vital that both nsa fisa and fbi fisa material be properly and separately identified so that i users of that material know that they arc accessing nsa fisa or fbi fisa and 2 nsa can remain in compliance with department of justice and all other obligations for fisa handling and

ensure that the issues of classification partitioning and access are resolved and any existing fisa access or retention violations are identified and clcarcd up tssi further sv recommends tliat this access not be approved until s3ces and the crvptologic centers involved coordinate with the offices that sponsored the nsa fisa court orders and agree to the responsibilities that cach will have
