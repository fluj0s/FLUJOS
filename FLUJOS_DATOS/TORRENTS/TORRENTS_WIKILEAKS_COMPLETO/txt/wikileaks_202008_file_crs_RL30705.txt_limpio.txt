american national government government and finance division federal grants to state and local governments brief history summary the historical origins of the federal grantsinaid system predate the constitution grants of land were provided under the articles of confederation as early as 1785 there was however little development in the system until the 20th century certain conditions existed during the late 18th and 19th centuries that limited federal aid to states and localities during the precivil war era proponents of states rights and minimalist national government prevailed during this period the transmississippi west consisted largely of federally administered territories indeed more than half of the transmississippi west entered the union after the civil war the postcivil war era was one of corporate dominance and weak government despite these conditions the federal government did provide aid to states and localities on an ad hoc basis to address natural disasters civil disturbances westward expansion and the need for internal improvements the grantsinaid system began to take its current form in the early 20th century financial grants created during the 1910s included grant mechanisms such as matching requirements and conditions which are now common in grant programs in the 1930s president franklin roosevelts administration prompted by the conditions of the great depression worked with congress to accelerate the development of the grantsinaid system as part of the new deal program of social relief financial reform and economic recovery the grantsinaid system again grew significantly during president lyndon johnsons great society initiative of the 1960s many of these programs were specifically focused on urban areas and disadvantaged populations the nixon administration and congress initiated changes in the system emphasizing block grants as well as establishing general revenue sharing program that distributed funds to state and local governments virtually without programmatic requirements the reagan administration also worked with congress on substantial change consolidating dozens of categorical grants into broader block grants and slowing the growth of the grantsinaid system since the reagan initiatives there have been few significant changes in the grantsinaid system one grantrelated issue the 110th congress has considered was the use of block grants for disaster recovery pl 110116 the 110th congress may also wish to consider issues such as consolidation of grant programs methodologies and formulas used to calculate grant disbursements and potential reauthorization of existing grant programs this report was originally written by ben canada formerly an analyst in american national government in the

origins of the grantsinaid system predate the constitution early grants were authorized on an ad hoc basis awarded not only to states and localities but in some cases to private corporations just as they are today early grants frequently came in the form of land as well as money for example the land ordinance of 1785 enacted under the articles of confederation required every new township incorporated from federal lands to reserve one lot for public schools1 the need to help victims of civil disturbance and disasters prompted the federal government to provide assistance to communities for example following the whiskey rebellion in 1794 the federal government compensated individuals who could prove they had suffered losses2 when the town of alexandria virginia burned in 1827 congress quickly appropriated 20000 in assistance3 which equates to approximately 362143 in 2007 dollars after inflation conversion4 in 1790 the newly established government under the constitution set precedent for federal aid by assuming state revolutionary war debts treasury secretary alexander hamilton proposed the idea suggesting that it would establish sound credit rating for future governmental borrowing5 the antifederalists mostly from southern states hotly contested the idea arguing that it made the new federal government too centralized superseded states rights and rewarded speculators6 ultimately the federal government assumed the debt but only after placating the southern states by among other things locating the capital city along the potomac river in the south7 1

inflation conversion formula 5 hamilton also believed although he did not state as public argument that federal assumption of state debts would focus more attention on the national government 6 many state debt instruments had been purchased at steep discounts by speculators hamiltons bill assumed the instruments at full value 7 votes on the issue of the permanent seat of government are found in annals of congress continued crs2 as westward settlement accelerated following the war of 1812 the federal government gave greater attention to internal improvements the need for which had been emphasized by thomas jefferson john c calhoun then secretary of war the war department played leading federal role in frontier development presented plan for national internal improvements in 1819 in which he set forth criteria by which the national government should evaluate improvement projects he stated that federal assistance should be granted for programs immediately beneficial to more than half of the states of the union and which without the aid of the federal government would require their cooperation8 calhouns plan also called for using the surveying and planning resources of the army corps of engineers9 one reason congress was partial to awarding land grants instead of funds was that land was plentiful in the antebellum period whereas money was not most early land grants were for transportation projects for example congress granted land and surveying services for the intracoastal waterway which was intended to provide means of transporting goods without necessitating travel along the hazardous ocean areas off the eastern seaboard the waterways original plans called for using canals to link all major rivers east of the mississippi providing yearround travel in the american east10 in addition to canals and waterways land grants were also made for roads and railroads in some instances the federal government awarded land to private corporations building railroads in other instances rightofway grants were used in which the federal government retained ownership but permitted other entities to undertake internal improvements for example the national or cumberland road was surveyed and constructed at federal and later state expense from cumberland maryland to vandalia illinois between 1811 and 185011 the american migration westward during the 19th century provided many examples of early grantsinaid although grants generally applied to individuals corporations and territories since most of the states of the transmississippi west did not enter the union until after the civil war the movement west greatly depended on aid from federal troops who provided law enforcement protection and constructed network of over 70 wilderness forts the forts provided medical services blacksmith shops for repairing wagons and fostered sometimes created local economies through supply purchases federal assistance also came through its 7 continued 1st cong 2nd sess pp

west which provided communication link to the east12 in the area of social services the national government played almost role this was largely due to support for states rights and dominant strict constructionist views of most national politicians for example president franklin pierce 1853 1857 vetoed an 1854 act supported by reformer dorothea dix to allocate funds to states to help the indigent insane pierce contended that if congress is to make provision for paupers the fountains of charity will be dried up at home and the several states instead of bestowing their own means on the social wants of their people will become humble suppliants for the bounty of the federal government reversing their true relation to this union13 in rare instances the national government assisted states and localities with social service projects that were beyond the resources of single localities for example in 1817 congress awarded land grant to the hartford deaf and dumb asylum in connecticut which was intended to educate deaf persons the asylum founded by advocate thomas hopkins gallaudet resulted from joint effort by six new england states as well as several churches it was eventually renamed the american school for the deaf and it remains the nations oldest school for the hearing impaired14 grantsinaid during the late 19th century the outcome of the civil war had significant impact on the future of the grantsinaid system after the war states rights advocates lost considerable ground to the view that the constitution and federal law empowered the federal government to take wide range of measures deemed necessary and proper to attain the goals of the constitutions preamble measures that set the stage for the development of the grantsinaid system many years later15 during and immediately following the war congress passed several acts that expanded federal involvement in the states congress supported westward expansion with the pacific railroad act of 1862 which enabled the government to charter railroad corporations that constructed transcontinental railroad16 the morrill act of 1862 provided land grants for the establishment of landgrant universities focusing on agriculture mechanics and military science congress had been assisting higher education for decades through ad hoc legislation the morrill act systemized this 12 john d unruh

congress also authorized the first financial grant for states and localities that targeted specific segment of the population based on need in 1879 congress authorized funds for the distribution of education materials for blind students in an act to promote the education of the blind18 this act purchased and distributed reading materials to public institutions for the education of the blind using formula based on the institutions number of blind students the practice of targeting grants however would not become common until the early 20th century notwithstanding these examples governmental activity at both the state and national levels remained at low levels during the years following the civil war the 14th amendment was adopted in 1868 for the purpose of protecting the rights of freed slaves but the courts generally interpreted its due process clause to be barrier against state action in social and economic problems this reduced the states abilities to respond to new and burgeoning problems generated by the rapid industrialization of the late 19th century governmental inactivity in this period contributed to the development of philosophies of governmental intervention and preemption that would be applied early in the 20th century19 early 20th century the presidents in office during the last three decades of the 19th century were generally cautious about exercising executive authority president theodore roosevelt 19011909 however used the powers of the presidency to greater extent than any of his immediate predecessors he believed that strong executive branch was necessary to address the problems of the industrial revolution and overcome the overdivision of governmental powers to address state and local concerns as he later argued the state must be made efficient for the work which concerns only the people of the state and the nation for that which concerns all the people there must remain neutral ground to serve as refuge for lawbreakers and especially for lawbreakers of great wealth who can hire the vulpine legal cunning which will teach them how to avoid both jurisdictions the new nationalism puts the national need before sectional or personal advantage it is impatient of the utter confusion that results from local legislatures attempting to treat national issues as local issues this new nationalism regards the

31 continued crs5 president theodore roosevelts extensive use of power may have inspired changes in the federal system after he left office for example some analysts point to the weeks act of 1911 as the first example of modern grantinaid in the act congress authorized the secretary of agriculture to cooperate with any state or group of states when requested to do so in the protection from fire of the forested watersheds of the navigable streams21 despite its appropriation of only 200000 observers consider it landmark in the development of the grantsinaid system because it contained several mechanisms that became common in future grants including conditioning the receipt of federal funds on approval of state plans requiring matching state funds and specifying the oversight role of federal officials22 congress established pattern of financial grants to states in 1914 by passing the smithlever act which distributed millions of dollars in agricultural assistance to states23 within 10 years of passage of the weeks act the federal government was awarding grants for highway construction in response to the automobile vocational education public health and maternity care24 president woodrow wilson 19131921 continued roosevelts active use of executive power to address social ills to strengthen the federal system wilson advocated the professionalization of public service and cooperation among federal state and local governments he countered the arguments of those who believed in limited role for national government by arguing that each generation had the right to interpret the constitution differently in his 1908 book constitutional government in the united states wilson wrote the question of the relation of the states to the federal government is the cardinal question of our constitutional system it cannot indeed be settled by the opinion of any one generation because it is question of growth and every successive stage of our political and economic development gives it new aspect25 during the wilson administration congress began to institutionalize the practice of targeting grants to certain geographic areas or population segments in particular two acts began this trend the federal aid highway act of 1916 provided federal grants to states for the express purpose of constructing roads in rural areas26 also the smithhughes act of 1917

for agricultural skills were distributed based on states rural population grants for industrial skills and home economics were distributed based on states urban population and funds from one grant program with several eligible activities were distributed based on states overall population28 following the roosevelt and wilson administrations federal activity in the states remained at relatively low ebb until the 1930s29 the new deal prompted by the conditions of the great depression president franklin roosevelt and his administration accelerated the development of the grantsinaid system as part of his new deal program of social relief financial reform and economic recovery drawing on broad constructionist interpretation of the constitution that gave him flexibility in designing economic recovery programs roosevelt and congress expanded federal involvement in areas where the government previously had taken little action including public housing and employment security30 examples of new deal programs still in existence are the tennessee valley authority which provides electric power and formerly administered infrastructure projects and social security which provides income security to american workers the federal emergency relief act of 1933 fera had longlasting impact on the grantsinaid system31 it was the first grant to the states for the express purpose of providing public relief the act provided 3 billion in federal aid over three years approximately 451 billion in 2007 dollars after inflation conversion32 which the states could provide in the form of direct relief or work relief which was the presidents preference states were required to match half of the fera funds with state funds and could distribute the rest on discretionary basis where they felt it

georgia continued crs7 led to the first use of federal employment for relief purposes the emergency relief appropriation act of 193534 authorized the works project administration which employed 3 million citizens at its peak in 193635 the new deal expanded the use of categorical grant programs currently the most common type of grant36 some observers believe this increase in financial assistance to states and localities as well direct financial assistance to individuals concentrated more authority and responsibility at the federal level supreme court decisions that upheld new deal programs cemented this concentrating effect by permanently expanding the federal governments role in policy areas that had previously been within the states domain or were not addressed by government at any level37 president roosevelt summarized his approach to federal assistance in speech before congress if as our constitution tells us our federal government was established among other things to promote the general welfare it is our plain duty to provide for the security upon which welfare depends38 the great society the grantsinaid system expanded gradually during the two decades following the roosevelt administration during the administration of president harry truman 19451953 the federal government adopted grant programs in several areas including agricultural research health initiatives and housing the number of grant programs further expanded during the administration of president dwight eisenhower 19531961 by the time president eisenhower left office total grant outlays had nearly tripled from 24 billion to 68 billion39 arguably the most significant grant program enacted during the eisenhower administration was the interstate highway program which remains the primary funding source for interstate highway construction and maintenance40 the grantsinaid system expanded under president lyndon johnsons great society initiative relying implicitly on the 14th amendment

between 1964 and 1968 rising from 101 billion to 186 billion41 all of the new programs were categorical grants with the exception of two block grants in the fields of health and law enforcement42 some new categorical grants also addressed environmental concerns such as water and air pollution significant number of these programs such as the model cities and demonstration cities program concentrated federal assistance on urban and metropolitan areas as well as minority and disadvantaged populations43 in legislation congress emphasized the need to assist urban areas the congress hereby finds and declares that improving the quality of urban life is the most critical domestic problem facing the united states the congress further finds and declares that cities of all sizes do not have adequate resources to deal effectively with the critical problems facing them and that federal assistance in addition to that now authorized by the urban renewal program and other existing federal grantinaid programs is essential to enable cities to plan develop and conduct programs to improve their physical environment 44 although categorical grants to state and local governments were the dominant form of assistance enacted during the 1960s congress and the president also established other approaches to achieving national goals in 1966 for example congress encouraged regional approaches to governmental challenges by requiring all recipient governments to coordinate federal programs with regional clearinghouses which often took the form of regional planning councils45 this requirement led to the creation of omb circular a95 which was the primary instrument of intergovernmental coordination until 1983 congress directed regional clearinghouses which received federal planning grants to prevent duplication of services and improve development planning one observer of regional councils stated the use of a95 procedures represents the single most potentially powerful device to affect the distribution of resources in region according to some regional point of view46 observers of federalism have debated the review processs 41 us acir significant features of fiscal federalism

governments began implementing vast array of federal programs some observers of federalism point to the great society as permanent shift in the federal approach to assisting state and local government new grant programs were enacted throughout the johnson administration the trend of creating new programs continued into the nixon administration leading some observers of federalism to call the great society permanent change in the federal approach to assisting state and local governments48 changes in the system nixon and reagan the expansion of grantsinaid under president johnson led to call for reform under his successor president richard nixon 19691974 nixon characterized the system as terrible tangle of categorical grants plagued by overlapping programs inefficiency excessive administrative requirements and imposition of federal priorities on state and local governments49 his primary goals were to improve program efficiency decentralize decision making to states and localities and restrain program growth president nixon advocated new federalism implemented through general revenue sharing and special revenue sharing general revenue sharing sent funds to state and local governments with virtually programmatic requirements the goal of general revenue sharing was to combine the advantages of national revenue collection with the advantages of local discretion over spending50 representative melvin laird of wisconsin was pioneer in the field introducing revenue sharing bill as early as 1958 walter heller chairman of the council of economic advisers in the kennedy and johnson administrations proposed general revenue sharing in 1960 as potential use of federal surpluses but his plan received little attention until the nixon administration51 the program

categorical programs into large allocations distributed to states these programs were intended to give the states broad discretion in addressing the functional areas53 special revenue sharing was similar to block grants but required application and had fewer programmatic strings congress however favored block grants over special revenue sharing and modified most of nixons special revenue sharing proposals to block grant programs54 one such nixon proposal was adopted as the community development block grant program cdbg which remains one of the federal governments primary development programs although president nixon intended to devolve greater degree of decision making to states and localities the changes that occurred during his administration have been credited with ultimately expanding federal intervention in state and local governmental activities55 the new block grants and revenue sharing gave the federal government more influence over state and local decision making because the federal government placed conditions on the use of funds funds could be reduced or withheld if the recipient government failed to meet certain specified conditions some observers believe that since block grants and general revenue sharing brought federal aid into many communities for the first time new federalism enabled the federal government to have more influence over american society than ever before56 the administration of president ronald reagan 19811989 also pushed for grant changes these efforts differed from those of the nixon administration in that they sought not only to decentralize grant administration to state and local governments but also to reduce funding alter priorities in the grantsinaid system and reduce federal governmental regulatory power that had developed through expansion of the grant system president reagan supported the block grant as means both of disengaging the national government from policy areas he viewed as state and local concerns and of reducing spending57 president reagan was initially successful in his efforts the omnibus budget reconciliation act obra of 1981 consolidated 77 categorical programs into nine block grants obra reduced total grant outlays to state and local governments by 6 billion below the previous fiscal year most of the budget cuts came in the areas of education job training and welfare there was however
