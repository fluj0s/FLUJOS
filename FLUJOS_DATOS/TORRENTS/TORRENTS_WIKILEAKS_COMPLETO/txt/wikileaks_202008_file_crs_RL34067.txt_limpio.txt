environmental policy resources science and industry division brent d yacobucci specialist in energy and environmental policy resources science and industry division climate change legislation in the 110th congress summary congressional interest in climate change legislation has grown in recent years in the 110th congress members have introduced numerous bills that directly address various aspects of climate change these bills cover wide spectrum ranging from climate change research to comprehensive greenhouse gas ghg emissions capand trade programs as of the date of this report congress has enacted six broader pieces of legislation that among many other nonclimaterelated provisions address climate change in some fashion pl 110140 expands the carbon capture research and development program requires national assessment of geologic storage capacity for co2 and supports technologies for the largescale capture of co2 from industrial sources the act also establishes an office of climate change and the environment to coordinate research and implement strategies to address climate changerelated transportation issues pl 110161 directs the environmental protection agency epa to develop regulations that establish mandatory ghg reporting program that applies above appropriate thresholds in all sectors of the economy pl 110181 directs the department of defense dod to assess the risks of projected climate change to the departments facilities capabilities and missions pl 110229 requires the secretary of energy when reviewing research and development activities for possible inclusion in the steel research and development initiative to expand the plan in order to consider among steel project priorities the development of technologies that reduce ghg emissions pl 110246 directs the department of agriculture usda to establish technical guidelines to measure the environmental services benefits from conservation and land management activities in order to facilitate the participation of farmers ranchers and forest landowners in emerging environmental services markets usda is to give priority to carbon markets pl 110343 provides tax credit for select geologic carbon sequestration activities in addition the national academy of sciences nas is to identify the types of and specific tax provisions that have the largest effects on carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions and to estimate the magnitude of those effects nas is to report its findings to congress by october 3 2010 this report briefly discusses the basic concepts on which climate change bills are based and compares major provisions of the bills in each of the following categories climate change research emissions reduction technologies us actions pursuant to international emission reduction agreements adaptation to the effects of climate change ghg reporting and registration and ghg emissions reduction programs contents introduction 1 climate change research and studies 3 deployment of greenhouse gas reduction technology 3 international agreements 4 adaptation bills 4 greenhouse gas reporting and registry bills 4 greenhouse gas emission reduction bills 5 sectorspecific reduction

change legislation in the 110th congress 12 climate change legislation in the 110th congress introduction in the 110th congress members have introduced numerous bills that would directly or indirectly address climate change this report describes and compares bills that directly address climate change as opposed to those that primarily address other issues eg energy efficiency and conservation but could have ancillary impacts on climate1 in some cases it is difficult to draw line between direct and indirect climate change bills because specific bill or action may seek to achieve multiple objectives this report focuses on legislative actions including comprehensive bills with individual climate change titles or sections that explicitly address climate change issues these bills fall into six major categories 1 research on the causes and effects of climate change and on methods to measure and predict climate change 2 deployment of emissionreducing technologies in the united states or other countries 3 requirements for us participation in international climate agreements 4 investments in systems to adapt to changes in climate 5 establishment of greenhouse gas ghg monitoring systems as basis for research or for any potential reduction program and 6 implementation of mandatory ghg emission reduction programs these categories are not mutually exclusive and several bills address more than one of the above categories there has been considerable interest in climate change issues in the 110th congress as of the date of this report members have introduced more than 100 bills that would directly address climate change issues congress has enacted six legislation proposals that address climate change to some degree pl 110140 the president signed the energy independence and security act of 2007 december 19 2007 among other provisions some of which indirectly address ghg emissions this act amends the energy policy act of 2005 to expand the carbon capture research and development program it also directs the department of the interior to conduct national assessment of geologic storage capacity for carbon dioxide co2 and instructs the department of energy to implement program to demonstrate technologies for the 1 congressional resolutions that address climate changerelated issues but do not directly call for action on greenhouse gas emissions are likewise not included in this report crs2 largescale capture of co2 from industrial sources of co22 in addition the act establishes within the department of transportation an office of climate change and the environment to coordinate research and implement strategies to address transportation issues associated with climate change pl 110161 the president signed the consolidated appropriations act of 2008 into law december 26 2007 among other provisions this statute directs epa to promulgate regulations that require mandatory reporting of ghg emissions above appropriate thresholds in all sectors of the economy the act directs epa to develop the proposed rule by september 2008 and the final rule by june 2009 in addition the act instructs noaa to work with the national academy of sciences to establish climate change study committee that will study climate change issues and make recommendations regarding climate change mitigation strategies pl 110181 on january 28 2008 the president signed the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 in addition to many nonclimate related provisions the act directs the department of defense to assess the risks of projected climate change to the departments facilities capabilities and missions pl 110229 on may 8 2008 the president signed the consolidated natural resources act of 2008 among other provisions the act requires the secretary of energy when reviewing research and development activities for possible inclusion in the steel research and development initiative to expand the plan in order to consider among steel project priorities the development of technologies that reduce ghg emissions pl 110246 on june 18 2008 congress enacted overriding the presidents veto the food conservation and energy act3 among many other provisions the act section 2709 directs the department of agriculture usda to establish technical guidelines to measure the environmental services benefits from conservation and land management activities in order to facilitate the participation of farmers ranchers and forest landowners in emerging environmental services markets usda is to give priority to carbon markets4 pl 110343 on october 3 2008 the president signed the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 among many other 2 see crs report rl33801 carbon capture and sequestration ccs by peter folger 3 the legislative

renee johnson 4 see crs report rl34042 environmental services markets in the 2008 farm bill by renee johnson crs3 provisions the legislation provides tax credit for select geologic carbon sequestration activities in addition the act directs the department of treasury to enter into an agreement with the national academy of sciences nas to undertake comprehensive review of the internal revenue code of 1986 to identify the types of and specific tax provisions that have the largest effects on carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions and to estimate the magnitude of those effects nas is to report its findings to congress by october 3 2010 in addition to enacted legislation the house and senate have passed several bills numerous bills have been reported out of committees these bills address range of climate change topics these topics are discussed briefly below appendix categorizes the bills and enacted legislation by the topics discussed below appendix b provides brief summary of each bills provisions and status in the legislative process climate change research and studies global climate change is complex issue while most scientists agree that the climate is changing in response to ghg emissions uncertainties concerning the causes and effects of climate change remain and are continuing subject of extensive scientific research5 these uncertainties include the potential effects on natural systems as well as effects on social and political systems further research is ongoing regarding technologies that improve efficiency reduce fossil fuel consumption and capture and store carbon dioxide co2 emissions deployment of greenhouse gas reduction technology one approach to addressing climate change is to promote the deployment and diffusion of technologies to reduce ghg emissions such as carbon capture and storage or sequestration within the legislative proposals there are different methods of promoting technology deployment one deployment strategy may involve tax incentives for investment in technologies to improve efficiency andor lower emissions other deployment strategies would provide grants loans and other incentives for technology transfer to developing countries in the 110th congress some bills deal solely with technology deployment through tax incentives for lowercarbon technology or grants to develop and deploy carbon capture and sequestration or through requirements that the federal government use technology with lower emissions other bills that create mandatory ghg reduction programs also include technology deployment as one component 5 for more information on the science and policy of global climate change see crs report rl33849 climate change science and policy implications by jane leggett crs4 international agreements the united states ratified the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc in 1992 five years later the united states signed the conventions kyoto protocol but it was never submitted to the senate for ratification6 in 2001 president george w bush rejected the kyoto protocol and withdrew the united states from subsequent negotiations since that time the united states has entered into other cooperative agreements including the asia pacific partnership on clean development and climate this partnership focuses on voluntary action by member states to promote cleaner technology and related goals however us participation in discussions over binding agreements has been limited adaptation bills some critics of ghg regulation argue that the effects on global ghg concentrations and consequently the effects on climate from any reduction scheme will be limited some therefore contend that investment should focus on preparing communities and systems to adapt to the effects of changing climate this notion is shared by some proponents of ghg regulation who argue that because of earlier greenhouse gas emissions some level of warming will occur regardless of mitigation activity those stakeholders support adaptation initiatives in concert with mitigation efforts greenhouse gas reporting and registry bills pursuant to the unfccc the united states publishes annual reports on its ghg emissions7 the us environmental protection agency epa reports this information using various techniques eg fuel analysis for co2 the 2005 emissions estimates indicate that the three dominant sources of ghg emissions are electricity generation 33 transportation 28 and industry 198 at the national level the 1990 clean air act requires most electric utilities to report their ghg emissions but there is overall national ghg reporting requirement however some states also gather data through voluntary registries or mandatory ghg emissions reporting mechanisms9 6 president clinton did not submit the protocol to the senate for advice and consent because the senate was on record in mid1997 sres 98 objecting to treaty that had mandatory obligations for developing countries for more discussion see crs report rl33826 climate change the kyoto protocol and international actions by susan r fletcher and larry parker 7 these reports are issued by the environmental protection agency and are available at httpepagovclimatechangeemissionsindexhtml 8 us environmental protection agency inventory of us ghg emissions and sinks 1990 2005 p es14 additional sources are agriculture 8 commerce 6 and residential activities 5 9 for more information see crs report rl33812 climate change action by states to continued crs5 greenhouse gas emission reduction bills the united states has federal ghg reduction requirements although there have been proposals to require such reductions10 these proposals include command and control regulations and marketbased techniques to limit emissions marketbased programs typically take as their model the clean air acts acid rain program which employs capandtrade design to control several air pollutants11 capandtrade systems set strict limits on specific emissions from particular group of sources sources may reduce their own emissions or purchase credits ie trade from other sources that have reduced emissions below their individual allotment this flexibility in who makes reductions can lead to lower costs in an efficient market entities that face relatively low emissionreduction costs would have an incentive to achieve extra emission reductions because these additional reductions could be sold to entities that face higher emissionreduction costs an entity facing higher costs could purchase allowances that would allow it to emit more than its initial emissions allotment total us emissions may decrease or increase depending on the entities covered the ghgs controlled and the emissions trading schemes in the 110th congress some bills cover just the electric utility sector while others cover most or all emissions throughout the economy12 another marketbased option is to establish carbon tax direct tax on ghg emissions or on the fuels that generate emissions when combusted to the extent that emissions reductions can be achieved at costs lower than the tax rate those reductions will be undertaken if emissions reductions are more expensive covered entities would opt to pay the tax in this way there is an upper limit to the cost of the control program13 9 continued address greenhouse gas emissions by jonathan l ramseur 10 president bush has articulated the goal of reducing us greenhouse gas emissions intensity the ratio of ghg emissions to economic output however that goal is voluntary not mandatory 11 for more discussion of the different emission reduction policy options see crs report rl33799 climate change design approaches for greenhouse gas reduction program by larry parker 12 for detailed information on ghg reduction bills see crs report rl33846 climate change greenhouse gas reduction bills in the 110th congress by larry parker and brent d yacobucci 13 hybrid of capandtrade and carbon tax schemes would require tradeable emissions permits but establish safety valve price in this case if the market value of permit remains below set price the safety valve the emissions targets will be achieved at low cost if prices rise above the safety valve covered entities can purchase an unlimited number of permits from the government in this way the overall price to covered entities and the economy is limited but specific emission reduction targets may not be reached however such bills have been introduced in the 110th congress crs6 sectorspecific reduction bills members have introduced several bills in the 110th congress that would control emissions from only the electric utility sector the rationale for such policy is that electricity generation emits the highest percentage of ghgs by sector and the number of covered sources would be relatively small compared to other sectors eg transportation moreover power plants have experience with reporting if not reducing their co2 emissions under the clean air act sectorspecific bills generally fall into two categories 1 bills that would control only ghgs and 2 bills that would control both ghgs and other pollutants such as mercury sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides this latter category of bills is generally referred to as multipollutant legislation14 comprehensive ghg emissions reductions broader approach is to require emission reductions from multiple economic sectors several bills in the 110th congress would apply to most or all us ghg emissions these bills are often described as an economywide ghg reduction approach these bills vary in their coverage some bills cover the most highemitting sectors eg electricity generation industry and transportation while excluding other sectors eg residential and commercial other bills grant epa broad authority to establish regulations to reduce the most emissions at the lowest cost 14 for more information on
