circuit has f ound that punitive damages do not apply to agencies of foreign governments that perform primarily go vernmental rather than commercial services continuedsuits against terrorist states by victims of terrorism overview prior to 1996 foreign states were immune from civil liability in us courts for injuries caused by acts of rrorism carried out by their agents and proxies in 1996 congress amended the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia1 to allow civil suits by us victims of terrorism against certain states responsible for or complicit in such terrorist acts as torture extrajudicial killing aircraft sabotage and hostage taking2 the amendment enjoyed broad s upport in congress but was initially resisted by the executive branch president clinton signed the amendment into law after the cuban air force shot down civilian plane over international waters an incident that resulted in one of the firs t lawsuits under the new fsia exception after court found that the waiver of sovereig n immunity did not itself create private right of action congress passed the flatow amendment to create cause of action3 numerous court judgments awarding plaintiffs substantial compensatory and punitive damages were to follow4 until the dc circuit in 2004 interpreted the provisions inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31258crs2 4 continued because such agencies are considered to be th state itself rather than an agent roeder v islamic republic of iran 333 f3d 228 234 dc cir 2003 cert denied 124 sct 2836 2004 some courts continued to award punitive damages against foreign military and intelligence agencies the supreme court va cated and remanded decision that had treated the ministry of defense mod of iran as an agency or instrumentality for the purpose of determining immunity of its property to execution to satisfy judgment but did not explain how the court was to determine the proper characterization of an entity total punitive damages awarded under the terrorism exception to the fsia now amount to nearly 73 billion excluding any vacated awards total compensatory damages under the exception amount to about 66 billion another 53 billion was awarded against six libyan officials in their personal capacities see appendix way that made further awards somewhat more difficult for plaintiffs to win plaintiffs thereafter largely relied on domestic state law to provide cause of action which resulted in some disparity in th amount and type of relief available to different victims of the same terrorist attacks although the defendant state sponsors of terrorism have frequently declined to appear in court to defend against the lawsuits the litigation has nevertheless proven contentious often leading to the perception on the part of plaintiffs that the us government is their most formidable adve rsary nevertheless us courts have awarded victims of terrorism more th an 19 billion against state sponsors of terrorism and their officials most of which remains uncollected the scarcity of assets within us jurisdiction that belong to states subject to economic sanctions has made judgments against terrorist states difficult to enforce efforts by plaintiffs to attach frozen assets and diplomatic or c onsular property while receiving support from congress have met with opposition from the executive branch the total amount of judgments against rrorist states far exceeds th assets of debtor states known to exist within the jurisdiction of us courts the use of us funds to pay portions of some judgments has drawn criticism calls for more effective and fair means to compensate victims of terrorism have not yielded an alternative mechanism the issue has pitted the compensation of vi ctims of terrorism ag ainst us foreign policy goals and some business interests congress passed rider to the nationa l defense authorization act for fy2008 hr 1585 to provide cause of action ag ainst terrorist states and to facilitate enforcement of judgments and to permit some plaintiffs to refile claims that were unsuccessful under the previous law the provision also per mits the filing of new cases related to terrorist incidents that ve been the subject of previous cases in order to permit the filing of cases in which the plaintiffs were previously ineligible to file or had missed the filing deadline or perhaps in order to garner higher damages after the president vetoed the bill based on the possible impact the measure would have on iraq congre ss passed new version hr 4986 this time authorizing the president to waive its provisions with respect to iraq the president signed the bill into law pl 110181 and promptly issu ed waiver with respect to iraq the administration now seeks waiver for liby and other states whose designation may be lifted however the court of appeals for the dc circuit has ruled that thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31258crs3 waiver with respect to iraq does not affect pending cases which are permitted to go

compared to the current sum of judgments that remain to be satisfied the repor t will be updated as events warrant background on state immunity customary international law historically afforded sovereign states complete immunity from being sued in the courts of other states in the words of chief justice marshall this immunity was rooted in the perfect equality and absolute independence of sovereigns and the need to maintain friendly relations although each nation has full and absolute jurisdiction within its own territory the chief justice stated that jurisdiction by co mmon consent does not extend to other sovereign states one sovereign being in respect amenable to another and being bound by obligations of the highest character not to degrade the dignity of his nation by placing himself or its sovereign rights w ithin the jurisdiction of another can be supposed to enter foreign territory only under an express license or in the confidence that the immunities belonging to this independent sovereign station though not expressly sti pulated are reserved by implication and will be extended to him this perfect equality and absolute independence of sovereigns and this common interest impelling them to mutual intercourse and an interchange of good offices with each other have given rise to class of cases in which every sovereign ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31258crs4 5 the schooner exchange 11 us 7 cranch 116 137 1812 holding french warship to be immune from the jurisdiction of us c ourt in berizzi bros co v ss pesaro 271 us 562 1926 the court held this principle of immunity to apply as well to stateowned commercial ships 6 american law institute 1 restatement of the law third the foreign relations law of the united states 391 1987 7 the acting legal adviser of the department of st ate jack b tate stated in letter to the acting attorney general that in future case s the department would follow the restrictive principle 26 department of state bulletin 984 1952 previously when case against foreign state arose the state department r outinely asked the department of justice to inform the court that the government favored the principle of absolute immunity and the courts usually acceded to this advice the ta letter meant that the government would longer make this suggestion in cases agains t foreign states involving commercial activity 8 28 usc 160211 9 id 1604 10 id 1605understood to waive the exercise of part of that complete exclusive territorial jurisdiction which has been stated to be the attribute of every nation5 during the last century however this principle of absolute sovereign immunity gradually came to be limited after number of states began engaging directly in commercial activities to allow states to maintain their immunity in the courts of other states even while engaged in ordinary commerce it was said gave states an unfair advantage in competition with private commercial enterprise and denied the private parties in other nati ons with whom they dealt their normal recourse to the courts to settle disputes6 as consequence numerous states immediately before and after world war ii adopted the restr ictive principle of state immunity which preserves sovereign immunity for most cases but allows domestic courts to exercise jurisdiction over suits against foreign states for claims arising out of their commercial activities the united states adopted the rest rictive principle of sovereign immunity by administrative action in 19527 and the state department began advising courts on casebycase basis whether foreign s overeign should be entitled to immunity from us courts jurisdiction based on the nature of the claim in 1978 congress codified the principle in the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia so that the decision longer depended on deter mination by the state department8 the fsia states the general principle that foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states and of the states9 and then sets forth several exceptions the primary exceptions are for cases in which the foreign state has waived its immunity either expressly or by implication cases in which the action is based upon commercial activ ity carried on in the united states by the foreign state and suits against foreign state fo r personal injury or death or damage to property occurring in the united states as re sult of the tortious act of an official or employee of that state acting within the scope of his office or employment10 for most types of claims covered the fsia also provides that th commercial property of foreign state in the united states may be attached in satisfaction of judgment against it regardless of whether the property was used for the activity on which

states by victims of terrorism in 1996 congress added another exception to the fsia to allow the us courts federal and state to exercise jurisdiction over foreign states and their agencies and instrumentalities in civil suits by us victims of terrorism12 the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 aedpa amended the fsia to provide that foreign state is not immune from the jurisdic tion of us courts in cases in which money damages are sought against foreign state for personal injury or death that was caused by an act of torture extrajudicial killing aircraft sabotage hostage taking or the provision of mate rial support or resources for such an act if such act or provision of material support is engaged in by an official employee or agent of such foreign stat while acting within the scope of his or her office employment or agency13 as predicates for such suits the aedpa amendment required that the foreign state be designated as state spons or of terrorism by the

debate or explanation during the aedpas consideration by the senate and the house provisions similar to what was enacted were included in both the senate and the house measures as introduced s 735 221 and hr 2703 803 respectively but committee report was filed on either bill and the only change that ppears to have been made during floor debate was slight amendment by representative hyde in managers amendment in the house imposing 10year statute of limitations on such suits and slightly modifying the provision concerning pretrial arbitration see 142 c ong rec h2164 daily ed march 13 1996 the report of the conference committee simply stated as follows section 221 house section 803 recedes to nate section 206 with modifications this subtitle provides that nations designated as state sponsors of terrorism under section 6j of the export administration act of 1979 will be amenable to suit in us courts for terrorist acts it permits us federal courts to hear claims seeking money damages for personal injury or death against such nations and arising from terrorist acts they commit or direct to be committed against american citizens or nationals outside of the foreign states territory and for such acts within the states territory if the state involved has refused to arbitrate the claim hrept 104518 1996 however the house had adopted simila r measure during the second session of the previous congress hr 934 th department of state and th department of justice had opposed the legislation at that time the h ouse judiciary committee explained the rationale of the bill as follows the difficulty us citizens have had in obtai ning remedies for torture and other injuries suffered abroad illustrates the need for remedial legislation foreign sovereign violates international law if it practices torture summary execution or genocide yet under current law us citizen who is tortured or killed abroad cannot sue the foreign sovereign in us courts even when the foreign country wrongly refuses to hear the citizens case therefore in some instances us citizen who was tortured or the family of one who was murdered will be without remedy hr 934 stands for the principle that us citizens who are grievously mistreated abroad should have an effective remedy for damages in some tribunal either in the country where the mistreatment occurred or in the united states to this end the bill would add new exception to the fsia that would allow suits against foreign sovereigns that subject us citizens to torture extrajudicial killings or genocide and do not provide adequate remedies for those harms hrept 103702 103rd cong 2d sess august 16 1994 at 4which the claim is based occurred in the territory of the defendant state the act also provided that the terrorist states and their agencies and instrumentalities would be liable for compensatory damages and the agencies and instrumentalities for punitive damages as well16 the act further allowed the commercial property of foreign state in the united states to be attached in satisfaction of judgment against that state under this amendment regardless of whether the property was involved in the act

sponsored terrorism known as the flatow amendment19 to clarify that cause of action existed against the officials employees and agents of states whose sovereign immunity was abrogated pursuant to the exception the flatow amendment gives parties injured or killed by terrorist act covered by the fsia exception or their legal representatives cause of action for suits against an official employee or agen t of foreign state design ated as state sponsor of terrorism who commits the terrorist act while acting within the scope of his or her office employment or agency if us government official would

several suits were quickly filed agains t cuba and iran pursuant to the new provisions neither state recognized the juri sdiction of the us courts in such suits however and both refused to appear in cour t to mount defense the fsia provides that court may enter judgment by default in such situation if the claimant establishes his claim or right to relief by evidence satisfactory to the court21 after making the proper finding several federal trial courts entered default judgments holding iran and cuba to be culpable for pa rticular acts of terrorism and awarding the plaintiffs substantial

claims tribunal in favor of iran and against the us government but which had not yet been paid23 the clinton administration oppos ed these efforts arguing that the diplomatic properties nd the rental proceeds were essentially sovereign non commercial property that remained immune to attachment pursuant to the fsia in addition the administration argued that it wa s obligated to protect irans diplomatic and consular properties under the vienna conventi on on diplomatic relations24 and the vienna convention on consular relations25 and that using such properties to satisfy court judgments would expose us diplomatic and cons ular properties around the world to similar treatment by other count ries the clinton administration further argued that the funds set aside to pay an award to iran by the decision of the claims tribunal were still us prope rty and as such were imm une from attachment due to us sovereign immunity the court agreed and quashed the writs of attachment26 efforts were also mounted in both the flatow case and in alejandre v republic of cuba the brothers to the rescue case to attach assets of iran and cuba in the united states that had been blocked by the us

other countries as in the iranian hostage situation and that they will be useful in negotiating the possible future reestablishment of normal relations with iran and cuba the administration also contended that numerous other us nationals had legitimate and prior claims against these countries that would be frust rated if the assets were used solely to compensate the recent vic tims of

properties it would encroach on my authority under the constitution to receive ambassadors and other public ministers moreover if applied to foreign diplomatic or cons ular property secti on 117 would place the united states in breach of its internationa l treaty obligations it would put at risk the protection we enjoy at every embassy and consulate throughout the world by eroding the principle that diplomatic property must be protected regardless of bilateral relations absent my authority to waive section 117s attachment provision it would also effectively elimin ate use of blocked assets of terrorist states in the national security interests of the united states including denying an important source of leverage in addition section 117 could seriously impair our ability to enter into global claims settlements that are fair to all us claimants and could result in us taxpa yer liability in the event of contrary claims tribunal judgment to the extent possible i shall construe section

statement44 while expressing support for the goal of fi nding fair and just compensation for the grievous losses and unimaginable experiences of the victims of terrorism they said that the victims of terrorism act wa s fundamentally flawed and had five principal negative effects as follows first blocking of assets of terrorist st ates is one of the most significant economic sanctions tools available to the presid ent the proposed legislation would undermine the presidents ability to comb at international terrorism and other threats to national security by permitting the wholesale attachment of blocked property thereby depleting the pool of bl ocked assets and depriving the us of source of leverage in ongoing and office sic sanctions programs such as was used to gain the release of our citizens he ld hostage in iran in 1981 or in gaining information about pows and mias as part of the normalization process with vietnam second it would cause the us to violat its international treaty obligations to protect and respect the immunity of dipl omatic and consular property of otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31258crs14 45 hrept 106733 at 4 2000 as initially reported hr

spending outlays and receipts that would re sult from enactment of th bill because this provision apparently had not been discu ssed in committee the committee subsequently deleted it before the bill went to the floor see hrept 106733 part 2 2000nations and would put our own diplomatic and c onsular property around the world at risk of copycat attachment with all that such implies for the ability of the united states to conduct diplomatic and consular relations and protect personnel and facilities third it would create race to the courthouse benefiting one small though deserving group of americans over fa r larger group of deserving americans for example in the case of cuba many americans have waited decades to be compensated for both the loss of property nd the loss of the lives of their loved ones this would leave assets for th eir claims and others that may follow even with regard to current judgment holders it would result in their competing for the same limited pool of assets which would be exhausted very quickly and might not be sufficient to satisfy all judgments fourth it would breach the longstandi ng principle that the united states government has sovereign immunity fro m attachment thereby preventing the us government from making good on its debts and international obligations and potentially causing the us taxpayer to incur substantia l financial liability rather than achieving the stated goal of forcing iran to bear the burden of paying these judgments the congressional budg et office cbo has recognized this by scoring the legislation at 420 million the bulk of which is associated with the foreign military sales fms trust fund such waiver of sovereign immunity would expose the trust fund to writs of attachment which would inject an unprecedented and major element of uncertainty and unreliability into the fms program by creating an exception to the processes and principles under which the program operates fifth it would direct courts to ignore the parate legal status of states and their agencies and instrumentalities overtu rning supreme court precedent and basic principles of corporate law and inte rnational practice by making state majorityowned corporations liable for th debts of the state and establishing dangerous precedent for government owned enterprises like the us overseas private investment co rporation opic notwithstanding these contentions the senate and house judiciary committees reported and the house passed slightly amended version of the justice for victims of terrorism act the bill in the nate was reported w ithout committee report the house judiciary committee stated in its report the presidents continued use of his waiver power has frustrated the legitimate rights of victims of terrorism and thus this legislation is required while still allowing the president to block the attachment of embassies and necessary operating assets hr 3485 would amend the law to specifically deny blockage of

authority granted by 2002 and waived subsection f1 of section 1610 of title 28 united states code in the interest of national security53 thus except to the extent 2002 allowed the blocked assets of

report of the housesenate conference committee on the victims of trafficking bill expressed an intent that th waiver authority of 2002 be exercised only on casebycase basis as follows subsection 1f of this bill repeals the waiv er authority granted in section 117 of the treasury and general government appropriations act for fiscal year 1999 replacing it with clearer but narrower waiver authority in the underlying statute the committee hopes clarity in the legislative history and intent of subsection 1f in the context of the section as whole will ensure appropriate application of the new waiver authority the committees intent is that the president will review each case when the court issues final judgement to determine whether to use the national security waiver whether to help the plaintiffs collect from foreign st ates nonblocked assets in the united states whether to allow the courts to attach and execu against blocked assets or whether to use existing authorities to vest and pay those assets as damages to the victims of terrorism when future president does make decision whether to invoke the waiver he should consider seriously whether the national secur ity standard for waiver has been met in enacting this legislation congress is expressing the view that the attachment and execution of frozen assets to enforce judgem ents in cases under the antiterrorism act of 1996 is not by itself contrary to the national security interest indeed in the view of the committee it is generally in the national security interest of the united states to make foreign state sponsors of terrorism pay courtawarded damages to american victims so neither the foreign sovereign immunities act nor any other law will stand in the way of justice thus in the view of the committee the waiver authority should not be exercised in routine or blanket manner but only where us national security interests would be implicated in taking action against particular blocked assets or where alternative recourse such as vesting and paying those assets may be preferable to court attachment hrept 106939 at 117118 2000 55 65 fed reg 70382 november 22 2000 and 65 fed reg 78533 december 15 2000 56 the

the fy2002 appropr iations act for the departments of justice commerce and state which was signed in to law on november 28 2001 prior to that amendment it said the suit did not fall within the terrorist state exception to the fsia because iran had not been declared to be rrorist state at the time it seized and held the american personnel hostage the court said also that absent an express statement of intent by congress it could not apply 626c retroactively 102 the court stressed that the terrorist stat exception which congress had added to the fsia in 1996 meant only that us courts coul d exercise jurisdiction over such cases traditional state immunity in other words was eliminated as jurisdictional barrier but that amendment to the fsia did not in itself the court said provide cause of action for such suits the specific statute providing fo r such cause of action which congress enacted later in 1996 it said provided only for cause of action against an official employee or agent of terrorist state not agai nst the terrorist state itself see pl 104208 div title i 101c september 30 1996 flatow amendment 110 stat 3009172 28 usc 1605 note supra note 3 103 the court stressed

on august 17 2001 it did not in fact have jurisdiction over the case and thus should not have entered judgment101 the cause of action which congress had adopted in late 1996 did not in fact apply to suits against terrorist states but only against the officials employees and agents of those states who perpetrate terrorist acts102 and the provision of the algiers accords committing the united

international executive agreement furthermore the legislative histories of these statutes contain clear statements of congressional intent to specifically abrogate the algiers accords therefore unless and until congress expresses its clear intent to overturn the provisions of binding agreement between two nations that has been in effect for over twenty years this court can not interpret these statutes to abrogate that agreement roeder v islamic republic of iran supra at 177 the court also rejected the argument that beca use the united states entered into the algiers accords under duress the accords cons tituted an unenforceable illegal contract whatever emotional appeal and rhetorical flour ish this argument contains the court said it is absolutely without basis in law id at 168 104 the court did not base its decision on any paration of powers considerations but it did say that if it had construed 626c to apply retroactively congresss postjudgment retroactive imposition of

the fy2008 ndaa into law the white house signed waiver154 and issued press release justifying the exercise of the waiver authority155 the memorandum declares that waiver of all of the provisions of section 1083 with respect to iraq is in th national security interest of the united states and lists the following factors absent waiver section 1083 woul d have potentially devastating impact on iraqs ability to use iraqi funds to expand and equip the iraqi security forces which would have serious implications for us troops in the field acting as part of the mu ltinational forceiraq and would harm antiterrorism and counterinsurgency efforts application of section 1083 to iraq or any agency or instrumentality thereof will hurt the interests of the united states by unacceptably interfering with political and ec onomic progress in iraq that is critically important to bringing us troops home if applied to iraq or any agency or instrumentality thereof the provisions of section 1083 would re direct financial resources from the continued reconstruction of iraq and would harm iraqs stability contrary to the interests of the united states waiver will ensure that iraqi assets of the central bank of iraq the government and commercial entities in which iraq has an interest remain available to maintain ma croeconomic stability in iraq and support private sector development and trade by providing for the maintenance of macroeconomic stability the waiver of section 1083 will promote the consolidation of democracy in iraq absent waiver of section 1083 iraqs ability to finance employment alternatives vocational training and job placement programs necessary to promote community reintegration and development efforts contributing to counterterrorism efforts would be harmed by ensuring that iraq and its agencies and instrumentalities are not subject to litigation or liability pursuant to section 1083 waiver of section 1083 will promote the cl ose relationship between the united states and iraq httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31258crs42 156 simon v republic of iraq 2008 wl 2497417 dc cir 2008 157 it appears that the waiver of all of the provisions of 1083 merely leaves the law as it was prior to the enactment of the ndaa with respect to claims against iraq under simon plaintiffs with ongoing actions may conti nue to pursue them under 28 usc 1605a7 as previously in force and the flatow ame ndment supplemented by state causes of action 158 simon slip op at 3 noting that statute that retroactively alters the consequences of primary conductas by impairing rights party possessed when he acted increasing partys liability for past conduct or imposi ng new duties with respect to transactions already completed is presumptively nonretro active such statute applies to pending case only if the congress clearly so provides citing landgraf v usi film prods 511 us 244 280 1994 id at 4 construing 1083cd of the ndaa specifi cally the court noted that congress by specifying that the amendments apply to any claim arising under section 1605a must have meant to distingu ish new claims from pending claims inasmuch as the amendments obviously would apply to any claim under 1605a and could apply to other claim id 159 28 usc 1610 note permitting the attachment of some blocked assets 160 judgment holders would not be foreclosed from invoking other provisions for property attachment in the fsia that were not amended by 1083 if the creditors were able to locate assets that qualify for exceptions to sovereign immunity under those provisions however very few of these nonterrorism exceptions would likely apply iraqi property used for commercial activity in the united states would be attachable only if iraq waives its immunity for that purpose or if judgment stems from claim that was also based on some commercial activity and the property is or was used for that activity 28 usc 1610f could potentially be used to satisfy outstandi ng terrorism judgments against iraq against property regulated under an executive order issu ed pursuant to ieepa if the presidential waiver provided for in 1610f3 exercise d by president clinton in 2000 28 usc 1610 note is somehow deemed to have lapsed or to be ineffectiv with respect to particular asset 28 usc 1610f2 also likely continues to apply it provides in pertinent part continuedthe waiver appears to foreclose any refiling of the acree lawsuit under the new provision but the dc circuits recent decision in simon v republic of iraq156 may permit the acree case to go forward as case pending under previous 28 usc 1605a7 along with other pending cl aims against iraq under the fsia terrorism exception157 in simon iraq argued that the repeal of 1605a7 cut off jurisdiction of pending cases while the presidential waiv er prevented their conversion into claims under new 1605a the court disagree d interpreting 1083c of the ndaa to repeal 1605a7 only as to future cl aims against state sponsors of terror158 under this interpretation plaintiffs with pending claims against defendants other than iraq may be permitted to pursue claims under both the repealed 1605a7 and new 1605a the court also rejected iraqs contention that th lawsuit shoul d be dismissed as presenting political question iraq will likely ask the supreme court to review the decision possibly in conjunction with the beaty case final judgments against iraq are not affected by the presidential waiver but any judgments against iraq will likely remain difficult to enforce some avenues available to plaintiffs to enforce terrorism judgments ar not affected by 1083 such as tria 201159 and the nonterrorism related excep tions related to the property of sovereign in 28 usc 1610160 but these will likely remain unavailing

1605a7 as in effect before the enactment of section 1605a or section 1605a the secretary of the treasury and the secretary of state should make ever effort to fully promptly and effectively assist any

may 7 2003 making certain antiterrorism sanc tions inapplicable with respect to iraq see supra note 113 pursuant to 1503 of ewsaa pl 10811 effectively restores immunity to iraqi assets while this argument has not prevailed in the courts and congress included in 1083c of the fy2008 ndaa provision approving of the courts interpretation that ewsaa could not be invoked to such effect 1083c4 there may be some plausibility to the argument that congress by permitting th president to waive the latter provision has tacitly acquiesced to the presidents interpretation of ewsaa the dc circuit did not consider whether waiver of 1083c4 d any effect on ewsaa concluding that its earlier decision in acree would control in any event simon slip op at 9 the supreme court may take up the issue if it grants

claims against the united states be fore an international tribunal that is the subject of awards rendered by such tribunal or that is subject to section 1610f1a of title 28 united states code the court found that the award was covered by section 1610f1a because it is property regulated although not blocked by the office of foreign assets controlpossibly believing that pending cases woul d be dismissed due to the exercise of the waiver provision congress included in 1083 its sense that the president acting through the secr etary of state should work with the government of iraq on statetostate basis to ensure compensation for any meritorious claims based on terrorist acts committed by the saddam hussein regime against individuals who were unite d states nationals or members of the united states armed forces at the time of those terrorist acts and whose claims cannot be addressed in courts in the united states due to the exercise of the waiver authority above165 ministry of defense iran v elahi although iran has not appeared in court to defend itself in any of the terrorism cases brought against it it did nonethele ss challenge decision that allowed judgmentholder to collect part of judgme nt against iran out of an award owed to iran by third party166 the ministry of defense and support for the armed forces of the islamic republic of iran mod asked the supreme court to overturn decision that allowed the respondent dari ush elahi to attach 28 million arbitral award issued in irans favor by the international chamber of commerce for breach of contract that occurred in 1979 elahi had been awarded default judgment of 3117 million in lawsuit against iran and its ministry of intelligence and security mois based on the 1990 the assassination of his brother

suit against cubic defense systems inc to attach irans award in partial satisfaction of their judgments against iran flatows petition was denied after the court found that he had waived his righ t to attach such assets by accepting payment under section 2002 of the victims of trafficking and violence protection act of 2000 vtvpa168 elahis lawsuit was one of those cases added later to section 2002 of the vtvpa however and since he was onl able to collect portion of the compensatory damages from us funds he retained the right to pursue satisfactionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31258crs45 169 28 usc

compensatory portion of his claim from irania n blocked assets not at issue before the usiran claims tribunal iran argued that its judgment retained immunity under the fsia as military property169 the court rejected irans contention noting that mod did not assert that the judgment would be used for military purposes but instead stated the money would be deposited in irans central bank170 the court also rejected irans contention that the judgment is protected as the property of foreign central bank or monetary authority held for its own account within the meaning of section 1611b1 because it found that language to apply only to money held by foreign ba nk to be used or held in connection with central banking activities171 mod also sought to invoke the blocking regulations as bar to the attachment of the judgment but the court rejected that argument as well pointing out that the transacti on was permitted under general license finally mod sought to bring collateral attack against elahis default judgment contesting the jurisdiction of the court that issued it on the basis of the alleged invalidity of the fsia terrorism exception under the cicippiopuleo decision supra the court construing the jurisd ictional question as one of personal jurisdiction rather than subjectmatte r jurisdiction found that mod could have attempted to void the judgment on this basis at the district court level but had waited too long to raise the issue during collateral proceedings because mod was unable to show that the district court that issued the default judgment in favor of elahi acted in manner inconsistent with due process or that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case the court ffirmed the decision in favor of elahi mod petitioned for certiorari to the supreme court to review the decision on several bases mod challenged the ninth circuits assumption that mod is an agency or instrumentality of iran rather than an integral part of the iranian government without parate juridical status this distinction has bearing under the fsia as to how its assets are treated and whether it can be held liable for the debts of the ministry of intelligence and security mois mod also challenged the assessment that the judgment due it on military contract is not military property under the fsia as to the collateral attack on elahis judgment iran argued that in the context of the fsia questions of personal jurisdiction and subjectmatter jurisdiction over foreign sovereign are so intimately linked as to be inseparable which would allow mod to dispute the va lidity of elahis default judgment by asserting it was founded on an invalid cause of action based on the recommendation of the solicitor general the supreme court granted certiorari only with respect to the issue of mods status as an agency or instrumentality of iran in per curi am opinion the court vacated the decision below on the grounds that mod had not had an opportunity to present

177 see brief of the solicitor general in support of certiorari elahi v islamic republic of iran usno 07615the issue172 the ninth circuit had erred according to the court because it had either mistakenly relied on concession by the plaintiff that mod was an agency or instrumentality or it had simply assumed that there was relevant distinction between those entities and foreign state proper the fsia provides an exception to the immunity from execution of the pr operty of foreign state only if such property is used for commercial purposes by contrast the property of an agency or instrumentality of foreign state is not immune from execution if the entity is engaged in commercial activity in the united states regardless of whether the property is used for the commercial activity173 on remand the appellate c ourt found that mod is foreign state rather than an agency or instrumentality of foreign state so that the judgment owed to mod in the cubic defense arbitration would have to qualify as property used for commercial activity in order for the fsia exception to sovereign immunity to apply174 the court did not regard the judg ment as commercial property however the court found that it was blocked sset within the meaning of tria 201 because it represented an inte rest in military equipment th at iran had acquired prior to 1981175 and permitted the judgment holder to attach the entire sum one judge dissented arguing that the judgment should be considered at issue before the iran us claims tribunal in case involving ir ans claims against the united states for nondelivery of military equipm ent although the judgment itself is not at issue judge fisher reasoned it could be used by th united states as an offset in the event iran is eventually awarded compensation if the judgment were considered to be at issue before the iranus claims tribunal the plaintiff would have relinquished his right to attach it in satisfaction of his judgment against iran by accepting partial payment of compensatory damages from th us treasury pursuant to tria 201 iran again petitioned for certiorari which the supreme court granted176 to review whether the arbitral award is blocked asset within the meaning of tria 201 and whether it is at issue before th iranus claims tribunal and thus off limits to elahi the solicitor general d filed brief supporting certiorari on the first issue but advising against review of the second on the basis that determination in irans favor would merely mean that the award would be used to satisfy judgment against iran where the plaintiff had not relinquished his right to attach such assets177httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31258crs47 109th congress proposed legislation in addition to the bills addressing the acree decision hr 1321

suits seeking money judgments over matters unrelated to the property unless and until valid judgment has been awarded194 it does not generally apply to ne gotiable instruments195 ordinarily the purpose of filing lien of lis pendens in civil litigation is to put third parties on notice that the property is the subject of litigation which effectively prevents the alienation of such property although it is not technically lien or prejudgment attachment it does not preven t or invalidate transactions involving the property and its intent is not to aid either side in the underlying dispute196 its effect is to bind person who acquires an interest in property subject to litigation to the result of the litigation as if he or she were party to it from the outset197 because the resulting cloud on title can have detrimental effect on the value of property and the right of enjoyment courts in some jurisdictions have the discretion to require the lis pendens proponent to post

subj ect to attachment under 28 usc 1610 can be read two ways it can be read to require that the property would be subject to execution to satisfy judgment based on the specific clai m at issue because it is property described in 28 usc 1610g or it can be read to requi re merely that the property does not qualify for foreign sovereign immunity the legislative history suggests that the intent is to protect property used for diplomatic or consular purposes rather than to ensure that lis pendens notices have effect only with respect to propert that is ultimately subject to attachment to satisfy judgment on particular claim this interpretation is problematic because the provision seems to cover all property titled in any entity identified by the plaintiff as controlled by the defendant state which c ould encompass property in which the defendant state has interest and where the propert owner is not defendant to the action 202 28 usc 1964 203 54 cjs lis pendens 23 204 id 24

pendens is unjustified198 some states require that the court expunge lis pendens notice on evidence that the litigation is not the type contemplated by the relevant statute or that the proper procedures were followed199 some state statutes permit the court to cancel notice of lis pendens if the defendant posts bond or provi des some other substitute s ecurity if adequate relief for the claimant may be secured by these means200 for recording the lis pendens liens in suits filed unde r section 1605a the clerk of the district court is required to file the notice of action indexed by listing as defendants and all entities listed as controlled by any defendant this appears to be intended to relieve plaintiffs of the burden of identifying specific property in the notices but it is unclear what further measures might be required to ensure adequate notice is afforded to prospective purchasers or how it is to be determined without further process that the property is in fact subject to attachment if the statute is interpreted to require such showing201 with respect to real property federal law ordinarily requires compliance with record ation or indexing procedures applicable in the state where the property is located in order to give constructive notice of an action pending in united states district court202 state procedures typically require that notices of lis pendens affecting real estate are recorded with the local registry of deeds although in some cases notice is deemed valid as long as the pleadings adequately describe the property at issue203 notice of lis pendens that is not properly recorded may be held ineffec tive as to the rights of subsequent purchaser204 if the filing requirement in sec tion 1605ag is deemed to replace state statutes and to give constructive notice to prospective purchasers such purchasers who have actual notice of the lis pendens could raise due process claims205httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31258crs53 205

discretionary relief after final judgment is rendered and appeals are longer possible ordinarily change in statutory law may be applied to civil cases that arose prior to its enactment if congress makes clear its intent in this regard230 but only in cases still pending before the courts and those filed after enactment to the extent that 1083 is read to require courts to reopen final judgments and previously dismissed cases or reinstate vacated judgments the provision may be vulnerable to invalidation as an improper exercise of judicial powers by congress231 similar objection may be raised with respect to the waiver of legal defenses while it is wellestablished that congress can waive legal defenses in actions against the united states232 an effort to abrogate valid legal defenses of

corporations an overview by kevin r kosarlibya from terrorrelated lawsuits if it agr ees to compensate certain us victims under claims settlement agreem ent with the united states243 s 3370 the libyan claims resolution act was enacted on august 4 2008 it provides an exception to the fsia for libya in the event libya signs an international agreement claims agreement with the united states to settle terrorismrelated claims and to provide fair compensation it contains sense of the congress in support of the presidents effo rts to provide fair compensation to all nationals of the united states who have terrorismrelated cl aims against libya the statute authorizes the secretary of state to designate one or more entities within the united states to assist in the provision of compensation it does not indicate whether the designated entity is to have role in adjudicating claims or whether the amount of compensation and identity of claimants eligible for compensation are to be specifically set forth in the claims agreement it appears that the government is to receive funds pursuant to an agreement with libya which it would then turn over to the designated entity for dispersal to cl aimants although there is express requirement to this effect in the statute all of the entitys property that is related to the claims agreement would then be immune from judicial attachment and the entity itself would be immune from lawsuits related to actions it takes to implement claims agreement designated entity will not be subject to the government corporation control act244 if the secretary of state certifies to congress that sufficient funds have been received under the claims agreement the statute will provide immunity to libya including its agencies and instrumentalities as well as its officials employees and agents for all claims brought under the rrorism exception to the fsia either under the previous version of the statute or as amended by 1083 of the fy08 ndaa whether the suits are brought in federal or state courts the statute provides immunity to property belonging to libya including its agencies and instrumentalities and the property of libyan agents officials and employees from attachment in aid of execution or similar judicial process under the fsia terrorism exception in order for the funds received by the government to be sufficient for the purposes of the certification under the bill they must be sufficient to cover settlements libya has agreed to pay to vi ctims of the pan am 103 airliner bombing and the belle disco bombing as well as to provide fair compensation to us nationals who have pending cases against libya for wrongful death or physical injury arising under section 28 usc 1605a incl uding previous actions that have been given effect as if they had been filed under 1605a it appears that the amount of fair compensation is left to the discretion of the secretary of state it is unclear how the entity designated to assist in the disp ersal of the funds is to determine how much to provide to each of the claimants there is express requirement that the designated entity disperse the fundshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31258crs65 245 28 usc 1605a provides cause of action for personal injury or death which appears to cover broader scope of injuries than wrongful death or physical injury claims for wrongful death under the fsia ame ndment have

appendix the provision does not explicitly state that only claims described in the certification requirement would be compensated but this seems to be fair inference under this interpretation compensation is envisioned in the case of claimants who are not beneficiaries of settlement agreement in the pan am 103 and belle disco cases unless they have pending case under 1605a for wrongful death or physical injury245 claims that would otherw ise be permitted under 1605a for example claim for solatium or intentional infliction of emotional distress related to the hostagetaking of family member would not likely be compensated under the bill it appears that finally adjudicated cases are not covered in which case unsatisfied judgments against libya and its officials will likely be unenforceable246 claimants do not appear to have any recour in court to dispute the amount or denial of compensation under the propos although claim against the united states for an uncompensated taking in violation of the fifth amendment would not be foreclosed other bills in the 110th congress hr 3346 is substantially identical to hr 6305 as introduced in the 109th congress except that it makes provision for returning assets from the hostage victims fund to foreign state after its status as terrorist state has been terminated provided all cla ims have been paid or the president determines that sufficient funds remain availabl to pay remaining claims it is unclear whether these requirements refer to claims against the fo reign state whose terrorist designation has been lifted

id at 910an appellate court decisi on in 2004 holding that cause of action exists under the fsia to sue terrorist states themselv as opposed to thei r employees officials and agents led courts to apply domestic state tort law to lawsuits against terrorist states based on the domicile of the victim resulting in some disparity of relief available to victims confusion about the finition of an agency or instrumentality of foreign state also brought uncertainty to these lawsuits the supreme court in the elahi case clarified the importance of distinguishing between agencies and instrumentalities and foreign states themselves but did not address any of the other issues raised by the terrorism exception to the fsia section 1083 of the fy2008 national defe nse appropriations act will likely clarify the existence of federal cause of action against state sponsors of terrorism but us nationals with outstanding cau ses of action against iraq may call on congress for some form of redress th total amount of judgments against state sponsors of terrorism and former state s ponsors of terrorism is likely to increase more rapidly especially if 1803c is d eemed valid to permit the refiling of cases the reinstatement of vacated judgments or the upward amendment of final awards as well as the filing of new cases for which the statute of limitations has already expired whether more assets of those states will become available to satisfy those judgments is less certain making th assets of separate agencies and instrumentalities available to satisfy judgments may increase the total assets available for levy in the short term but may also lead such entities to avoid future transactions that would put their assets at risk an in crease in transactions with debtor states is likely to occur only with respect to those states that are longer subject to anti terrorism sanctions in which case the use of any assets that come into the jurisdiction of the united states to satisfy judgments may act as barrier to trade notwithstanding the lifting of sanctions on the other nd if the terrorism exception to the fsia results in decrease in terrorist attacks affecting the
