implementation project is the method by which the federal emergency management agency fema will update the tcl and implement the doctrine of capabilities based preparedness as outlined in the national preparedness guidelines the goal of the project is to provide more user friendly accessible and credible capability targets with which to link all preparedness cycle activities to strengthen preparedness across prevention protection response and hazard mitigation capabilities the purpose of this document is twofold first it explains the history of the tcl and why fema is leading t he effort to streamline and revise the co ntent found in tcl version 20 through the establishment of updated target capabilities secondly the document provides an executive summary of the updated target capabilitie s how they can be applied to identify capability targets and gaps and explains how jurisdict ions may leverage the target capabilitie s to build capabilities along each phase of the preparedness cycle ii background homeland security pre sidential directive 8 hspd 8 national preparedness1 directed the secretary of homeland securi ty to develop national domestic all hazards preparedness goal the national preparedness guidelines2 previously the national preparedness goal published in september 2007 sets forth the doctrine priorities and systematic approach for enhancing the level of preparedness across the nation the target capabilities list tcl version 20 3 also release d in september 2007 supports the national preparedness guidelines guidelines by providing guidance on the specific capabilities and levels of capab ility that federal state local tribal and non governmental entities should develop and maintain in order to ensure readiness for all hazards the tcl provides references and baseline information for 37 capabilities across the prevention protection r esponse and hazard mitigation mission areas while the 37 capabilities found in the tcl are not the only capabilities that should be built and maintained they are those that have the highest payoff in terms of national readiness the tcl is derived f rom th tasks identified to be performed to prevent protect against respond to and recover from the 15 national planning scenarios4 that are representative of the range scope magnitude and complexity of major incidents including terrorism natural d isasters and other hazards the tcl is also designed to serve as reference document to assist jurisdictions in understanding what actions they may take to build and sustain capabilities as

tcl is living document it is designed to be modified to fit the changing preparedness landscape and to add ress stakeholder re commendations for improvement through continued engagement with the stakeholder community fema obtained the input necessary to inform updating the content and structure of the tcl users have collectively recommended improvements to both the structure and level of specifi city contained within the tcl 20 specifically s takeholders commented that the tcl should be rooted in measurable and objective outcomes in order to best assist jurisdictions in determining their respective level s of preparedness section 646 of t he post katrina emergency management reform act of 2006 pkemra8 reitera tes this need by requiring fema to create guidelines that are specific flexible and measurable9 stakeholders also noted that the tcl 20 suggests that all jurisdictions require the same level of capability regardles s of population or other applicable risk factors such as proximity to critical infrastructure and key resources cikr stakeholders recommended that the next iteration of the tc l identify different capability targets for j urisdictions with varying risks and characteristics pkem ra reaffirmed the national need to build capabilit in accordance with risk by charging fema with defining risk based target capabilities for federal state local tribal and non governmental entities 10 pkemra directed that the risk based targets include the variables of threat vulnerability and consequences related to population areas of high population density critical infrastructure coastli ne and international borders11 based on the abovementioned guidance fema h as initiated an effort to enhance tcl by developing an updated target capability for each of the 37 capabi lities described in tcl 20 the effort entitled the tcl implement ation project is intended to better assist jurisdictions or entities understand how prepared are we how prepared do we need to be what should we do to close the gaps 5 information on t he national incident management system can be found at httpwwwfemagovemergencynims 6 the national response framework is available at the nrf

capabilities as jurisdictions this should not be confused with the intent to define capabilities in terms of the level of government city or county or entity mass transit system that has authority to deliver specific capability iv intended audience as whole the target capabilities are being written chiefly for those who have responsibility to ensure that their jurisdiction is prepared for large scale incidents as such the intended audience includes elected and appointed leaders eg federal department or agency heads state governors mayors tribal leaders and city or county officials and emergency management and homeland security practitioners across state local and tribal government each target capability is designed for specific audience for example the wmdhazardous mater ials rescue capability may be most utilized by fire chiefs and hazmat operators while the animal disease emergencies capability may be utilized more often by state veterinarians and public health officials while some of the language in each target capab ility reflects this subject area specificity fema has designed the target capabilities to be read by all emergency response practitioners regardless of their specialization v tcl implementation project development fema will release target capabilitie s on rolling basis beginning with the following target capabilities animal disease emergencies multi agency coordination eoc management onsite incident command intelligence mass transit protection wmdhazardous materials rescue because t he target capabilities are only as strong as the validation they receive from the home land security community fema will first circulate the drafts for review and comment through the fema regions and stakeholder groups following the broad national review subject matter experts will assist fema with adjudicating all comments received once complete fema will release the target capability drafts for formal review through the federal tcl evolution priorities increased usability the new target capabilities are intuitive concise and consistent with h ow communities think about building capabilities alignment with other preparedness documents the new target capabilities reflect consistent alignment with industry s tandards planning guidanc laws and federal policies and doctrine such as the nat ional incident management system nims the national response framework nrf and the national infrastructure protection plan nipp emphasis on outcome oriented measurable performance metrics the new target capabilities establish measurable targe ts for jurisdictions that allow them to assess readiness status and identify how they may build capabilities provision of jurisdiction specific capability criteria the new target capabilities provide guidance on incorporating risk factors in determin ing desired levels of capability for jurisdictions of different size and characteristics predecis ional draft for official use only fouo 2172009 fema national preparedness directorate 6 classes key points acknowledge that different jurisdictions have varying capability needs not every risk variable is relevant for each capability jurisdictions may belong to different classes for different capabilities scope the intent of the target capabilities is to provide performance targets for jurisdictions to build capabilities against through preparedness programs and activities to demonstrate they can deliver capability during large scale disaster or terrorist attack register comments received will be incorporated into the document s or catalogued f or future consideration the first six draft target capabilities are planned for circulation in calendar year cy 2009 and fema plans to complete development of the remaining suite of target capabilities by 2010 vi target capabilities the target capab ilities aim to streamline the tcl to provide jurisdictions with clearer guidance on target levels of capability in order to prevent protect against respond to and recover from catastrophic natural disaster andor large scale terrorist attack each of the 37 target capabilities described in the tcl will be revised and released as target capabilities the target capabilities will be different from iterations contained within tcl version 20 as information will be presented in series of three 3 int errelated charts illustrated in figure vi 1that define figure vi 1 target capability components the following sections explain in greater detail the three components of target capability where appropriate examples have been added for clarification the following sections are not intended to be technical assistance resourc or training guide rather they are intended to provide readers with an understanding of the tcl and updated

opulation density may drive the initial placement of jurisdictions and adjustments will be based on proximity to critical i nfrastructure and other factors specific to given capability other factors may rve to drive the delineation of classes based upon the unique charac teristics of the 37 capabilities classes ultimately help define who should possess how much of cap ability classes will most often be based on the level of government or entity with statutory authority to deliver capability either city or county government this is consistent with the central tenet of the national incident management system nims that most emergency situations are handled locally however the end user will determine how they will be organized to build and sustain capability and the target capabilities present risk factors based on jurisdiction or entity perspective defining preparedness at the sta tutory authority level should be combined with the emphasis fema has placed on regional collaboration while preparedness will be measured by political jurisdictions the effort to improve preparedness must be collective effort the target capabilities do not suggest that any entity is expected to deliver capability by itself rather they allow for jurisdictions and tities to access capabilities through mutual aid and regional collaboration identifying your class the class chart groups ju risdictions according to shared risk characteristics end users should selfidentify which class they be long to through four 4 step process 1 determine who city county state or other jurisdiction or entity has authority to deliver the capability 2 based on answer to number 1 identify the requisite class based on primary risk factors defined in section of the classes i llustrated table below note that classes are not always initially identified by population factors for example the mass trans it protection capability may use total modal passenger miles or number of unlinked passenger trips 3 consider the use of additio nal risk factors to determine whether or not t he jurisdiction s class may be adjusted based on criterion defined in section b of the classes illustrated table 4 jurisdiction or entity may identify itself as belong ing to class by virtue of meeting criteria for any one or more risk factor s predecis ional draft for official use only fouo 2172009 fema national

entity identifies its appropriate class capabilities are then expressed in terms of performance objectives in the second chart performance objectives measure the critical few activities that should be completed in order for the capability to be achieved to be consistent with nims spanofcontrol principles target capabilities should have limited number of performance bjectives genera lly more than five or six performance objectives will be used to outline single capability furthermore performance bjectives measure outcomes or the end state and do not prescribe how the jurisdiction or entity mush meet the objective performance objectives are link ed to each specific class the associated performance measures define the target or scale of the benchmark s with which to build capabilities against some performance objectives will be universally ap plicable across all class eg all jurisdictions predecis ional draft for official use only fouo 2172009 fema national preparedness directorate 9 need to rescue victims as part of the wmdhazardous materials rescue capability conversely some performan ce objectives may only apply to some classes eg rural jurisdictions may not need to disseminate intelligenc as defined in the intelligence capability the target of performance objective measure can also vary by class for example large jurisdictions may be expected to rescue more victims within certain time period than small jurisdiction s outcome oriented performance objectives are important because they identify the highest priority actions necessary f or given capability the focus on more than five 5 performance objectives helps decision makers understand the fundamental set of skills needed to demonstrate proficiency in particular capability as such performance

measuring proficiency proficiency in certain capability is measured by jurisdictions ability to meet the five performance objectives through combination of plans personnelteams equipment training and exercises figure ix 1 preparedness cycle jurisdictions do not need to own each of the resources listed in the resource element chart s rather jurisdictions should demonstrate that they have access to such resources eg through mutual aid or regional collaboration and that ch access can be granted during disasters in the time scales identified in the performance objective eg jurisdiction must address whether the hazmat response team can get to the incident scene within 30 minutes if the nearest team lives 100 miles away absent real world test jurisdictions will never have absolute confirmation that they have the appropriate level of preparedness however plan reviews and exerci ses do provide meaningful proxy for determining whether minimum capability benchmarks can be met jurisdictions that use the target capabilities for planning purposes should first identify and review resource element deficiencies against the resources l isted in the planning personnelteams equipment and training resou rce element tables once those gaps or deficiencies have been corrected jurisdictions should employ exercises to understand whether or not they can meet capability s performance objectives predecis ional draft for official use only fouo 2172009 fema national preparedness directorate 12 resource elements illustrated identifying capability gaps the tcl is intended to facilitate capability and risk based preparedness to achieve national regional and jurisdictional preparedness goals pursuant to the national preparedness guidelines the updated target capabilities outline measurable objectives for jurisdictions to strive toward achiev ing through building the appropriate resources expertise tools and personnel for that specific jurisdiction to identify precisely whi ch resource s may be sought or built to help meet each performance objective jurisdictions should perform an analysis comparing available resources against what is needed through four step process 1 use target capabilities to determine applicable class performance objectives and resource elements needed to achieve the performance objectives 2 determine the availab ility and status of personnel and resources owned mutual aid and regional collaboration that can deliver the capability by achieving perfor mance objectives 3 identify gaps in resource availability and readines s predecis ional draft for official use only fouo 2172009 fema national preparedness directorate 13 4 apply resources and validate the capability level through plan reviews exercises and after action review processes target capabilities are intended to facilitate the identification and validation of generalnational level regional as well as jurisdictional specific targets the target capabilities serve to identify high level strategic recommendations and guidelines while states local jurisdictions private sector entities and thers are responsible for carrying out the specific tactical activities to address those national guidelines graphic ix2 illustrates this relationship figure ix2 capability targets x applying the target capabilities to the preparedness cycle the tcl target capabilities are designed to be used as reference guide but are primarily implemented during course of each step of the preparedness cycle developing strategy developing comprehensive homeland security strategy is the first step in the preparedness cycle jurisdictions homeland security strategy should be consistent with the strategy of its state or urban area and is intended to enumerate potential risks and identify capabilities designed to protect against these risks this proces s consists of three steps 1 risk assessment 2 capability assessment and 3 establishing priority capabilities 1 risk assessment predecis ional draft for official use only fouo 2172009 fema national preparedness directorate 14 risk assessment serves as the basis for setting priorities for investments and other actions to ensure the adequacy of capabilities related to the threats and vulnerabilities of greatest concern 2 capability assessment jurisdictions should conduct capability assessment to identify which of their capabilities require improvement to adequately prevent protect against or respond to the risks they have identified the initial assessment should be based on the performance objectives identified in the target capabilities 3 establishing priority capabilities jurisdictions should compare the results of their risk assess ment with the results of their capability assessment based on the findings they can identify priority goals and objectives for improving all hazards preparedness when determining priority capabilities jurisdictions should also take into consideration the strategic goals and objectives developed at the state or regional levels planning the planning elements identify what jurisdictions standard operating procedures sop or emergency operations plans eop should include for ensuring that contingencies are in place for delive ring the capability during large scale disaster jurisdiction should review the industry standards and policy documents that have been referenced in the planning chart jurisdictions should follow these general guidelines when revising sops and eops however jurisdictions will still refer to their specific hazard and vulnerability analysis to develop requirements specific to their needs comprehensive preparedness guides cpg that provide guidance on planning process for all hazards are being developed to supersede the state and local guide 101 document which will includ references to applicable tcl capabilities as preparedness resource for planning similarly each target capability references applicable cpgs as planning resource element s developing homeland security strategy example from wmdhazmat rescue capability jurisdiction conduct s risk assessment and determine s that because it contains class chemical plant the wmdhazmat rescue capability is high priority this jurisdictions strategy should explore the following types of questions regarding the interrelationship between capabilities and the best approaches to addressing gaps and defici encies how many people would potentially have to be rescued from the chemical plant in the event of large scale incident at the plant how many people would potentially have to be decontaminated in the event of large scale incident at the plant how nd where would decontaminated victims be triage d predecis ional draft for

evaluation states and jurisdictions should asse ss and develop plan to address training needs specific to each capability jurisdictions should make training decisions based on the requisite performance objectives and information derived from previous assessments and the homeland security strategy training should focus n developing the knowledge skills and abilities to complete the series of essential tasks or learning objectives dhs and its training partners provide specialized tailored training courses to assist jurisdictions in building the ir capabilities jurisdictions can access these courses as part of their effort to execute the capability building efforts of the preparedness cycle exercises qualitatively and quantitatively test the ability of jurisdictions to achieve

937 am task completed fully partially x not na establishing improvement plans and tr acking corrective actions jurisdictions should develop improvement plans and track corrective actions to address the priority capabilities identified in strategic plans and tested in exercises or real events jurisdictions create corrective actions based on improvement plans generated from aars and after action conferences the outputs of which can strengthen initial strategic plans after the exercise exercise participants attend an after action conference where they discuss the content of the draft ar and develop an improvement plan ip in the final aarip the content of the draft aar is revised and the initial recommendations are tied to corrective actions and presented in an improvement plan the completion of corrective actions leads to the improvement of priority capabilities which informs future capability assessments and improves overall preparedness updating capability assessment homeland security strategy plans corrective actions guide capability improvement by identifying the plan s training equipment and procedural areas that need to be strengthened based on findings from exercises or real world events each corrective action is linked to target capability or capability element and then assigned to responsible party for imp lementation predecis ional draft for official use only fouo 2172009 fema national preparedness directorate 18 jurisdictions should reference the tcl when implementing corrective actions specifically the measures and critical tasks listed within the tcl can serve as benchmarks for implementation jurisdictions should continually reassess their ove rall capabilities plans and strategies taking into account the implementation of improvement plans and corrective actions this process of reassessment and revision supports and contributes to the beginning of the next preparedness cycle by ensuring th at updated strategies and plans can be used to retest past exercise objectives and inform new preparedness building activities fema is charged with developing the comprehensive assessment system cas by pkemra to enable fema to assess compliance with the national preparedness system the national incident management system nims and other related plans assess capability levels against target levels assess resource needs to meet target levels and assess the performance of training exercises and perations the cas will function as central repository for national preparedness data in its first iteration the system will integrate data from prior reports and legacy assessment systems to reduce the need for duplicative data calls the first c as survey will address questions about current capabilities that have not already been answered through other assessments and reports focusing on key measures drawn from the 37 capabilities set forth in the tcl 20 the cas will integrate the target capab ilities into the assessment process as they are completed xi conclusion for additional information on the tcl implementation project and the target capabilities please contact fema at tcldhsgov
