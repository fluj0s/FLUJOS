questions ve been raised about the potential for terrorist events to occur close to or during the voting process for the november 2004 elections for instance the stion has been raised as to whether sufficiently calamitous event could result in the postponement of the election and what mechanisms are in place to deal with such an event while the current date of november 2 could be changed by statute the legal and practical implications of this change would vary depending on the pa rticular circumstance under which such postponement arose this report focuse s on who has the constitutional authority to postpone elections to whom such power could be delegate d and what legal limitations exist to such postponement in evaluating any such proposals an initial question to be asked is which elections will be affected traditionally all voting whether federal state or local occurs in local precinct polling places and state or local authorities have significant role in regulating such voting congress however also has authority to regulate elections and that authority ma vary depending on whether the election is for the presidency the house the senate or for state or local offices while the executive branch has significant delegated authority regarding some aspects of election law this authority does not currently extend to setting or changing the times of elections under variety of possible scenarios that could arise as result of terrorist attack before or during an election eith er the congress or the states might pass legislation which would affect the timing of these elections the suggestion has been made however that the executive branch might have some role in determining whether an election was to occur or whether it could be cancelled while the executive branch does not currently have this power it appears that congress may be able to delegate this power to the executive branch httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32471crs2 1 this power is at its most broad in the ca of house elections which have historically always been decided by system of popular votin g us const art i 2 cl 1 states the house of representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states unlike house elections senate elections were until ratification of the 17th amendment decided not by popular vote but by vote of the state legislatures this helps explain why cong ressional power over senate elections while almost as broad as it is for house elections contains one exception that congress may not regulate the places of chusing senators 2 2 usc 7 3 2 usc 1relevant constitutional provisions the authority to postpone an election woul d appear to be natural corollary of the power to set the time for an election th authority to set the date of elections appears to derive principally from two constitutional provisions article i 4 cl 1 the times places and manner of hol ding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature therof but the congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations except as to the places of chusing senators article ii 1 cl 4 the congress may determine the time of c husing the presidential electors and the day on which they shall give their votes which day shall be the same throughout the united states the text of the constitution does not appear to contain constitutional role for the executive branch in such decisions house and senate elections although the constitution is silent on various aspects of the voting process the constitution seems to anticipate that stat would be primar ily responsible for establishing election procedur for congressional elections1 however in the case of setting the time for house and senate elections congress has superseded the states authority and has set the time for the election of members and senators by statute members of the house are to be elected the tuesday next after the 1st monday in november in every even numbered year2 while senators are to be elected at the same time as house members3 it would appear that under article i 4 cl 1 congress would have broad authority to postpone elections so as to account for emergency situations the supreme court and lower courts have interpreted the langua ge of article i 4 cl 1 to mean that congress has extensive power to regulate

authority to ex act 5 percent filing fee for congressional elections 6 it would appear however that the congress could not postpone elections indefinitely as the constitution requires that members of the house of representatives shall be chosen every second year us const art i 2 cl 1 and senators shall be chosen for terms of six years us const amend xvii see also us const amend xx specifying that the terms of the president and vicepresident shall end january 20th and those of senators and representatives shall end january 3rdvote for members of congress is derived from the constitution and that congress therefore may legislate broadly under this provision to protect the integrity of this right4 the court has stated that the author ity to regulate the times places and manner of fede ral elections embraces the authority to provide complete code for congressional elections not only as to times and places but in relation to notices registration supervision of voting protection of voters prevention of fraud and corrupt practices counting of votes duties of inspectors and canvassers and making and publication of election returns in short to enact the numerous requirements as to procedure and safeguards which experience shows are necessary in order to enforce the fundamental right involved congress has general supervisory power over the whole subject 5 although the congress has set the election date applicable to the 2004 election by statute it would still appear to be within congresss power to change it thus it would appear that congress would have the power by statute to postpone the upcoming house and senate elections6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32471crs4 7 despite modern state practice providing fo r popular voting for electors the appointment of presidential electors was historically and re mains today power of the state legislatures for instance state would still retain the aut hority to use an alternative method of choosing presidential electors besides popul ar elections us const art ii 1 cl 2 provides that each state shall appoint in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct number of electors equal to the whol number of senators and representatives to which the state may be entitled in the congress but senator or representative or person holding an office of trust or profit under the united st ates shall be appointed an elector 8

article ii 1 cl 4 does provide that congress may determine the time of c hoosing presidential electors the congress has established this date by statute as the tuesday next after the first monday in november in every fourth year succeeding every election of president and vice president8 although the congress does not have the explicit authority to regulate other aspects of presidential elections bey ond time case law does indicate that the congress may have powers ex tending beyond establishing the time of choosing the electors for instance the supreme cour t has allowed congre ssional regulation of political committees which seek to influence presidential elections arguing that such legislation is justified by the need to preserve the integrity of such elections in burroughs v united states 9 the supreme court reasoned that while presidential electors are not officer s or agents of the federal government they exercise federal functions under nd discharge duties in virtue of authority conferred by the constitution of the united states the president is vested with the executive power of the nation the importance of his election and the vital character of its relationship to and ffect upon the welfare and safety of the whole people cannot be too strongly stated to say that congress is without power to pass appropriate legislation to safeguard such an election from the improper use of money to influence the result is to deny to the nation in vital particular the power of self protec tion congress undoubtedly possesses that power as it possesses every other power essential to preserve the department and institutions of the general government from impairment or destruction whether threatened by force or by corruption10 the power of congress to protect the integrity of the presidential election combined with its authority to set the time of election would also seem to provide the congress the power to postpone elec tions because of national emergencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32471crs5 11 us const amend x iii prohib iting slavery amend xiv due process and equal protection and amend xv voting rights 12 the rights of citizens to vote shall

legal overview crs report 91736a 16 it is possible however that the executive branch could make deci sions that would make it difficult or impractical for particular state or federal election to occur for instance variety of situations could occur under which the executive branch might seek to limit the movement of citizens under its emergency powers see harold relyea national emergency powers crs rep 98505 gov may 13 2004 howeve r exercise of such power would not appear to have the legal effect of delayi ng an election nor would it vest the executive branch with the authority to reschedule the election the legal resolution of an election during which significant numbers of persons fail to reach the polls due to the actions of the executive branch is beyond the scope of this memorandum 17

authority to regulate the manner and procedures used for elections at the stat and local level the congress does have extensive authority under the civil war amendments11 the 19th amendment12 the 24th amendment13 and the 26th amendment14 to prevent discrimination in access to voting and it has exercised that power extensively over state and local as well as federal elections15 however absent some relations hip to the issues addressed by these amendments such as th postponement of state ection to deal with issues of discrimination the congress would not appear to have th authority to regulate the time of the state elections executive branch po wer over elections the executive branch does not appear to currently have the authority to establish or postpone the dates of elections at either the fe deral or state level in the event of an emergency situation16 the question arises however whether the congress could delegate such power as it does have to the executive branch generally under separa tion of power doctrine congre ss may delegate power to the executive branch so long as it includes standards so that court can ascertain whether the will of congress has been obeyed17 there is apparent reason why this doctrine would not extend to the power of congress to set the time of national elections under either article i 4 cl 1 house and senate or article ii 1 cl 4 presidential electors18 thus as long as the congress set standards for thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32471crs6 18 continued court rejected the argument that the taxing cl ause us const artic i 8 cl 1 should be treated differently for purposes of delega tion we discern nothing in the placement of the taxing clause that would distinguish c ongress power to tax from its other enumerated powers such as its commerce powers its pow er to raise and support armies its power to borrow money or its power to make rule s for the government in terms of the scope and degree of discretionary authority that c ongress may delegate to the executive in order that the president may take care that the laws be faithfully executed but see amy keller members pan election idea roll call july 13 2004 quoting yale professor jack balkin to the effect that article ii provides that congress not the executive branch may determine the date of presidential elections 19 arguably the congress would need to set standards both for the cancellation of the existing date and then for the institution of new date failure to provide such direction would raise issues of separation of powers see clinton v city of new
