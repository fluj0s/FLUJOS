rulemaki ng process underlying many of these regulatory reform efforts is perceived need to reduce the burden associated with regulatory compliance proponents of refo rm contend that fede ral regulations are too costly time consuming complex and intrusive for businesses and other regulated parties and that better crafted rules can be developed through among other things the use of sophisticated anal ytical tools and greater oversight by the president and congress on the other hand some contend that these reform fforts focus too much on the costs of regulations and do not adequate ly recognize the benefits that the rules provide they also argue that additional requirements will have the effect of eroding existing regulatory protections or lengthening an already lengthy rulemaking process thereby depriving the public of needed health safety and environmental improvements the purpose of this report is to provi congress with broad overview of significant congressional and presidential regulatory reform efforts within the past 20 to 30 years those efforts have ge nerally centered on one or more of the following themes or categories 1 requirements that agencies use various forms of regulatory analysis eg costbenefit analysis costeffectiveness analysis and risk assessment when developing regulations 2 the development of presidential or congressional offices or procedures for the ex ternal review of agencies rules 3 the development of regulatory accounting statem ents reflecting the costs and benefits of all agencies rules possibly leading to th development of regulatory budget 4 efforts to encourage agencies to use alternatives to traditional command and control regulations such as market incentives and performance standards 5 the imposition of

protection agencyfederal regulatory reform an overview introduction federal regulation can be fined broadly as requirement s directives standards or procedures backed by the use of penalties or other sanctions intended specifically to modify the behavior of state and local governments private institutions businesses and individuals regulations generally start with an act of congress and are the means by which statutes are implemented and specific requirements are established the terms rule or regul ation are often used interchangeably in discussions of the federal regulatory process the administrative procedure act apa of 1946 defines rule as the whole or part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement interpret or prescribe law or policy1 the procedures that federal agencies are required to follow in writing regulations is called the rulemaking process for description of the federal rulemaking process and the statutes and executive orders that govern that process see crs report rl32240 the federal rulemaking process an overview by curtis w copeland although the term regulatory reform can refer to efforts to deregulate certain industr ies eg airlines or teleco mmunications in this report the term refers to efforts to ch ange the rulemaking process origins of regulatory reform the federal government has regulated economic activity since the nation was formed for example in the late 1700s congress gave the president the authority to develop regulations that set duties on foreign goods and to determine who traded with indian tribes subsequently econo mic regulation often occurred as result of historical events and was often implemente d through independent regulatory agencies established separate from executive partments and independent agencies2 for example congress created the intersta commerce commission in 1887 in response to public dissatisfaction with the railroa d industry the securities and exchange commission was created in 1934 to address fra ud and corruption in the securities and financial markets httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32356crs2 3 see for example s 343 the comprehensive regulatory reform act of 1995 in the 104th congress s 981 the regulatory improvement act of 1997 in the 105th congress and s 746 the regulatory improvement act of 1999 in the 106th congress in contrast social regulation in such areas as environmental quality workplace safety and consumer protec tion is relatively recent phenomenon beginning in the 1960s number of new statutes were enacted in those ar eas including the clean air act and the clean water act the toxic substances control act the resource conservation and recovery ac t the occupational safety and health act the truth in lending act and the consumer product safety act those and other statutes reorganization plans and executive orders created new regulatory agencies such as the environmental protection agency epa the occupational safety and health administration osha the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa and the consumer pr oduct safety commission cpsc by the late 1970s an arra of federal economic and so cial regulations were in place that affected many of the decisions made by american businesses strong concerns then began to be raised about whet her the benefits that these regulations and regulatory agencies were attempting to achieve were worth the costs associated with compliance concerns were also being ra ised about the cumulative effects of all federal regulations on indivi dual businesses in 1980 president reagan was elected on platform critical of gove rnments role in society in general and of federal regulations in particular during his ad ministration substantia l changes were made in how federal agencies develop and publish rules and in the degree to which federal regulations were overseen by the executive ffice of the president each subsequent president has also made changes in the regulatory process focus of activity within his administration imposing moratoriums on new rules attempting to focus on results or trying to reduce regulatory burde n or red tape congress has also made several attempts to reform the rulemaking process enacting such statutes as the paperwork reduction act of 1980 the regu latory flexibility act of 1 980 the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995 and the sm all business regulatory enforcement fairness act of 1996 each of th statutes is discussed later in this report additionally congress passed legislation deregulating specific sectors of the economy eg airlines teleco mmunications other efforts in the midtolate 1990s to enact more comprehensive regulato ry reform bills were not successful3 proponents of regulatory re form contend that federal regulations are often too costly time consuming and intrusive they argue that the public and private resources needed to address problems in h ealth safety and envi ronmental areas are limited and that these resources must be allocated more efficiently to address the greatest needs of society in the most costeffective manner and that the costs of regulations should not exceed the benefits they also contend that the existing regulatory system tends to be overly risk averse and question perceived lack of stringent analytical guidelines in the met hodology used to assess risk hazards as well as costs and benefits when developing re gulations reform proponents also contend that the scientific and technical informa tion underlying regulati ons is often of poor quality these perceived shortcomings they argue result in rules that are not well designed and that impede econo mic growth and developmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32356crs3 others however have expressed concerns regarding regulatory reform efforts and believe that at least some of the reforms focus too much on regulatory costs and do not adequately recognize the benefits that federal regulations provide to the public they argue that the real motiv ation behind many of the reforms is relaxation or rollback of regulatory requirements and reduction in the costs associated with regulatory compliance not improvements in net benefits cost effectiveness or information quality they also maintain that the addition of new analytical or procedural requirements to the rulemaki ng process would have the intended or unintended effect of blocking new regulations and reducing the ability of regulatory agencies to safeguard the pub lics health and safety and to protect the environment in timely manner several factors make it difficult to resolve these disputes regarding the need for regulatory reform first the contending parties often repres ent vastly different interests and constituencies with business gr oups often advocating for reforms in the hope that regulations w ill be less burdensome and environmental groups often resistant to those efforts second the empirical information needed to permit science or economics to resolve those differences of opinion regarding the need for regulation or the best way to regulate is rarely av ailable requiring decision makers to use assumptions or judgement to make public policy determinations finally resources are rarely available for regulatory agencies to systematically examine the implementation of their regulations nd to determine whether they should be continued without change strengthened altered to reduce compliance costs or eliminated entirely themes in regulatory reform this report provides broad overvie w of significant congressional and presidential regulatory reform efforts within recent decades those efforts encompass wide range of issues and constituencies ranging from how agencies design regulatory requirements to the review and possible elimination of those requirements after they have been put in place the report is not intended to be comprehensive summary of all regulatory reform initiatives focusing instead on general themes that seem to underlie many of them in general efforts to reform the regulatory process seem to have focused on the following areas requirements that agencies use various forms of regulatory analysis when developing regulations incl uding costbenefit analysis cost effectiveness analysis and risk assessment the development of offices or procedures within the executive office of the president and the congress for the external review of agencies rules the development of regulatory accounting statements reflecting the total costs and benefits of agencies rules and ultimately the development of regulatory budget httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32356crs4 4 see for example tammy tengs and john d graham the opportunity costs of haphazard social investments in lifesaving in risks costs and lives saved getting better results from regulation robert w hahn ed new rk oxford university press 1996 for counter argument see richard w parker grading the government the university of chicago law review vol 70 fall 2003 pp 13451486efforts to encourage agencies to use alternatives to traditional command and control regulations the imposition of moratoriums on the development of new regulations particularly at the change of presidential administrations reviews of agencies existing rules to determine whether they should be revised or eliminated reform efforts focusing speci fically on paperwork burden reform efforts focusing specifically on small entities attempts to ensure the quality of the information used to develop rules or otherwise disseminated to the public efforts to increase the use of in formation technology in rulemaking to improve public participation and regulatory transparency and other reform initiatives eg efforts to protect property rights and the rights of state and local gove rnments and to encourage the use of negotiated rulemaking and plain language regulatory analysis requirements common and some would say the pr imary concern voiced by proponents of regulatory reform in recent decades s been that the costs associated with regulations often outweigh the benefits that those regulati ons are intended to provide another and somewhat related view is that more intelligent regulatory policies could achieve the same social goals eg cleaner environment safer workplaces at much less cost or achieve more ambitious goals at the same cost4 to improve the quality and effectiveness of federal rules and minimize burden regulatory reform proponents have frequently advocated greater use of ra nge of analytic tools during the rulemaking process including costbenefit analysis sometimes referred to as benefitcost analysis costeffectiven ess analysis and risk assessment costbenefit analysis in this context involves th systematic identification of all costs and benefits associated w ith forthcoming regulation including nonquantitative and indirect cost s and benefits and how thos costs and benefits are distributed across different gr oups in society proposed regulatory requirement is judged to pass the costbenefit test if the sum of its anticipated benefits outweighs the sum of its present and future costs in present value terms httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32356crs5 5 see for example lisa heinzerling and frank ackerman pricing the priceless cost benefit analysis of environmental protection washington georgetown university 2002 6 whitman v american trucking associations 531 us 457 2001 7 see kenneth j arrow et benefitcost analysis in envi ronmental health and safety regulation statem ent of principles annapolis the annapolis center 1996 8 for example epa concluded that the full set of basic toxicity data was available for only about 7 of approximately 3 000 highpr oductionvolume chemicals see us environmental protection agency chemical hazard data availability study what do we really know about the safety of high production volume chemicals april 1998these prospective also known as ex estimates of benefits and costs that are done before rules are issued are nece ssarily uncertain and heavily dependent on numerous assumptions particularly difficu lt to quantify are longterm or uncertain effects of rules where subtle interactions between various factors are often not well understood or directly measurable costbenef it analysis is partic ularly controversial when it seeks to rationalize inherent value tradeoffs and to place value on benefits not traded in the market eg health or lives5 also as the supreme court affirmed in 2001 some statutes prohibit the consider ation of costs when setting certain health standards6 these concerns notwithstanding most economists believe that when used carefully and with ade quate data costbenefit analysis can be an effective tool in regulatory decisionmaking7 costeffectiveness analysis seeks to determine how given goal can be achieved at the least cost in contrast to costben efit analysis the concern in costeffectiveness analysis is not with weighing the merits of the goal but with identifying and analyzing the costs of alternatives to reach that goal eg dollars per life saved costeffectiveness analysis has been referre d to as bangforthebuck exercise in which the payoff is measured in health units rather than dollars it is commonly seen as better tool than costbenefit analysis for uncovering cases in which large incremental costs result in minor gains disadvantage of this type of analysis is that misjudgments in determining the goal or the budget may go undetected risk assessment in this context is the systematic evaluation of the probability of certain hazards occurring and their adverse effects and can serve as the starting point for regulatory activity and for estimates of regulatory benefits for example risk assessment is often used to estimate the expected rate of illness or death in population exposed to hazardous chemical the quality of the analysis depends on the adequacy of the underlying data and the validity of the methods and assumptions used advocates state that risk analysis ma be used as an objec tive scientific basis for planning identifying management strategies to promote risk reduction conversely critics argue that risk analysis is often not entirely objective in part because of inadequate data regarding the health and ecological effects of most chemicals8 major concerns are that risk analysis may oversimplify problems that its conclusions can be easily manipulated nd that when used in costbenefit analyses it may undervalue benefits pecially when projected over time another concern is that risk analyses often focus on relativ ely small risks to the population as whole rather than larger risks to smaller gr oups these concerns notwithstanding manyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32356crs6 9 for more indepth discussion see crs issue brief ib94036 the role of risk analysis and risk

be valuable management tool in developing and di recting regulatory programs9 presidential initiatives each president within the past 35 years has required some form of regulatory analysis before rules are published in the federal register for example in 1971 president nixon required agencies to develop summary of their proposals description of the alternatives that they considered and the costs of those alternatives in 1974 president ford required agencies to develop an inflation impact statement for each major proposed rule in 1978 president carter required ag encies to prepare regulatory analysis that examined the costeffectiveness of the alternative regulatory approaches for major rules current costbenefit analysis requirements in the rulemaking process are primarily traceable to president reagans executive order 12291 issued in february 198110 under that executive order covered agencies those othe r than independent regulatory agencies were generally requi red to 1 refrain from taking regulatory action unless the potential benefits to society for the regulation outweigh the potential costs to society 2 select regulatory objectives to maximize net benefits to society and 3 select the regulatory lternative that involved the least net cost to society the order also required covered agencies to prepare regulatory impact analysis for each major rule which was defined as any regulation likely to result in among other things an annual ffect on the economy of 100 million those analyses were required to contain descri ption of the potential benefits and costs of the rule description of alternative approaches that could achieve the regulatory goal at lower cost and why they werent selected and determinati on of the net benefits of the rule these analytical requirements remain ed in place until september 1993 when president clinton issued executive order 1286611 the new executive order which is still in effect revoked executive order 12291 but established analytical requirements that are similar although not identical to those it replaced for example regulatory principles unde r executive order 12866 include adoption of regulations only upon reasoned determinati on that the benefits of the intendedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32356crs7 12 as previously mentioned the standard in executive order 12291 was that regulatory benefits outweigh costs not just that there be reasoned determination that they justify those costs 13 this best practices document was developed by an interagency group cochaired by the administrator of oira and member of th council of economic advisors the document was revised and issued as guidance in 2000 to view copy of the best practices document see httpwwwwhitehousegovombinforegriaguidehtml as noted later in this report this document and the 2000 guidance was later replaced by omb circular a4 14 see for example richard d morgensterned economic analyses at epa assessing regulatory impact

burden on society needed to achieve the regulatory objective the order also requires cost benefit analysis for all economically significant rules essentially the same as major rules under executive order 12291 containing an assessment of the anticipated costs and benefits of the regula tory action and an assessment of the costs and benefits of alternatives to the regulatory action with an explanation of why the planned action is preferable in january 1996 the office of management and budgets omb office of information and regulatory affairs oir published document that described best practices for preparing the economic analyses called for by the executive order13 in essence the best practices docum ent said that the analysis should 1 clearly state the need for the proposed action eg mark et failure and make clear why federal regulation as opposed to othe r methods such as state regulation or subsidies is the appr opriate solution 2 clearly show that the agency considered the most important alternative approaches eg performanceoriented standards or market incentives and 3 assess the incr emental costs and benefits of the proposed action taking into account such factors as the appropriate baseline and the use of discount rates when benefits and costs occur at different times the bestpractices document also stated that co steffectiveness analysis s hould be used where possible to evaluate alternatives and says that estimating the benefits and costs of risk reducing regulations requires risk assessment that in part characterizes the probabilities of occurrence of outcomes of interest the government accountability office gao formerly the general accounting office and others have examined agenci economic analyses of rules under the executive order and the 1996 best practices guidance14 several of the studies indicated that the agencies analyses are not always consistent with the requirements in the order or the guidance for exam ple in 1998 gao reported that some of the 20 economic analyses that it examined did not discuss alternatives to the proposed regulatory action and in many cases it wa s not clear why the agencies used certain assumptions15 also five of the analyses did not discuss uncertainty associated with the agencies estimates of benefits or costs or document the agencies reasons for nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32356crs8 16 see for

circularsa004a4pdf doing so other studies have criticized agencies for not providing quantitative information on net benefits in their analyses16 still other studies have examined the accuracy of agencies regula tory cost estimates often concluding that costs are overestimated17 gao and others have also examined agencies use of risk assessment in regulation in 2001 gao described selected agencies chemical risk assessment procedures noting among other things that the statutory and legal context in which the assessments are conducted and how the ag ency plans to use the information play an important role in determining why certain risk assessment approaches are used18 for example some statutes require regulato ry decisions to be based solely on risk while others require standard s to be based on the best av ailable control technology in general gao concluded that the agenci followed the fourstep risk assessment process recommended by the nationa l academy of sciences in 198319 the report also indicated that assumptions are an unavoidable part of risk assessment because science cannot always provide definitive answ ers to questions raised at various stages of an assessment president george w bush retained the general analytical requirements in executive order 12866 in september 2003 though omb and the council of economic advisors finalized new guidance on regulatory analysis refining and replacing the 1996 best practices document among other things the new guidance which has been formally issued as omb circular a4 regulatory analysis 1 places more emphasis on costeffectiveness an alysis as well as costbenefit analysis 2 requires formal probability analysis of future rulemakings with more than 1 billion impact on the economy and 3 re quires more systematic evaluation of qualitative as well as quantified costs and benefits20 the new guidance took effect on january 1 2004 for regulatory analyses in support of proposed rules and takes effect on january 1 2005 for analyses in support of final rules industry groups have been generally supportive of the new guidance but public advocacy groups have expressed concerns that it may result in less regulation

executive order 12866 and related guidance number of ot her presidential acti ons have required analyses of regulations for particular purposes for example executive order 13132 on federalism requires agencies to prepare federalism summary impact statement whenever they issue rule th at has significant federalism implications21 the order goes on to say that the assessment is to contain description of the extent of the agencys prior consultation with state and local officials summary of the nature of their concerns and the agencys position supporting the need to issue the regulation and statement of the extent to which the concerns of state and local officials have been met other executiv orders specifically require agencies to assess the effect of their rules on children and on energy supply distribution or use however most of these orders give agenci substantial discretion to determine when the analytical requirements are triggered congressional initiatives congress has also re quired federal regulatory agencies to analyze the effect of their rules before they are issued some of the requirements are potentially applicable to range of regulations while others are focused on particular types of rules perhaps the broadest of these requirements are in title ii of the unfunded mandates reform act umr of 1995 2 usc 1532 153822 before promulgating rule containing mandate that may result in the expenditure of 100 million or more by the pr ivate sector or stat local and tribal governments in the aggregate umra requires agencies again other than independent regulatory agencies to prepare written statement containing qualitative and quantita tive assessment of the anticipat ed costs and benefitsas well as the effect of the federal mandate on h ealth safety and the natural environment these requirements are not triggered though if the agency issues final rule without previous notice of proposed rulemaking about half of all fi nal rules do not have prior proposed rule also as gao pointed out in 1998 report the umras analytical requirements do not apply to most economically significant rules give agencies substantial discretion regardin g their implementation and do not require much more than is already required in executive order 1286623 other statutory analytical requirements have been enacted with regard to particular issues or constituencies such as the environment or small entities for example the national environmental po licy act nepa of 1969 42 usc 4321 4347 requires all federal agencies to in clude in every recommendation or report related to major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment detailed statement on th environmental impact of the proposed action the

implemented the adequacy of an agencys environmental impact statement is subject to judicial review the regulatory flexibility act rfa of 1980 5 usc 601612 requires federal agencies to assess the impact of their forthcoming regulations on small entities which the act defines as including small businesses small governmental jurisdictions and certain small notforpro fit organizations the rfa requires the analysis to describe among other things 1 the reasons why the regulatory action is being considered 2 the small entities to which the proposed rule will apply and where feasible an estimate of their number 3 the projected reporting recordkeeping and other compliance require ments of the proposed rule and 4 any significant alternatives to the rule that would accomplish the statutory objectives while minimizing the impact on small entities the rfas analytical requirements are not triggered though if the head of th issuing agency certifies that the proposed rule would not have significant economic impact on substantial number of small entities the rfa does not define sig nificant economic impact or substantial number of small entities thereby giving federal agencies substantial discretion regarding when the acts analytical requirements are triggered also as in umra the rfas analytical requirements do not apply to final rules for which the agency does not publish proposed rule gao has examined the implementation of the rfa several times within the past 10 to 15 years and recurring theme in gaos reports is the varying interpretation of the rfas requirements by federal agencies24 in 2001 gao testified that the promise of the rfa may never be realized until congress or some other entity defines wh at significant economic impact and substantial number of small entities mean in rulemaking setting25 in the midtolate 1990s congress considered several comprehensive regulatory reform legislative proposals th at were intended to increase or improve the use of cost benefit analysis costeffectiveness analysis or risk assessment by federal agencies26 the bills particular requirements varied substantially but all of them would have generally required federal agencies to analyz risks as well as costs and benefits when developing major rules some of the bills would have also required cost effectiveness analysis and some required specific studies of how the rules would effect small businesses most of the bills would have required that benefits justify costs or that the agency select the most costeffective alternative on the other hand most of the bills particularly those in the 105th and 106th congress also indicatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32356crs11 27 as noted previously some statutes forbid any consideration of costs in setting health standard eg national ambient air quality standards under the clean air act other statutes establish other requirements eg requiring agencies to regulate to the extent feasible or achievable whose effect on the use of costbenefit analysis in decisionmaking is less clear 28 in some caseseg s 746 the regulatory improvement act of 1999 these bills permitted courts to remand or invalidate rule if an agency had failed to perform required analysis but could not do so because of the perceived inadequacy of the analysisthat these analytic requirements and d ecision criteria would not supercede the provisions in existing law eg the clean air act or the safe drinking water act regarding whether and if so how ag encies should weigh costs and risks in developing regulations27 one of the most controversial aspects of some of these bills were provisions that would have made agencies costbenefit analyses and risk assessments subject to judicial review if these analyses were found to be deficient the rules on which they were ba sed could have been reversed28 some expressed concerns that the courts were illequipped to assess the quality or importance of such analyses to the underlying rules and also indicated that the judi cial review process could prohibit the speedy adoption of healt h safety and environm ental rules none of these comprehensive regulatory reform bills was enacted bills requiring some type of regulatory analysis continue to be introduced for example in the 108th congress hr 338 the defen of privacy act would if enacted require agencies to prepare and make available to the public privacy impact analysis describing the effect of the rule on the privacy interests of individuals the bill specifies that the analysis should scribe the extent to which the rule provides notice of the collection of personally identifiable information allows access to and permits co rrection of that informati on by those individuals and provides security for the information as in umra and the rfa though the analysis is not required if the agency i ssues final rule without an associated proposed rule presidential and congressional review of rules other regulatory reform initiatives have established systematic processes by which agencies regulations are scrutiniz ed by oversight bodies outside of the rulemaking agencies such oversight bodies and review processes have been established for both the president and the congress presidential initiatives as was the case regarding the previously mentioned analytic requirements every president in recent decades has established some type of process within the executive office of the president by which regulatory agencies rules would be reviewed before their publication in the federal register for example president nixon

r egulatory analysis review group to review the economic analyses prepared for certain major rules and to submit comments during the comment period he also established regulatory council to coordinate agencies actions to avoid conflicting requirements and dupli cation of effort according to many observers the most significant development in this evolution of presidential review of ru occurred in 1981 when president reagan issued executive order 1229129 in addition to the previously discussed analytical requirements the executive order require d cabinet department s and independent agencies to send copy of each draft proposed and final rule to omb before publication in the federal register and authorized omb to review any preliminary or final regulatory impact analysis tice of proposed rulemaking or final rule based on the requirements of this order the scope of this requirement was therefore much broader than its predecesso rs covering every proposed and final rule developed by the covered agencies regard less of its significance or subject matter the review responsibility within omb was given to oira which had been created by the paperwork reduction act pra of 1980 and whose primary responsibility had been to review agencies paperwork requests30 after executive order 12291 was issued oira also began reviewin g the substance of between 2000 and 3000 federal rules each year oiras influen ce over agencies rules under this order was substantial unless rule was required by congress or the cour ts the order allowed oira to effectively block the rules promulgation until the rulemaking agency responded to its concerns oiras influe nce was underscored by its location within omb the agency that reviews and appr oves rulemaking agencies budget requests in 1981 president reagan also created task force on regulatory relief headed by vice president bush whose mission was to review pending regulations study past regulations with an eye toward revising them and recommend appr opriate legislative remedies oira also supported th work of this task force in 1985 president reagan extended oiras influence even further by issuing executive order 12498 which required agencies to submit regulatory program to omb for review each year that covered all of their significant regulatory actionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32356crs13 31 executive order 12498 regulat ory planning

noting that oira coul d generally return any rule to the issuing agency for reconsideration if it was not in the agencys regulatory program for that year or was materially different from what was described in the program as result oira could block the issuan ce of rule even if it was otherwise consistent with the require ments in executive order 12291 the expansion of the presidents and more specifically oiras role in the rulemaking process via these executive orders and other actions was highly controversial members of congress public advocacy groups and others raised number of concerns including whether oiras role violated constitutional separation of powers and the effect that oiras review had on public participation and the timeliness of agencies rules in 1983 gao concluded that the expansion of oiras responsibilities under executive order 12291 had adversely affected the offices ability to carry out its pra res ponsibilities and recomme nded that congress consider amending the act to prohibit oira from carrying out other responsibilities like regulatory review32 additional concerns focused on the lack of transparency of oiras reviews specifically whether oira had become clandestine conduit for outside influence in the rulemaking proce ss in 1987 the national academy of public administration published report that summarized the criticisms of the oira review process as well as the positions of its proponents33 both this report and similar 1988 report by the administrative conferen ce of the united states supported the concept of presidential review of rulemaki ng but also offered suggestions to improve the transparency of the process nevertheless congre ssional concerns regarding oiras influence on rules and opposition to some of its actions continued in 1989 president george h w bushs nominee to head oira was not confirmed in part because of lingering concerns about the office s previous actions in response to congressional inaction and because of continuing concerns about the costs of regulations president bush established the presidents council on comp etitiveness to review regulations issued by agencies chaired by vice presiden t quayle the council oversaw and was supported by oira and review ed particular rules that it believed would have significant impact on the economy or par ticular industries many of the competitiveness councils actions were highly controvers ial with cr itics assailing both the effects of those actions eg rolling back environmental or other requirements and the secrecy in which the council acted executive

oversight regulation vol 20 fall 1997 pp 1723 while retaining the overall concept of presidential review of draft regulations the order limited the scope of oiras review to significant rules issued by cabinet departments and indepe ndent agencies the order defi ned significant regulatory action as one that may among othe r things have 100 million impact on the economy create serious inc onsistency with actions by another agency or raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal manda tes as result of this limitation the number of rules that oira reviewed fell from between 2000 and 3000 each year to between 500 and 700 each year executive order 12866 differs from its pred ecessors in other respects as well for example the order generally require s that oira complete its reviews of proposed and final rules with in 90 calendar days and requires both the agencies and oira to disclose certain information about how the regulatory reviews were conducted specifically the or der says that agencies should identify for the public 1 the substantive changes made to rules between the draft submitted to oira for review and the action subsequently nnounced and 2 changes made at the suggestion or recommendation of oira oira is also required to provide agencies with copy of all written communications with parties outside of the executive branch and to maintain public log of all regulatory actions under review the executive order retained regulatory pla nning function but did not explicitly permit oira to return rules that were not included in the issuing agencys plan34 during the clinton administration concer ns were raised th at agencies rules were not being critically reviewed by oira35 for example critics pointed out that from 1994 through 2000 oira returned only seven rules to the agencies for reconsideration less than onehalf of 1 of the rules the office reviewed and returned rules during the last three year s of this period oira said that the number of returns was poor measure of oiras performance and said it was working with agencies to improve their rules before they were formally submitted congress held oversight hearings and legislation was introduced but ultimately not enacted that would have codified and strengthened oira regulatory review function president george w bush retain ed executive order 12866 and the review process it delineated he also nominat ed john graham to head oira whose confirmation was highly controversial shortly af ter taking office in july 2001 graham instituted number of changes in oiras review practices including greater use of return letters 21 returns in his first eight months the issuance of prompt letters encouraging agency action in particular area an increased emphasis on economic

of the agencies performance during the annual appropriations process and hearings on specific regulatory issues during the late 1970s and early 1980s congress also used the legislative veto process to overturn some of the agencies final regulations in that process statutes applicable to several agencies and some programs were written to make final regulations subject to either onehouse or twohouse veto before they could take effect in 1983 howev er the supreme court held in immigration and naturalization service v chadha 462 us 919 that onehouse veto of deportation order by the atto rney general violated the separation of powers doctrine and was therefore unconstitutional the court subsequently applied the same logic in rulings regarding twohouse vetos and ve tos of rules issued by

congress is in recess or adjournmen t member of congress can introduce resolution of disapproval that if adopted by both houses and enacted into law can nullify the rule even if it has already gone into effect congressional disapproval under the cra also prevents the agency from proposing to issue substantially similar rule without subse quent statutory authorizati on but this provision is not intended to vitiate the agencys power to establish regulations in the area in question the cra provides that nate action on disapprova l resolution under the act must occur within 60 days of session after the regulation is submitted and makes available during that period an expedited pr ocedure intended to ensure that the senate can take up and vote on the measure before the period expires the act establishes such expedited procedure for the house if congress adjourns less than 60 days of session after rule is submitted new 60 day period for disapproval under the act begins on the 15th

res that congress has an opportunity to reject unnecessary overly intrus ive or excessively costly regulations critics argue that congressional review encroaches on agency independence can politicize rulemaking delays the timely issuance of regulations and requires an expertise in subject areas that congress doe s not have readily av ailable to it one of the reasons congress delegates regulatory authority to agencies in the first place proponents respond however that congressi onal review enables congress to whom regulatory power is constitutionally given to make the final decision on the need for specific regulations and makes regulatory agencies more sensitive to congressional intent and congress more accountable for re gulators actions they also argue that the mere presence of congressional revi ew process can prevent poorlyconceived rules from being developed regulatory accounting and regulatory budgets regulation like taxing and spending is basic function of government unlike taxing and spending though the costs th at nonfederal entities pay to comply with federal regulations are not accounted for in the federal budget process some researchers have estimated those offbudg et costs in the hundreds of billions of dollars and the estimates of aggregate regulatory benefits are even higher41 congress decided that it needed more information on regulatory costs and benefits so for several years it included language in appropriations bills that required omb to submit annual reports to congress most recently section 624 of the treasury and general govern ment

regulatory costs and benefits see crs report rl32339 federal regulations efforts to estimate total costs and benefits of rules by curtis w copeland 43 for example ombs estimate of regulatory benefits

treasury and general government appropriations act for fiscal year 2001 generally known as the data quality act or the information quality act amended the paperwork reduction act and directed omb to issue governmentwide guidelines that provide policy and procedural guidance to federal agencies for ensuring and maximizing the quality objectivity utility and integrity of information including statistical informati on disseminated by federal agencies omb issued final version of those guidelines in february 2002 45 to view copy of this report see httpwwwwhitehousegovombinforeg

in the aggregate 2 by agency and agency program and 3 by major rule the accounting statement is also required to contain an analysis of impacts of federal regulation on state local and tribal government s small businesses wages and economic growth42 from 1997 through 2001 omb provided estimates of the total costs and benefits of federal rules but presented those estimates with strong caveats for example in its 1998 report omb said ther was not professional consensus on how regulatory costs and benefits should be measured and discussed number of methodological problems eg determining what costs and benefits would have occurred in the absence of the regulation ombs estimates particularly of regulatory benefits varied substantially from year to year43 and also varied from estimates provided by other researchers since 2001 omb has not presented cost or benefit estimate s for all rules instead the office has reported information for all regulations that it reviewed within particular timeframe 1 th at had costs or benefits of at least 100 million annually and 2 whose costs and benefits had been monetized by either the rulemaking agency or omb in its 2002 report omb said its decision to present data for only certain rules during limited timeframe was driven by the inconsistent and increasingly aged nature of many of the studies used to develop aggregate estimates omb went on to say that we do not believe that the estimates of the costs and benefits of regulations issued over ten years ago are re liable or very useful for informing current policy decisions therefore omb said that it decided not to provide aggregate estimates in keeping with the spirit of ombs new informationquality guidelines44 in its september 2003 report omb provide d estimates of the costs and benefits of 107 regulations that it reviewed dur ing the 10year period from october 1992 to september 200245 ombs estimate of the cost of these rules ranged from 36 billion to 42 billion and the estima ted benefits ranged from 146 billion to 230 billionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32356crs19 46 in fact the creation of regulatory budg et was contemplated in section 6a6 of executive order 12291 in 1981 47 samuel hughes regulatory budgeting ce nter for the study of american business washington university working paper 160 june 1996 all in 2001 dollars omb said that it recognized that this information was not complete accounting of the costs and benefits of all federal regu lations or even for all rules issued during the 10 year period and said that th total costs and benefits of all federal rules in place could easily be factor of ten or more larger than the sum of the costs and benefits re ported for the 10year period nevertheless omb said that estimates prepared for rules adopt ed prior to the 10year period are of questionable relevance now regulatory budgets in addition to better informing congress and the public about the costs and benefits of regulations some obser vers have suggested using regulatory accounting information to create regulatory budget to improve regulatory account ability and control46 regulatory budget might limit the total volume of regulatory programs expenditures and compliance costs by setting cap on the compliance costs each agency coul d impose on the economy therefore an agency proposing to add additional complia nce costs would be obligated to remove commensurate amount of existing cost implementing regulatory budget however can present many conceptual and empirical problems including the scope of regulations to be cove red almost all fede ral programs involve some degree of regulation the amount depending to some extent upon ones definition of regulation the accuracy of cost estimate s direct and indirect including the impact on firms industries and consumers be yond compliance costs the accuracy of benefit estimates generally regarded as more difficult to determine than estimating costs and redundancy or overlap w ith state and local regulations47 legislation was introduced in the 108th congress that could lay the groundwork for regulatory budgeting in the future hr 2432 the paperwork and regulatory improvements act of 2003 would if enacted require omb to designate at least five agencies including at least epa and the departments of labor and transportation as pilot projects in regu latory budgeting for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 the bill provides that the budgets shall present for one or more of the major regulatory programs of the agency the varying levels of costs and benefits to the public that would result from different budg eted amounts the bill directs omb to issue report by february 2009 on the pilot project and recommend whether legislation requiring regulatory budgets s hould be proposed during testimony in july 2003 on the bill omb suggested reducing the scope of the pilot projects and clarifying that the budget levels set by omb were not legally binding alternatives to traditional regulations federal agencies have traditionally i ssued command and control regulations that specify what individuals and firms must do to meet an established standard or goal for example environmental regu lations may require the use of specific pollution control devices and inspection systems may require the performance of specific procedures

or performancebased rules may permit the achievement of the regulatory objective at lower cost some st atutes encourage the use of nontraditional regulatory approaches in specific areas or more generally across range of regulations for example the trade agreements act of 1979 19 usc 25312533 requires where appropriate the use of performance standards rather than design standards and the consideration of intern ational standards as the basis of domestic standards emission trading commonly cited example of the market approach to regulation is emission allowan ce trading under the clean air act title iv of the act allows electric utilities to trade allowances to emit sulfur dioxide with other utilities after setting the overall reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions to be achieved congress defined each sources specific missions limits for all sources combined to meet total emissions cap utilities that reduce their emissions below the required levels can sell their extra allowances to other utilities to help them meet their requirements otherwise utilities that ex ceed their emissions allowances must pay fines that are set at several times the estimated average cost of complying with the emissions limits emissions trading has also been used in other environmental programs for example the clean air act amendments of 1990 addressed the use of marketbased approaches to attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards for other pollutants particularly ozone secti on 11a2a of the act says that in their implementation plans states can use economic incen tives such as fees marketable permits and auctions of emissions rights to meet the statutory requirements information disclosure another nontraditional approach to regulation involves information disclosure specifica lly congress and regulatory agencies may attempt to affect the behavior of regulated entities or others by simply revealing the nature of their actions rather than directly attempting to limit them the epa toxics release inventory tri program is one of the most established examples of an information disclosure program the tri program is essentially database created through collections of information imposed on businesses in order to inform the public about chemical hazards in their commun ities tri reporting is required by section 313 of the emergency planning and community righttoknow act of 1986 42 usc 1100111050 1102348 the act generally requires certain types of facilities to report the amounts of various toxic chemi cals that they release to the environment above certain th resholds and requires epa to make this information available to the public the expectation is that these facilities would reduce their use of these chemicals thereby

presidential encouragements in addition to these legislative requirements most recent presidents have also advocated the use of alternatives to traditional regulations for example in 1980 president carter directed agencies to find areas where alternative techniques c ould be used in both existing and new regulatory programs the presidents regulatory council created project on alternative regulatory approaches whic h published series of guides on those approaches presidents reagan and george hw bush also supported the use of market approaches as an altern ative to traditional regulation in september 1993 the national performan ce review npr headed by vice president gore published report to th president containing 384 recommendations intended to make the governme nt work better and cost less51 one set of npr recommendations was directed at improving regulatory systems including the use of innovative regulatory approaches such as performance standards marketable permits monetary incentives and inform ation disclosure executive order 12866 was issued later that month and one of the principles of regulation included in the order was that each agency shall identify and assess available alternatives to direct regulation including providing economic incentives to encourage the desired behavior such as user fees or market able permits or providing information upon which choices can be made by the public another executive order principle says each agency shall identify and assess alterna tive forms of regulation and shall to the extent feasible specify performance objectives rather than specifying the behavior or manner of compliance that regulated entities must adopt oiras september 2003 guidance on econo mic analysis under executive order 12866 recommends that alternatives to traditi onal regulatory action be explored for example the guidance states that performance standards are generally superior to engineering or design standards because performance standards give the regulated parties the flexibility to achieve the regulatory objective in the most costeffective way the guidance also says that marketoriented approaches that allow for averaging banking or trading of credits for achieving emissions reductions beyond the required standards can be extremely valuable in reducing costs or achieving earlier or greater benefits but cautioned that they should not be used if they produce unacceptable local air quality outcomes suc h as hot spots from local pollution concentration finally the guidance says that informational remedies such as rating systems labeling requirements and government publications will often be preferred when intervention is contemplat ed to address market failure caused by inadequate or asymme

regulations increase significantly during postelection quarters arlington va mercatus center oct 5 2000 moratoriums on new regulations imposing moratorium on new rulemaking is technique that has been used to assert control over the rulemaking process particularly for an incoming presidential administration52 for example on january 29 1981 shortly after taking office president reagan issued memorandum to the heads of the cabi net departments and the epa administrator directing them to take certain actions that would give the new administration time to implement new regulatory oversight process particularly for lastminute decisions made by the pr evious administration specifically the memorandum said that agencies should to the extent permitted by law 1 postpone for 60 days the effective date of all final rules that were scheduled to take effect during that 60day period and 2 refrain from promulgating any new final rules executive order 12291 issued few weeks ter contained another moratorium on rulemaking that supplemented but did not supplant the january 29 1981 memorandum section 7 of the executive or der directed agencies to suspend or postpone the effective dates of all major rules that they have promulgated in final form as of the date of this order but th at have not yet become effective excluded were major rules that coul d not be legally postponed or suspended and those that ought to become effective for good cause agencies were also directed to refrain from promulgating any new final rules until final regulatory impact analysis had been conducted in january 1992 president george hw bush imposed 90day moratorium on new regulations in response to criticisms that regulatory burden was increasing rapidly during his administration the pres ident instructed agencies to identify existing regulations and programs imposin g unnecessary regulatory burdens and to develop programs to reduce or eliminate those burdens regulations that were issued in response to emergency situations had st atutory or judicial deadlines dealt with military or foreign affairs or were related to agency administrative matters were exempted from the moratorium the moratorium was later extended and remained in force until the end of the bush administration on january 22 1993 the director of omb for the incoming clinton administration sent memorandum to th heads and acting heads of cabinet departments and inde pendent agencies requesting th em to 1 not send proposed or final rules to the office of the federal register for publication until they have been approved by an agency head appointed by president clinton and confirmed by the senate and 2 withdraw from the office of the federal register all regulations that had not been published in the federal

presidential moratoriums were later ove rturned by the courts56 supporters on the other hand assert that moratoriums help to block undesirable regulations and enable the new administration and federal

codified in the code of federal regulations although most of the attention of regulatory reformers has been focused on new rules reexamination of the large body of existing rules can reveal that they are longer needed or that improvements in the regulatory approach can make the pr ogram more effectiv or less burdensome reviews of existing regulations were recommended by the administrative conference of the united states57 and have been initiated by both recent presidents and the congress presidential initiatives most recent presidents have directed agencies to reconsider their existing regulations fo r example in 1979 president carter issued executive order 12044 which required agenci to review their existing rules periodically58 one of the missions of president reagans task force on regulatory relief was to identify existing regulations and recommend changes during the previouslymentioned moratorium on ne w rules during the administration of president george hw bush agencies were instructed to evaluate existing regulations and programs nd to identify and accelerate action on initiatives that will eliminate any unnecessary regulatory burden or otherwise promote economic growth section 5 of executive order 12866 issued in september 1993 required agencies to submit to oira plan for periodically reviewing their existing significant regulations to determine whet her any should be modified or eliminated according to the executive order the purpose of the review is to make the agencies regulatory programs more effective less burdensome or better aligned with the presidents priorities and the principles speci fied in the order in its report on the first years implementation of the executive order oira said this review of existing rules was intended to be f undamental reengineering of entire regulatory systems not just tinkering with regulatory provi sions to consolidate or update provisions because of concerns that all agencies were not taking the steps necessary to implement regulatory reform president clinton sent memorandum to the heads of cabinet depar tments and independent agencies in march 1995 directing them to among other things conduct pagebypage re view of all their regulations in force and eliminate or revise those that were outdated or in n eed of reform in june 1995 the president announced that this effort had resulted in co mmitments to eliminate 16000 pages from the cfr gao later reported however that four agencies page elimination totals did not take into account the pages that they had added to the

have involved the general public in the review process in may 2001 oira asked the public to nominate rules that it believed s hould be modified or rescinded60 in response oira received 71 nominations from 33 commentator s and decided that 23 of the rules nominated merited high priority review in march 2002 oira again solicited public comments on regulations in need of reform and in response received more than 300 suggestions from about 1700 comme ntators some of which suggested making rules more stringent or developing new rules this time oira forwarded the suggestions to the relevant federal ag encies for review and prioritization in february 2004 oira requested public nomina tion of promising regulatory reforms relevant to the manufacturing sector specifically oira requested that commenters suggest reforms to regulations guidance documents or paperw ork requirements that would improve manufacturin g regulation by reducing unnecessary costs increasing effectiveness enhancing competitiveness reducing uncertainty and increasing flexibility congressional initiatives congress has also directed agencies to review the effects of their existing regulations some of these congressionallyinitiated review requirements focus on rules issued under specific statutes for example section 812 of the 1990 amendments to th clean air act required epa to provide information about the economic costs and benefits and the health welfare and environmental impacts of the clean air act61 the 1990 amendments also directed an interagency group to report every four years beginning in 1996 on the costs benefits and effec tiveness of the acid rain program other congressionallydirected regulatory reviews are more crosscutting although still focused on partic ular types of rules s ection 610 of the regulatory flexibility act requires each federal agency to develop plan for the review of its existing rules that have or will have significant ec onomic impact on substantial number of small entities the purpose of th is lookback review is to determine whether the rules should be continued w ithout change or should be amended or rescinded to minimize their impact on small entities gao reported in 1999 however that regulatory agencies differed in how they interpreted this requirement62httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32356crs26 63 for example epas toxics release inventory tri program is essentially database created through collections of information im posed on businesses in order to inform the public about chemical hazards in their comm unities tri reports require businesses in certain industries to report the quantity of any of more than 600 chemicals entering each environmental medium on site transfers of the chemical in wastes to offsite locations on site treatment methods and efficiency and source reduction and recycling activities for example it was not clear whether agencies are suppos ed to review rules that currently have an impact on small entities or those that had that impact at the time the rules were issued in any event it was clear that few section 610 reviews were being conducted several of the comprehensive regulatory reform bills that congress considered but did not enact during the mid to 1990s would have required agencies to review virtually all of their existing rules not just those issued under certain statutes or that affected small entities for example the regulatory sunset and review act of 1995 hr 994 would have required agen cies to review each existing significant rule and other rules upon re quest by affected partie s or congressional committees within four to seven years after the bills enactment and then to either issue report continuing the rule or take action to modify consolidate or terminate it later the regulatory improvement act of 1997 s 981 would have required agencies to review existing rules identified by an advisory committee representing balanced cross section of public and private interest s the agencies would have then had to decide whether to retain amend or repeal the rules it reviewed paperwork reduction initiatives other regulatory reform initiatives have focused specifically on controlling the paperwork that often accompanies regulations many information collections recordkeeping requirements and thirdparty disclosures are contained in or are authorized by regulations as monitoring or enforcement tools in fact these paperwork requirements are the essence of many agencies regulatory provisions63 large amount of federal pa perwork is necessary and is how many agencies carry out their missions for example irs needs to collect information from taxpayers and their employers to know the corr ect amount of taxes owed epa uses information requirements to ensure compliance with its regulations to evaluate the effectiveness of its programs and for other purposes ne vertheless federal agencies are expected to minimize the paperwork burden that they impose paperwork reduction act the most notable of the various reform initiatives to control federal paperwork is the paperwork reduction act pra 44 usc 35013520 which was originally enacted in 1980 but was subsequently amended in 1986 and again in 1995 the or iginal pra replaced the ineffective federal reports act of 1942 and established oira with in omb to provide central agency leadership and

february 2002 though that omb had not fully developed and implemented an information resources management plan that articulated comprehensive federal vision for all aspects of government information65 the pra also requires agencies to receive oira approval signified by an omb control number for each information collection request before it is implemented under the pras public protection provision one can be penalized for failing to comply with collection of information subject to the act if it has not been approved by oira within the previous three years each year however oira reports that agencies impose hundreds of pape rwork requirements without oira approval although the number of such pra violations have declined in recent years66 oira can disapprove any collec tion of information and generally stop any associated regulation if it believes the collection is inconsistent with the requirements of the pra67 the 1995 amendments to the pra required oi ra to set goal of at least 10 reduction in the government wide burdenhour estimate for each of fiscal years 1996 and 1997 5 goal for each of the next four fiscal years and annual agency goals that reduce burden to the maximum practicab opportunity therefore if these goals had been met the amount of federa l paperwork would ve fallen by 35 from about 7 billion burden hours at the end of fy1995 to about 46 billion hours at the end of fy2001 this anticipated reduction did not occur though in fact by the end of fy2002 the governmentwide pape rwork estimate stood at more than 82 billion hours 17 increase since the pra amendments took effect at the end of fy1995 the agencies often contend that they cannot reduce their paperwork requirements without changes in their author izing statutes many of which require the collection of certain ty pes of information other paperwork initiatives in addition to the pra congress has enacted other statutes in an attempt to reduce or at least control fe deral paperwork burden for example in june 2002 congress enacte d and the president signed the small business paperwork relief act of 2002 pl 107198 the act amended the pra to among other things require each agency to

fewer than 25 employees and established task force to study th feasibility of streamlining information collection requirements on small businesses the task force delivered its first report in june 200369 and its final report is due in june 2004 statutory reforms have been introduced in each congress in an attempt to address paperwork re quirements in particular areas for example in the 108th congress hr 464 the idea paperwor k reduction act of 2003 was intended to provide relief to teachers administrators and related service providers from excessive paperwork burdenrequired under the indivi duals with disabilities act other bills have focused on such issues as the suspension of fines under certain circumstances for firsttime paperwork violations for small businesses initiatives focusing on small entities number of regulatory reforms implemented in recent decades have attempted to get agencies to recognize the effect that their rules can have on small businesses and other small entities advocates of thes initiatives note the important role that small entities play in the economy eg about 50 of the gross domestic product and point to research indicating that sma ll entities are disproporti onately affected by federal regulations70 others indicate however that special regulatory treatment of small entities is both unjustified and socially destructive71 although there have been some pr esidential initiatives in this area72 most of the significant rulemaking requirements affecting small entities have been imposed by congress as noted previously the regulatory flexibility act of 1980 requires agencies to examine the effects of thei r rules on small entities and if the agency concluded the rule had significant ec onomic effect on substantial number of small entities to conduct regulatory flex ibility analysis the act gives regulatory agencies substantial discretion to decide when these analytical requirements are triggered other previously mentioned reforms focusing on small entities include the look back requirement in section 610 of th rfa and the requirements in the smallhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32356crs29 73 general accounting office

paperwork number of statutory reforms directed at small entities concerns were included in the small business regulatory enfo rcement fairness act of 1996 sbrefa perhaps most notably sbrefa amended the rfa and permitted judicial review of agencies compliance with initial and final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements their use of the signif icant impact exclusion and compliance with the look back requirement in section 610 the original rfa prohibited judicial review as discussed be low other sbrefa provisions included requirements that agencies develop compliance guides for small entities provide small entities with penalty relief permit more equal access to justice and ensure that small entities interests are represented on boards and panels involved in the rulemaking process compliance guides and other guidance section 212 of sbrefa requires agencies to publish one or more compliance guides for each rule or group of related rules for which the agency is required to prepare final regulatory flexibility analysis under the rfa becau this provision in sbrefa was built on the rfa all of the discretion inherent in the rfa regarding whether to do an analysis also applies to whether compliance guides must be developed for example if the agency concludes that the final rule w ould not in its opinion have significant impact on substantial number of small entities the agency is not required to prepare compliance guide when they are prepared section 212 requires the guides to be published to be designated as small entity compliance guides and to explain the actions small entity is required to take to comply with the associated final rule in other areas though section 212 gives agen cies broad discretion for example the statute says agencies may prepare separate guides covering groups or classes of similarly affected small entities and may cooperate with asso ciations of small entities to develop and distribute the guides agencies are given sole discretion in the use of plain language in the guides and the statute does not indicate when the guides must be developed or how they mu st be published therefore under section 212 an agency could develop compliance gu ide years after final rule is published with input from small entities in 2001 gao reviewed agencies implementation of section 212 and concluded that the requirement did not appear to have had much of an impact on agencies rulemaking actions73 section 213 of sbrefa requires federa l agencies regulating the activities of small entities to establish program fo r responding to inquiries concerning compliance with applicable statutes and regulations the section also says that in any civil or administrative action against small entity such guidance may be considered as evidence of the reasonabl eness or appropriate ness of any proposed fines penalties or damages sought against such small entity penalty relief by the mid1990s concerns we re being expressed about the

describing the actions the agency would take and said the plans should identify how notification of the agencies policies would be given to frontline workers and small businesses similar requirements were included in sbrefa which was enacted less than year later in march 1996 section 223 of sbrefa entitled rights of small entities in enforcement actions requires agencies to provide small entities with some form of relief from civil monetary penalties specifically the statute requires federal agencies regulating the activities of small entities to establish policy or program by the end of march 1997 fo r the reduction and under appropriate circumstances the waiver of civil penalties on small entities it also required agencies to submit onetime report to four congressional committees by the end of march 1998 on the scope of their programs or policies and th implementation of their penalty reduction efforts section 223 also gave federal agencies substantial discretion in how these requirements were to be carried out in 2001 gao examined the implementation of secti on 223 and determined that the agencies were using that discretion extensively75 for example some of the agencies policies covered only certain civil penalty enforcement actions and some of the policies gave small entities more penalty relief than large entities the agencies also varied in how key terms were defined and in their conditions and exclusions gao made several recommendations to strengthen penalty re lief and improve cong ressional oversight ombudsman and fairness boards section 222 of sbrefa

the participants generally agreed that the panels were worthwhile but suggested several changes to make them work better77 information quality and peer review relatively recent emphasis from advocates of regulatory reform has been focus on the quality of the underlying information that federal agencies use to develop their rules or otherwise disseminate to the public the most significant development in this area has been the actment of section 515 of the treasury and general government appropr iations act for fiscal year 2001 generally known as the information quality act iqa or the data quality act78 the iqa amended the paperwork reduction act and direct ed omb to issue governmentwide guidelines that provide policy and proce dural guidance to federal agencies for ensuring and maximizing the quality objectivity utility and integrity of informationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32356crs32 79 omb published those governmentwide guidelines in interim form on sept 28 2001 and in

define dissemination as ag ency initiated or sponsored distribution of information to the public and specifically indicates that this includes risk assessments prepared by an agency to inform the agencys formulation of possible regulatory or other action the guidelines also define such terms as quality utility objectivity and integrity the iqa also instructed all agencies both cabinet departments and independent agencies as well as independent regulatory agencies to issue their own guidelines not more than one year after the issuance of ombs governmentwide guidelines and to establish administrative mechanisms allowing affected persons to seek and obtain correction of information maintained and disseminated by the agency80 finally the act required agencies to report periodically to the director of omb on the number and nature of complaints received and how such complaints were handled by the agency the first agency reports were due by january 1 2004 the iqa builds upon existing agency responsibilities to assure the quality of information collected used or disseminated to the public81 proponents of the act contend that the law and the omb and agency guidelines will improve the quality of agency science and regulation and force agencies to regulate based on the best science available some of these propone nts also maintain that the act will help agencies defend their regulations against lawsuits and reduce the number of lawsuits filed they also point out that in any re quests for correction of information the iqa places the burden of proof on the affected parties making the request they must demonstrate that specific dissemination does not meet the standards of either the omb guidelines or the ag encyspecific guidelines on the other hand opponents of the act nd the guidelines contend they may have chilling effect on agency distribution and use of scientific information these opponents foresee flood of data quality cha llenges

correction of information pursuant to the iqa82 the conference report also said that omb should suggest changes to the act or to ombs guidelines to improve the accuracy and transparency of agency science in april 2004 omb provided congress with report on the imple mentation of the iqa during fy200383 the report said that agencies received only about 35 substantive correction requests during the year and said it wa s premature to make broa d statements about both the impact of the correction request proce ss and the overall responsiveness of the agencies many other correction request s listed in the report were on minor issues or involved matters that had been dealt with before the iqa was enacted omb indicated that the correction requests came from all segments of society and said there was evidence that the iqa had affected the pace of rulemaking however omb watch public interest group said ombs report was seriously flawed in that it understated the number of correction requests and di d not disclose that nearly threequarters of the re quests were from industry84 judicial review some observers see judicial review as the crucial test of the acts future effectiveness if judicial review is permitted agencies may find themselves subject to potentially endless legal challenges to their regulations and other types of information disseminations wh ich could make them less likely to issue similar regulations in the future on the other hand the absence of judicial review may encourage agencies to pay less attention to the iqa and make them more subject to

omb also retains substantial discretion in certain areas omb and supporters of the peer review bulletin indicate that peer review standards across the government are currently inconsistent and th at more consistent use of peer review can increase the technical quality and credibility of regulatory science92 they also assert that peer review can protect sciencebased regulations from political criticism and litig ation opponents view the bulletin as an effort to inject political considerations into the world of science and to use the uncertainty that inevitably surrounds science as an excuse to delay new rules that could cost regulated entities millions or even billions of dollars they also expressed concerns regarding the need for the bulletin and ombs authority to issue it electronic rulemaking federal agencies have recen tly initiated number of efforts to use information technology it in their rulemaking and othe r regulatory processes the impetus for some of these efforts were congressional or presidential directives to better utilize it in range of administrative areas but many were started at the initiative of career officials involved in the rulemaking process presidential initiatives in its september 1993 report the national performance review recommended increas ed use of information technology to increase opportunities for early frequent and interactive public pa rticipation in the rulemaking process shortly thereafter an interagency regulatory working group established by executive order 12866 created subgroup on information technology and rulemaking by decembe r 1994 several agencies including the nuclear regulatory commission and the department of agricultures animal and plant health inspection service were accepting comments on proposed rules through electronic bulletin boards for example the department of labor dol used electronic bulletin boards to support negotia ted regulatory proce ss developing rules to protect workers building steel structures in the next several years many federal agencies used it in the rulemaking process to varying degrees many of these efforts centered on the facilitation of public participation in rulemaking93 most notably the depa rtment of transportation developed its docke t management system an electronic imagebased database covering every agency and every rulemaki ng within the department the system permitted electronic comments and access to regulatory supporting materials eghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32356crs37 94 for discussion of the use of it in regu latory

developed an implementation strategy th at identified 24 egovernment initiatives one of which was erulemaking this initiative is intended to provide single portal for businesses and citizens to access

consolidate redundant it systems relating to the pres idents online rulemaking initiative and indicated that consolidation of those systems could save millions of dollars in late 2002 epa was named lead agency for the rulemaking initiative in january 2003 the bush administration launched the regul ationsgov website as the first module of its erulemaking initiative the webs ite permits the public to identify proposed rules that are open for comment govern mentwide and permits the public to comment electronically on those rules95 although omb indicated in march 2004 that regulationsgov was being accessed by the public more than 15000 times per month eg to locate rules open for comment other data indicat ed that fewer than 50 electronic comments per month were r eceived from the public via the website in its first 10 months of operation the second module of the erulemaking initiative is intended to create one or more electronic dockets for proposed and fi nal rules thereby allowing the public to access regulatory supporting ma terials and the comments of others from one website epa indicated that the erulemaking team would test centra lized governmentwide online docket in the fall of 2004 in four or five agencies with full implementation expected in early 2005 congressional initiatives congress has also taken numerous steps in recent years to encourage federal agencies to use it in carrying out their missions some of these efforts have been specifically direct ed at the regulatory process while others had an indirect effect on that process for example in 1998 congress enacted the government paperwork limination act gpea 44 usc 3504 note which required that by october 21 2003 federa l agencies provide the public when practicable with the option of submitting

proposed rules containing all comments submitted on the rules as well as other materials that by agency rule or practice are included in the rulemaking docket under the apa whether or not sub mitted electronically the egovernment act also requires agencies to conduct privacy impact assessment before initiating new collection of informa tion that uses information technology and contains individually identifying informa tion in addition the act established an office of electronic government within omb headed by an administrator appointed by the president it requires the administrator of that office to work with the administrator of oira in establishing the strategic direction of the egovernment program and to overs ee its implementation other regulatory reform initiatives number of other regulatory reform in itiatives have been undertaken in recent decades including efforts to encourage agenci to 1 recognize the effect that their rules have on federalism nd private property rights 2 develop rules through negotiations with affected parties 3 write their rules using plain language federalism both congress and various presidents have put in place reforms intended to ensure that federal agencies take the interests of state local and tribal governments into consideration as they velop rules the effectiveness of these requirements however is questionable as mentioned in an earlier section of this report the unfunded mandates reform act requires federal agencies to analyze their rules and prepare written statement when their rules require 100 million in expenditures by state local or tribal governments in the aggregate gao concluded however that this requirement applies to few rules and requires little beyond what the agencies we re already required to do97 in 1987 president reagan issued executive order 12612 on federalism which established set of fundamental principles and criteria for executive departments and agencies to use when formulating and implementing

contain certain elements eg identifying the extent to which the policy would impose additional costs or burdens on the states and was to accompany any rule submitted to omb for review under executive order 12866 gao examined the implementation of executive order 12612 and concluded that like umra it had little effect on agency rulemaking99 agencies prepared few federalism assessments even when the rules preempted state or local law in 1999 president clinton issued executive order 13132 on federalism which revoked execu tive order 12612 like its predecessor though the new executive order provides ag encies with substantial flexibility to determine which of their actions have f ederalism implications and therefore when they should prepare federalis m summary impact statement private property rights each year federal agencies issue number of regulatory actions that can affect the use of private property such as limiting the development of land that includes critical wildlife habitat or wetlands in such takings cases the property owner may be owed just compensation under the fifth amendment to the constitution to obtai n compensation property owner claiming that regulatory action has effected taking must initiate lawsuit against the government in 1988 president reagan issued ex ecutive order 12630 which addressed this subject100 the stated purpose of the order was to ensure that regulations and other government actions are undertaken on well reasoned basis with due regard for the potential financial impacts imposed on the government by the just compensation clause of the fifth amendment the executive order requires executive branch agencies among other things to 1 cons ider the potential takings implications of their proposed actions and to document sign

resulting from landowner lawsuits allegi ng takings and 4 account for takings awards levied against them in their annual budget sub missions the order also required the department of justice to issue guidelines on the implementation of its requirements in december 1998 the congressional budget office cbo reported that of the thousands of actions that agen cies take each year that c ould affect

believed that the justice departments 1988 guidelines needed to be updated102 gao also reported that omb issued guidance in 1994 informing agencies that information on just compensation awards longer needed to be compiled or reported and that the executive orders requirement that agencies consider the takings implications of their actions applied to relatively few cases and often were not documented103 in the mid1990s several bills were introduced either as part of comprehensive regulatory reform legislati on or separately that woul d have required the federal government to compensate pr operty owners if regulation restricted the use of the land by certain amount eg 10 or 50 these bills were not enacted negotiated rulemaking the concept of negotiated rulemaking sometimes referred to as regulatory negotiation or regneg emerged in the 1980s as supplement to the traditional proce dure for developing regulations104 in 1982 the administrative conference of the united states established criteria identifying rulemaking situations in which negotiated rulemaking is likely to be successful105 in 1990 congress enacted the negotiated rulemaking act of 1990 5 usc 561 570a and the act was amended and pe rmanently authorized in 1996 110 stat 3870 the act encourages but does not re quire agencies to consider convening negotiated rulemaking committee before developing and issuing proposed regulation under the administrative pro cedure act the committee composed of representatives of the agency and the vari ous interest groups that would be affected by the proposed regulation ddresses the issues involved in the hope that it can reach agreement on the contents of proposed regulation the agency can if it agrees then issue the agreement as proposed rule and eventually final rule under existing apa requirements any propos agreed to by the ne gotiated rulemaking committee is not however binding on the agency or other parties the act also generally requires that the committee consist of at least one member of the agency and more than 25 members that the agency select an impartial facilitator to chair meetings and that an agreement on any negotiated rulemaking must be unanimous the acthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32356crs41 106 us president clinton negotiated rulemaking memorandum of sept 30 1993 code of federal regulations vol 3 1994 p 776 107 cary

travel and per diem expenses and reasonable compensation to committee memb ers under certain conditions negotiated rulemaking has also been encourage through presidential initiatives for example in september 1993 executi ve order 12866 directed agencies to explore and where appropriate use c onsensual mechanisms for developing regulations including negotiated rulemaking also in september 1993 the president ordered executive branch agencies to submit to oira within 90 days list of regulations for which they planne d to use negotiated rulemaking106 although the use of negotia ted rulemaking was expect ed to improve rulemaking timeliness and reduce litigation an examination of agenci efforts in this area indicates that those expectations are not being fulfilled107 another study however indicated that negotiated rulemaking can imp rove participants perception of the final rule and of the overall process108 plain language one problem that regulated entities have frequently cited is lack of clarity in the rules that federal agencies publish the rules often use legally precise but sometimes unintellig ible language to convey what they require and how to comply several regulatory reform in itiatives in recent decad have attempted to address this problem for example section 1 of president carters executive order 12044 said that regulations should be as simple and clear as possible more recently one of the principles of regu lation in executive order 12866 is that each agency shall draft its regulations to be simple and easy to understand with the goal of minimizing the potential for uncertainty and litigation arising from such uncertainty on june 1 1998 president c linton reemphasized this issue by sending memorandum to the heads of executive partments and agencies directing them to use plain language in all proposed and final rulemaking documents published in the federal register for the first time after january 1 1999 the memo also suggested that the agencies rewrite existing regulations in plain language when you have the opportunity and resources to do s the office of the vice president and the office of the federal register subs equently developed guidance on how to comply with the memorandum and provide d list of related resources some individual agencies have published revised plain language regulations sometimes in question and answer format designed to facilitate understa nding of the rules requirements httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32356crs42 109 discounting can have significant effect on th present value of future health benefits for example in february 2003 speech the oira administrator noted that the present value of 1000 lives saved 50 years in the future is only 34 lives in present value when evaluated at 7 discount rate conclusion regulatory reform has taken number of different forms in recent decades from requirements that agencies conduct analy tical reviews in advance of rules publication to the retrospective examinations that agencies are sometimes required to do after their rules are codified in the federal register some of the reforms were initiated by congress some by presidents and many were prompted by both regardless of the type or source of reform an underlying theme in many of these efforts is the minimization of regulatory burden in its various forms the costs associated with federal regulations are formidable and it is generally accepted that compliance costs should be the minimum necessary to accomplish the rules objectives as ombs recent regulatory accounting reports indicate though the benefits of federal regulations are generally viewed as greater than their costs in the aggregate and for most of the agencies individual major rules nevertheless it is often unclear whether greater net benefits could be achie ved through other regulatory methods or even whether alternatives to federal regulation would have been more effective or efficient debates concerning regulatory refo rm are likely to continue profound differences of opinion exist among those for and against reform regarding the merits of such analytical tools as costbenefit analysis and risk assessment often because of the assumptions that underlie the analys those assumptions are often necessary because empirical data are not available to provide definitive answers to such questions such as the extent to which humans are exposed to particular chemical or the level of toxicity associated w ith human exposure philosophical differences also exist between such groups regardin g the degree to which agencies should exercise precaution in proactively regulating potential risks from bioengineered food to the transport of nuclear waste the groups also differ regarding the extent to which the health and ecological benefits expected from regulations can or even should be monetized and whether future health benefits s hould be discounted109 possible areas for future reform of the regulatory process are numerous but difficult to predict some have mentioned the possibility of examining the statutes that currently limit agencies ability to consider costs when developing rules another possibility is extending the reach of executive review of rules to those issued by independent regulatory agencies thes and other possible ar eas of reform are highly controversial and likely to gene rate strong resistence as mentioned previously regulatory reform legislation introduced in the 108th congress includes additional analytical require ments privacy and pilot tests of regulatory budgets future efforts to reform either the subs tance of regulations or the processes by which they are developed can be greatly info rmed by previous efforts for example many of the analytical requirements in the statutory reforms that have been enacted eg the regulatory flexibility act the small business regulatory enforcementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32356crs43 110 general accounting

agencies and implications for the legislative process mar 1997 fairness act and the unf unded mandates reform act focus on proposed rules or final rules for which notice of proposed rulemaking has b een developed about half of all final rules however do not have corresponding proposed rule including many of the agencies significant and major rules110 therefore the reform requirements automatically do not apply to about half of all rules also many of the regulatory reform statutes and executiv orders do not define key terms eg significant economic impact or significant federalism implications thereby permitting the agencies broad discretion to determine when the requirements apply to their rules care in crafting these requirements can ensure that they achieve the results that were intended finally the cumulative weight of federal rulemaking requirements is substantial currently dozens of statutes and executiv orders govern the federal rulemaking process requiring numerous forms of anal yses and processes before rules can take effect those analytical and procedural requirements are not free111 and the requirements sometimes overlap or even conflict with one another eg requirements to increase public participation and to speed the development of rules some observers have called for rationaliza tion of these rulemaking requirements integrating them in such way that the overlaps and conflicting provisions are recognized and the burden that they impose on regulatory agencies does not prevent them from carrying out their missions on the other hand advocates of reform have more commonly expressed concerns about the burden that regulatory agencies impose on the public through their rules than the burden that reforms place on the agencies
