are served by or in the view of some are captive to one railroad are extremely frustrated with what they perceive as poor rail service and exorbitant rail rates captive shippers claim that the railroad serving them acts like monopolycharging excessively high rates and providing less service than they require beginning in the late 1970s congress gave railro ads flexibility to set rates and to enter into confidential contracts with their customers over the last decade large railroads have consolidated and particularly in the past two years have achieved higher profitability some members of congress believe that the present mostly deregulated regime needs to be revised to provide more weight for the interests of captive shippers major point of contention is whether current railroad industry practices should be changed to provide captive shippers with more railroad routing options legislation has been introduced in the 110th congress that would overrule regulatory decisions preventing shippers from gaining access to second railroadthe railroad competition and service improvement act of 2007 s 953 introduced by senator john rockefeller and hr 2125 introduced by representative james oberstar this proposal would markedly change current railroad practices to allow captive shippers more access to competing railroads by addressing bottlenecks paper barriers and terminal switching arrangements bottleneck refers to situation in which only one railroad serves particular origin or destination but competing railroad provides parallel track over at least portion of the route currently the bottleneck carrier is not required to interchange traffic with the competing carrier but captive shippers seek legislative or regulatory change requiring the bottleneck carrier to do so paper barriers are contractual agreements between large railroad selling or leasing less profitable route segment to smaller railroad the agreemen t typically requires the smaller railroad to interchange all of its traffic with the large railroad even if it has access to another railroads network these agreements are means of reducing the upfront sale or lease price while enabling the selling railroad to still recover th full value of the route over time terminal switching refers to interchanging traffic between competing railroads wherever terminal provides the possibility to do so currently railroads interchange traffic at terminals only where they find it mutually beneficial to do so one issue for congress is balancing the railroads ability to earn revenue sufficient to reward shareholders as well as maintain and improve its network and the need of captive shippers for reasonable rates and adequate service however the captive shipper issue has wider economic implications than just the question of division of revenue between railroads and their captive customers higher fuel prices congestion on certain segments of the interstate highway system and rising domestic and international trade volumes are driving shippers to demand more rail capacity freight revenues are significant means of financing rail capacity because the railroads receive negligible public financing therefore larger policy question is how legislated solution to the captive shipper problem would affect the development of more robust and efficient railroad system

decade class i railroads have consolidated and particularly in the past two years have achieved higher profitability1 the present mostly deregulated railway regime was designed during period when railways were in financial peril beginning in the late 1970s as part of fundamental change in philosophy that affected the regulation of all modes of transportation congress gave railroads more flexibility to set rates and negotiate confidential contracts with their customers some members of congress believe that the present mostly deregulated regime needs to be revised to provide more balance for the interests of those rail customers who are served by only one railroad major point of contention is whether current railroad industry practices should be changed to provide these customers referred to as captive shippers with more routing options captive rail shippers have been frustrated with what they perceive as poor rail service and exorbitant rail rates these shippers often cannot ship their product economically by truck because of the bulk quantity or long distance of their shipments and do not have viable access to navigable waterway to ship by barge captive shippers claim that the railroad serving them acts like monopolycharging excessively high rates and providing less service than they require captive rail shippers are minority of all rail customers by one estimate accounting for 15 to 20 of all rail movements 2 and the argument between them and the railroads is longstanding however the captive shipper issue has wider economic implications than just the question of division of revenue between captive shippers and the railroads the captive shipper problem raises an important policy question for congress could more railtorail competition lead to more robust and efficient railroad system or could it undermine it by discouraging investment in rail infrastructure this report provides background on the current railroad regulatory regime it then examines the three main points of contention between railroads and their captive customers bottlenecks paper barriers also known as interchange commitments and terminal switching arrangements it discusses legislation addressing these issues as well as shipper and railroad points of view the last section of the report discusses the implications of injecting more railtorail competition into the industry 3 1 the association of american railroads categorizes railroads based on annual revenues class i railroads had revenue of at least 2894 million in 2004 regional railroads operate at least 350 routemiles andor had revenues of at least 40 million but below the class i threshold and local railroads operate less than 350 routemiles and had revenues of less than 40 million per year in this report the terms class i and main line railroad are used interchangeably while the term shortline railroad is used to mean both regional and local railroads 2 an estimate by the former chairman of the surface transportation board stb is that about 80 of rail customers are served by only one railroad but that because most of these customers can also ship by other modes only bout 15 to 20 of all rail movements would be judged captive by the stb oral testimony of stb chairman roger nober house committee on transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on railroads status of railroad economic regulation march 31 2004 p 10 3 captive shippers also seek changes in the regulatory process for determining the reasonableness of rail rates but generally view greater railtorail competition as more effective means of addressing both rail rate and rail service issues

regulatory reform act of 1976 the socalled 4r act pl 94210 90 stat 31 and the staggers rail act of 1980 pl 96 448 94 stat 1898 at that time there was widely held view that the us railroads were in severe and prolonged period of financial decline and that much of that decline was the result of strict federal regulation of railroad activities railroad deregulation was part of larger movement toward deregulation of all modes of transportation in the late 1970s and early 1980s before 1976 the interstate commerce commission icc reviewed almost all rail rates to determine whether they were reasonable and rail shippers were given wide latitude in selecting the routes over which their shipments would travel and the railroad companies that would participate in their traffic the 4r act was mostly about restructuring the northeast railroads and creating conrail as well as subsidizing branch lines but one provision exempted for the first time railroad traffic from regulation if the regulation was deemed by the icc to be an undue burden to commerce and served useful purpose 4 the 4r act also introduced the concept of market dominance which the act describes as the absence of effective competition from other carriers or modes of transportation for the traffic or movement to which the rate applies the act directed the icc to establish standards and procedures for determining when railroad possesses market dominance over route 5 the staggers act greatly advanced the movement toward railroad deregulation by granting railroads more freedom to set rates and enter into confidential contracts with their customers rates negotiated under contract are not subject to regulatory review on the assumption that contract reflects shipper and railroad agreement6 however rates published in tariffs and rates for captive traffic are still subject to regulatory oversight the interstate commerce commission termina tion act of 1995 pl 10488 109 stat 803 abolished the icc and replaced it with the surface transportation board board or stb the icc termination act eliminated many of the functions of the icc but transferred its remaining functions to the stb the stb is bipartisan and decisionally independent from but organizationally housed within the us department of transportation dot7 the icc termination act left largely intact the regulatory framework that governs captive rail shipper issues authorization of the stb expired september 30 1998 but the agency continues to function through annual appropriations the mo st notable issue associated with possible reauthorization of the board and the major reason for it not being reauthorized is the captive rail shipper dispute competition and railroad revenue adequacy figure prominently in national railroad policy as stated in the staggers act and amended by the icc termination act of 1995 pl 10488 109 stat 803 in regulating the railroad industry it is the policy of the united states government to allow to the maximum extent possible competition and the demand for service to establish reasonable rates and to minimize the need for federal regulatory control over the rail 4 section 207 of pl

decisions when regulation is required8 the law also states goal to promote safe and efficient rail transportation system by allowing rail carriers to earn adequate revenues as determined by the board the stb conducts an annual evaluation to determine railroad revenue adequacy based on established standards and procedures the us department of transportation dot sharing the view of most observers believes that the staggers act has been profoundly successful noting that today the railroads are financially healthy productivity is high the industrys infrastructure has been modernized and shippers have benefitted from lower average rates 9 gao study also notes that the rail industrys health has improved since staggers but finds that while rates have declined they have not done so uniformly and rates for some commodities are significantly higher than rates for others10 the gao study notes that the extent of captivity appears to be dropping but the percentage of industry traffic tr aveling at rates substantially over the statutory threshold for rate relief has increased from about four percent of tonnage in 1985 to about six percent of tonnage in 200411 the gao states that these findings may reflect reasonable economic practices by the railroads in an environment of excess demand or they may indicate possible abuse of market power12

have access to second potentially competing railroad is referred to as competitive access shippers sometimes use the term open access and railroads use the term forced access unlike highways waterways and airways which are publicly owned and over which carriers within these respective modes compete against each other for freight or passengers railways are privately owned and each railroad has exclusive access to its rightsofway however while railroads generally have exclusive access to their rightsofway they do share their rightsofway with other rail roads in circumstances where they find it is mutually beneficial to do so for instance if two railroads own parallel track in relatively light traffic area they may agree to abandon one track and share the other to reduce maintenance costs or in dense traffic lane they may agree to designate each track for one direction ie west bound track and an eastbound track to increase train fluidity through the area however neither of these situations involves granting access to each others customers in other situations the stb has required railroads to share track including access to potential customers on route as condition for approving merger for instance as condition for approving the merger between union pacific up and southern pacific sp in 1996 the stb granted the bnsf and other railroads trackage rights over about 4000 miles of track because otherwise the merger would have reduced the numb er of railroads serving certain shippers from two to one 13 in the case of the breakup of conrail in 1997 the two acquiring

railroad14 other merger remedies include switching arrangements where one carrier transports the railcars of competing carrier at origin or destination for fee and terminal access areas where the terminal owning railroad allows trains from competing railroad to use the terminal for fee while these track sharing circumstances are not uncommon neither are they universal legislation has been introduced in the 110th congress that would allow shippers significantly more access to competing railroadsthe railroad competition and service improvement act of 2007 s 953 introduced by senator john rockefeller and hr 2125 introduced by representative james oberstar among other provisions this legislation addresses three contentious issues between captive shippers and the railroads bottlenecks paper barriers and terminal switching arrangements g4g152g157g157g149g142g151g142g140g148g156g561 bottleneck refers to situation where only one railroad has track serving particular origin or destination but where another railroad also owns track that parallels at least portion of the route between the same origin and destination this situation is most easily explained with diagram figure 1 bottleneck situation source crs in the diagram above the bottleneck portion of the route between origin and destination c is the rail segment from to b because only one railroad railroad x has track between these two points the nonbottleneck portion of the route is from points b to c because two railroads have track between these two points under existing practice railroad x the bottleneck carrier can exclusively serve all traffic from origin to destination c by insisting on only offering through rate from to c even though railroad x could potentially interchange traffic with railroad at point b by only offering through rates railroad x prevents railroad from competing for the through traffic between points and c bottleneck rate practices were affirmed by the stb in december 1996 in its ruling on three coal rate cases brought by several utilities15 the stb ruled that railroads did not have to shorthaul 14 for details of this arrangement see httpwwwconrailcomfreighthtm 15

serve the entire route the board cited the section of statute that states that rail carrier may establish any rate for transportation or service16 the board decided that railroad only has to offer rate on the one route the railroad deems most efficient for handling the cargo railroad does not have to offer rates for any alternative routes that the shipper requests the stb did establish an exception to this ruling if shipper has already entered into contract with the nonbottleneck carrier for the nonbottleneck portion of the route in other words in the diagram above contract with railroad for the movement between points b and c then the bottleneck railroad railroad x must in fact segment the route and offer separate rate for the bottleneck shorthaul portion of the shipment in practice however the nonbottleneck railroad generally has not entered into contract with shipper under these circumstances hr 2125 and s 953 would require railroads to provide rate on any bottleneck segment of route thus in figure 1 above shipper located at origin could require railroad x to quote rates from both to b and from b to c it could also seek rate from railroad from point b to c if the shipper chose railroad to carry its traffic from b to c railroad x would be required to interchange the traffic at point b

there are seven two of which are canadian railroads with us subsidiaries captive shippers contend that the consolidation of the railroad industry has led to more bottleneck s ituations in the nations rail network railroads contend that the number of captive shippers has remained about the same throughout the merger process they assert that this is because the stb has required railroads to share access to track as condition for approving merger in those instan ces where the merger would otherwise result in captive traffic as described above in addition to these merger remedies railroads also contend that recent mergers have not resulted in more captive shippers because most mergers since 1980 have been endtoend consolidations rather than mergers between neighboring railroads with parallel track in an effort to exploit their comparative advantage longdistance movement of freight the class i railroads have sought mergers with their interline partners that is with railroad whose route network begins at the end point of their route network by reducing the amount of interchanging between interline railroads railroads believe that merged railroad can better streamline its operations in 1970 the average length of haul for class i rail shipment was 515 miles today it is more than 860 miles 17 in addition to focusing on longdistance freight the class i carriers are deploying longer trains utilizing bigger railcars and trying to operate these trains to the greatest extent possible so that all the cars in the train have the same origin and destination throughblocking by reducing the amount of car switching that is required betw een given origin and destination the railroad can simplify its operation reduce costs and improve transit time reliability the railroads argue that these benefits are passed on to shippers in the form of lower rates and improved service and consequently rail mergers benefit their customers also continued stb 235 1997 bottleneck ii affd sub nom

traffic over their trunk lines while abandoning their lighterdensity feeder lines since 1980 class i railroads have shed about 66000 routemiles while some of these lightdensity lines have been abandoned many of them have been sold or more often leased to shortline railroads today 550 short line railroads operate 50000 routemiles which represent about 29 of the nations rail network it is

public policy to not allow shippers to utilize all potential routing options shortline railroads contend that banning paper ba rriers would negatively affect their potential customers because it would

profitable they are reluctant to reinvest in the line leaving those customers located on the line with inferior rail service shortlines argue that these rail customers could receive much better

to require more interchanging of traffic among railroads the railroads claim that this will incr ease delays at switching yards increase cargo handling costs and therefore make them less competitive relative to other modes they also contend that if the stb were to require mandatory access to railroad track and terminals the board would be put in position of having to assess the reasonableness of

70 of the nations coal which generates over half of the nations electricity is delivered by rail according to one report an electric utility in arkansas was forced to switch to more expensive natural gas in part because the railroad could not deliver coal to its power plants on time 24 and some utilities have even begun to import coal from south america or indonesia at least in part to lessen their dependence on what they perceive as overpriced and unreliable rail service likewise railroads haul about 40 of the nations grain grain producers have complained about railroads not providing them with enough hopper cars at harvest time to move their product to market in an attempt to resolve this problem many grain producers purchased their own fleet of hopper cars but now they complain that railroads do not provide the locomotives and crew to move their cars25 they contend that poor and expensive rail service is driving their customers to overseas sources of grain the dispute between railroads and their captive customers is longstanding predating deregulation but the dispute has recently been exacerbated by record demand for rail service and higher rail rates additional indicators of railroad market power that captive shippers point to are the railroads return to public pricing and the manner in which they have recently assessed fuel surcharges with some of their

opportunity for price signaling between the railroads shippers have also complained about railroads using recent spikes in fuel prices to pad their freight bills by basing their fuel surcharges on simple percentage of the freight bill rather than basing it on the actual or estimated amount of fuel burned for particular shipment the stb investigated this practice and in january 2007 directed the railroads to change their fuel surcharge method to reflect actual costs26 in addition to the captive shipper groups that represent coal chemical and grain shippers27 some other shipper groups also believe that more railtorail competition is needed in the rail industry the national industrial transportation league nitl which represents wide diversity of shippers and carriers supports reversal of the stbs existing bottleneck decisions and lowering of the stbs barriers to reciprocal switching28 the nitl argues that competition drives efficiencies and innovation it leads to fundamental shift in thinking away from static and ultimately counterproductive effort to protect franchise toward positive effort to grow business opportunities and eliminate costs competition promotes cooperation between transportation providers and their customers as both become partners in an effort to eliminate inefficiencies and im prove their market opportunities the result of these efforts is increased demand for the servicethat is growth 29 however other rail customers do not support the captive shipper legislative agenda intermodal rail customers that utilize the railroads to haul freight in

rather than being indications of excessive market power the railroads argue that their recent pricing and investment strategies are rational responses to changing economic circumstances they argue the shift from rail market with excess capacity to rail market with excess demand dictates price increases and preference by the railroads for shorter term contracts or in some cases public pricing the railroads note that many of the contracts that recently expired were negotiated many years ago when the railroads had excess capacity and thus were eager to sign longterm contracts railroads argue that rail infrastructure is fixed and long term 30 to 40 years investment and thus they must be confident that demand increase is going to be sustained over the longterm and is not temporary

argue it would undermine their incentive to reinvest in their infrastructure for example they assert that the dakota minnesota and eastern railroad dme would never have undertaken its effort to build third rail line into the powder river basin if it were required to share that line with competitors44 the railroads argue that if they are not able to price their service based on the demand for rail service they will not be able to recover their costs and eventually could require government subsidies to continue operating furthermore they assert that just as few us cities are able to support two major league baseball teams not every shipper can sustain the services of two railroads in other words even if bottleneck shipper were to gain access to second railroad that shipper may not generate enough business to attract more than one railroads investment in the physical facilities necessary to serve that customer on the other side of the issue captive shippers believe that increased competition is the means for improving railroad financial health 45 they argue that competition spurs efficiency and innovation and creates sense of urgency in the words of one industry observer the culture of large freight railroads is one that is slow to change nd has never been known to have keen market sensitivity adequate railroad competition could add to railroad efficiency but more importantly could provide the needed sensitivity to shipper needs46 proponents of competition criticize the railroads position as relying on static economic model that fails to recognize the financial benefits that increased competition generates they assert that competition leads to more responsive service which leads to more rail traffic and an emphasis on eliminating unnecessary costs which leads to price reductions that stimulate more demand for rail service which would lead to more railroad revenue in short achieving railroad financial viability and satisfying railroad customers are in this view two sides of the same coin increasing competition among railroads could in the view of some result in reduced geographic scope of the rail network that serves only higher margin customers this view was articulated by linda morgan former chairwoman of the stb the shape and condition of the rail system that open access would produce is significant issue that was not resolved at the hearings the shippers assume that the replacement of differential pricing by purely competitive pricing would reduce the rates paid by shippers the railroads by contrast would argue that because their traffic base would shrink the rates paid by those shippers that would continue to receive service would actually increase even as overall revenues received by railroads would decline b ecause the overall traffic base from which costs would be recovered would be re duced more specifically carriers could be expected to seek to maintain an adequate rate of return by cutting their costs which could include the shedding of unprofitable lines thus it is quite possible that open access would produce smaller rail system although not necessarily degraded one that would serve fewer and different mix of customers than are served today with different types of and possibly more efficient but more selectively provided service we leave open for public discussion the issue of whether that type of rail system which might not serve shippers of 44 the powder river basin is the nations largest source of coal responsible for the fuel that generates about 20 of the nations electricity the most

textbook advantages of comp etition over monopoly of rger sum of consumer and producer surplus due to restriction on output by monopoly however the advantages are only so clear when the costs of providing services are the same for competitive or monopoly firms in cases where there are substantial economies of scale and scope in the production as there appears to be in the rail industry competition can increase the costs of resources used in production potentially reducing societal welfare all agree that the nation needs robust and efficient railroad system its inherent advantage in hauling large volumes of heavy freight long distances is especially beneficial during periods of high fuel prices rising trade volumes and growing demand for raw material transport whether elimination of the captive shipper problem would be detrimental or beneficial to maintaining strong and vibrant railroad system is disputed among stakeholders as well as outside observers
