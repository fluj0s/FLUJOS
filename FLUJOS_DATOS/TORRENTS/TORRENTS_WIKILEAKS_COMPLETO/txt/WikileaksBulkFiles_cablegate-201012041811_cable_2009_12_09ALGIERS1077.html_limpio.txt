africom commander general william ward met algerian president abdelaziz bouteflika november 25 during wards first visit to algeria since assuming command of africom ward said africoms strategy was to assist african nations in providing for their own security needs not do the job for them the us recognized algerias leadership in the region and africom was prepared to assist algeria and its neighbors combat terrorism bouteflika said algeria wanted to be strategic partner not an adversary our military relationship already included training and technical cooperation endusemonitoring requirements infringed on algerias national sovereignty and therefore imposed some limits on military engagement but the us and algeria shared common goal in combating terrorism terrorism in the region had taken dangerous form and sahel countries were prepared to address the problem jointly more needed to be done to ensure the participation and commitment of malis political leadership in the regional struggle bouteflika told ward the malian president needed to understand he could not be friends with both the thieves and their victims at the same time transsahara heads of state still planned to convene security and development summit in bamako but had yet to set firm date bouteflika also reviewed egyptianalgerian tensions in the aftermath of world cup qualifying match western sahara the negative repercussions of israeli settlement activities iran iraq and afghanistan on the soccer issue he made point of telling ward that the king of morocco in contrast to the strain with egypt had sent him very warm congratulatory message after the game at the end of the meeting bouteflika invited ward to return to algeria in the near future end summary addressing common challenges 2 c visiting africa command africom commander general william ward met with algerian president abdelaziz bouteflika november 25 at the presidential residence with bouteflika were chief of staff of the algerian national popular army anp lieutenant general ahmed gaidsalah ministry of national defense mnd director of external relations and cooperation general nourredine mekri anp chief of organization and logistics major general abdelhamid ghriss and translator the ambassador general wards foreign policy advisor dr raymond brown the datt and poloff notetaker accompanied general ward to the meeting which lasted two hours ward emphasized that his visit to algiers was symbolic of our countries growing bilateral relationship africa commands mission was to assist african nations address their own security challenges not to do it for them the purpose of his visit ward said was to listen to algerias perspective on enhancing our cooperation as we seek ways to work together to address common challenges in africa ward recognized that these challenges were complex and required development and political solutions not just military intervention going forward we sought to cooperate in areas that algeria determines are priorities africom welcomed the regional counterterrorism efforts algeria has engaged in with neighboring sahel countries algeria is leading the effort we will work with algeria and its neighbors to assist in eliminating the terrorist threat in the region 3 c president bouteflika said that the united states and algeria shared common objective and the will to work cooperatively in the fight against terrorism bouteflika noted the us and algeria started to work more closely together during the clinton administration when both sides came to realize they were fighting the same problem bouteflika underscored that after 911 algeria was the first arab and muslim country to send message of solidarity to president bush subsequently despite the unpopularity of some bush policies political and economic relations between our countries improved today relations were excellent he said noting that algeria was the united states second largest trading partner in the middle east after saudi arabia and our largest trading partner in africa president obamas new approach to us foreign policy was breath of fresh air and well regarded by developing world countries but this meant there were also high expectations for his administration bouteflika predicted that our bilateral relationship would continue in positive direction he commented that the us and algeria were moving forward with cooperation recognizing the value of dialogue across all leadership levels in this regard bouteflika declared he was ready to assist ward and invited him to visit algeria again military cooperation 4 s bouteflika attached importance to algerias militarymilitary cooperation with the united states but noted that us enduse monitoring requirements contravened algerias national sovereignty nonetheless we had made progress on training and technical cooperation bouteflika said the capabilities of us and algerian forces were well understood in the region bouteflika argued that frank direct talks were the key to successful military dialogue as well as recognizing that in some cases there would be limits on the extent of cooperation tell us what you want and we will tell you what we can do algeria he continued wanted to be strategic partner for the us in the region not an adversary 5 s general ward thanked bouteflika for his candid assessment of our milmil relationship he said the president secretaries of state and defense and us joint chiefs of staff all recognized the value of the usalgeria partnership bouteflika responded that he would help us to consolidate that partnership ward argued that to enhance our partnership algeria needed to tell us how we can contribute best to achieve mutual objectives despite the bad things sometimes said about africom ward said with smile his command had not been created to take over africa without missing beat bouteflika replied with an even bigger smile that he had been unsure about this himself until ward came ward said that as we continue our military dialogue we want to do the things algeria tells us are important ward affirmed algeria had long recognized the challenge of extremism and demonstrated its ability to fight back africom would do its part to support algeria and its neighbors in this effort addressing bouteflikas point on endusemonitoring requirements ward suggested focusing our efforts in areas where cooperation was possible ie training and equipping he acknowledged that some us laws and regulations may preclude for now algerias participation in other forms of engagement civilmilitary relations 6 s bouteflika underscored that algerias military absolutely respected the authority of civilian leadership this is not at all like turkey he said bouteflika asserted that the army was forced to take drastic measures during the violence of the 1990s in order to save the country this was difficult period but constitutional rule had been restored the house is now in order he stressed and i can tell you that the army obeys the civilians there is one constitution and all obey it bouteflika acknowledged however that the problems of the past still haunted the country he cited foreign press reports referring to algeria as dictatorship and argued that the term was sometimes used carelessly the algerian constitution had established the rule of law in 2004 it was decided that there was more historical revolutionary legitimacy the only legitimacy was the constitution anyone can be candidate for election in accordance with the constitution even general he paused then grinned and said but the generals realize the difficulties and none has been candidate yet counterterrorism 7 c bouteflika said terrorism in africa had taken dangerous form the situation in somalia was hopeless he commented meanwhile the sahel region presented complex set of issues fortunately most sahel countries were determined to cooperate and have the capability to fight the threat if they work together mauritania expressed clear commitment as did niger although bouteflika recognized us concerns with president tandja malis full cooperation remained elusive however malis policies have failed to create stability in the north the result is lawless environment in which smuggling along with arms and drug trafficking enable terrorism bouteflika said the region was prepared to tackle this problem and bilateral and regional efforts were already underway in this regard algeria was closely monitoring us military assistance to mali and niger 8 s ward told bouteflika that he planned to visit bamako after algiers and would encourage malis leaders to cooperate in the regions counterterrorism efforts the us was providing military assistance to mali and we hoped it complemented the work algeria was doing ward emphasized that ultimately defeating terrorism was the responsibility of the region bouteflika expressed his appreciation for us assistance to mali and said algeria also provided aid including some equipment bouteflika urged the us to tell malian president amadou toumani toure that he cannot be friend to the thieves and victims at the same time many in malis security services shared the same concern bouteflika asserted in the past he said algeria has waited for the chance to debrief terrorist suspects held in mali only to find out later that malian officials were conducting negotiations for the terrorists release back to the terrorist organizations at the same time it is difficult to cooperate in these conditions he said despite difficulties bouteflika said regional leaders still planned to convene security and development summit in bamako all agreed on the need for the summit he said but there was still set date bouteflika said that algeria would be open to sharing information with the us regarding algerias cooperation with its neighbors general ward said africom would do the same for algeria regarding us initiatives in the region egypt and soccer 9 c bouteflika shared his perceptions of egypts antialgerian nationalism following the november 18 world cup qualifying match bouteflika said the egyptian media had overreacted to the situation and that algeria did not plan to respond algeria could not afford to confuse its historical relationship with egypt past present and future with the outcome of soccer match he said algeria and egypt had number of common political and economic interests and that his country had desire to have political crisis over the results of soccer match some have urged bouteflika to respond publicly to egyptian claims i understand the egyptians are responding to local conditions he said but we wont take the same tack arab league secretary general amr moussa bouteflika asserted asked to visit algiers to mediate the issue bouteflika told moussa there was nothing to discuss in algiers and suggested moussa might best mediate tensions by working with cairo to influence egyptian opinion 10 c bouteflika noted that the aftermath of the game had been interesting moroccan king mohamed vi sent bouteflika very warm message congratulating algeria on its victory bouteflika said he chose not to publicize the letter in order not to create problems for morocco in its relations with egypt he said arab political frustrations were sometimes expressed through soccer algeria would continue to support egypts reconciliation efforts with the palestinians one expects change in netanyahus approach to negotiations he said thus now was an opportune time to work on reconciliation and encourage palestinians to speak with one voice algeria also supported egypts position on gaza which was dictated by egypts proximity to gaza and its domestic political environment if we were in their position we would have applied the same policy bouteflika said he would prefer to see egypt concentrate its energies on these issues rather than against us palestine 11 c bouteflika noted that senator mitchell had said the us was committed to the peace process because it was in the us interest it was important not to confuse us interests with israeli interests although the two sometimes overlapped or arab interests bouteflika lamented current settlement activities which he said undermined peace negotiations before negotiations could succeed settlement activity had to stop first he added that this included jerusalem any solution that did not take jerusalem into account would certainly produce future conflict with the arab and muslim world bouteflika commended president obama for trying his best to start new process for negotiations but president abbas and pm netanyahus meetings in washington failed to reinvigorate the process bouteflika regretted that serious negotiation effort has been produced since oslo and current efforts in washington seemed to have impact western sahara 12 c bouteflika commented that us policy on western sahara was inconsistent some problems dated back to the clinton administration there was improvement under president bush but now the state department seemed to be backsliding the us bouteflika argued was moral authority and had to show consistency in the principles its foreign policies reflected you cannot have one set of principles for palestine and another set for western sahara he cautioned bouteflika remarked that the principle in question the right to selfdetermination was clearcut unsyg personal envoy christopher ross was in charge of finding solution based on this principle he said now was not the time to adopt position favoring moroccos autonomy plan as the solution to the issue bouteflika recounted his support for the baker plan and subsequent disappointment when us policy appeared to shift in favor of the moroccan position on autonomy trust was essential he urged algeria wanted frank loyal relationship with the united states it did not want to be competitor but fullfledged partner in contributing to solutions in africa the middle east and the muslim world iran 13 c bouteflika declared that the us and algeria shared the same position on iran the only difference being that algeria believed we need to first ensure irans efforts are peaceful but then let them pursue peaceful use of nuclear energy without constraints he had doubt that the us was capable of reaching peaceful agreement with iran and believed the us was in better position to deal with iran than either france or britain bouteflika said algeria appreciated president obamas patient approach with iran and had interest in seeing irans influence in the muslim and arab world increase iraqafghanistan 14 c in iraq bouteflika appreciated us and arab efforts which were making some progress algerias interest was in the unity of the iraqi people ensuring iraqs sovereignty and maintaining the countrys territorial integrity bouteflika remarked that difficult road lay ahead in balancing these priorities and questioned whether the us would have enough time before leaving iraq to see if democracy or dictatorship takes root he recounted an anecdote of vulture that picks up snake struggles to keep the snake from strangling it and finally decides to let the snake go the same is true in iraq he said sometimes its best to leave things alone 15 c afghanistan was different matter bouteflika said the world has noted the amount of time president obama has taken to consider his next step in afghanistan any decision bouteflika acknowledged will be thorny and difficult one if president obama decides to send an additional 40000 troops he will need some guarantee he can win bouteflika commented this option was plagued by too many unknowns and the us could find itself in the same position as the russians on the other hand bouteflika continued if obama sends fewer troops and fails he will be blamed for not doing enough decision to withdraw from afghanistan might trigger conflict between the administration congress and the american people bouteflika believed whatever decision the us makes will influence the debate on afghanistan in partner nations meanwhile questions concerning stability in pakistan and control of that countrys nuclear arsenal further complicated matters peace in the region he concluded concerned all nations and therefore afghanistan was an international problem comment 16 s the wardbouteflika meeting was significant in number of respects the algerian president spoke repeatedly of his readiness to build strategic relationship with the us he transmitted clear readiness for closer coordination and contact on sahel counterterrorism issues the simple fact of the meeting with the president was itself green light to the military bureaucracy on steppedup bilateral military cooperation not least the warm and highlevel official reception provided powerful antidote to the persistent negative mythology about africa command since the commands rollout it was also noteworthy that in the presence of three generals including the chief of staff bouteflika spoke assertively to ward about civilian control of the military he described the revolutionary origins of military influence in algeria said this socalled revolutionary legitimacy ended in 2004 and the military now obeys the civilians and they all obey the constitution in the course of his regional political review bouteflika delivered algerias views on western sahara in familiar terms but in doing so he also struck an unusually positive note about morocco and the kings message clearly in the context of the high emotions stirred in algeria over the controversial world cup contest with egypt mohammed vis message of congratulations struck chord with bouteflika jordan m
