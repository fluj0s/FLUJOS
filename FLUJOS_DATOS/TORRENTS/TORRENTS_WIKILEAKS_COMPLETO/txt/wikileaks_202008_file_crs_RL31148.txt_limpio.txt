presidential coordination office summary responding to the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon president george w bush among other actions announced in his september 20 address to joint session of congress his intention to create an office of homeland security ohs headed by director who would have cabinet rank and would report directly to the president ohs as subsequently chartered with eo 13228 of october 8 2001 is an agency of the executive office of the president the success of this office as coordinator of federal preparations and response to terrorism including the development of comprehensive national strategy for homeland security may be guided by past experience with similar such entities this report reviews past experience principally with the office of war mobilization and its successor the office of war mobilization and reconversion and its significance for ohs as well as the administrative development of the new agency that ohs was not altogether successful in its efforts at homeland security leadership may have prompted the president to propose the creation of department of homeland security in june 2002 however during the course of the establishment of the department attempts to replace or recharter ohs legislatively were not successful the establishment of the new department and the new homeland security council diminished the role of ohs by assuming most of its functions although presidential assistant for homeland security may be retained in the white house the continued need for ohs waned in 2003 and the

in his september 20 2001 address to joint session of congress president george w bush as part of his response to the september 11 terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon announced his intention to create an office of homeland security ohs according to the presidents initial description of ohs it was to be located within the white house office and would be headed by director who would have cabinet rank and would report directly to him pennsylvania governor tom ridge was named as the presidents choice for director his mission and that of his office would be in the presidents words to lead oversee and coordinate comprehensive national strategy to safeguard our country against terrorism and respond to any attacks that may come1 following the announcement by president bush few details were forthcoming regarding ohs because the president historically has enjoyed virtually complete authority over the organization of the white house office it was not surprising that directive or charter for ohs was publicly released although this omission contributed to lack of specificity regarding the offices duties2 presidential charter on october 8 2001 president bush issued eo 13228 establishing ohs as an agency within the executive office of the president which includes such other agencies as the council of economic advisers the national security council the office of management and budget and the white house office3 later in the day tom ridge was appointed as the assistant to the president for homeland security the presidents directive specified that the head of ohs is the assistant to the president for homeland security signifying that the individual directing ohs is member of the white house office staff the assistant to the president for national security affairs condoleezza rice has similar status she is member of the white house office staff and directs the staff of the national security council because the direction of ohs is vested in presidential assistant senate approval of the appointment was necessary because all white house office staff are 1 weekly compilation of presidential documents vol 37 sept 24 2001 p 1349 2 the white house office

providing appropriations and personnel authorization for the white house office congress has not legislatively limited the presidents prerogatives regarding its operations 3 federal register vol 66 oct 10 2001 pp 5181251817 crs2 appointed without senate confirmation however this situation and the advisory role that senior white house officials play have the potential for limiting congressional access to such presidential aides traditionally they have come before congressional committees only to explain very serious allegations of personal misconduct otherwise attempts by congressional overseers and investigators to require their appearance and testimony before committees has usually been met by presidential invocations of socalled executive privilege the privilege of the president to exercise discretion based upon the constitutional separation of powers doctrine regarding the questioning of his advisers4 also because ohs has been established by presidential directive its mission responsibilities and administration may be readily modified through the issuance of additional executive orders situation that initially contributed to congressional reluctance to appropriate significant amounts of money for an agency so established for any length of time before requiring statutory charter5 ohs began operations utilizing discretionary monies available to the president for responding to the september 11 terrorist attacks these conditions limited the ability of congressional overseers to assess the success of ohs as coordinator of homeland security policy planning and preparations and as the developer of national strategy for homeland security eo 13228 also established the homeland security council which was responsible for advising and assisting the president with respect to all aspects of homeland security as well as serving as the mechanism for ensuring coordination of homeland securityrelated activities of executive departments and agencies and effective development and implementation of homeland security policies chaired by the president the council was composed of the vice president the secretaries of defense health and human services and transportation the attorney general the director of central intelligence the directors of the federal bureau of investigation and the federal emergency management agency fema the assistant to the president for homeland security and such other officers of the executive branch as the president may from time to time designate title x of the homeland security act of 2002 reconstituted the homeland security council and made it responsible for advising the president on homeland security matters assessing the objectives commitments and risks of the united states in the interest of homeland security and making resulting recommendations to the president and overseeing and reviewing homeland security policies of the federal government and making resulting recommendations to the president still chaired by the president the councils membership was modified to include the vice president the secretary of homeland security the attorney general the secretary of defense and such other individuals as the president may designate6 4 see crs report rl31351 presidential advisers testimony before congressional committees brief overview by harold c relyea and jay r shampansky 5 see 31 usc 1347 6 116 stat 2135 at 2258 crs3 model and principles for success ohs emerged in an environment in which several entities having established reputations and turf were potential rivals in some policy and administrative areas the situation was reminiscent of the efforts of president franklin d roosevelt to create an effective war mobilization and preparedness coordination entity success was realized with the office of war mobilization owm established by presidential order on may 27 1943 and the man roosevelt selected to direct it james f byrnes former member of the house of representatives the senate and the supreme court and former director of the office of economic stabilization7 the owm mandate was sweeping and general it was empowered to develop programs and to establish policies for the maximum use of the nations natural and industrial resources for military and civilian needs for the effective use of the national manpower not in the armed forces for the maintenance and stabilization of the civilian economy and for the adjustment of such economy to war needs and conditions b to unify the activities of federal agencies and departments engaged in or concerned with production procurement distribution or transportation of military or civilian supplies materials and products and to resolve and determine controversies between such agencies or departments except those to be resolved by the director of economic stabilization under section 3 title iv of executive order 9250 concerning agricultural prices and c to issue such directives on policy or operations to the federal agencies and departments as may be necessary to carry out the programs developed the policies established and the decisions made under this order it shall be the duty of all such agencies and departments to execute these directives and to make to the office of war mobilization such progress reports as may be required given an office in the white house byrnes soon was regarded as second only to the president on the home front and with his frequent exhibition of confidence in byrnes the president helped established public and governmental understanding and recognition of his position8 owm operated with small staff which byrnes instructed not to constitute an isolating layer between the director and the heads of agencies but to facilitate the relations of the director with agency heads small staff prevented owm from engaging in administrative activities and operations and from undertaking or interfering with the normal functions of other agencies it was also inadequate to perform the type of central planning function which many people considered owms most important duty however this was not limitation in byrness view for he felt that most planning should be conducted at agency levels and that it was his job primarily to coordinate such plans9 concise clear understanding of owms functions was offered in july 27 1943 memorandum on the general plan for the operation of the agency 7 eo 9347 3 cfr 19381943 comp pp 12811282 8 herman miles somers presidential agency owmr the office of war mobilization and reconversion cambridge ma harvard university press 1950 p 52 9 ibid pp 5556 crs4 the office of war mobilization acts for the president the job of the office is not to perform the functions of the established departments and agencies but to see that these functions are well performed by those charged with responsibility for their performance the other primary task of the office is to assure coordination of separate programs by securing policy integration resolving conflicts and rendering responsible authoritative and firm decisions in controversies10 few months after owms creation another presidential order expanded the agencys authority to include aspects of us foreign economic affairs11 as consequence of congressional concern about the accountability of the owm directors exercise of his discretionary power as well as desire to begin planning for conversion to peacetime economy congress enacted the war mobilization and reconversion act in 1944 creating the office of war mobilization and reconversion owmr as an independent agency and making its presidentially appointed director subject to senate confirmation with twoyear term12 this act by one nearcontemporary estimate was considered the broadest grant of power ever legislated by congress creating for the first time by statute superdepartmental director over the whole range of homefront executive activities for war and reconversion powers so great that some critics questioned the constitutionality of such grant to anyone short of the president13 upon signing the legislation into law president roosevelt issued an order transferring the functions and resources of owm to owmr14 byrnes who was named the director of the new agency continued to operate from the east wing of the white house he left the office in april 1945 and three months later was named secretary of state owmr was dismantled at the end of 194615 few years after the demise of owmr it was evaluated in study as notable although improvised attempt to equip the president with strong staff arm for executive policy and program coordination as distinguished from administrative management and fiscal control the author of the study participantobserver who served on the owmowmr staff for 16 months regarded the agency to be successful instrument of central control and coordination for the president16 why was owmowmr successful in response to this question seven guiding principles were offered institutional status in the presidents office presidential coordination entity like owmowmr must have permanent institutional status and must be clearly presidential arm accountable only to him it is also essential 10 reproduced in ibid p 58 11 eo 9361 3 cfr 19431948 comp pp 257259 12 58 stat 785 13 somers presidential agency p 1 14 eo

presidential confidence and backing while it was thought that the permanent establishment of such an office as owmowmr should probably be recognized by statutory law it was also considered to be undesirable that the coordinator have any statutory powers or be accountable to congress17 byrnes did not have statutory powers such as responsibility for administering program so he was not accountable to congress in that regard but he did serve as presidential liaison to congress to negotiate the drafting of legislation18 he also informally kept in touch with members of congress and agreed to follow up on conflicting war programs identified by senator harry s truman and his senate special committee to investigate the national defense program19 but avoided interceding with congress on behalf of individual departments and appears to have been an infrequent witness before congressional committees which is reportedly why congress made the appointment of the owmr director subject to senate confirmation jurisdiction over all agencies presidential coordination entitys span of jurisdiction must include all agencies and in effect be as broad as the presidents but should not involve curtailment of the existing policymaking jurisdiction of any agencies while the inclusion of the military within the coordinative jurisdiction may prove most difficult to work out the problems of the military have to be reconciled with the interests of the other agencies and this must be done in the presidents office or in the office of the coordinator acting on behalf of the president20 restriction of functions to top policy and program issues the owmowmr experience demonstrated clearly that successful central coordination must be completely divorced from any operating or administrative responsibilities indeed when the central unit is the capstone of an operating organization it will soon become just another operating agency however important its operations may be21 noninvolvement in normal functions of individual departments the owmowmr experience suggests that the coordinator must avoid the two edged evil of either allowing departments to feel that some of their normal responsibilities either for administration or policymaking within their regular jurisdiction have been taken away or of being drawn into the innumerable detailed problems which they may bring to him to obtain support the coordinator should take jurisdiction only over issues not susceptible of settlement at the department level or where interagency conflict has caused an impasse similarly 17 ibid p 224 18 ibid p 74 19 donald h riddle the truman committee study in congressional responsibility new brunswick nj rutgers university press 1964 p 98 20 somers presidential agency pp 225226 21 ibid p 226 crs6 he should not be concerned with development of methods of operation but only with seeing that agencies concerned are following through22 maintenance of reasonable control because reasonable discipline is essential to effective coordination in situations where the coordinators authorized decisions are flouted he must take prompt and appropriate action either directly or preferably through the president also the coordinator should not attempt to eliminate all disputes among agencies but rather to reduce their volume and magnitude through early delineation of general policy and the provision of locale for final arbitration as corollary consideration agencies must be given relatively free rein for debate and for working out their differences among themselves within the broad framework of administration policies ultimately when resolving conflict the coordinator should indicate that he is bringing together all elements in the issue for the president and assisting him in arriving at decision but that the decision is the presidents23 qualifications of the program coordinator recognizing that paper authority and organizational lines rarely prove adequate in the higher echelons of government the owmowmr experience suggests that successful coordinator must not only be man or woman of highest ability and broad perspective but should possess independent position and prestige based on wide experience and public respect those who suggest that highly regarded individual appointed to the coordinator position might become the presidents political competitor are reminded that this individual is presidential agent whose effectiveness can be brought to halt by few public nods of disapproval from the president because his office is empty of power without presidential backing indeed the likelihood exists that matter how prestigious coordinator may be he may become expendable when white house decisions require scapegoat24 small highlevel staff the owmowmr experience suggests that coordinators staff should be small probably not exceeding 25 persons other than clerical help such staff should all have high rank be of recognized high caliber and broadgauged generalists and staff work requiring technical expertise should be assigned to other units of the executive office or regular agencies also staff members are political personnel in the high sense of the term and must be willingly and patently identified with the presidents program finally because the coordinator must either review or direct the actions of heads of agencies on matters not susceptible of final determination at the departmental level unusual caution must be exercised regarding delegation of authority to staff members however this consideration must be tempered by caution against rigid adherence so that the coordination office does not become an irritating bottleneck25 22 ibid p 227 23 ibid pp 228229 24 ibid pp 229230 25 ibid pp 231232 crs7 implications for the homeland security office what implications do these principles have for the office of homeland security ohs as chartered by eo 13228 created by presidential directive ohs does not have the permanent institutional statusof the statutorily established owmr statutory mandate for ohs might have relieved congressional concerns about funding an agency subject to having its mission responsibilities and administration readily modified by presidential order fashioning statutory charter for ohs also might have provided an opportunity to determine when and how the head of the agency would be accessible to congress it appears that the man initially named to direct ohs former pennsylvania governor tom ridge had the presidents confidence and backing he was allocated office space in the west wing of the white house his mandate to coordinate the executive branchs efforts to combat terrorism work with executive departments and agencies in this regard and identify priorities concerning same however did not appear to convey authority equal to that of the owmowmr director who was empowered to develop programs establish policies and issue directives on policy or operations to the federal agencies and departments consequently in this regard the head of ohs compared with the owmowmr director may of necessity have had to make more frequent resort to the president to resolve disputes including opposition to his initiatives stated in the executive order in the most general terms the jurisdiction of ohs for performing its functions is not clear and it is questionable if it compared with owmowmr has had any jurisdiction over other agencies the executive order also mandated homeland security council chaired by the president and composed of at least 10 members the head of ohs being among them five other officials were invited to attend council meetings and numerous other officials could be invited to attend council sessions when appropriate the relationship between the functions of the head of ohs and the council was not clear the relationship of the ohs director to the homeland security council created by the homeland security act is perhaps even more ambiguous the ohs director is not specified member of the council and civilian executive secretary appointed by the president is mandated for the council support role that the ohs director might have been expected to play the owmowmr experience also warned against ohs becoming involved in operating or administrative responsibilities nonetheless the assistant to the president for homeland security was designated the individual primarily responsible for coordinating the domestic response efforts of all departments and agencies in the event of an imminent terrorist threat and during and in the immediate aftermath of terrorist attack within the united states such activity not only suggested the exercise of operating or administrative authority but also duplication of or intrusion into the responsibilities of the director of fema with homeland security presidential directive 5 hspd5 of february 28 2003 the secretary of homeland security was designated the principal federal official for domestic incident management this designation is according to the directive in accordance with the secretarys responsibilities pursuant to the homeland security act for coordinating crs8 federal operations within the united states to prepare for respond to and recover from terrorist attacks major disasters and other emergencies26 former member of the house of representatives and popular governor ridge at the time of his appointment was generally thought to be qualified to head ohs early press accounts indicated that ohs might have beginning staff of 100 four times the number suggested by the owmowmr experience most of these initially were detailees civil servants not political personnel from agencies within the jurisdiction of ohs27 finally apart from the owmowmr experience some argued early on that ohs should have some authority over the budgets of agencies responsible for combating terrorism or homeland security28 model in this regard was the director of the office of national drug control policy ondcp coordinator who in conjunction with preparing national drug control strategy prepares consolidated national drug control program budget to implement the strategy the ondcp director certifies the adequacy of agency drug control program budgets in cases where budget is deemed inadequate the ondcp director recommends new funding level these recommendations are considered during the preparation of the presidents annual budget also national drug control program agency may submit to congress reprogramming or transfer request for any appropriated funds greater than 5 million in the national drug control program budget unless the request has been approved by the ondcp director in the event of disapproval the agency may appeal the ondcp directors decision to the president29 eo 13228 authorizes the head of ohs to review agency budgets and make recommendations to agency heads and to the director of the office of management and budget omb regarding the levels and uses of funding for homeland security related activities prior to the forwarding of the proposed annual budget submission to the president for transmittal to congress the head of ohs is to certify to the omb director the funding levels that he believes are necessary and appropriate for the homeland securityrelated activities of the executive branch further guidance in this regard is offered by the order it does not appear that ridge during his tenure as ohs director sought to modify agency budgets for homeland security section 889 of the homeland security act directs the secretary of homeland security to prepare homeland security funding analysis including homeland security needs30 26 hspd5 is available at

the transfer of 1959 million from the emergency response fund established by statute 115 stat 220 for recovery from and response to the september 11 terrorist attacks 255 million of which was allocated for the establishment of ohs31 ridge launched ohs operations in early october with dozen staff assistants by october 18 when he held his first press conference he had added couple of individuals to his staff and indicated that he talked at least once daily with the president and did so as well with key cabinet officials and the director of the federal bureau of investigation he described himself as coordinator as being like an orchestra conductor32 the music doesnt start playing he said until he taps the baton when agencies respond to terrorist activity my role would be to participate in that effort to make sure that the response agencywide cross governmentwide is coordinated so that it is quick and is aggressive and is as complete as possible thats my job he proffered he also indicated that his role was that of an overseer if there is gap if there is something i think that needs to be done differently if there are additional preventive measures i think need to be taken if i think we have overlooked something i make the call he added however in response to question that he did not have tactical or operational authority what president bush asked to do was to come to washington to work to create comprehensive national plan to deal with homeland security and to do whatever i could in conjunction in consultation and yes i have the authority i certainly have access i have the presidents ear but my job is really longterm the president has tasked to take look at the 46plus agencies to take look at everything that everybody considers to be homeland security and over the next several months to put together comprehensive national strategy to deal with this threat that perhaps we thought about but really didnt think too long or hard about concluding his remarks on his role ridge said im the one person in the government that can stand back from the different agencies stand back from their missions and stand back from their history and say well mr president i would recommend that we strengthen our national ability to respond to these threats with this strategy that i have been asked to do and thats what ill do 31 the white house letter to the

summit ridge commented that he was very openminded to the notion that once i get done doing my work and present national strategy to the president that the realignment of some of those agencies having something to do with homeland security may be an outcome i cant tell you which ones he quickly added but my challenge is to give the president national strategy based on what i learned from you and everybody else and so i may just do that government organization for homeland security arose again at ridges november 27 press briefing where he said that one of the challenges that the office of homeland security has is to make sure that it becomes permanent part of how the federal government does business regarding the federal agencies having role in maintaining homeland security ridge commented that we will have to take look at whether or not we will enhance security if we merge their functions in late december aides to ridge reportedly produced tempest within the bush administration when they unveiled broad proposal to create an agency that would consolidate border security management opponents represented wide range of agencies including five cabinet departments33 returning to the october 18 press briefing ridge responding to question about his being included in the national security and intelligence briefings given daily to the president and his aides said i am cleared by the president to have as much information as i want or need which means that i have access to that kind of information asked if he would be the spokesman the main person who will interface with the public regarding administration efforts to effect homeland security ridge said yes and indicated that there were plans to try to have more regular briefings of this type indeed he subsequently held nine such briefings during the year in addition to some speeches he also offered during the period this activity prompted some to question whether he would be an effective overseer or another spinner34 at his october 19 press briefing ridge announced the creation of the homeland security support team at fema to gather information concerning consequence management for ohs and help state and local government officials with access to such information by the end of the month the task force reportedly consisted of eight staff members with others to be added drawn from several agencies35 on occasion ridge directly intervened in homeland security administration at his october 19 press briefing ridge revealed that at the request of new york governor george pataki he had obtained an extension of the stay of coast guard cutter protecting the greater new york harbor area ridge reportedly acted on behalf of south carolina governor jim hodges to ensure that there would be

presidential directives hspds that shall record and communicate presidential decisions about the homeland security policies of the united states additional details about the issuance of hspds were not immediately available but they are not published in the federal register the initial directive concerned the organization and operation of the homeland security council the second also issued on october 29 pertained to combating terrorism through immigration policies the third issued march 11 2002 established the homeland security advisory system of five graduated threat conditions to apprise the executive branch and the nation of the risk of terrorist attack ridge also named six senior members of his ohs team on october 29 they included steve abbot retired navy admiral former deputy

established the presidents homeland security advisory council with four senior advisory committees to assist it members being drawn from state and local government academia and the policy research community the private sector and emergency services law enforcement and public health organizations and hospitals41 by late january 2002 ridge was reportedly facing resistance to some of his ideas forcing him to apply the brakes on key elements of his agenda and raising question about how much he can accomplish ohs plans engendering opposition from within the executive branch included those to streamline or consolidate agencies responsible for border security improving intelligence distribution to federal state and local agencies and alerting federal state and local officials of terrorist threats using system of graduated levels of danger it was noted that even though he works few steps from the oval office ridge has been left out of important intelligence discussions concerning homeland security for example he is not included in more expansive intelligence briefing provided daily to the president the vice president the white house chief of staff and several others and ridge also acknowledged that he was unaware of the details of late november meetings in pakistan by the director of central intelligence42 38 august gribben ridge appoints six staffers to homeland security

his refusal to testify before congressional committees among the first to request his appearance were senator robert c byrd and senator ted stevens respectively the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on appropriations ridge turned down their initial informal invitation and later formal requests of march 15 and april 443 when ridge declined the request of representative ernest istook jr chairman of the house appropriations subcommittee on treasury postal service and general government appropriations for the executive office of the president were threatened prompting ridge to offer to meet with istook and other subcommittee members in an informal session44 thereafter ridge arranged other informal briefings with members of the house committee on government reform and group of senators and agreed to similar such session with members of the house committee on energy and commerce these informal meetings did not appear to abate the controversy that ridges refusals to testify had generated45 assessing the situation in early may new york times news analysis proffered that instead of becoming the preeminent leader of domestic security tom ridge has become white house adviser with shrinking mandate forbidden by the president to testify before congress to explain his strategy overruled in white house councils and overshadowed by powerful cabinet members reluctant to cede their turf or their share of the limelight in support of this view the analysis noted that the pentagon did not consult with ridge when suspending air patrols over new york city special assistant to the secretary of defense explained this action by saying we dont tell the office of homeland security about recommendations only about decisions and the attorney general unilaterally announced possible terrorist threat against banks last month46 asked about this assessment by jim lehrer on the pbs newshour ridge called it false and said i just dont think they have

continued crs14 editorial observed that one of the reasons ridge lost these turf battles is that he failed to build constituency for change in congress his refusal to testify before congressional committees has not helped48 others senator bob graham and brookings scholar paul light former lieutenant general edward l rowney and former white house chief of staff leon panetta have contended that ridge needs tools or direct authority to do his job effectively49 ridges problems had not escaped white house attention in his april 11 2002 testimony before the senate committee on governmental affairs concerning senator joseph liebermans proposal for homeland security department mitchell daniels jr the director of the office of management and budget indicated that the president might eventually decide to create the department as envisaged in the lieberman bill in addition daniels said he would consider creating working group with senator lieberman to discuss the legislation50 subsequently daniels ridge white house chief of staff andrew h card jr and white house counsel alberto r gonzales would constitute the principal members of secret group that would begin drafting the presidents departmental plan on april 23 this proposal was unveiled on june 6 the presidents surprise announcement was viewed not only as an attempt to regain the initiative in the nations efforts at combating terrorism but also to move beyond the coordination efforts of the office of homeland security to strong administrative structure for managing consolidated programs concerned with border security and effective response to domestic terrorism incidents as congress began considering legislation to establish department of homeland security in early july ridge began appearing before various congressional committees to explain and garner support for the presidents proposal on july 16 the president released the national strategy for homeland security which ridge and his ohs staff had developed an important contribution made by the strategy is definition of homeland security which had potential for guiding the program composition of the new department51 however in the end the homeland security act establishing the department of homeland security did not include definition of homeland security when signing the homeland security act into law on november 25 2002 president bush said he intended to nominate tom ridge to be the first secretary of homeland security the senate confirmed ridge in this new role on january 24 the day the homeland security act took effect his

national strategy for homeland security washington july 2002 p 2 crs15 direction of ohs on april 29 the white house announced that president bush was appointing retired general john gordon who has held highlevel intelligence energy security and counterterrorism positions to be assistant to the president and homeland security advisor which will bring him to the directorship of ohs however some of the functions of ohs incident management budget review alert advisory determinations and various coordination efforts were or soon would be performed by the new department the director of ohs was not statutory member of the new homeland security council mandated by the homeland security act about the only major responsibility left for ohs is maintaining the national strategy for homeland security in view of the uncertain relationship between the national strategy and the homeland security funding analysis to be prepared by the secretary of homeland security this responsibility also may come to be vested in the secretary in late july further doubt was cast on the future of ohs when house appropriators in their report on the departments of transportation and treasury and independent agencies appropriations bill 2004 hr 2989 revealed that the bush administration had changed the office of homeland security account to one for the homeland security council the report also questioned the role of ohs saying it is not clear what work remains that cannot be effectively performed by the department of homeland security the account change apparently also implied the shift of 66 staff from ohs to the council which the report questioned given the existence and support of the department of homeland security the committee cut the presidents request of 83 million for the council to 41 million52 senate appropriators in their report recommended the 83 million sought by the president but did not provide these funds for the council as an entity within the white house office saying the homeland security council should be funded as separate account which is consistent with the budgetary treatment of its predecessor the office of homeland security53 conferees on the consolidated appropriations act 2004 hr 2673 which included funding for agencies of the executive office of the president made recommendation of funds for ohs but did propose 72 million for the homeland security council in the white house office account54 the house agreed to the conference report on december 8 and adjourned sine die the senate completed action on the legislation on january 23 and the president signed the measure the following day pl 108199 the presidents fy2005 budget made mention of ohs which while not formally abolished has become dormant like the council of national
