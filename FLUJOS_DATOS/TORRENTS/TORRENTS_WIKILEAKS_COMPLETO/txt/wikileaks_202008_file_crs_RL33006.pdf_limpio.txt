byside assessment of house and senate versions of hr 6 introduction since the arab oil embargo in 1973 1974 congress has peri odically taken up energy policy legislation with comprehe nsive scope often spurred by the price of oil and us dependence upon imported oil the price of crude oil began to rise in 2003 exceeding 60barrel bbl in early july 2005 setting much of the context for renewed deba over omnibus energy legislation in the 109th congress national and world demand fo r oil continues to grow however domestic oil production in the united states continues to decline as consequence the gap between us production and consumption s had to be covered by increased oil imports these imports roughly 6 million barrels per day mbd after the arab oil embargo now exceed 10 mbd to satisfy total us oil consumption of nearly 21 mbd1 addressing dependence on im ported oil raises number of issues touching on both demand and consumption of fossil fuel s chief among these are the production of additional fossil fuels developmen t of alternative energy sources and conservation and energy efficiency energy infrastructure has also been growing issue including the oil refining and dist ribution sector and ectricity transmission reliability and regulation increased use of domestic coal and reassessment of many issues associated with nuclear ergy have drawn attention as well developing comprehensive approach to energy policy that balances economic security and environmental issues as well as competing regional priorities in the united states is an enormous challenge for policymakers keeping clear eye on distinguishing between short and longt erm policies is also difficult but important in keeping expectations realistic for wh at comprehensive legislation can achieve in the 109th congress the house approved an omnibus energy bill hr 6 on april 21 2005 that would open the arctic na tional wildlife refuge anwr to oil and gas leasing substantially change oversight of electric utilities increase the use of alternative motor fuels provide 81 b illion in energy tax incentives extend the nuclear accident liability system and au thorize numerous energy rd programs the senate passed its vers ion of hr 6 on june 28 without anwr provisions but including 141 billion in tax incentives nd provisions on global climate changehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33006crs2 the two versions of the bill contain many provisions from the conference report on an omnibus energy bill also numbered hr 6 in the 108th congress that was blocked by nate filibuster the house and senatepassed bills in the 109th congress would mandate increasing levels of etha nol production through 2012 but allow regions to opt out under certain conditions use of methyl rtiary butyl ether mtbe as domestic gasoline additive would be phased out but states could authorize continued use and under the house bill the president coul d void the ba n producers of mtbe and renewable fuels would be granted protec tion safe harbor from product liability lawsuits under the house bill while only re newable fuels would be covered in the senate bill mtbe liability protection proved highly contentious in the senate in the 108th congress the senate bill includes renewable portfolio standard rps rejected by the house energy and commerce committee requiring utilities to generate at least 10 of their electricity from renewable energy sources by 2020 also the senate bill would establish creditba sed deployment program to encourage technologies to reduce greenhouse gas intensity and establis h programs to deploy technologies in developing countries neither of t hose provisions is in the house bill provisions are also included in both bills to increase access by energy developers to federal lands several new statutory fficiency standards would be established for consumer and commercia l products and app liances and other standards would be set by the department of energy doe major provisions electricity regulation title xii in the house and senatepassed bills would create an electric reliability organization ero that would enforce mandatory reliability standards for the bulkpower system all ero standards would be approved by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc under this title the ero could impose penalties on user owner or operator of the bulkpower system that violates any fercapproved reliability standard this title also addresses transmission infrastru cture issues the secretary of energy would be able to certify congestion on the transmission lines and issue permits to transmission owners permit holders would be able to petition in us district court to acquire rightsofway for the construction of transmission lines through the exercise of the right of eminent domain in the senate b ill ferc could approve participant funding for transmission line construction pr ovision that would have required ferc to approve participant funding for new transmission lin was removed in markup by the house committee on energy and commerce under the house bill fercs standard market design notice of proposed rulemaking would be remanded the senate bill would terminate fercs standard market design notice of proposed rule making under both senate and house passed bills native load service obligations would be clarified and federal utilities would be allowed to pa rticipate in regional transmission organizationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33006crs3 under both bills the elect ricity title would repeal the mandatory purchase requirements under the public utility regulatory policies act purpa the public utility holding company act of 1935 puhca would be repealed the federal energy regulatory commission and state regulatory bodies would be given access to utility books and records ferc would be required to issue rules to establish an electronic system that provides information about the availability and price of w holesale electri c energy and transmission services under the house vers ion and could issue such rules under the senate version under both versions for electric rates that the federal energy regulatory commission finds to be unjus t unreasonable or unduly discriminatory the effective date for refunds would begin at the time of the filing of complaint with ferc but not later than five months after filing of complaint criminal and civil penalties would be increase d under the house version the federal power act would be amended to give ferc review aut hority for transfer of assets valued in excess of 10 million the senate version w ould also apply to the purchase lease or acquisition of an existing generating facility that has value in excess of 10 million and is used to generate electricity for ferc jurisdictional interstate wholesale sales in addition to the house requireme nts the senate vers ion would require ferc to determine that the proposed transact ion would not result in harmful cross subsidization with nonutility associate company for additional discussion on th issues see crs report rl32728 electric utility regulatory reform issues for the 109th c ongress and crs report rl32133 federal merger review authority renewable fuel sta ndard and mtbe the house and senate versions of hr 6 would amend the clean air act to eliminate the requirement that reformulated gasoline rfg contain 2 oxygen to reduce automotive emissions requirement which prompted the widespr ead use of mtbe and to lesser degree ethanol instead the bills would establish new requirement that an increasing amount of gasoline contain renewable fuel s such as ethanol the house bill would require that 31 billion gallons of renewabl fuel be used in 2005 increasing to 50 billion gallons by 2012 and the senate b ill would require 80 billion gallons by 2012 compared with 34 billion gallons used in 2004 however concerns have been raised that this requirement could significantly increase the pump price for gasoline in some areas because of concerns over drinking wa ter contamination by mtbe major competitor with ethanol both bills would ban the use of mtbe in motor vehicle fuel except in states that specifically authorize its use not later than december 31 2014 under the house version and four years after enactment in the senate version the ban has two possible exceptions firs t the environmental protection agency epa may allow mtbe in motor fuel up to 05 percent by volume in cases that the administrator determines to be appropriate and second under the house version the president may make termination not later th an june 30 2014 that the restrictions on the use of mtbe shall not take place the house bill would authorize 20 billion and the senate bill 10 billion to assist the conversion of merchant mtbe production f acilities to the production of other fuel additives further the bills would preserve the reductions in emissions of toxic substanceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33006crs4 achieved by the rfg program although they use different baselines for determining required reductions one of the most controversial provisions in the house version of hr 6 is the establishment of safe harbor from product liability lawsuits for producers of mtbe and renewable fuels such as etha nol the safe harbor provision would protect anyone in the product chain fro m manufacturers down to retailers from liability for cleanup of mtbe and renewable fuels or for personal injury or property damage based on the product be ing deemed defective tha t legal approach has been used in california to require refiners to shoulder liability for mtbe cleanup the safe harbor would be retr oactive to september 5 2003 prior to that date five lawsuits had been filed afte r that date at least 150 suits were filed on behalf of 210 communities in 15 different states the senate bill includes the safe harbor provision for renewable fuels but not mtbe the senate safe harbor would not be retroactive for

provisions estimated at 13 billion over 10 years were included in the working families tax relief act of 2004 pl 108311 enacted on october 4 2004 about 5 billion in additional energy tax incentives over 10 years were part of the american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108 357 enacted on october 22 2004 many of the energy tax incentives in hr 6 from the 108th congress that were not enacted in 2004 have been repack aged into the hr 6 in the 109th congress with significant differences between the house and senate versions fi rst the senate bill would provide net tax reduc tions of 141 billion over 11 years compared with 81 billion in the housepassed version second mo st of this difference is accounted for by tax cuts for the electricity industry energy efficiency and renewable and alternative fuels the senate bill provides absolutely and relatively more tax cuts for energy efficiency and alternative fuels th differences in tax cuts for alternative fuels are particularly striki ng 12 billion in the senate b ill vs 06 billion in the house bill the senate bill also provides more tax incentives for energy efficiency investments than the house bill the house bill provides much larger tax cuts for the electricity industry particularly for electricity infrastructure thus in relative sense the house bill is tilted more toward fossil fuel production while the senate bills tax cuts are tilted more to the production of alternative and renewable fuels and ener gy conservation however the absolute dollar tax cuts for oil gas and coal are also somewhat larger in the senate bill than in the house bill 58 billion vs 47 billion for more background see crs issue brief ib10054 energy tax policy nuclear energy strong incentives for building new commercial nuclear power plants are

the conference energy bill of 2003 sroiaf200401 february 2004senate bills would reauthorize the priceanderson act nuclear liability system for 20 years and authorize doe to build an advanced reactor in idaho the strongest nuclear incentive is the senate bills 18cen tskilowatthour tax credit for electricity produced by nuclear reactors the credit would be available for up to 6000 megawatts of new capacity the equivalent of about five or six new reactors for the first eight years of operation the nuclear production tax credit was also included in the energy bill conference report in the 108th congress and the energy information administration concluded then that the credit would provide sufficient incentives for new co mmercial reactors to be built2 the senate bill would also authorize loan guarantees for new reactors neither of those incentives is included in the house version reauthorization of the priceanderson act is generally considered to be prerequisite for new reactors under priceanderson commercial reactor accident damages are paid through combination of privatesector insurance and nuclear industry selfinsurance system liability is capped at the maximum coverage available under the system curren tly about 107 billion even without reauthorization existing reactors continue to be covered but any new ones would not priceanderson also authorizes the department of energy to indemnify its nuclear contractors the limit on doe contractor liability is the same as for commercial reactors except when the limit for commercial reactors drops because of decline in the number of covered reactors both versions of hr 6 would provide 20year extension of priceanderson to the end of 2025 the nuclear industry c ontends that the system has worked well and should be continued but opponents char ge that priceandersons liability limits provide an unwarranted subsidy to nucl ear power the house version of the bill would also require the nuclear regula tory commission nrc to assess nuclear power plant security and require additional security measures for more information see crs issue brief ib88090 nuclear energy policy renewable portfolio standard and energy efficiency the senate version of hr 6 would require retail electricity suppliers electric utilities except for those in hawaii and that sold less than 4 billion kwh to obtain minimum percentage of their power from portfolio of new renewable energy resources the minimum renewable energy target or rene wable portfolio standard rps would start at 25 in 2008 rise in steps of 25 every four years and level off at 10 from 2020 to 2030 the house version of h r 6 does not have an rps provision eligible resources for the rps in the senate bill would include new renewable energy produced from solar wind ocean and geothermal energy most forms of biomass landfill gas and incremental hydropower so additional energy above the average generation in the three preceding years from existing already placed in service facilities using solar wind ocean biomass landfill gas incrementalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33006crs6 hydropower or incremental geothermal energy would be eligible to satisfy the rps target the base for calculating the ta rget production level would exclude power from existing hydropower and municipal solid waste generation thus states with large amount of existing hydropower or municipal solid waste generation would have proportionately lower target for ne w generation however there may be debate in conference about whether exis ting nuclear and hydr generation or some portion of it would be eligible to satisfy the rps target tradable credits would be created which could be purchased in place of alternative power sources the credits would function like those in the clean air act emission allowance trading system which has lowered compliance costs for air pollution regulations electricity suppliers could carry forward surplus credits for up to three years double credits would be provided for facilitie s on indian land and triple credits would go to distributed gene rators under 1 megawatt in size cost cap for the credits is set as the lesser of 15 centskilowatthour kwh or 200 of the average market value of the credits doe collections from credit sales and penalties would fund grants to states to promote renewables both versions of hr 6 would legislat new energy efficiency standards for several consumer and commercial products and appliances for certain other products and appliances doe would be empowered to set new standards also the bill would provide increased funding authorizations for the doe weatherization program and establish voluntary program to prom ote energy efficiency in industry for additional information see crs issue

national wildlife refuge the congressional debate over whether to open anwr to development has continue d for more than 40 years hr 6 as passed by the house would authorize oil and gas exploration development and production in portion of anwr with 2000acre limit on certain production and support facilities the senate version contai ns anwr provisions development advocates argue that anwr oil would reduce us energy markets exposure to crises in the ddle east boost north slope oil production lower oil prices extend the economic life of the trans alaska pipeline system and create many jobs in alaska and elsewhere in the united states they maintain that anwr oil could be developed with minima l environmental harm and that the footprint of development could be limited to total of 2000 acres opponents of development in anwr argu that intrusion on this ecosystem cannot be justified on any terms that economically recoverable oil found if any would provide little energy security nd could be replaced by costeffective alternatives including conser vation and that job claims are overstated they also maintain that the footprint of oil devel opment despite provision in the measure to limit certain facilities to 2000 acr would still be scattere d in many parcels across the landscape and would have greater impact than is implied by any limit on total acreage they also argue that

16 according to epa hydraulic fracturing of il and gas found in conventional geologic traps is well established but hydraulic fracturing of coal beds is relatively new conventional sites are usually very deep and involve saline ground water that is unsuitable for drinking water in contrast formations that contain coal bed methane can be near the surface where ground water may be used as source of drinking water supplies pp 49 410 5 memorandum of agreement between the unite d states environmen tal protection agency continuedappendix hydraulic fracturing sec 327 house bill before 1997 epa had not considered regu lating hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas development because it did not view this wellproduction pr ocess as an activity subject to regulation under sdwas uic program in 1997 the 11th circuit court of appeals ruled that the injection of fl uids for the purpose of hydraulic fracturing constituted underground injecti on that all underground injec tion must be regulated and that hydraulic fracturing of coalbed methane cbm wells in alabama must be regulated under the states uic program leaf v epa 118 f 3d 1467 hydraulic fracturing involves the highpressure injection of fluids into coal beds to enhance the recovery of oil and na tural gas from underground formations water based fluids are typically used as fracturin g fluids however diesel fuel often is used instead of water and various chemi cals are added to fracturing fluids3 while hydraulic fracturing has been used in the recovery of conventi onal oil and gas since the 1950s this practice has been used fo r cbm recovery mainly since the 1990s growing concern is that in many cbmproducing regions the target coal beds occur within underground sources of dr inking water and the fracturing process injects fluids directly into the drinking water sources epa has determined that the use of diesel fuel as fracturing fluid introduces benzene and other toxic substances directly into underground sources of drinking water4 also because the process fractures rock fracturing can create new pathways for natural gas primarily methane to enter drinking water aquifers as the number of coalbed methane cbm wells and the use of hydraulic fracturing have increased rapidly in recent years so has concern over the potential impact on water resources particularly in the waterscarce west very few studies have been done to evaluate these impacts in 2003 epas national drinking wate r advisory council recommended that epa work to eliminate the use of diesel fuel and related additives in fracturing fluids that are

alternatives are available epa has not sought to limit other toxic components in fr acturing fluids and other companies did not agree to cease injecting diesel fuel into drinking water sources the national drinking water advisory council further recommended that epa continue to study the extent and nature of public health and environmental problems that could occur as result of hydraulic fracturing for coalbed methane production and defend its authority to implement the uic program in manner that protects groundwater resources from contamina tion however oil and gas industry representatives argue that regulation is unnecessary and would slow natural gas development in 2004 epa issued report based primar ily on review of the literature that concluded that the injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids into cbm wells poses little threat to underground sources of drinki ng water and requires further study however epa noted that very little docum ented research has been done on the environmental impacts of injecting fracturing fluids6 epa also noted that estimating the concentration of diesel fuel compone nts and other fracturing fluids beyond the point of injection

the phase ii rules for small oil and gas construction sites to allow the agency to assess the economic impact of the rule on that industry in march 2005 epa extended the exemption until june 2006 and said it would propose specific rule for small oil and gas cons truction sites by ptember 11 2005 epa had initially assumed that most oil and gas facilities would be smaller than one acre in size and thus excluded from the phase ii rules but recent department of energy data indicate that several thous and new sites per year would be of sizes subject to the rule the provision in the housepassed

assume all liability for nucl ear damages awarded to the public by the court system and they must waive most of their legal defenses following severe radioactive release extraordinary nuclear occurre nce to pay any such damages each licensed reactor must carry financial pr otection in the amount of the maximum liability insurance available which was increased by the insurance industry from 200 million to 300 million on january 1 2003 any damages exceeding that amount are to be assessed equally against all covered commercial r eactors up to 958 million per reactor most recently adju sted for inflation on august 20 2003 those assessments called retrospective premiums would be paid at an annual rate of more th an 10 million per reactor to limit the potential financial burden on reactor owners following major accident according to the nuclear regulatory commission nrc 103 commercial reactors ar currently covered by the priceanderson retrosp ective premium requirement funding for public compensation following major nuclear incident therefore would include the 300 million in insurance coverage carried by the reactor that suffered the incident plus the 958 million in retrospective premiums from each of the 103 currently covered reactors totalin g 102 billion on top of those payments 5 surcharge may also be imposed raising the total perreactor retrospective premium to 1006 million and the total poten tial compensation for each incident to about 107 billion under priceanderson the nuclear industrys liability for an incident is capped at that amount which varies depending on th number of covered reactors the amount of availa ble insurance and an inflation adjustment that is made every five years payment of any da mages above that liability limit would require congressional approval under speci procedures in the act the priceanderson act also covers c ontractors who operate hazardous doe nuclear facilities the liability limit for doe contractors is the same as for commercial reactors excluding the 5 surcharge except when the limit for commercial reactors drops because of decline in the number of covered reactors because two closed reactors had been cove red until recently for total of 105 the liability limit for commercial r eactors minus the surcharge had been 104 billion which remains the liability limit for doe c ontractors priceanderson authorizes doe to indemnify its contractors for the entire amount so any damage payments for nuclear incidents at doe facilities would ultimately come from the us treasury however the law also allows doe to fine its contractors for safety violations and contractor employees and directors can face criminal penalties for knowingly and willfully violating nuclear safety rules however section 234a of the atomic energy act specifically exempts seve n nonprofit doe contractors and their subcontractors under the same sec tion doe automatically remits any civil penalties imposed on nonprofit

through 2015 for all activities under the amendment to the federal power act that creates the ero this is in addition to the dues paid by the ero members it is unclear whether ferc would be the sole recipient of the 50 million annual authorization since section 1211b specifically states that the ero and its regional entities are not departments agencies or instrumentalities of the united states

were not able to take into account freezes on retail rates in states that are transitioning to competitive markets and increase in transmission capacity is assumed under the smd case 5 increase in transmission capability by 2005 is assumed by doe due to improved operational efficiency at regional seams in addition doe assumes that adopting the smd would result in some savings that are difficult to quantify but would be re sult of several factors including the consolidation of control areas from the cu rrently existing 150 the possible avoidance of capital cost and software expenditures that would have been needed at existing control centers improved regi onal planning and consistenc of market design doe assigns 10 savings due to these efficien cy improvements doe believes that the assumptions used in the models are cons ervative and result in an underestimation of the net economic bene fits of the smd doe calculates the median cost of fercs smd rule to be about 760 million per year or about 21 cents per megawatt hour the models range for uncertainties is estimated to be about 100 million the cost varies significantly by region ranging from 47 cents per megawatthour fo r gridflorida to 12 cents per megawatt hour for pjm13 regions with existing rtos have zero additional costs under the smd case the effects of smd on retail rates are influenced to significant extent by whether the states in question have costofservice regulation or competitive retail choice doe found that for some importing regions with costbased rates the net result could be increased costs associated with wholesale purchases which would be passed through to retail customers for so exporting regions with costbased rates additional utility revenues from exports are expected to lead to lower retail prices for the region under the smd case in contrast in regions in which most states have adopted retail choice increased electricity exports are expected to lead to higher marketclearing

repealed in 1987 but by this time qfs and small power pr oducers had gained portion of the total electricity supply this influx of qf power challenged the costbased rates that previously guided wholesale transactions before imple mentation of purp ferc approved wholesale interstate electricity transactions based on the sellers costs to generate and transmit the power since nonutility

these rates are called marketbased rates this first incremental change to traditional electricity regulation started movement toward marketori ented approach to electricity supply following the

renewable energy industry and environmen tal groups have many reasons to support purpa as it stands mainly their argument is that purpa introduced competition in the electric generating s ector and at the same time helped promote wider use of cleaner alternative fuels to generate electricity since the electric generating sector is not yet fully competitive they argue repeal of purpa would decrease competition and impede the development of the renewable energy industry additionally opponents of purpa repeal argue that it would result in less competition and greater utility monopoly cont rol over the electric industry some state regulators have expressed concern that 210 repeal would prevent them from deciding matters currently under their jurisdiction appendix h repeal of the public utility holding company act of 1935 house sec 1263 senate sec 1273 historically electricity service was fined as natural monopoly meaning that the industry has 1 an inhere nt tendency toward declining longterm costs 2 high threshold investment and 3 technolog ical conditions that limit the number of potential entrants in addition many regula tors have considered unified control of generation transmission and distribution as the most efficient means of providing service as result most people about 75 are currently served by vertically integrated investorowned utility as the electric utility industry has evol ved however there has been growing belief that the historic classification of electric utilities as natural monopolies has been overtaken by events and that market forces can and should replace some of the traditional economic regulatory structure for example the existence of utilities that do not own all of their generating fac ilities primarily coope ratives and publicly owned utilities has provided evidence that ve rtical integration has not been necessary for providing efficient electric service moreover recent changes in electric utility regulation and improved tec hnologies have allowed dditional generating capacity to be provided by independent firms rather than utilities the public utility holding company act and the federal power act fpa of 1935 title i and title ii of the public utility act establis hed regime of regulating electric utilities that gave specific and separate powers to the states and the federal government regulatory bargain was made between the government and utilitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33006crs254 in exchange for an exclusive franchise service territory utilities must provide electricity to all users at reasonable regulated rates state regulatory commissions address intrastate utility activities including wholesale and retail ratemaking state authority currently tends to be as broad and as varied as the states are diverse at the least state public utility commission will have authority over retail rates and often over investment and debt at the other nd of the spectrum the state regulatory body will oversee many facets of u tility operation despite this diversity the essential mission of the state regulator in states that have not restructured is the establishment of retail electric prices this is accomplished through an adversarial hearing process the central issues in such cases are the total amount of money the utility will be permitted to collect and how the burden of the revenue requirement will be distributed among the various customer classes residential commercial and industrial under the fpa federal economic regula tion addresses wholesale transactions and rates for electric power flowing in interstate commerce federal regulation followed state regulation and is premised on the need to fill the regulatory vacuum resulting from the constitutional inability of states to regulate interstate commerce in this bifurcation of regulatory ju risdiction federal re gulation is limited and conceived to supplement state regulation ferc has the principal functions at the federal level for the economic regulation of the electric utility industry including financial transactions wholes ale rate regulation transac tions involving transmission of unbundled retail electricity interconnection and wheeling of wholesale electricity and ensuring adequate and re liable service in addition to prevent recurrence of the abusive practices of the 1920s eg cro sssubsidization selfdealing pyramiding etc sec regulates utilitie s corporate structure nd business ventures under puhca the electric utility industry has been in the process of transformation during the past two decades there has been major change in direction concerning generation first improved technologies have reduced the cost of generating electricity as well as the size of generating facilities prior preference for largescale often nuclear or coalfired powerplan ts has been supplanted by preference for smallscale production facilities that can be brought on line more quickly and cheaply with fewer regulatory impediment s second this has lowered the entry barrier to electricity generation and pe rmitted nonutility entities to build profitable facilities one argument for additional puhca change has been made by electric utilities that want to further diversify their assets currently under puhca holding company can acquire securities or utility assets only if the sec finds that such purchase will improve the economic efficien cy and service of an integrated public utility system it has been argued that reform to allow diversification would improve the risk profile of electric utilities in much the same way as in other businesses the risk of any one investment is diluted by the risk associated with all investments utilities have also argued that diversification would lead to better use of underutilized resources due to the seas onal nature of electric demand utility holding companies that have been exempt from sec regulation argue that puhca discourages diversification because the sec could repeal exempt status if exemption would be detrimental to the public interesthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33006crs255 16 testimony is available at

litigationaljdecid222bpmhtmfor number of years there has been significant bipartisan congressional support for repealing much of puhca since the 1980s the securities and exchange commission has testified befo re congress that many provisions of puhca are longer relevant and other provisions are redundant with state and other federal regulations16 however as result of enrons dealings and collapse some in congress have taken somewhat different view toward significantly amending or repealing puhca17 even though enron had claimed exemption from puhca on february 6 2003 securities and exchange commission chief administrative law judge brenda p mu rray denied enrons puhca exemption applications of april 12 2000 and february 28 2002 amended on may 31 200218 in the case of enron puhca and many other laws did not deter or prevent fraudulent filing of information with the sec state regulators have expr essed concerns that increas ed diversification could lead to abuses including crosssubsidiz ation regulated company subsidizing an unregulated affiliate crosssubsidization was major argument against the creation of exempt wholesale generators ewgs and has reemerged as an argument against further puhca change in the case of electric and gas companies nonutility ventures that are undertaken as result of diversification may benefit from the regulated utilities allowed

utility subsidiaries in this situation opponents f ear that utilities would not be penalized for failure in terms of reduced access to new capital because they could increase retail rates appendix i continuation of transmission security order sec 1441 in 2002 24mile 330megawatt mw tr ansmission cable was installed beneath the seabed of long island s ound between connecticut and long island shortly after the line was installed it was determined that in several places the cable was not buried to depths specified in permits issued by the us army corps of engineers corps and the connecticut partment of enviro nmental protection cdep while the corps determined th at operation of the cable would not pose environmental or navigati onal harm and did not object to the operation of the transmission line the cdep objected to th operation of the line based on procedural grounds cdeps position was that operation of the cable would violate the permit unless the cable was installed to the permitted depth requirements cdep denied request to modify the permit on june 12 2003 crosssound the owners of the cable filed new permit application with the cdep however on june 26 2003 connectic ut governor johnhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33006crs256 rowland signed into law bill extending prohibition on cons idering permits or applications related to certa in infrastructure crossings of the sound on august 14 2003 the northeast experienced widesp read electric blackout in response secretary of energy spencer abraham issued an emergency order to energize the crosssound cable this order was resc inded on may 7 2004 long island power authority lipa and crosssound filed petition with ferc to have the cable re energized by july 1 2004 at june 17 2004 ferc meeting chairman pat wood asked the parties to negotiate settlement within seven days after which ferc was ready to issue an order on june 25 2004 the parties came to an agreement and the crosssound cable was reenergized appendix j deadline for decision on appeals under the coastal zone management act sec 2013 current law the consistency provisions in section 307 of the czma guides state consideration of whethe r proposed federal activity will be compatible with federally approved and state administered coastal zone management plan since the first state plan was approved in the mid 1970s there has been considerable friction between states and federal agencies over the reach of the consistency provisions states have sought broader pplication to have strong role in decisions about the largest possible array of proposed federal ac tivities while the fede ral government has sought narrower interpretations especially relating to offshore energy development determining an exact boundary separating ac tions on which the state is to have primary role in halting proposal from acti ons on which the state does not have such powers has been subject of federal appeal s and litigation including decisions by the us supreme court notably secretary of the interior v california 464 us 312 1984 in which the court termined that the sale of oil and gas leases on the outer continental shelf was not an act affecting the coastal zone when state and federal agency cannot reach an agreement on consistency determination the law and regu lations lay out an elaborate process for resolving that disagreement most disagreements are resolved through this process but if agreement can be reached the final step is an appeal to the secretary of commerce to make decision appeals to the secr etary have not been common according to citations of appeals posted on the website of the office of ocean and coastal resource management in the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa viewed may 12 2005 38 consistency deter minations were appealed to the secretary between 1984 and 1999 and 19 of th em involved proposed activities by oil companies the appeals process like all ot her aspects of consistency is currently covered under final rule issued by noaa in the december 8 2000 federal register section 319 in current law has less detail than the proposed amendment it states that the secretary will either issu final decision on the appeal or publish notice in the federal register stating why decision cannot be reached within 90 days after the record has closed if the secretary publishes notice that decisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33006crs257 has not been made that decision must be issued within 45 days of the date of publication of that notice policy context consistency appeals have been contentious and in some instances the appeals process has dra gged on for long time periods the 1996 amendments in section 319 were meant to ddress those delays by establishing some time limits this has proved unsatisfactory to some who seek additional statutory language that would remove decisions about deadlines from the unpredictable rulemaking process by defining the length of component steps in law and therefore the overall process after an appeal to the secretary has been filed the consistency provision creates an unus ual relationship where states can halt most federal actions that are incompatible with state interests when enacted the consistency requirement wa s viewed as main reason why states would pursue development and implementation of coastal plans since the other incentive to participate federal financial grants always has been modest this view appears to have some validity as 34 of the 35 eligible states and territories are now administering federally approved coastal ma nagement programs appendix k domestic offshore energy reinvestment sec 2053 policy context this is the most recent of repeated efforts to allocate portion of federal offshore oil and gas revenues to coastal states to assist them in addressing the impacts of these activities recent congresses starting with the 105th considered numerous similar legislative proposals these proposals came to be known as cara or the conservation nd reinvestment act in the 106th congress the house passed version of cara on may 11 2000 hr 701 some of these proposals were also reflected in the clin ton administrations lands legacy initiative proposal in 2000 and also onetime 150 million appropriation provided in the fy2001 commerce appropriati ons legislation pl 106553 for coastal impact assistance support for the cara proposals which w ould also have f unded many related federal natural resource prot ection programs grew as the budget deficit of the early and mid1990s was replaced by forecasts of surplus as protecting natural resources came to be viewed as part of the effort to address spra wl and as efforts and support to secure federal funding for coastal res ource protection and rest oration efforts grew with the replacement of the budget surplu s forecast with deficit forecasts and changing national priorities since the 911 terrorist attacks broad support for wide ranging legislation like cara has declined but interest has remained in returning portion of the money currently paid to th federal government by private companies leasing offshore areas to those locations most affected by the offshore activity
