mops mass ir ae subject urgent uae request for air defense five patriot batteries this year classified by ambassador richard olson reasons 14 b and d 1 snf summary uae chief of staff of the armed forces convoked the ambassador to request the urgent deployment of five us patriot batteries in the uae as an interim measure until the uaes own batteries are operational anticipated in 2012 the uae belief that an increasingly likely preemptive israeli attack on iran would prompt quick retaliation on us allies foremost among them the very proximate uae prompted the request end summary 2 c on 22 february 2009 ambassador richard olson defense attache datt colonel bret rider and chief us liaison office uslo colonel david sprague were summoned to the office of the chief of staff of the uae armed forces cos where they were met by the cos ltg hamid thani rumaithy director military intelligence and security miss mgen eissa mazrouei commander of the uae air force and air defence afad avm mohammed swaidan qamzi and the coss office director bgen faris mohammed mazroui 3 s following very brief pleasantries the cos bluntly commented i need to be open and frank with you there are changes in the region that concern us on behalf of his government the cos then made an official request of the us government to deploy between four and five patriot batteries to the uae during calendar year 2009 he requested these batteries remain in place until such time as they can be replaced by the uaes own nine batteries currently on order 4 snf the uae would place three of the us batteries in and around abu dhabi one battery at the port of jebel ali and final battery somewhere else in the northern emirates presumably dubai the cos noted previous studies on the placement of the batteries are on file and will help guide final placement the cos stated the batteries would be used to protect critical military and civilian targets 5 snf the cos noted that iran will continue doing its best to keep the entire region unstable iran is recognized as israels biggest threat in the region and israel will attack iran with little or notice following an israeli attack the uae is convinced iran will lash out against those who help israel or the allies of israels friends most significantly the uae the cos noted the uae has the patriot system on order and expects to take delivery in 2012 he went on to mention the pending deployment of single patriot battery to protect dhafra air base which should be operational within the next 30 to 60 days the cos noted the uae operational capacity will come too late and the single us battery will be too little to stop iranian missiles if they attack sooner rather than later 6 snf hamid thani senses indications and warnings the israeli government now being formed will likely attack iran he thinks the new netanyahu government will be very determined to eliminate the threat of iranian missiles especially nuclear tipped ones which they fear may come raining down on israeli cities he also stated israel would be justified to take such action as it must protect its citizens just as any nation has the duty to do he feels that breakthrough in international efforts in regard to irans armament programs may slow israels actions however the cos knows that israel must maintain all its options he also knows the iranians have toyed with the international community for over ten years as they built their capability he stated the israelis are also very aware of iranian tactics 7 snf when pressed on what type of event may precipitate an israeli attack the cos thought the delivery of the russian s300 system could be the catalyst the cos stated very flatly that i dont trust the russians ive never trusted the russians or the iranians 8 snf the cos went on to request continued and expanded intelligence sharing between the us and the uae he asked the datt what advance warning the us could expect of an iranian attack he quickly added that he asks the same question of his miss chief at least twice week and gets answer as he knows there is good answer note the cos served as the miss chief prior to becoming cos and knows very well the capabilities related to predicting iranian actions end note 9 c the meeting ended nearly as quickly as it began with both sides wishing each other good will and great success during the international defense exhibition idex opening later in the day immediately following this meeting all of the attendees departed directly for idex the cos met with and most certainly briefed the president prime minister and abu dhabi crown prince the facto minister of defense as idex began olson
