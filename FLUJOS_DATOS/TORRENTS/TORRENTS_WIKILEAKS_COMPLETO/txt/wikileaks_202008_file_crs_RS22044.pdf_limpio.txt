are enrolled in private sc hools by their parents consistent with the number and location of these children th requirements were further detailed in regulations which required that local educa tion agencies leas provide private school students an opportunity for equ itable participation in progra m benefits and that these benefits had to be comparab in quality scope and opportunity for participation to the program benefits provided to students in the public schools2 the vagueness of the statute and the equitable participation standard led to differences among the states and localities and to differences among the courts prior to pl 10517 the courts of appeals that had considered these issues had sharply divergent views some courts gave local authorities broad discretion to decide whether to provide services for children with disabilities in private schools wh ich generally resulted in fewe r services to such children3 while others attempted to equalize the costs for public and private school children4 the supreme court had granted certiorari in several of these cases but when congress rewrote the law in 1997 the court vacated and remanded these cases the idea amendments of 1997 rejected th equitable particip ationstandard and provided that to the extent consistent w ith the number and location of children with disabilities in the state who were enrolled in private schools by their parents provision was made for the participation of these ch ildren in programs assisted by part b by providing them with special ducation and related services5 the amounts expended for these services by an lea were to be qual to proportionate amount of federal funds made available to the local educational ag ency under part b of idea these services could be provided to children with disa bilities on the premises of private schools including parochial elementary and secondary schools6 there was also requirement that the statutory provisions relating to child find identifying ch ildren with disabilities are applicable to children enrolled in pr ivate schools including parochial schools7 more changes to these provisions were made by the 2004 reauthorization the senate report observe d that the intent of these chan ges is to clarify the responsibilities of leas to ensure that services to these children are provided in fair and equitable manner8 in addition

that these are important changes that will resolve number of issues that have been the subject of an increasing amount of contention in the last few years10 private school placement under pl 108446 types of private school placements child with disability may be placed in private school by the lea or the stat educational agency sea as means of fulfilling the fape requirement for the child in this situation the cost is paid for by the lea child with disability may also be unilaterally placed in private school by his or her parents in this situation the cost of the private school placement is not paid by the lea unless hearing officer or court make s certain findings however idea does require some services for children in privat schools even if they are unilaterally placed there by their parents the 2004 reauthor ization includes several changes to the provisions relating to children who are pl aced in private school by their parents11 the provisions relating to children placed in pr ivate schools by public agencies were not changed children with disabilities placed in private schools by their parents generally children with disab ilities enrolled by their parents in private schools are to be provided special education and re lated services to the extent consistent with the number and location of such children in the school di strict served by lea pursuant to several requirements 612a10ai in addition to this genera l lea responsib ility there are also five specific requirements regarding parentally placed children lea responsibility the general provision disc ussed above was changed from previous law by the addition of the requireme nt that the children be located in the school district served by the lea the senate re port described this change as protecting leas from having to work with private schools locat ed in multiple jurisdictions when students attend private schools across district lines12 although the intent was to protect leas from working with private schools in multiple jurisdictions this pr ovision has generated considerable controversy detailed discussion of this issu is beyond the scope of this report however several of the issues raised include the disproportional effect on leas with large concentrations of private schools the lack of change in the funding formula to reflect the change and potential conflicts with state laws13httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22044crs4 13 continued reprinted at httpwwwedgovpolicyspecedguidideafaqparentplacedpdf 14 id 15 34 cfr 300 appx b 71 federal register 46814 august 14 2006 16 hrept 10877 108th cong 1st sess 94 2003 see also srept 108185 108th cong 1st sess 1516 2003 which states that this requirement was to help to ensure that these funds are serving their intended purposespecific requirements for parentally placed children there are five requirements regarding children pa rentally placed in private school s the first is that the funds expended by the lea including direct services to parentally placed private school children shall be equal to proportionate amount of federa l funds made available under part b of idea the 2004 reauthorization dded the phrase regarding direct services the senate report stated that it is the committees intent that school districts place greater emphasis on services provided directly to such children like specifically designed instructional activitie s and related services rath er than devoting funds solely to indirect services such as professiona l development for private school personnel14 second new provision relating to the calculation of the proportionate amount is added in calculating this amount the lea after timely and meanin gful consultation with representatives of private schools shall conduct thorough and complete child find process to determine the number of childre n with disabilities who are parentally placed in private schools the final regulations provide discussion and example of the proportionate share calculation15 third the new law keeps the previous require ment that the services may be provided to children on the premises of private includi ng religious schools to the extent consistent with law pl 108446 added the term re ligious while deleting the term parochial fourth specific provision regarding s upplementing funds not supplanting them is added state and local funds may s upplement but not supplant the proportionate amount of federal funds required to be expended fifth each lea must maintain records and provide to the sea the number of children evaluated the number of children determined to have disabilities and the number of children served under the private school provisions the house report stated that such requirement ensures that thes funds are serving their intended purpose16 the general requirement regarding child find is essentially the same as previous law the requirement for finding children with disabilities is the same as that delineated in 612a3 for children who are not parenta lly placed in private schools including religious schools as was done in the prev ious section the former use of the term parochial is replaced by the term religious in the new law new provisions are added concerning equitable particip ation activities cost and the completion period child find is to be designed to ensure the equitable participation of parent ally placed private school children with disabilities and th eir accurate count the cost of child find activities may not be considered in meeting the leas proportional spending ob ligation finally the child find for parentally placed private school children with disabilities is to be completedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22044crs5 17 srept 108185 108th cong 1st sess 15 2003 in time period comparable to that for students attending public schools 612a10aii consultation between the local educational agency and private school officials pl 108446 adds requirements concerning lea consultation with private school officials and re presentatives of the parents of parentally placed private school children with disabilities this consultation is to include the child find process and how parent ally placed private school children with disabilities can participate equitably the determination of th proportionate amount of federal funds available to serve parentally placed privat school children with disabilities including how that amount was calculated the consultation process among the lea private school officials and representatives of parents of pare ntally placed private school children with disabilities including how the process will operate how where and by whom special education and related services will beprovided for parentally placed priv ate school children with disabilities including discussion of the types of services including direct services and alternate service delivery mechanisms how the services will be apportioned if there are insufficient funds to serve all children and how and when these decisions will be made and how the lea shall provide writte n explanation to private school officials of the reasons why the lea c hose not to provide services if the lea and private school official s disagree 612a10aiii the senate report described the consultation procedure as similar to that in the child left behind act and therefore the committee does not believe including these provisions places an undue burden on leas17 the new law requires written affirmation of the consultation signed by the representatives of the particip ating private schools if th private school representatives do not sign within reasonable period of time the lea shall forward the documentation to the sea 612a10aiv compliance procedures also are added by pl 108446 generally private school official has the right to submit complaint to the sea alleging that the lea did not engage in meaningful and timely consultation or did not give due consideration to the views of the private school offi cial if private school offi cial submits complaint he or she must provide the basis of the noncompliance to the sea and the lea must forward the appropriate documen tation if the private school official is dissatisfied with the seas determination he or she may submit complaint to the secretary of education and the sea shall forward the appropriate documentation to the secretary 612a10av equitable services the 2004 reauthorization c ontains specific subsection regarding the provision of equitable services services are to be provided by employeeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22044crs6 18 552 us __ 2007 2007 us lexis 11481 october 10 2007 19 board of education of the hyde park central school dist rict v frank g 459 f3d 356 2d cir 2006

new law further states that the f unds that are available to serv pupils attending private schools shall be controlled and ad ministered by public agency 612a10avii reimbursement for private school placement as noted above when child with disability is unilaterally placed in private school by his or her parents the cost of the private school placement is not pa id by the lea unless hearing officer or court makes certain findings as in previous law this re imbursement may be reduced or denied if the childs parents did not give certain notice 612a10ciii both the 1997 and 2004 reauthorizations contain an ex ception to this limitation but this exception is changed somewhat in the new law unde r the new law the cost of reimbursement is not to be reduced or denied for the failure to provide notice if the school prevented the parent from providing such notice the parents had not received notice of the notice requirement or compliance would likely result in physical harm to the child previous law had included provision requiring that reimbursement not be reduced or denied if parent is illiterate and had included serious emotional harm pl 108446 also contains provision allowing at the discretion of court or hearing officer the reimbursement not to be reduced or denied if the parent is illiterate or cannot write in english or compliance with the notice requirement would likely result in serious emotional harm to the child 612a10civ an issue that is not specifically addressed in the statute is whether parents of child with disability are entitled to private school reimbursement even though the student had never received special education services from the school distri ct in the supreme courts most recent idea decision board of education of the city school district of the city of new york v tom f 18 the court dividing 44 upheld an appeals court ruling that parents of child with disability are entitled to private school reimbursement even though the student had never received special education services from the school district the courts per curiam decision does not set precedent for lower courts therefore the issue is not settled on october 15 2007 the supreme cour t denied certiorari in another case presenting the same issue19
