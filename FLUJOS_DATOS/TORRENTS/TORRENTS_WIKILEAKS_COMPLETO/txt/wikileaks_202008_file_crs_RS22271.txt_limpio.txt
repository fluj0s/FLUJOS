24 2005 president bush nominated ben bernanke to be greenspans successor on january 31 the senate confirmed bernankes nomination by voice vote bernanke was chairman of the presidents council of

and theories on inflation targeting the monetary transmission mechanism and global saving glut have been widely cited the chairman of the board is also chairman of the federal open market committee fomc which sets the nations monetary policy the fomc meets every six weeks to set monetary policy by setting target for the federal funds rate the overnight interbank lending rate the federal reserve is also responsible for regulating financial holding companies enforcing certain financial regulations issuing paper currency clearing checks and collecting economic data1 1 see crs report rl30354 monetary policy current policy and conditions by marc labonte and gail makinen and crs report rs20949 the federal reserve recurrent public policy issues by marc labonte congressional research service the library of congress crs2 the federal reserve system has seven governors who are appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate since the eisenhower administration the senate has never rejected nominee appointed by the president2 governors term lasts for 14 years and governor may serve only one nonrenewable complete term all seven governors serve on the fomc congress can only remove governor for cause and governor has ever been removed by congress if governor is appointed to serve out the unexpired portion of another governors term however that governor may then be reappointed to one new complete term after the first term ends greenspan first took office to fill an unexpired term on august 11 1987 when that term ended on january 31 1992 he was reappointed to full 14year term which ended january 31 2006 by law he is ineligible to be reappointed to another term among the seven fed governors the president appoints and the senate confirms one of the governors to be chairman of the board like bernanke in 2006 when greenspan was appointed governor in 1987 he was also appointed chairman the term for chairman runs for four years but there is limit on how many times it can be renewed greenspan served five terms as chairman there have been 13 chairmen since the fed was established in 19133 although there is little nominal difference between the powers of the chairman of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22271 the board and the other governors4 there is widespread perception that the chairman wields enormous influence over the fomcs decisions for example recent st louis fed study found that in the period from 1989 to 1997 chairman greenspans initial interest rate policy proposal was adopted at every single fomc meeting furthermore voting members of the fomc voiced disagreement with chairman greenspans proposal 28 of the time but cast votes against the proposal only 75 of the time5 chairman greenspans legacy there is widespread agreement among economists many elected officials of all political stripes historians financial market participants and commentators that greenspans tenure as chairman was success he initially gained praise for the feds swift reaction to the stock market crash of october 19 1987 because this crash did not lead to recession and the stock market started rising again soon afterwards much of his legacy stems from the 1990s expansion which was the longest on record the 1990s expansion was also noted for persistently low price inflation which did not significantly accelerate even at the end of the expansion although the fed was unable to prevent the 2001 recession it reduced the federal funds rate rapidly and sharply in response 2 irwin morris congress the president and the federal reserve ann arbor university of michigan press 2000 p 78 the senate can prevent an appointment without formal rejection however for example the senate did not give president clintons nominee carol parry confirmation hearing before the 106th congress ended parry was nominated on aug 6 1999 3 for information on the federal reserves structure see crs report rs20826 structure and functions of the federal reserve system by pauline smale 4 each governor has one vote on board and fomc decisions although the chairman sets meeting agendas passes out assignments administers the federal reserve system and is the public spokesman for the fed 5 ellen meade the fomc preferences voting and consensus federal reserve bank of st louis review vol 87 2 marapr 2005 p 93 crs3 many of the economic accomplishments for which chairman greenspan is credited would not reasonably be attributed to monetary policy monetary policy is widely believed to ultimately influence only two things inflation and the stability of the business cycle to fairly judge his record it is best to look at data over the entire business cycle chairman greenspans tenure coincided with the end of the 1980s expansion the 19901991 recession the entire 1990s expansion the 2001 recession and the beginning of the current expansion as can be seen in table 1 the 19901991 and 2001 recessions were two of the shortest mildest recessions of the postworld war ii era6 likewise the 1990s and 1980s expansions were the longest and third longest expansions of the era respectively contrary to popular belief table 2 shows that economic growth was not faster in the 1990s than in earlier expansions growth was rapid in the second half of the 1990s but relatively slow in the first half however the 1990s were more successful than previous expansions in that the economy had never before maintained such steady stable growth for such an extended period of time and unlike the expansions of the 1960s1980s high rates of growth at the end of the 1990s expansion were not achieved at the cost of rapidly rising inflation httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22271 table 1 comparing the two recessions of the greenspan era to the previous eight duration contraction of gdp months

2004 from 1967 to 1991 by contrast inflation was above 3 in every year except one reaching double digits four times only in the period from 1952 to 1966 during the tenure of chairman william mcchesney

greenspan was not without its critics perhaps the most salient criticism surrounds how monetary policy should treat imbalances in the economy which during the greenspan era included stock market bubble in the 1990s particularly in the hightech sector potential housing bubble today large and rising trade deficits from the mid1990s to the present and rising household and government borrowing the orthodox view which greenspan consistently followed was that monetary policy could respond to these types of events only insofar as they manifested themselves in the form of rising inflation or change in aggregate spending in this view the fed has only one tool at its disposal shortterm interest rates and any attempt to use it to tackle ancillary economic issues would divert the fed from its mandate of low inflation and stable business cycle critics respond that these imbalances will eventually spill over to the broader economy even if they do not necessarily cause the inflation rate to rise for example the 20002001 stock market crash contributed to the 2001 recession critics also argue that imbalances can be precursor of higher inflation for example higher stock or house prices may induce unsustainable levels of consumer spending the shortcoming of the critics argument is that by tackling an imbalance with the blunt tool of higher interest rates the fed risks inducing the very recession that it is feared the imbalance will cause7 tackling imbalances also requires the federal reserve to in effect outwit the market 7 greenspan made this point in speech risk and uncertainty in monetary policy at the american economic association annual meetings jan 3 2004 crs5 since phenomenon identified by market participants as unsustainable would come to halt on its own as greenspan puts it to spot bubble in advance requires judgment that hundreds of thousands of informed investors have it all wrong betting against markets is usually precarious at best8 perhaps the aspect of chairman greenspans legacy that is most important for his successor is that he leaves behind model or formal method for how to make monetary policy decisions as chairman greenspan eschewed policy rules and regimes that would reduce the feds discretion federal reserve transparency and predictability were increased during greenspans tenure by announcing changes to the federal funds rate immediately and making the minutes of the fomc meetings public for example nevertheless greenspans decisions and views often appeared at least to outside observers to be based more on hunches than predictable welldefined decisionmaking process often these hunches proved to be correct and prescient for example greenspan was credited with correctly identifying the acceleration in productivity growth that began in the mid1990s before it was evident in the data had he failed to identify the acceleration he might have raised interest rates when economic growth began to accelerate for fear that faster growth would make inflation rise as it turned out higher httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22271 productivity growth meant that the economy could grow faster without causing inflationary pressures issues for the new chairman gaining the financial markets confidence the major challenge new chairman faces is gaining the confidence of financial market participants that the fomc will make decisions that support economic stability were participants to lose confidence in the new chairman at some point us stock bond or currency prices could temporarily fall as discussed in the previous section greenspan leaves behind explicit transparent model for setting monetary policy therefore the new chairman will likely be starting from scratch in the financial markets eyes traditionally the new chairman gains confidence by building his or her own track record over time the difficulty of this challenge may be overstated when greenspan became chairman in 1987 many observers feared that he could not fill the shoes of his predecessor paul volcker who had brought inflation down from double digits to low levels at the end of his term perhaps chairman bernankes time as fed governor during the greenspan era will help him gain market confidence more quickly related challenge for the new chairman will be clearly communicating the feds intentions in order to prevent policy surprises while the fed has never and would never preannounce its next policy decision in the later years of the greenspan era the fed conveyed its intentions to financial market participants clearly enough that rate change was rarely surprise this kept the feds contribution to financial uncertainty and thus market turbulence to minimum since the fed chairmans statements are generally guarded it is possible that it will take some time before market participants can decipher the new chairmans intentions 8 testimony of chairman greenspan before the joint economic committee 106th congress june 17 1999 crs6 is there still new economy many of the economic questions raised during the 1990s have still not been resolved by economists how fast can the economy grow on sustainable basis how low can unemployment fall before triggering inflationary pressures how long will the acceleration in productivity last answers to these questions are necessary to make sound monetary policy decisions yet remain elusive should the fed adopt an inflation target in the past two decades central banks in most of the developed world have adopted single mandate of price stability and have set inflation targets to meet this mandate9 as chairman greenspan resisted calls for the fed to adopt numerical inflation target partly on the grounds that it would hinder the feds flexibility to respond to unforeseen economic events and partly on the grounds that the fed has provided price stability without one greenspans retirement will likely rekindle the targeting debate because chairman bernanke has been longtime advocate of inflation targeting10 proponents believe that adopting an inflation target would give the fed clear achievable mandate and safeguard against return to the days of high inflation opponents believe like greenspan that inflation targets needlessly restrict the choices available to policymakers and that it is unrealistic and undesirable for the fed to respond only to inflationary pressures11 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22271 nonpartisanship although fed governors are political appointees they are widely viewed and expected to behave as nonpartisan that is partly due to the technical apolitical nature of monetary policy decisions arguably monetary decisions require fewer judgment calls as to how to balance competing interests than most policy questions and therefore do not require political values decisions are not supposed to be made in political context such as how they would influence an upcoming election12 fed governors do not explicitly endorse or reject political proposals or candidates as chairman greenspan rigorously adhered to this nonpartisan tradition and was widely respected by both parties some critics however claimed that he crossed the partisan line by tacitly endorsing the 2001 tax cuts unlike previous positions greenspan had taken the tax cuts were highly controversial among economists some observers believed that his endorsement greatly improved the tax cuts chance of congressional approval key challenge for the new chairman will be how to respond in similar situations bernankes time as chairman of the presidents economic advisers position also held by greenspan may color peoples perceptions of his nonpartisanship at least initially chairman bernanke who is relatively unknown with the american public could potentially find it difficult to defend himself from accusations of partisanship by drawing on his stature as greenspan was able to do 9 see crs report rl31702 price stability inflation targeting as the sole goal of
