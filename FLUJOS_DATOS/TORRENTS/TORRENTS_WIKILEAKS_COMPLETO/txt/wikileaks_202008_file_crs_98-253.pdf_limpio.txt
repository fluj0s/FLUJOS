by the us department of agriculture to reach record 91 billion while agricultural imports are expected to reach 755 billion also record level the agricultural trade surplus is projected to be 155 billion exports of highvalue products eg fruits vegetables meats wine and beer have increased since the early 1990s and now account for 60 of total us agricultural exports exports of bulk commodities eg soybeans wheat and feed grains remain significan t much of the growth in us export value in 2007 is due to increased bulk exports leading markets for us agricultural exports are canada mexico japan the european union china south korea and taiwan the united states dominates world markets for corn wheat and cotton brazil has overtaken the united states as the worlds leading supplier of soybeans and is the worlds leading supplier of beef and poultr to world markets the us share of world beef exports which declined after the 2003 discovery of case of mad cow disease in the united states are recovering as more countries reopen markets to us product the united states european union australia and new zealand are dominant suppliers of dairy products in global agricultural trade most us agricultural imports are highvalue products the biggest import suppliers are the european union and nafta partners canada and mexico which together provide 55 of total us agricultural imports australia brazil new zealand indonesia and colombia are also major suppliers of agricultural imports to the united states among the fastestgrowing markets for us agricultural exports are canada and mexico both partners with the united states in the north american free trade agreement nafta us agricultural exports to china member of the world trade organization since 2001 have grown at an annual rate of 15 since 1992 both the eu and the united states subsidize their agricultural sectors but overall the eu outspends the united states five to one recent reforms of the eus common agricultural policy shift substantial spending into direct income support decoupled from production and into rural development canada supports some sectors eg dairy and poultry more than others australia provides less support to its agriculture eu and us export subsidies are declining largely in response to policy changes and market forces border measures tariffs are more important in canada than in either the united states or the eu australia operates mix of trade measures the united states is the dominant supplier of fore ign food aid followed by the eu canada and australia us food aid is almost exclusively in the form of commodities while other donors provide mix of cash and commodities httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98253g23g495g21g495g561g3g144g155g146g140g158g149g157g158g155g138g149g561
