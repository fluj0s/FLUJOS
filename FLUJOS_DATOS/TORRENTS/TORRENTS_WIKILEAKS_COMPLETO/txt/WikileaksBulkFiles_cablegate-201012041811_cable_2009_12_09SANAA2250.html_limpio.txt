mops mass ym subject yemen abuzz with talk of ct operations ttention slowly turns to us role classified by ambassador stephen seche for reasons 14b and d 1 s summary yemenis have talked of little else but the counterterrorism operations against alqaeda in the arabian peninsula since news broke of the predawn raids on december 17 official media and royg officials have focused on the successful aspects of the operation including an alleged 34 terrorists killed and 51 arrested independent and opposition media as well as the opposition joint meeting parties and members of the southern movement have used the operations specifically the deadly airstrikes in abyan governorate to criticize what they view as the roygs heavyhanded policies after series of stories on us involvement broke in the us media in the days after the strikes local and panarab media have begun to focus on this aspect of the story royg media reported the conversation between president obama and president saleh and released an official statement that there was us military involvement in the raids while president saleh and the royg seem determined to move forward with similar strikes in the future septel stillnascent public support will depend on the roygs ability to effectively manage the evolving coverage of the events end summary heavy media coverage along partisan lines 2 c the royg made swift work of announcing the preemptive dawn strikes against alqaeda in the arabian peninsula aqap in sanaa and abyan governorates on december 17 but abc tv news reports of us intelligence and logistical assistance to the royg were picked up on the same day by yemens opposition media and were quickly followed by charges of scores of civilian deaths due to the joint airstrikes in abyan by royg and us forces opposition demonstrators and media outlets as well as members of parliament have called for an investigation of the civilian deaths in abyan due to the airstrikes the story heavily reported in the international press of an extensive role by us counterterrorism forces in assisting the royg will linger as long as interest in the civilian deaths continues 3 c raids against aqap at dawn on december 17 in arhab suburb of sanaa and training camp located in village in abyans almahfad district were reported immediately by the ministry of defense web site 26sepcom and picked up by local and international media by noon on december 17 reports of us logistical and intelligence assistance to royg counterterrorism forces were reported on abc tv later the same day that tv broadcast was swiftly reported on the opposition islah partys web site alsahwa repeating assertions of us assistance to the royg and citing unnamed eyewitnesses claiming that 18 children and 41 men and women were among the civilians killed by airstrikes also on december 17 aljazeera aired footage of civilian casualties and quoted locals as saying that us aircraft were sighted on overflight surveillance on the eve of the airstrikes in abyan the official media was slow to respond to rapid coverage critical of the raids by opposition media and to organized protests in the region instead focusing its initial reporting on aqap leaders killed or captured in the raids official media defends strikes denies us involvement 4 sbu by december 18 the regional and international media led by the report in the new york times that the us had given intelligence firepower and other assistance to the royg in their raids against aqap began to cover the question of us involvement the sensationalist and often inaccurate almenparnet the houthis official web site and irans presstvnet both reported 63 people dead in the raids in abyan including 28 children on december 19 the royg went on the offensive reporting on the mods web site that operations against aqap militants were targeted to foil suicide bombers planning attacks against yemeni and foreign installations that the raids resulted in killing four suicide bombers and arresting four others and that the attack on the training center in abyan resulted in the deaths of 2430 aqap members aljazeera meanwhile broadcast report on december 19 that the number killed in abyan was over 60 according to eyewitnesses and that most of the deaths were civilians the satellite channel also showed video of artillery shells with visible serial numbers and claimed that us warplanes or cruise missiles probably conducted the strike on december 21 official media attempted to get the damaging story of civilian deaths off the front pages by diverting focus to the war in saada elites react with reserve some praise 5 s gauging public opinion on the december 17 ct strikes is difficult since the majority of yemens population is rural and national polling systems exist the political elite as represented by embassy contacts however have generally reacted with reserve and some have even offered praise for longoverdue action in an email to emboffs xxxxx congratulated the usg on the successful ct operations which he praised as necessary to rid yemen of terrorist elements xxxxx told poloff that the strikes were necessary to bring abyan back from the edge of extremism alqaeda travels freely throughout abyan and shebwa using their training camps they now number in the thousands in these areas he said criticism among the elite classes has so far been limited to loss of civilian life and largely avoided any criticism of the us xxxxx to poloff on december 20 we do not support religious ideological or political extremism but to use military violence that kills innocents on the pretext of pursuing criminals is wrong xxxxx often critical of royg policies told poloff on december 18 that he perceived the operations as successful but wished the arhab operation had netted the big fish aqap operational commander qassim alrimi which would have provided better justification for any civilian losses opposition hits back citing civilian deaths 6 s members of the opposition joint meeting parties jmp parliament and the southern movement have all used the airstrikes in abyan as means to attack the royg for what the oppositionists call heavyhanded policies the strike in maajala in abyans almahfad district which locals have reported killed 49 civilians including 17 women and 23 children comes on the heels of critical and widely read human rights watch report focused on the roygs violent suppression of political demonstrations in the southern governorates released on december 15 note deputy prime minister for defense and security affairs rashad alalimi told the ambassador that civilians killed in the airstrikes were most likely poor bedouin from the area providing logistical support to the terrorists and aqap family members end note nonstop aljazeera coverage of the aftermath of attacks in abyan has provided fuel for the opposition on december 20 parliament led by opposition islah party member from abyan ali alashal called alimi and the minister of defense to appear before the legislative body to discuss reports of civilian deaths in abyan 7 s the jmp immediately seized on reports of civilian deaths using the december 17 airstrikes as an excuse not to participate in president salehs national dialogue set to begin on december 26 the yemeni socialist party ysp called for the royg to compensate victims families and pay for treatment of those wounded in the operations local media reported that thousands protested in the perpetually restive southern governorates of lahj and abyan calling for an investigation into the attacks rumors were rampant among secessionists in southern yemen that the attack did not target an aqap training camp but rather civilian population xxxxx the airstrikes in abyan as another occasion to promote the movement as better ct partner for the us than the royg he told poloff on december 20 the saleh regime is trying to mix up alqaeda with the movement were willing to cooperate with you to avoid killing innocent people and kick out alqaeda royg frustrated but willing to stay the course 8 s the royg has weathered the storm of criticism most of it from the usual suspects well and has restated its commitment to continue similar operations against aqap in the near future alimi speaking for president saleh told the ambassador on december 20 that his government was determined to keep hitting aqap in cooperation with the us septel political observers in sanaa have suggested that president saleh received significant morale boost from personal congratulatory phone calls from president obama and egyptian president hosni mubarak the day of the strikes wearysounding xxxxx the attack is already causing the government headache because the jmp is using it as the reason not to participate in the national dialogue which will include economic as well as political issues however the royg often eager to use flack from the opposition as an excuse not to move forward in controversial ct operations has indicated that it is willing to weather the most recent criticism comment 9 s the december 17 operations against aqap have proven success and served as significant distraction in the local media from the governments protracted civil war in the north of the country in sanaa at least many yemenis seem to accept the necessity and inevitability of similar ct action as alqaedas presence in yemens lawless tribal governorates has ballooned in recent months the royg however must be more proactive in countering inaccurate opposition stories and aqap propaganda regarding the loss of innocent lives in the abyan airstrikes especially if future operations are already in the works while the us has escaped the brunt of criticism to date continued leaks from washington and international media coverage of american involvement could stir up antiamerican resentment in yemen and test the roygs professed commitment to going after aqap end comment seche
