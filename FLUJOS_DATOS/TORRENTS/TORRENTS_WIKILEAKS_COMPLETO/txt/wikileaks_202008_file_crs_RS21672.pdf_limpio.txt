scope of diplomatic immunity this report describes the hi story behind the principle of diplomatic immunity as well as internati onal and domestic law concerning the scope of this immunity historical background of diplomatic immunity from the earliest of times interaction between sovereign entities has required secure means of communication between governme nt and its envoys in order to facilitate relations between governments sovereign entities have long recognized the concept of diplomatic immunity from the jurisdiction of the receiving sovereign as being necessary to ensure that these channels of communica tion are preserved the concept of diplomatic immunity has longstanding roots in international practice and can be traced as far back as the ancient civilizations of china india and egypt1 the greek historian thucydides records that the ancient greek citystates regularly exchanged special missions and ambassadors were ceremoniously received and c ourteously treated by the receiving city state2 the early romans too maintained treat relations with neighboring nations that included active diplomatic exchange3 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21672crs2 4 barry carter phillip r

extraterritoriality and representative character theories the extraterritoriality theory posited the legal fiction that the diplomat legally remained in the sending state even when he was temporally in the receiving state c arter trimble supra note 4 according to the representative character theory the diplomat is the personification of the sending state and should therefore receive the same

at the purpose ofdiplomatic privileges and immunities is not to benefit individuals but to ensure the effici ent performance of the functions of diplomatic missionsin both ancient greece and rome diplom ats enjoyed personal inviolability that included immunity from the receiving na tions civil and criminal jurisdicti on and the receiving sovereign owed special duty to protect the diplomats person4 even crime as severe as plotting to overthrow the recei ving sovereign could not be punished the only permissible response was to declare the diplomat persona non grata and oust him from the territory5 violation of diplomats invi olability required immediate reparation by the offending sovereign and more than one war began because an envoy was detained or punished by the receiving sovereign without reparation6 as political and economic contact between nations grew so too did the need for regular diplomatic contact be tween nations by the end of the middle ages diplomacy was being practiced in manner closely resembling modern practice and the recognition of diplomatic immunity by receiving states had become customary norm7 indeed the noted international legal commentator grotius asserted that there are two maxims in the law of nations relating to ambassadors which are generally accepted as established rules the first is that ambassadors must be received and the second that they must suffer harm8 the vienna convention on diplomatic relations9 ratified by the us in 1972 codified the customary law of diplomatic relations that had developed in the previous millennia including the scope of diplomatic immunity historically number of theoretical justifications d been presented in support of the doctrine of diplomatic immunity10 the privileges and immunities granted to diplomats pursuant to the vienna convention are based upon the theory of functi onal necessitythat is those privileges and immunities that are required to enable the diplomat to effectively perform his prescribed duties11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21672crs3 12 it should be noted that diplomatic missions and agents are distinct from consulates and international organizations under international w the privileges and immunities afforded to consular officers and missions are mainly prov ided for by the vienna convention on consular relations apr 24 1963 21 ust 77 the privileges and immun ities afforded to individual international organizations and their members are determined by treaty or the domestic law of the receiving state for example the priv ileges and immunities granted to international organizations by the united states are governed by the international organization immunities act 22 usc 288 2003 13 family members of diplomat who are not nationals of the receiving state enjoy the same privileges and immunities afforded to the diplomat pursuant to articles 29 through 36 of the vienna convention vienna convention at art 371 members of the administrative and technical staff of the diplomatic mission along with members of their families shall if they are not nationals of or permanent residents in the re ceiving state enjoy the privileges and immunities afforded to diplomatic agents except 1 their immunity from civil and administrative jurisdiction of the receiving state shall not extend to acts pe rformed outside the course of their duties and 2

diplomatic mission staff members the families of diplomatic agents and personal servants of mission members shall receive varying degrees of immunity fro m the jurisdiction of the receiving state13 the diplomatic agent defined as the the head of the mission or member of the diplomatic staff of the mission14 receives the highest degree of immunity article 29 of the vienna convention provides the person of diplomatic agent shall be inviolable he shall not be liable to any fo rm of arrest or detention the receiving state shall treat him with due respect and shall take all appropriate steps to prevent any attack on his person freedom or dignity15 diplomats enjoy absolute immunity from criminal jurisdiction of the receiving state16 they also are immune from civil and administrative jurisdiction except in the case of real action relating to private immovable property situated in the territory of the receiving state unless he holds it on behalf of the sending state for the

outside his fficial functions17 in addition the receiving state may not compel foreign diplomat to give evidence as witness18 as result of the broad immunity granted by the vienna convention receiving states have only limited number of options for dealing with diplomats impropriety one method for dealing with abuse is by declaring the diplomat persona non grata in which case the sending state shall either recall the diplomat or terminate his functions with the mission and thereby eliminate his prospective diplomatic immunity19 if the sending state refuses or fails to respond to the receiving states persona non grata declaration regarding one of its diplomats the receiving state may refuse to recognize the person concerned as member of the mission20 another option available to the receiving state is to reach an agreement with the sending state to waive diplomats immun ity article 32 of th vienna convention provides that the sending state can waive th diplomatic immunity of an agent though this waiver must always be express21 notable recent example of sending state waiving diplomatic immunity for foreig n officer occurred in 1997 when georgian diplomat driving drunk killed an american teenager in car accident although diplomatic immunity would ve shielded the diplomat from prosecution in the united states georgia waived the di plomats immunity and he was subsequently convicted for involuntary manslaughter22 the diplomat nevertheless remained immune from civil suit however because neither the department of states request to georgia for waiver of immunity nor the actual waiver expressly mentioned civil litigation23 redress for offenses committed by diplomat in the receiving state may be sought within the sending state the immunity of the diplomatic agent from the jurisdiction of the receiving state does not exempt him from the jurisdiction of the sending state24 depending upon the particular ci vil and criminal laws of the sending state its diplomats could potentially be held liable for actions they commit in another state further the privileges and immunities pr ovided by the vienna convention remain subject to reciprocal limitations article 47 of the convention provides that if the receiving state infringes upon the legal rights afforded to the sending state the sending state is permitted to reciprocate this treatme nt against the receivi ng states diplomats25httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21672crs5 26 us c onst art vi cl 2 27 22 usc 254258 2003 28 22 usc 254a the families of diplomatic agents as well as diplomatic mission members and their

limited circum stances as party to the vienna convention the united states has dopted its provisions concerning diplomatic immunity and in enacting the diplomatic relations act the united states
