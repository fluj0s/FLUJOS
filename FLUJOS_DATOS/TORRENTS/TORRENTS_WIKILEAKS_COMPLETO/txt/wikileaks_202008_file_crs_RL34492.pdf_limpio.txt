electronic government information howe ver while the repor ting requirements of this section appear to have been fulfilled7 ongoing concerns about issues such as the archiving of official elect ronic records and the accessib ility of current electronic information for citizens have prompted th introduction of new legislation in the 110th congress for example the revelation of deficiencies regarding the retention and preservation of official electronic co mmunications ie ema il messages by the white house have contributed to calls for more stringent rules and oversight related to the archiving of such materials8 similarly s 2321 the egovernment reauthorization act of 2007 includes pr ovision discussed later in this report requiring the director of omb to promul gate new guidelines

source for interagency it projects however although the egovernment act authorized cumulative minimum of 345 million from fy2003fy2007 concerns rega rding oversight have prompted congress to appropriate more than 5 million in any given fiscal year since the passage of the act congress has also re peatedly declined to approve the bush administrations alte rnative proposals to allow omb to

cross agency funding and the role of the egovernment fund the problem of cross agency funding hi ghlights the clash between the horizontal nature of governmentwide egovernment initiatives and the vertical organization of government congressional authorizing committees and appropriations subcommittees are organized by program andor agency the allocation of resources and the oversight of
