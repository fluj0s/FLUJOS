iraq lebanon and the palestinian territories the current state of the middle east has been frequently described in terms of growing sunnishiite rivalry in which sunni arab and western governments aim to contain irans panshiite foreign policy when applied to lebanon this narrative is becoming an increasing reality many us policy makers fear that without significant outside support the march 14 movement an antisyrian coalition of some sunni druze and christian lebanese that came together after the february 2005 assassination of former prime minister rafik hariri will not be able to withstand syrian and iranian meddling through their shiite proxy hezbollah since 2005 the administration has pursued policy of strengthening the prowestern elements of the lebanese government critics charge that the united states may be fueling civil strife in lebanon by taking sides in lebanons complex political mosaic others assert that us policy exaggerates iranian influence over hezbollah claiming that hezbollah has evolved over time into more independent political actor in lebanon in order to support the lebanese government the united states has pledged to devote more financial resources to reconstruction and military assistance the summer 2006 war between hezbollah and israel heightened the need for additional economic aid as the lebanese government and its international and arab partners vied with iran and hezbollah to win the hearts and minds of many lebanese citizens who lost homes and businesses as result of the conflict iran channeled millions of dollars in cash assistance through hezbollah to southern lebanon while the international community raised several billion dollars at an emergency donor conference in stockholm sweden nevertheless lebanon remains in need of aid from abroad from military standpoint the war also highlighted the urgent need for more robust lebanese military to adequately patrol lebanons porous borders with syria and to prevent hezbollahs rearmament as part of an overall fy2007 supplemental funding request the bush administration seeks an estimated 770 million in foreign aid for lebanon country that has received an estimated

to provide 181 million in emergency aid following the 2006 summer war d country allocations based on the fy2007 continuing resolution pl 1105 have not yet been made strengthening the lebanese armed forces laf the bush administration which has sought to pull lebanon away from syrias orbit has pledged to strengthen the laf as military counterweight to hezbollah syrias and irans primary interlocutor in lebanon us efforts to boost lebanese sovereignty and independence have evolved over time beginning with increased us pressure on syria in the months prior to the us invasion of iraq in march 2003 us efforts gained traction after the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri and the subsequent withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon in 2005 the impetus for new us military assistance to lebanon reached its apex after the 2006 israelhezbollah war that again exposed the lafs overall impotence and its inability to secure lebanons borders to prevent destabilizing hezbollah operations against israel the deployment of 12000 peacekeepers to southern lebanon under the auspices of unbrokered ceasefire resolution unscr1701 reinforced the need for more robust laf international peacekeepers take their lead from the crs3 government and require the lafs permission before acting against suspected weapons smuggling and border violations according to us secretary of state condoleezza rice ultimately one of the most important things that you can do is to strengthen the lebanese armed forces not i think probably not to replace the united nations forces for some time but to be more capable themselves of defending the country and providing stable platform1 the laf remains capable of internal security only it is too understaffed and underequipped to serve as deterrent against the armed forces of its neighbors syria and israel the lafs active force is 65000 to 70000 personnel according to anthony cordesman military expert at the center for strategic and international studies csis lebanese forces are lightly armed poorly organized for maneuver warfare and lack both meaningful air force and modern landbased air defense assets2 aside from manpower and equipment shortages the laf has historically suffered from factionalism during lebanons 15year civil war sectarian politics fractured the laf along sectarian lines in the 1990s it was eventually reformed and restructured by general emile lahoud the current prosyrian president of lebanon in 1997 christian and muslim brigades were integrated and military units were regularly rotated between regions to shield soldiers from political influences lahoud also instituted national conscription although that policy ended in early 2007 us military assistance to lebanon the bush administrations recent request for increased us military assistance to lebanon marks the third time in the last 25 years that the united states has sought to expand military cooperation with lebanese forces in the early 1980s the united states provided between 145 and 190 million in grants and loans to the laf primarily for training and equipment in the early 1990s with the end of civil war the united states again provided military aid primarily in the form of nonlethal equipment such as armored personnel carriers and transport helicopters through the us armys sale of excess defense articles eda for the first time since 1984 the administration requested foreign military financing fmf grants to lebanon in the fy2006 foreign affairs budget originally it sought approximately 10 million in fmf for fy2006 and 48 million for fy2007 to help modernize the small and poorly equipped laf following syrias withdrawal of its 15000man occupation force in 2005 however the summer 2006 israelhezbollah war spurred western donors to increase their assistance to the laf drawing from multiple budget accounts the administration ultimately reprogrammed an estimated 42 million to provide spare parts technical training 1 us readies security aid package to help lebanon counter hezbollah washington post dec 22 2006 2 anthony h cordesman lebanese security and the hezbollah working draft center for strategic and international studies csis july 14 2006 crs4 and new equipment to the laf including 25 5ton trucks and 285 humvees to enhance the lafs border patrol operations3 the administrations fy2007 emergency supplemental request includes 220 million in fmf for lebanon significant increase from previous levels us military assistance may be used for expanded personnel training by private us contractors or the provision of spare parts and ammunition for lebanese forces according to the us state department us security assistance would promote lebanese control over southern lebanon and palestinian refugee camps to prevent them from being used as bases to attack israel the us governments active militarytomilitary programs enhance the professionalism of the lebanese armed forces reinforcing the concept of lebanese civilian control to foster peace and security the united states intends to build upon welcome and unprecedented lebanese calls to control the influx of weapons4 the administration also has requested 60 million in nadr funds primarily to train and equip lebanons internal security forces isf5 us reconstruction and economic assistance the battle for political primacy in lebanon waged by prime minister fouad sinioras march 14 government coalition and its us european and saudi supporters against hezbollah michel aoun and their foreign patrons in syria and iran is being fought on number of different fronts including in the economic arena the summer 2006 war and the oppositions campaign to obstruct the government have placed enormous financial strains on the lebanese economy and prime minister siniora has called on the international community to provide financial backing to his fragile government the united states has committed several hundred million dollars to lebanons rebuilding efforts president bush announced on august 21 2006 that the united states would provide an immediate 230 million to lebanon an additional 175 million on top of an earlier pledge of 55 million during conference in stockholm designed to raise funds for lebanese reconstruction at january 2007 donors conference in france dubbed paris iii secretary of state rice pledged an additional 250 million in cash transfers directly to the lebanese government this 3 according to the us state department the 42 million in fy2006 military assistance to lebanon was reprogrammed from several accounts including 10 million from department of defense section 1206 funds 27 million from fmf 28 million from the peacekeeping operations pko account and 12 million from esf and incle 4 see fy2008 international affairs function 150 congressional budget justification us department of state feb 16 2007 5 according to hr 1591 the house appropriations committees fy2007 emergency supplemental appropriations bill the 60 million in nadr funds is to be used for nonlethal assistance for lebanon of which 36500000 is for training of the internal security forces 19500000 is for equipment including individual supplies for 9000 new recruits 300 unarmored suvs computers and radio gear and 4000000 is to refurbish 35 police stations 4 police academies and command and control center crs5 us economic aid would reportedly be requested in the fy2007 supplemental request under esf assistance and may be tied to certain benchmarks that the siniora government would be required to meet to assuage donors fears that foreign assistance would be mismanaged prime minister siniora has developed an economic reform plan designed to lower lebanons crippling 41 billion public debt which costs nearly 3 billion year in interest payments or nearly 40 of the national budget decrease public subsidies privatize the electricity and telecommunications sectors and increase the value added tax vat from 10 to 12 the opposition has countered with populist campaign to thwart these reforms accusing siniora of adopting westernbacked liberalization schemes that hurt lebanese workers one opposition slogan found in beirut reads to the government of vat and to the government of seafront properties6 issues for congress7 lebanese political will some analysts believe that despite us efforts to increase military aid to the laf lebanese politicians lack the political will or cohesion to take on hezbollah and its allies in recent interview with time magazine prime minister siniora blamed israels occupation of the disputed shiba farms area for justifying hezbollahs continued armament an excuse that many observers believe masks the internal weakness and fear of antisyrian forces inside lebanon according to siniora for the state to be in full control we have to take away the reasons or the excuses that are being put forward for the continuation of hezbollahs weapons the withdrawal of the arms of hezbollah is something that has to be done through negotiation and not through force these are our countrymen these people at one time were fighting for the liberation of the occupied territory they fought bravely defending lebanon last july and august i bow my head for their sacrifices we have to arrange for the liberation of shiba farms8 6 peoples revolt in lebanon the nation jan 8 2007 7 section 1224 of pl 107228 the fy2003 foreign relations authorization act stated that 10 million of the funds available for lebanon in fy2003 and subsequent years could not be obligated until the president certified to congress that lebanese armed forces had deployed to the internationally recognized lebanonisrael border and that lebanon was asserting its authority over the border area the amendment was added to compel lebanon to exercise control over the border area following israels withdrawal from southern lebanon in 2000 lebanon refused to move to the border until israel evacuated the disputed shiba farms area the 10 million was held in an escrow account pending negotiations among the united states israel lebanon and members of congress the funds were eventually released in march 2004 after the administration certified to members of congress that appropriate action had been taken 8 lebanons siniora we dont want to be battlefield time mar 1 2007 crs6 without clear direction from the central government the lebanese military has pursued policy of deliberate ambiguity claiming that it officially remains neutral while taking periodic action to curb hezbollahs rearmament according to lebanese defense minister elias murr the military must stay neutral and restrained and the army cannot open fire on its citizens9 after the summer 2006 war in lebanon the laf deployed 16000 troops to southern lebanon to accompany 12000 peacekeepers it also deployed another 8000 troops along the lebanesesyrian border to combat arms smuggling in february 2007 lebanese customs police confiscated truck carrying mortars and rockets 60 grad rockets and another 240 katyusha rockets destined for hezbollahs militia defense minister elias murr refused to return the arms to hezbollah saying they would be handed over to the lebanese army10 israeli officials continue to insist that lebanese forces are not cracking down on hezbollah and that syrian and that iranian efforts to restock hezbollahs arsenal are succeeding israelilebanese skirmishes some observers caution that the potential for conflict between the lebanese and israeli militaries both of which receive substantial us assistance remains high given the tense atmosphere resulting from the 2006 war since the unbrokered ceasefire in august 2006 israeli and lebanese forces have periodically exchanged fire lebanon accuses the israeli military of violating its air space while israel accuses the laf of turning blind eye to weapons smuggling on february 7 2007 lebanese troops fired at an idf bulldozer attempting to dismantle explosives after it crossed border fence the idf fired back11 unifil spokesman stated that the exchange was initiated by the lebanese army and that unifil was assessing whether israeli troops had crossed the blue line technically lebanon and israel are still in state of war the lebanese government claims that the lafs deployment to the south is to protect lebanon from an israeli invasion not to disarm hezbollah according to lebanese army commander michel sulayman the army went to the south to protect lebanon from israeli attacks lebanon fell first in the south and i will not allow it to fall again12 9 the lebanese armys ability to maintain internal order was severely strained during january 2007 confrontation between progovernment supporters and opponents allied with hezbollah and general aoun the opposition had called for general strike which soon became violent after brawling sunni and shiite students at beirut university sparked wider confrontation in downtown beirut army commanders ordered soldiers not to disrupt the protests despite the resulting four deaths and several hundred wounded in street clashes 10 hezbollah leader shaykh hassan nasrallah responded to the weapons seizure saying that we will not forgive anyone who confiscates bullet but he added that the resistance will always stand by the lebanese army with our weapons men and blood to defend lebanon hezbollah will not forgive lebanon arms seizure agence francepresse feb 16 2007 11 ashkenazi idf may have to stop hezbollah rearming lebanese army fires on iaf planes jerusalem post feb 22 2007 12 lebanese army commander defends performance of military alnahar arabic feb 20 2007 translated by the bbc monitoring middle east crs7 potential misuse of us aid one perennial concern for lawmakers regarding us economic aid to lebanon is the risk of assistance inadvertently falling into the hands of hezbollah us state departmentdesignated foreign terrorist organization fto usaid which operates programs in southern lebanon hezbollah stronghold claims that it screens its lebanese partner organizations and subcontractors to ensure that aid is used properly and effectively other lawmakers may be concerned over the ability of the lebanese government to follow through on its reform commitments since the end of the lebanese civil war in 1990 the government has relied on external support and generous credit terms from the international community to fund reconstruction congress may examine tying new us assistance to lebanon to specific implementation of economic reforms versus tying it to promises by lebanese officials congressional action hr 1591 the house appropriations committees fy2007 emergency supplemental appropriations bill would fully fund the administrations request for aid to lebanon however it would require the administration to certify to congress that before assistance is disbursed the lebanese government and administration have fulfilled certain conditions placed on the assistance section 1802 of hr 1591 outlines the following requirements tied to the disbursement of fy2007 supplemental assistance to lebanon funds provided in this act for cash transfer assistance to lebanon be made available for obligation until the secretary of state reports to the committees on appropriations on the memorandum of agreement between the united states and the government of lebanon on lebanons economic reform plan and the benchmarks upon which cash transfer assistance will be conditioned the committee further directs the secretary to report on the procedures in place to ensure that funds are provided to any individuals or organizations that have any known links to terrorist organizations including hezbollah and mechanisms to monitor the use of the appropriated funds military assistance or international narcotics control and law enforcement assistance be made available for obligation until the secretary of state reports to the committees on appropriations on the vetting procedures in place to determine eligibility to participate in us training and assistance programs funded under these accounts the committee is concerned that the government of lebanon has not fully implemented section 14 of security council resolution 1701 and is concerned about reports of continuing arms shipments from syria into lebanon therefore the committee crs8 requests report from the secretary of state later than 45 days after enactment of this act detailing what steps the government of lebanon and unifil have taken to implement the actions outlined in the resolution hr 1591 also specifies that less than 10 million in fy2007 esf funds be made available for scholarships and direct support of american educational institutions in lebanon for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33933
