influence especially in the developing world to support new democracies in the postcold war era to fight poverty and disease affecting poor nations to combat global terrorism and to stabilize fragile or failed states have had substantial impact on levels of foreign policy resources international affair s funding decisions however are influenced not only by overseas requirements but also by th overall us budget environment and constraints that exist particularly during pe riods of deficits or when unforseen events demand reallocation of spending priorities congress and the executive branch have reduced foreign policy resources occasionally to greater extent than other sectors of the budget when fiscal austerity or domestic requirements were deemed to be of greater importance likewise during times of international crisis and especially since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 internati onal affairs spending has been one of the most rapidly in creasing areas of the us budget

resources or the creation of new imf facility at irregular intervals lthough congress provides new budget authority through appropriations for the full amount of us participation the transaction is considered as an exchange of assets between the united states and the imf and results in outlays from the us treasury in short the appropriations are offset by the creation of us counterpart claim on the imf that is liquid and interest bearing including budget authority figures for the imf creates spikes in selected years and tends to blur continuing trends in funding levels because of this and the fact that imf budget authority does not result in an outlay or have any impact on the federal deficit or surplus amounts are excluded from this reportseveral subcategories and trends that are especially applicable to current funding priorities such as confronting global health problems and increasing aid to africa data scope and sources unless otherwise noted dollar figures are expressed as discretionary budget authority representing the amount of funds congress maintains direct control over through enactment of annual appropriation bills data trends begin with fy1977 due to the consistency and availability of figures while some data on federal spending regarding outlays and mandatory progra ms are available prior to fy1977 omb publishes discretionary budget authority figures only beginning with fy1976 because fy1976 was 15 month transition year in which the beginning date of the fiscal year changed from july 1 to october 1 this analysis starts with fy1977 so that each year covers the same period of time in addition beginning in fy1996 the da ta include foreign policy resources available for the state department derived from fees collected through the machine

agency for international development usaid the congressional budget office cbo and house and sena appropriations committees constant dollar calculations are made by crs budget scorekeeping changes and problems with precise analysis of spending trends following enactment of the budget forcement act of 1990 the united states began applying in fy1992 different proce dures for appropriating funds for credit programs prior to fy1992 congress w ould appropriate the full value of direct loans issued by the us government for commercial loans guaranteed by the united states congress placed annual limitations on the total am ount of these guarantees but was not required to appropria any funds under the terms of credit reform congress began in fy1992 to appr opriate the subsidy value of both direct loans issued and loan guarantees backed by the government in simple terms the subsidy value as determined by omb is an amount that represents the risk to the us government in issuing or backing the loan plus the extent to which if any the loan carries concessional interest rate below market value accordingly there are inherent problems with comparing trends before and after fy1992 for any element of discretionary spending th at includes credit programs several credit programs ope rate within budget function 150 direct loans under foreign military financing fmf and p rior to fy1999 pl 480 food programs loan guarantees issued by usaid and direct loans and loan guarantees managed by the exportimport bank and the overseas private investment corporation two examples illustrate the mixed impact on appropriation requirements of the credit reform policy changes that took eff ect for fy1992 in fy1997 congress enacted 60 million subsidy appropriation for fmf direct loans an amount that allowed the defense department to issue military ai d loans with total face value of 540 million prior to fy1992 congress would have had to appr opriate th full 540 million instead of the 60 million subsidy that backed the loans on the other hand in the case of loan guarantee congress approved in fy1997 35 million subsidy appropriation permitting usaids urban and environmental credit program to guarantee 294 million in loans these represent loans issued by commercial lenders for which the united states gove rnment guarantees repayment before fy1992 appropriation would have been required thus c ongress appropriated in fy1997 635 million in support of these two programs whereas budget rules that existed prior to the 1992 credit reform w ould have required an appropriation of 540 million to implement these same two activities because omb has not adjusted its fi gures for prefy1992 credit programs comparisons between the two time periods cannot be totally pr ecise nevertheless an assessment of funding tre nds before and after fy1992 is still useful in identifying an illustrative pattern of spending decisi ons while the application of postcredit reform procedures on balan ce probably tends to oversta somewhat the degree of reductions in function 150 spending dur ing the mid1990s the extent of this overstatement does not appear to be sufficient to ove rride the general conclusion that cuts in the international affairs budget were substantial during that period comparison of the increases in fy 1999 fy2006 for function 150 resources withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33262crs4 pre1992 levels face the same methodological problems fo r selected subcategories of the international affairs budget however where credit programs exist such as for state department and public diplomacy programs the credit reform changes have effect on measuring and comp aring discretionary spending international affairs discretionary budget authority international affairs discre tionary budget authority meas ured in real terms has experienced several cycles over the past th ree decades there were periods of rapid growth followed immediately by sharp dec lines during the mid1980s after several years in the late 1980s and early 1990s of relative stable budget levels amounts fell at first gradually and then sharpl through fy1997 the foreign policy budget rose slightly in fy1998 but significantly in fy1999 and fy2000 compared to amounts during the mid1990s growth in the function 150 budget continued following the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 reaching by fy2004 the highest level of foreign affairs spending in three decades the earlytomid 1980s were marked by steady increase in foreign policy spending largely the result of rising amount s of security aid allocated for strategic purposes in central america pakistan nd military base rights countries such as the philippines at the same time that growth in security aid peaked in fy1985 congress approved two major supplementa ls 225 billion economic aid package for israel egypt and jordan and about 1 billion in famine relief for africa all of these factors combined to set foreign ffairs discretionary budget authority at 3896 billion in fy2006 dollars level about 5 higher than the fy2006 amount absent the unique combination of these international demands that spiked aid spending in fy1985 and with intensifying pressure in washington to reduce the federal deficit function 150 discretionary spending like other federal spending fell abruptly in fy1986 and declined further in the next two years to point more than 25 less than where the foreign policy budg et had stood just three years earlier the following period fy1988 through fy1993 marked relatively stable level of foreign affairs budg et authority ranging in most years roughly between 28 and 29 billion annually as calculated in fy 2006 dollars to considerable extent this steady period can be attributed to annually negotiated budget agreements between the administration and congress for major discretionary spending categories one of which wa s international affairs small temporary upsurge occurred in fy1990199 1 primarily the result of supplemental appropriation for aid to panama and nicaragua additional costs associated with the persian gulf war including supplemental assist ance for israel and turkey and added expenses for us agencies operating in the gulf region although the foreign affairs budget had been on long downward trend since fy1985 the drop in fy1994 was the first sign

period onequarter higher than the low point of fy1997 the most defining change in us foreign policy spending however came following the september 11 2001 terrorist ttacks in the united states since 911 american foreign aid and dipl omatic efforts have taken on more strategic sense of importance and have been cast frequently in terms of contributing to the global war on terrorism including assistance to about 30 frontline states in the terrorism war countries that cooperate with the unite d states in the war on terrorism or face terrorist threats themselves2 through series of emergency supplemental appropriations by fy2003 c ongress had boosted the inte rnational affairs budget following the 911 attacks to 374 billion in real terms at roughly the same time that fighting terrorism became the leading concern of us foreign policy the bush administr ation announced other significant initiatives that have added to growing foreign affairs budget the millennium challenge account mca

dropped back to 368 billion although it represented an 11 increase for international activities other than iraq another large emergency supplemental for fy2005 dealing with other foreign crises ts unami disaster relief palestinian aid package conflict in the darfur region of sudan and accelerated afghan reconstruction efforts pushed b udget function 150 to its highest level excluding iraq since fy1985 as overall budget pressures increased in the 109th congress and the unanticipated emergency to address the victims and destruction of hurricane katrina for the first time during the bush administration congress reduced by 21 billion or 64 the presidents regular foreign policy request subsequently however congress approved emergency s upplemental spending of 425 billion for iraq afghanistan and various humanit arian crises around the world at 3696 billion the international affa irs budget for fy2006 is one of the highest in three decades and is 21 higher than the annual

the previous year the largest increase in decade foreign policy resources declined steadily for six yearsfollowing the end of the cold war budget reduction pressures pus hed foreign policy and most federal resources down sh arply during the late 1980s large middle east and afri ca aid supplementals coupled with continued growth of s ecurity assistance pushed the fy1985 foreign policy budget to the highest level except for fy2004 over the 30 year period spending grew during the early 1980s largely due toincreasing security aid for central america and countries that granted the us military base access figure 1 international affairs spendinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33262crs8 international affairs budget as percent of total us discretionary funds another way of analyzing trends in international affairs resources is to draw relationships between foreig n policy spending and overall funding for total federal discretionary programs this is relevant especially for the present debate over budgetary prioritysetting decisions since it is within the roughly 840 billion non emergency discretionary budget for fy2006 th at international ffairs requirements must compete one of the most striking differences between measuring the international affairs budget as percent of total federal discretionary spending shown in figure 2 or as the level of total dollars appropriated figure 1 is the trend for each in recent years although the amount of spending for inte rnational activities s grown significantly since september 11 compared to changes in the overall size of the federal budget the share allocated for foreign policy programs has declined with the exception of fy2004 and the 1845 billion supplemental fo r iraq the estimated level for fy2006 is 341 the lowest level for any year in the last three decades and about oneeighth less than the 396 annual average since fy1977 if however the surge in spending for iraq in fy2004 is folded into the entire post911 period the annual average of the past four years quals the historic 396 average for the international affairs account this recent trend which is somewhat c ounterintuitive results from even larger increases in us government spending in noninternational sectors especially for defense homeland security and domestic di saster relief defe nse spending which accounted for roughly half the discretionary budget authority prior to 911 grew to more than 54 by fy2004 what the ited states now defines as homeland security spending category that did not exist prior to 911 has risen by about one third series of emergency supplem entals totaling about 821 billion for relief of hurricane katrina victims pus hed shares for other budget activities including function 150 down for fy2005 and fy2006 for the period prior to the terrorist attacks of september 11 the patterns in figures 1 and 2 for foreign policy spending are similar although the degree of sharp growth and decline are muted somewhat when measuring discretionary ba as of total budget authority one of the most notable trends is the substantial continuity in the amount of the budget authority devoted to international ffairs during an eight year period fy1988 to fy1995 although dollar amounts for foreign affairs may have risen somewhat in fy1991 due to th gulf war and fallen through the next four years function 150s pr oportion of total discretionary budget authority deviated only slightly from sustained level of 4 nnually in short even though the foreign policy budget fell steadily in the early to mid1990s it declined at roughly the same pace as the total for all other programs f unded through discretionary spending but in fy1996 this 4 share that had been stained for eight years ended and function 150s proportion fell to 363 in fy1997 and fy1998 it fell further to about 36 of discretionary ba thus at time when congress and the president had reduced total discretionary budget au thority resources for foreig n policy programs declined faster than other federal programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33262 crs9 note unless otherwise stated figures are expressed in constant fy2006 dollarskey trends the fy2006 foreign policy budgets share of total federaldiscretionary budget author ity is 341 substantially smaller than the 30 year annual average of 396 including the iraq reconstruction supplemental the fy2004 554 share of total spending was the largest for budget function 150 in three decades despite the significant increases in foreign policy resources since september 11 except for fy 2004 the share of function 150 of total us di scretionary spending has declined this is largely due to more rapid rise in defense and homeland security appr opriations and in fy2005 and fy2006 relief for victims of hurricane katrina with the exception of the years following two large spikes associated with the camp davidmiddle east peace accord fy1979 and iraq r econstruction fy2004 the singleyear cut for foreign policy spending of

reconstruction initiatives in afghanistan and iraq plus more gene ral assistance to countries supporting us efforts in the global war on terror have pushed foreign aid spending levels up significantly

anticipated to grow to 5 billion annual program c oncentrating on countries th at have performed well on governance economic and social meas ures combined with responses to unanticipated international

terms stood 54 below levels of decade earlier the first term of the reagan administration saw steady large increase in foreign aid spending culminating in fy1985 when resources reached 33 billion the third highest single year level in the past three decades growth occurred not because of policy consensus over the importance of foreign assistance but rather because of significant policy differences between the executive and legislative branches early in the reagan administration officials ttempted to reduce multilateral development contributions while at the same time increasing strategic types of foreign assistance congress blocked efforts to cut multila teral and other economic aid but also approved much of the funds sought by th executive for security assistance programs in central america and aid to countries that provided us access to military bases the peak year of fy1985 included large supplemental package for israel egypt and jordan payment of arrears owed to the world bank

spendinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33262crs20 8 accounting for military assistance uses different methodology than found elsewhere in this report while other budget trends are expressed in terms of discretionary budget authority military aid figures are expressed as total program size this is because at times during the past 30 years and especially in the 1970s and 1980s the united states provided large amounts of military support in the forms of marketrate loans rather than as grants or subsidized loans budgeting methods for milita ry loans have changed several times in the past three decades at times requiring appropria tions to equal the total face value of the loans yet in other years only requiring congress to provide as little as 10 of the face value of the loans by using figures for the tota l volume of military aid provided regardless of the budget rules that may have applied at th time allows for more consistent trend analysis current military assistance programs include foreign military financing fmf international military education and training imet and peacekeeping operations each managed by the state department for the mo st part the state department controls the funds and sets program policy while the defense department implements the activities military assistance8 through its military assistance programs the united states provides friends and allies with defense equipm ent and training as well as contributing to nonun peacekeeping operations although low by historical trends military aid budgets during the postseptember 11 period have been higher than at any time since the end of the cold war nevertheless amounts for fy2006 49 billion are nearly 30 less than the annual average since fy1977 military assistance spending in fy2005 and fy2006 would have been significantly higher if not for an admin istration decision backed by congress to fund with defense department resources 11 billion in prog rams to train and equip afghan and iraqi security forces in the previous three fiscal years such activities had been financed through the foreign military financing fmf program and the iraq relief and reconstruction fund i rrf both of which fall within the international affairs budget function although this represents substantial shift from traditional state department po licy and budgetary authority over military assistance the administration says that it intends to continue this financing structure in future years levels of military assistance declined steadily in the period following the end of the cold war as the united states ende d most defense support to countries other than israel egypt and few east europ eanformer soviet states this reduction however had actually begun in fy1987 when countries such as spain and south korea graduated as military aid recipients the early part of the 1980s witnessed steady increase in military assistance which became primary tool for advancing the reagan doctrine policy of supporting anticommunist insurgents around the world this included sharp rise in military support to sa lvador and honduras in ce ntral america to the philippines and other nations providing the united states access to overseas military bases and to pakistan frontline state on the border w ith sovietoccupied afghanistanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33262crs21 since the signing of the camp davi d peace accord in 1978 promoting middle east peace has been cornerstone of us military assistance in fy1979 military aid reached its 30 year peak of 152 billion in real terms largely because of substantial military support package offered to israel and egypt as part of the negotiations from that point these two countries have accounted for roughly two thirds of total us military assistancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33262 crs22 key trends even more so than politicalsecurityrelated economic assistance military aid focuses on countries and international in itiatives of strategic importance to the united states the military aid budget for fy2006 at 49billion is the sixth lowest spending level in the past three decades it falls nearly 30 below the annual average for this period significant factor as to why military assistancehas not been higher in the post911 period and especially for fy2005 and fy2006 is the administrations decision to shift funds to train and equip security forces in iraq and afghanistan from the international affairs budget to the defense budget in these two years congress appropriated 11 billion for such purposes managed by the defense department which in pr evious years had been funded under state partment accounts military assistance spending in fy2003 and fy2004 was the highest since the end of the cold war during the first term

merged into the state department in fy1999 prior to that point usia operating expenses had been part of the foreign information and exchanges category but since the consolidation these resources are
