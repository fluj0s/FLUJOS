the pe course lecture given on 1 september 1964 all right then this is the what audience first of september one sept ad 14 saint hill special briefing course 1 september well the research department slipped i dont see any lecture lying here on the desk in front of to be read calmly i dont know what to talk to you about today you know everything there is to know and some of it true some of it not so true ive been recently sorting out pe and id better give you bit of talk about it and i wont say this whole lectures about it but ill just give you few thoughts in passing here and i found out some interesting data out of the field of study that particularly relates to pe it naturally follows that if all of the students who come to pe course are given incomprehensible words they will then go away and that will be that and i think that is really the sole and total loss of new people into pes thats just all there is to it i mean its simple little package that you can put red frame around and hang it up on the wall in the pe instructors office or across from your own desk and youd have it made youre going to think there are lots of reasons but that is the reason why you start in on monday with fifteen people and wind up on friday with two people you see or people its just to the degree that you have not found or used or given them words they didnt understand its as simple as that that we should learn this with all of our technology and numerous nomenclature in scientology is quite fabulous but it just shows that im laying foundation for being an honest man selfcriticism is virtue and we have done this rather consistently and i now find out that it is glaring and terrible error only it is not an error necessarily in our framework it is an error in general in the whole field of study now what does thiswhat does this bring about here now this brings about datum that you would not expect to find in lecture on pe course because im not lecturing to pe students it says what has been discovered here is the prior act to the overt this gives you brandnew piece of that very very important thing called an overtmotivator sequence the overtwithhold sequence all of that data is suddenly illuminated before there is an overt there is noncomprehend anytime you find an overt youll find noncomprehend preceded it its preceded so its as elementary as that so an overt sequence goes in exactly this fashion noncomprehend and its commonest most usual form is simply misunderstood worda noncomprehend that can usually be traced to misunderstood word so youre going to get into some sequence thats something like this misunderstood word noncomprehend belief that its okay to commit an overt commission of the overt the withhold of the overt an attack or withdrawal now this can be in magnitude or this can be slight in other words youan overt sequence can go with exclamation points or it can go in light print you understand it can mount up to big overt it can mount to little overt but the final analysis of the thing is it amounts to blow or an attack its as simple as that its very elementary so we have new illumination of the overt sequence now we know this that when the auditor sits down and asks somebody for an overt act and the pc gives him critical thought the auditor thinks hes got an overt act and so buys it and so never gets the overt do you follow that that is common auditor error all right so lets trace it back from that error in session and lets see where we wind up the pc is asked for an overt act and gives critical thought he thought something critical all right the auditor that lets it sit there has not pulled the overt because that critical thought is symptom of an overt having been committed all right now lets back it up one and the auditor then says all right fine i heard you youve thought soandso very good now what overt have you committed the pc you see has not answered the auditing question hes been asked for committed overt and he has given critical thought and believe thats not an overt so we trace it back to that point of the overt and he dropped flatiron on the persons foot all right we pull that now that produces sufficiently salient result that we as practical practitioners in this particular field would be rather satisfied but interestingly enough that just prior to dropping the flatiron on somebodys foot theres noncomprehend and just prior to the noncomprehend theres misunderstood word so youll find that those four steps are present in any overt you find in any pc fascinating isnt it now lets examine something else lets examine something else here weve got situation where psychologist sits down in scientology course he cant learn actually im now giving you datum not criticism this is just data this has happened over and over and over they have the hardest time of anybody you ever had anything to do with they come in and one poor girl who was major in psychologyactually had her doctors degree sat in an academy course in the comm course for eight weeks and managed to get up to tr 1eight weekstr 1 so it is not criticism that im giving you here but actually just the plain bald data this has happened too often well lets look this over you say well scientology is so far afield and adrift from the things that she studiedlook how we can rationalize see just like an auditor sitting there sayingsaying this that and the other thing the auditor has given them the business on criticism you see ive had critical thought and so on well you get big rationalization and the auditor says of course thats very reasonable and then we do figurefigurefigure on how it is so reasonable and so forth well wereits disease known as reasonability can pull it in this one too there was real reason why that person sitting in that academy course couldnt learn and you couldnt have gotten it on abeing reasonable well of course of course because matter how reasonable you get you dont solve anything thats very important aboutto know about being reasonable about it all it really doesnt solve thing when youve got somebody who is totally civilized and totally this and total effete and totally gone and hes long wound up and so forth why his final stage is being reasonable about everything he cant do anything about anything but he can be reasonable and you fall into that trap see guys run over by truck see because the careless driver and the bad licensing in thein the traffic office and so forth so hes run over by truck and he lies under the truck wheels and is reasonable about why hes been run over by truck dont you see thatsits fascinating but this is sort of disease that civilized person gets into theyre reasonable about everything now because we can be so darn reasonable and say this psychology student of course is having trouble in scientology because its so different than the terminology and so forth they used in psychology that we wouldnt look for the real answer and the real answer is in the field of the associated subject this is all incidentally germane to pe but lot of other things its germane to too ah there have been subjects which have been associated which are associatable with scientology oh yes healing education religion psychology these things alwaysall have an associative point you see itstheyre related youre dealing with cousins and it didnt do any good being reasonable about this psychologist because it wouldnt have trained him we forget the end viewperson who cant make his goals anymore he can be reasonable all right well if you really find out what the score is with regard to this thing why he longer has to be reasonable he can do something about it psychology is an associated subject to scientology and you must assume that when that person sat down in the class and couldnt understand scientology that they never understood psychology and when youre trying to cure this person up and teach him scientology youre wasting your time because the misunderstood word is in psychology we dont care if they went through to the end product of degree and so forth in psychology this didnt guarantee anything because modern education does not require that one does anything or accomplish anything one simply is reasonable about the subject matter and can regurgitate it properly on an examination paper and one immediately gets his degree in other words practice or action is ever demanded the engineer does not have to build bridge before hes labeled bridge builder see thats that hole in education so they would never notice this the person could say the right words and give the right answers somehow or another and so he got labeled and so forth but this didnt mean that he understood the subject all right lets examine this field of psychology what is there to misunderstand in the field of psychology now were tracing this fellow down so he can understand himself some scientology see and wed have to go about it in processing session in this fashion and itd have to be processing i make that point you could never do this in training because this is auditing you can tell the fellow to do some certain things but realize youretell him to go back and look up the words in psychology which he didnt understand and look them up and find out what those are itll brighten him up oh yes but that would be assigning him selfauditing which is perfectly okay but remember youre assigning him auditing the second you depart from the immediate field on the clay table in training of the exact nomenclature the student is being taught you are into processing because you have departed from this when you get somebody to define the word memory in the academy you is doin wrong because that is not scientology technical word you understand the way you do clay table training is you take this word asis because its in an axiom you take this word scientology and you take this word engram you take this word facsimile you understand and you dont take such words as mind because thats general term not scientology particular term so in training somebody on clay table in scientology you would only take up the particular terms of scientology its just scientology and clay table training is entirely different than clay table processing clay table processing is done yes yes yes of course all right represent the object session see clay table training is make up the word scientology in clay maa maa maa maa so on and so on makes little blob and throws it down in the middle of the table and writes scientology on the top of it this is not an auditing session this is training session he hasnt got an auditor hes got coach and what does the coach say the coach says flunk flunk well i dont see why youre flunking and so forth i understand glob of clay is scientology and rrrrrr well nevertheless im flunking you all right why are you flunking look i dont understand how that represents scientology now lets go at it again the guyso on so on so on so on so on so on he finally makes something thats just test of whether or not the coach understands it coach finally understands it why he figures out the guy probably understands it so he says all right thats fine good thats not an auditing sessiontraining is mainly evaluation in training you tell the guy whats wrong with him in training you tell him what the definition isnot in auditing auditing is different approach we unfortunately are in two fields simultaneously see and were asking the same guy that trains to also audit occasionally well hes got to learn to shift his gears an auditor never sits there and when the pc has got his representation of soandso and soandso the auditor never says flunk the auditor says fine fine i dont quite understand that could you show little more tell little more about it and of course the thing shifts around the guy realizes he hasnt done it its different guiding principle entirely all right so teaching this psychologist what he missed in psychology by definition of clay table work is auditing because youve immediately departed the field of scientology you got that youre gone so youre into an auditing session youre on his backtrack see youre way over the hills and far away so if you havent got an auditing session going to handle this youre just going to lose him all right lets see what there is one is not capable of defining easily in psychology and wed audit this on the person we could assign it to him as selfauditing session butand you would in pe you just say well this guys natternatternatter all during the first day you know nyah nyah nyah nyah and youre teaching him and youre teaching him some fabulous thing like the definition of scientology and he just doesnt understand it and so on nyah nyah youve seen them in pe the right gear for the instructor is sir whatwhatwhat similar field have you studied to scientology oh uhwell uhi had three years in psychology very good well look couldcould we realize something here that actually itsyoure not having any difficulty with scientology youre having difficulty with psychology would you realize that please its pe course now course can assign auditing but it doesnt audit all right youve been in psychology very good all right now could we request could we please request that you look up some of the words in psychology which you did not understand and write them down on sheet of paper and go down to the local library and look the things up and see if you cant get that untangled and youll find out that handles it just like bang you can be very polite about it now for the minute can we lay that aside youve already told him it was psychology he was upset about can we lay that aside now and get on with scientology which is really different subject and youre not going to hear another word out of that boy youve assigned him selfauditing see which is make list of words you didnt understand and go and look them up see thats selfaudit but you can assign him that and youll find out that forcefully shuts him up and you longer have to contend in pe with the natterer that ends him this you do now when i say natterer i mean person whos just consistently uncomfortable who seems to be trying toyou can tell him they say well what does this have to do with theosophy well man ask yourself whatwhat good is it to know this point this point has validity it tells you that hes stuck in theosophy he hasnt understood telekinesis or something see hes flying around on cloud ten and id just take this boy who is busy nattering and wloowlffwlaa i cant and i thatsid just assign him that selfaudit see like that and the steps are very precise theyre not cloudyis what similar field to scientology have you been studying in the past and he says well i was in theosophy all right would you please realize that youre not really having any trouble understanding scientology obviously because i havent taught you any you must be having great deal of trouble with theosophy and would you make list of the words in theosophy which you did not understand and between now and the next time you come to class go down to the local library and look them up and get their definitions straight would you do that for please thank you very much are there any more questions thats precise action see that runs off brrrrrrphonograph recordwise and youll find out that just handles that right now all right now lets differentiate between that bird and the fellow who says scienscienscientology different time period recognize it as such this guy is dealing with term right here in the course which you are teaching hes dealing with that term right now and hes grappling with it and hes trying to understand it and the answer to that again is onetwothreefourjust like this you say now what word have i used sir on this course that you havent understood and he sits there and he thinks huh oh yeahyeah permissive yeah whats permissive you say all right its an english word it means without force without duress let him do as he pleases oh is that what it means all right very good all right now lets get back to scientology here and hell find out scientology yeah well thats scio yeah i got that you got it see thats different drill all you have to be able to differentiate is the difference between the bird who is saying nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah because he hasnt had time to gather this against scientology so it must be against some other target see and the bird who iswho is trying totrying to dig it the bird whos trying totrying totrying to dig it up one way or the other got it so theres two different reactions now actually theres third reaction theres third reaction thats very importantis the nodder hasnt got clue and is just going on you know yes yes yes and the instructor in pe always overlooks this person because this person causes trouble this person is the perfect student could probably put it all down on piece of paper again too or something but really hasnt clue now we get over this in pe by asking for written illustrations of the points made and this is the backflow which we should get so they keep sheet of paper and during the term of the instruction there periodically every time youve made big point something like this then they have to sit there for very few minutesdont make it too longand scribble down an illustration of that point taken from existence from real life and this lets them participate and backflow and at the end of that period of training that is to say the evening instruction at the end of the lecture and so forth you get that back you collect those papers and youll be able to spot the nodder because they could tell you almost verbatim sometimes what you said but to apply it or associate it to the real universe is quite beyond them and you dont have to look at those papers very thoroughly you just look them over for the reality of an example look at about the third example you have asked for if it bears any resemblance whatsoever theyre doing fine the nodder will give you one that bears resemblance particularly that deep into the hours of lecture it will bear resemblance youve given them big point here you see youve said that thetan is taken from the greek word theta which means thought and the greek word thetaout of the greek letter theta stood for the greeks for this thing thought now give an example from your experience of the word thought well worrying is good enough see so he writes down worrying or something like that well theyve got the idea you see the nodder will say being kind or will say something else thats how how all the instructor would have to do is how the devil does that exemplify it and then having gotten that clue out of it you examine two or three others and youve got this person cold youll find out that its just total unreality and they have not connected with something there somewhere theyre lost so you write on the paper give list of the words you have not understood since the course began and you take these when you get these words back and so forth you use that as your instructional or seminar type thing its the words they havent understood you simply redefine them you simply define them againyou take it up in other words you just go in very heavy on the subject of words you get the cycle here now the personall the students are asked to write down examples and at the end of each period of trainingsuch as an eveningyou collect all those papers with the students name and so forth on it you see and then the instructor all the instructor has to do with these things is glance them over rather rapidly to see whether or not those examples are applicable and have anything to do with it and if he finds anybody whose examples are just for the birds then when he hands the papers back why he gives special assignment to this person to write down all the words in the course which this person has not understood thats justthats your drill see thats the drillzzzzzzt now when you get that list back you use such lists as that you say when do you do this well you can actually skip night or two with it it doesnt matter because this persons going to come back because theyre waiting to hear about the rest of the assignment see and you take these words up youll find out that probably somebody else had hazy idea of them too and this means that pe course has one of these cracking great big unabridged twoton dictionaries dont teach pe course out of the bible teach it out of the dictionary and youll find out that thatll be very successful and you wont lose people all you have to be is alert to this one point it goes back to the first definition i gave you and these are just the ramifications of what you do when you run into it see be sure that every student understands every word hes given and your very very backward student has failed to understand similar subject the natterer the guy whos going to give you trouble and the person whos just having immediate trouble right here right now hes hung up on not the word he thinks hes hung up on hes hung up on word that happened just ahead of that word and youve got to point this up to him and hes got to give you what this is you understand ithes not necessarilyyou dont expyou can get into just endless upset by continuing to explain the word the student is asking about go ahead and explain it but dont get to running on treadmill on it because that isnt the word the student misunderstands so you and the student have gotten into gay minuet that had nothing to do with the ball because that student is hung up on this word because the student had an earlier word he didnt understand and thats why he cant get this word and he isnt mentioning the earlier word because he hasnt noticed he didnt understand it so youve got to point this point up do you see how this is taught then i notice some of you look little blank its actually pretty easy youve just got to be sure that you dont then ever get involved in one of these floor discussions with the pe course the natterer is going to cut the whole class to ribbons and distract all this attention the person who didnt understand this particular term that youre using or principle he probably goes over to an understanding he didnt understand this concept it is not concept he didnt understand it was word and hes going to talk and the instructor is going to ruin his vocal chords trying to explain this one concept or something to the student and the student doesnt understand it more and more and it gets more and more well it will get more and more involved because that isnt what the student misunderstood its something that happened just before that that the student misunderstood theres how you handle these various aspects and dont forget the nodder all right now you get pe course rolling along you just keep up this cycle and as long as youre just teaching them very straight highly defined scientology youre all right youre all set and you can just keep it rolling now i will make this comment about pe course what would you think of somebody who told you to come to course so that you could understand all about the automobile and of course you didnt know anything about an automobile youd really never seen one but youd heard dimly about automobiles and you thought this was kind of an interesting subject something that ran along the ground at tremendous speeds and youd like to know more about this thing and see ifthis fellow said he was going to teach you course and you were going to come in there and he was going to tell you all about this automobile and so you happily went over to this course and then he spent the next five nights telling you why you should know about this automobile how do you like that how good it was to know about automobiles or any other ramification the direct forte is of course to know about an automobile so in pe you teach them about scientology not how good scientology is or how bad scientology is or arrrghorso whether scientologys big or small or anything else you teach him just about scientology see and youre all set dont get into these other involved arguments look at this fellow whos going to teach you about the automobile and he gave you everything else but look at how happy you would be with course that was going to teach you all about the automobile you didnt know anything about an automobile you thought that was good thing so you go in the instructor says those are the front wheels front wheels they go aroundwheels see and they go around and they got tires on them and that travels over the ground and that cushions the shock and these are shock absorbers under here to keep the wheels from bouncing up the passenger too much and those are the back wheels and that is the bonnet and that is the hood see and were all set see and theres the engine and this is the steering wheel youd be perfectly happy about it you wouldnt even demand that he show you where the starter button was youhe could keep you all involved with this its just with thisthis is the automobile this is how it runs the engine goes around this way and it turns the wheels around that way and theres gears in there and here are the way the gears go and so forth and youd be very happy with that course man and hed say that guy sure teaches you about automobiles now he says now if you come back next week ill show you how to drive one brother youd be there and when you arrive for the course about how to drive one he says this is the starter button this is the ignition key theres the brakes heres the way you work the brakes now get in there and work the brakes good turn on the ignition key on and off good work the brakes good turn the steering wheel good work the brakes youd leave after some kind ofthe first night or two of that kind of training boy youd be pleased as punch youd say boy right down thereknow their business down there on the subject of automobiles next week next week im going to get ride in one dont you see right direct on the subject right on the groove see now that has tremendous liability to teach course like that because look youre handing them nomenclature all the time all the time all the time and its terrible not to have nomenclature instead of cursing your scientology nomenclature because of its numerousness just thank god that you dont have to stand there tonguetied now how are you going to teach fellow about automobiles if there is word front wheel well if you had nomenclature for an automobile and youre going to teach somebody about automobiles you couldnt teach them any nomenclature and they could never communicate on the subject of automobiles theres got to be nomenclature but theyve got to start out learning the language of an automobile and although they were being taught all about an automobile theyre actually in that first jumpoff being taught the language of the automobile now youif you were teaching automobiles that way to bunch of people that had never seen them or had much to do with them and so forth if you could figure yourself down in the middle of the congo or something like that and you were going to run this course on automobiles and so on actually youve just about got it taped because there you sit with an advanced technology that this civilization knows not what of or any part of it and its falling into problems consistently and youre just all the samein the middle of the congo and youre going to tell people its very nice to know about the mind hell they know that they know all about that what about the mind well it has parts it runs on various rules first place youre not specializing in the mind youre teaching them about the universe and youre teaching them about being in the universe and theres body and theres walls and theres the planet and theres the sky and heres being who lives in the midst of all this and we call him thetan see and we just tape it see and never let him miss definition and youve got pe course there that well i taught pe course like this one time and i taught it sufficiently well that eighteen psychiatrists attended the first lecture which was repetitive in other words i always gave the first lecture again every night and then gave an advanced lecture in another room there werent nobody being charged in the other room but there were new people coming along all the time so id keep giving the first lecture i always gave the first lecture im not advising you to do this it was just freak of the situation and then id give the people who had heard the first lecture the remaining lectures and we had quite few people there but amongst them there were eighteen psychiatristsnineteen and they came to nothing but the first lecture and they were some of the leading names in psychiatry and they turned up just as regular as clock every night man to hear that first lecture all over again and they sat there nodding nodding trying to figure it out and one of them finally got into action on the subject he took dangerous schizophrenic and put him back into childhood using dianetic techniques and then instantly realized that we really had something in dianetics so with the person returned on the track psychoanalyzed him told him now you know why you hate your fatherhe didnt change your diaper of course i wouldnt say they had absorbed very much butbut the funny part of it was is its simplicity that holds people its terrible simplicity people do not like totally new subject they like the familiarity of the old and that isnt just because were in england talking about english jokes english jokes are partially nostalgia its goodwas abeen good joke for long time hes glad to hear it again see but you get the idea yeah i was looking at an old pal of ours frankie howerd on the tv the other nighthe told the same jokes i actually was very happy to sit there watching him tell the same jokes you know hes the bird that has the aged pianist who is hard of hearing and he makes cracks to the audience about his aged pianist and she once in while will comment to him that its chilly in there and he will turn around and say yes chilly poor old soandso all very 11 type of act see well hes been doing that just for years and years and years and years and hes headliner and i dont think hes had new joke or new line in all those times trouble with an american comedian he knocks himself out all the time thats why he passes into oblivion toohe never develops nostalgia now heres an interesting point then as long as youre teaching somebody absolusomething absolutely new theyre going to feel like theyre in totally strange territory all the time all the time and therefore its very very strange to them my apologies for the crack about english humor i can always make the english laugh i have trouble with english humor ive learned to wait now the public goes for and likes the old and what they like to see occasionally is just little bit of improvement they like to see little bit of improvement on this old subject they dont like new subjects so youd better represent scientology as what it is which is the only conservative study in the field of the mind truth of the matter is when you look it over very carefully lot of things happened before i get too far ahead of my story let melet give you what happens to these students who dontlet melet get that in because i might forget to tell you the student that you dont handle as ive just described to you in pe will get the misunderstoodlook at the cycle they runsee the misunderstood word the misunderstood concept then they go into either the critical thought or the overt and they will commit an overt against scientology and it gets all right to commit an overt against scientology because thats the cycle they have to justify not having understood and that is what this is all about it must be strange and they have to justify not having understood it and so they commit an overt against it shows that its good do you see so itstheyll rig it that way in spite of anything you can do and then they go out and give you bad public presence the second they dont understand that first wordthe first word they dont understand is liable to start this cycle so that is what you prevent if you just prevent that all up on the line and they all go away feeling fine and everythings happy and so forth and furthermore youre doing more honest job and youre showing them exactly what they came in to find outthat you know the answer so you can do it and lets see why psychology got off to bad start and this hooks in with what i was just giving you now scientology is the conservative study it is the traditional study it follows the traditional patterns of philosophy religion and the mind it may be one of the reasons why your own interest in it is deepseated because you recognize in it the familiarities of ancient greece you recognize in it the philosophy of rome the philosophies of the middle ages the work of saint thomas aquinasall of this material as you roll on forwardfaculty psychology youd feel very comfortable in amongst the big religious universities of 1500 1550 with the faculty psychologistthats the psychology of the faculties of the senses and perceptions faculty used in the line of sense and perception youd feel very comfortable with these boys youd be talking about the same things only youd have answers to what they didnt have answers for and boy they would fall around your neck like mad because youd be talking the familiar to them theyre talking about such things as attention theyre talking about such things as seeing theyre talking about such things as hearing the faculties you see and theyre talking about these things and how they relate to thingsand sort of foggily and of course you could say to them why gentlemen youre talking about communication youre talking about communication between the individual and the physical universe around him or to other individuals through the medium of the physical universe and therefore sight and sound and so forth are means of communication with the physical universe or with other people through the physical universe and they would say holy smothering godfrey gadzooks by jove the chaps right you know thats true never realized that one person was ooowa and thats what perception is and thats what sound is and so forth its method of communication and you would have been right there brother but you cant talk to psychologist about this do you know why you cant oh the answer is absolutely fascinating there isnt anybody there there isnt anybody there the whole universe and the people in it are sort of delusion of machinery in the absence of sensation and association there is perception thats stable datum in the field of psychology of circa 196064 i know ive given you that and youve glanced over the top of it and youve said well and so on the psychologists so i dont have to understand it i invite you to understand this perception depends completely upon sensation and association and after youve looked that over for little while you begin to feel sort of creepy as though somebody had walked over your grave because that tells you volume it says machine in the absence of somebody tickling its gears and in absence of certain gears meshing with certain gears is incapable of noticing anything is happening you see perception depends upon sensation and association and that is the psychologists definition of perception now of course you look at that as scientologist and you say what the devil is going on here you mean ive got to have association between wfff and zfff before i can see blap that is not true that is not true but machineit would be true machine would have to have little cogwheels that wizzergood with the cogwheels in order to tell you that the wizzergoo was on the other side of the wazzergoo and therefore it should take some notice knowledge is totally evolved out of the results of perception but is individually evolved by sort of funny computer that then tells person what to perceive by the time youve drawn this up on drawing board youve got machine and theres nobody there you get what im talking about dont you i knowiif you dont grasp it dont blame yourself because i frankly the other night spent over an hour looking at the words out of text written by one of the leading godhelpus psychologist whoof the united stateson his definition of perception and it was that sensation with association brings about perception and that was what perception was and i looked at this and i looked at it and i looked at it and i finally understood the frame of reference on which he was viewing this thing and hes viewing it on the basis you have to understand that psychologist considers that everybody is brain piece of meat see which vanishes with death and so forth you have to understand all of these peculiar things and then you understand what the devil this means it means that once youve tickled the gears of the machine in some fashion or other and showed them which gears was being tickled why then it perceives whats ticking see it looks in that direction but wouldnt otherwise of course this absolutely violates your own concept of yourself you say before i can look at field of id have to receivehave received sensation from the field of and associated it with my childhood well the reason you dont understand it easily is because you wouldnt think of yourself as machine and naturally machinethink of rolling robot out there now now you roll robot out there and of course field of itd have to have some kind of an associative memory situation see its got sensation of heat waves and some kind of sensation of pattern and that brings it up and so forthand then the memory sorts out as the eons race around and it finally associates this with fields and then with and then it says ah field of and this to the psychologist is man well why does he think this way because hes wildeyed radical he is the revolutionary hes the johnnycomelately fifteen hundred and fifty you would have been perfectly understood by the faculty psychologist in any great university of the world he would have made much out of you man he would have had you out for tea and invited you to theto the local hop and made much out of the situation you walk into modern classroom of today and you say perception is engaged upon by the being himself as means of communication with the universe around him and other beings theyd throw you out on your head what do you mean you have introduced volition youve introduced volitional and nonvolitional acts to use couple of fancy words acts that are willed acts that are not willed you have set up an individual as seeing what he wants to see and not seeing what he doesnt want to see you have set up the whole mechanism of power of choice and you have set up the dignity of the individual and that they want nothing to do with because they of course in not understanding man have gone the route of the overt and thats why psychiatry cuts out brains theyve got to make nothing out of man because they havent understood him and that is the whole genus of it those poor luckless boobs and what word does it go back to it goes back to the word psychology im now quoting man im quoting the leading psychologist textbook writers and they define psychology as psyche once meant the soulology means study we do not know what the psych or psyche is we have idea we dont even know if it exists and that is the definition of psychology you mean were going to take off from anyplace then and go anywhere brother were going to go straight into an overt against the mind and that is where those birds went so theyve got to sell man short and there isnt one of those birds who isnt in the frame of mind of man they are the frauds they know its swindle theyre arc broke with their own subject they know their subject doesnt work us men together if we band together right and hold ourselves up high enough and sneer enough at anything else well eventually be able to triumph over these poor boobs those are hard words but im afraid that is the dominating idea if youve talked to these birds as much as i havei had an awful hard time understanding where comes this idea of this contempt wheres this terrible contempt i see whats the genus of this thing what are these odd and peculiar ideas about man the degrading aspect of them and so forth this worried frankly because theyre dominating thought in the universities and schools of the world today theyre teaching everybody mans good hes just machine well naturally your leaders of the world have got to have some kind of philosophy of this character they think look how dangerous this philosophy is however if you just ordered thirty million men killed you want philosophy that teaches you men are good hmmmm youve got to justify that overt man if youre busy firing people and ruining people all over the place why naturally youve got to have some kind of demon that stands alongside of you and says its perfectly all right theyre good perfectly all right theyre good and they found their perfect demon in psychology and psychiatry man is good hes ninetyseven percentcents worth of chemicals there is dignity of the individual the man has power of choice he has none of these things hes not capable of personal volition hes just machine you push button with your modern advertising he whirrsclicks reaches into his pocket and pulls out the sixpence and its perfectly all right to pull out the sixpence completely illegally and fraudulently because actually hes good and thats where you have to have philosophy you have to have philosophy that man is good in order to go on committing overts so it isnt that man has degraded its that mans mental subjects first didnt bother to understand anything about man and so then began to commit overts and then employment was found for these blokes by fellows who had to have their overts justified and naturally the guys who had to have their overts justifiedthe hitlers the other guys the stalins the birds that have really backed up this particular field of psychologynaturally these birds are going to put those fellows in the drivers seat and so theres where the degradation of man comes from actually man is not more degraded than he was before hes only degraded the mental sciences because he has departed from the traditional which had to do with the dignity of man and youre in the tradition it sounds wild ive studied this very carefully its not some new pitch im giving you our teachings and facts would have been revelatory straight through from the ancient medicine man through the wise man of persia through the philosophers of greece in the days of the first universities and so forththat you called such around 1200 ad through all the great periods of the renaissance and so forth the ideas which we are moving along with and havemake mistake about itenormously improved and clarified are nevertheless those ideas they had to do with attention they had to do with perception they had to do with power of choice they had to do with the dignity of man they had to do with the motivation of behavior all of these things and not on vicious basis of how rotten and wicked everybody is and how they all ought to be shot down in their tracks but just whats this all about and we are to marked degree preserving the dignity of man and were carrying forward on basic tradition which has come up through the ages but in 1879 in bavaria leipzig university fellow by the name of wundt must have fallen asleep in too damn many classes and he missed the boat and there are too many words he didnt dig so he had to figure out that men were animals and thats exactly what he figured out men were animals and he advanced this as philosophy as recently as 1879 completely departing madly departing from every traditional level of study there was in this field and this was carried forward with great enthusiasm by the early russian student in this field and which culminated in pavlov criticism of the russian circa 400 ad is that they made very good fighters because they became quite merciless and wereassociated man with animals and to them everything was animalistic and therefore they could drive forward in an animalistic fashion they thought of man as being animals they thought of animals as being animals they lived amongst animals and so therefore their cavalry was pretty good and pretty vicious and so forth these are commentaries on russians moving on forward same commentaries we hear occurring along about 1000 same commentaries around timur lenk around 1300 same commentaries around pavlov the dog hasnt changed his ears still flop yeah that pattern hadnt changed at all so pavlov and psychiatry rushed on the scene man is an animal man is lousy good we should kill everybody what you do with city is level it until pony will not even stumble being ridden at full gallop across its ruins whats the difference theres difference its out of the steppes straight on forward until now theyve always had the same idea that you could condition an animal that if you beat horse enough he would then do what he was supposed to do animal training pavlov difference he just carried forward the russian tradition for animal training only this my god somebody accepts as study of the human mind somebody must be in an awful need of justification for their overts you see it was always there to be bought you always had the idea there that men were beasts and so forth the idea was always there to be purchased by anybody who wanted to purchase it but its interesting that it didnt get purchased until after 1879 those are all johnnycomelately you see the point im trying to make here well now i dont thinki dont think thegermans are okay i use their rolleis continuously with great success and i wish theyd stay just building cameras and things like that but the german has enviable reputation for humanitarianism i will say he has contributed music to the world and thats dandy but if hed just stayed with music and cameras wed all be lot better off every once in while he gets careless with guns and for some reason or other hes got to go out and kill everybody for reasons best known to him and he authored modern psychology modern psychiatry was authored by the russian and modern psychology was authored by the german and by nobody else dont let anybody kid you thats exactly where they came from you should read russian textbook on the subject of psychiatry and every technique they know of in psychiatry is in russian textbook today i will tell you that when the czar went on the skids and lost his head it was very interesting that the revolution began to frown on psychiatry it was only stalin and his fascist impulses and so forth which kept it going any length of time at all and we have the completely weird subject of the russian now having lived through all of these cycles of what we call modern psychiatry and now having nothing to do with it so heres all the western psychiatrists that come in you know with their hands dripping with blood to this conference up in london the other day and the russians standing around and saying but we dont operate on peoples prefrontal lobes anymore but we dont give them electric shocks anymore but we dont use these treatments anymore because we found out they were ineffective we dont do this anymore were good boys now and so forth and the western psychiatrist saying whats the matter with you jerks you know whats the matter with you guys well whats the matter with these birds these birds are now in reform cycle too many overts but thats where it came from pavlovian psychiatric responses theres more to psychiatry than just pavlov of course but not much and thats radical school those are both radical schools you heard say these things before but ive never put it to you from the point of view that these are radical schools relatively uncivilized rather degraded and very new and they have not been productive of results and my point of view is i think we should return to more traditional methods i think these fellows have had their chancetheyve had their revolution and they didnt get anyplace with it and i dont think that they should be permitted to stand in the road of traditional study in the field of philosophy or religion or psychology of the field of the mind and i dont even think they ought to be left with the word psychology because they cant define it i think in actual fact that psychology is portion of scientology and i see reason to give psychology modernistic razzledazzle modrocker spelling like psycology i should think it should be spelled properly which is psycheology psychology put the back in it of course psyche means spirit and is the greek symbol for spirit i dont know why we have sudden psych i dont know what this thing called psych that suddenly arose that occurs in both psychiatry and psychology because it doesnt mean anything and it never has meant anything and they dont think it means anything so forget it skip it of course we should return it to more proper state in other words the familiar and the old is really what were studying somebody comes in to learn about the mind you say very good were glad that you came in to learn about the mind the whole field of the mind embraces of course the other fields of knowledge and the field of philosophy and that sort of thing the field of philosophy religion and so forth and study of the mind is actually not too disassociated from study of human spirit and were glad youve come over here to study this because were happy that people take interest in more traditional and conservative ways and were happy to have people studying the more standard psychology and you came here to learn about psychology well you came to the right place now this is body and this is the physical universe and you are an individual you got the idea and the eyes see the ears hear see you teach them about the automobile now why do the eyes see well they dont see because somebody is machine they see because theres something there to be perceived now the eyes can actually see by somebody putting something there to be perceived as well as something being there to be perceived for instance you simplywe dont now see this black crayon and we put it there to be perceived now you think of cat very good now some of you got picture of cat well you saw the cat didnt you well we wont worry about whether or not you saw that with the eyes or not because it reallyit isnt absolutely necessary to have eyes to see in other words you see what kind of pe you could conduct that would look little bit different wouldnt it it wouldnt be heres this great brandnew subject and its all different and so forth and these conservative fellows who are there in the university and so forth those are the fellows who are actually the authorities in the field and so on and were new were brandnew and were doing something very very strange and were doing something very very peculiar and these fellows object to us and theyre just bunch of bums really see thatsthis is different course this is different course it says well were very glad you have come to the people who know about these things and were very glad that you have resumed traditional study of this particular thing and are having done with radical approaches which have not resulted in any good effects and you want to study the field of scientology of course thats composed of philosophy and religion psychology what makes men do what they do why men act the way they act what life is all about and youve come to the right place well of course you shouldnt mind being taught old answers along with new answers and theres great deal in scientology that is new but the breakthrough is all in the traditional field its not radical breakthrough where does that leave psychology where does that leave old man wissergoo with the eighteen letters after his name as the head of the department of psyrology of chicago university or illinois university whats thatwheres that leave him it leaves him in gibbering fit thats where it leaves him well hubbards done it again this does about enough now were part of scientology you know what that hubbards done he said were part of scientology isnt that terrible and the public at large says well really are they because theyre all reasonable and this is the way the wheel is going to turn and the wheel has already begun its slow inexorable spin they are about to become more radical element of scientology and were about to become the conservatives and theyre about to become the revolutionaries theyre the johnnycomelatelys the cowboys in the black hat and were the old homesteaders been there long time and theyll give us all the propaganda we want to drive this point home because it will outrage them to such degree that every time they pick it up or hear it they will go into complete scream they will help us in every university they will help us theyll explain to all of their classes hubbard is crazy because he says actually scientology is very broad subject that psychology is just part of hahaha none of the students are laughing student can understand radical offshoot or johnnycomelately type of an approach that says all men are animals oh yeah thatsyeah we understand that thats german protocol see and the professor starts gibbering because he doesnt really dig how he would feather the wing straight in our direction he couldnt serve us better than the way they will serve us yes hubbard has gone to the last straw now hubbard has gone to the absolute last straw thats thethats the end thats it now we are all part of scientology and very small part of it at that i can hear them now at conference you know out in the anterooms they gibber you know about some of the things we do they have fits and so forth they aretheyre mad at us right now you know just for one reason actually just one real reason that theyre mad at us is everybody who is operating in ancharlatanism in the fieas charlatan in the field of the mind is calling himself scientologist these days they have not reached thethey have gone past the point of saying you see now that we are bums theyre saying the reason were bad is because other people can call themselves scientologists other people who are bad can call themselves scientologists you get this well thatsthe american medical association journal has made that rather astonishing remark very recently well they know that man is good because they cant do anything for him an auditor who would have hard time with people might wind up in this direction you could ask why more auditors dont wind up embittered and mean and vicious and so forth but they dont so we must not have done too bad job amongst ourselves in defining the parts of the mind and existence and the various words which are associated with it we couldnt have done too bad job amongst ourselves because theres so many of us still here and theres so many of us that have kindly attitude toward man and so many of us thatsstill capable of understanding so we couldnt have done very bad job dont you see proves itself but because we are capable of understanding and capable of making sense out of the problem and capable basically of doing something about these various things we of course are in the favored position and we dont really need to do anything very strange to make capital out of that favored position were in the favored position of the people who know how to do something about it you see were in the favored position knowing our business well knowing our business we of course would win over somebody that was just fake and didnt know his business and didnt even know what his subject name meant see this is very easy well the wheel is going to turn anyhow the fun i get out of life is just making it turn now and then little faster i remember learning how to drive jaguar you always take the jaguar down the road you never let the jaguar take you down the road and then you can drive jaguar if you want to ruin your driving sometime why just try that just go out and practice taking the car down the road takeyou take it around corners you take it up the highway you take it here there and everyplace and its very fascinating your driving goes all to pieces because the machinery starts breaking up dont you see its now im going to turn this corner yes and i turn the corner you know and all right now were holding it on the straight now just go straight you know hrrmmm just straight all right now were going to stop yes and so on and all of sudden your machinery goes whoooo i wouldnt try it in an exciting driving situation but after youve done it for few days your driving improves enormously and all of sudden you realize that for years the car has been taking you everywhere and all of sudden you have completely happy attitude toward cars and things your whole driving aspect will change so i dont like to just sit and watch the wheel take us someplace dont you see i like to also coax the wheel along well therealthough thats very technical dissertation which ive given you along the line of pe you wonder why i injected psychology and psychiatry into it to the degree i shouldi probably should make my point with great clarity there for people who are coming in to your pe and so forth have to some degree been reached or indoctrinated by this other field but are already dissatisfied by it and you dont have to curse very hard but you have to know the relationship of psychiatry and psychology to the field of the mind and to the history of the mind and their relationship is not different than i have told you their relationship is very exactly what i have told you this isnt just my idea of it but they have given another facade they have given the facade of we are the authorities and we are the conservatives and we are the big boys in this particular field theyre lot of fakes theyre not theyre johnnycomelatelys that are following very very radical line of thought calculated to degrade man so when your people come in for pe they are actually looking for something which is more relaxed less degrading which is better calculated to bring about happy frame of mind toward existence and your best way of handling it of course is just tell them oh you want to know about philosophy and religion and the mind and that sort of thing psychology well we teach it here youve come to the right place and here is your first lesson and the best you would do about psychology or psychiatry or something like that is explain occasionally to the student patiently perhaps even little sadly that there is long tradition in the field of the mind which culminated with scientology and that it is the longer more conservative tradition and there have been new discoveries in this tradition which revived it and these discoveries were rather terrific and theyre very interesting but they are discoveries in an old tradition they are not discoveries in new tradition and that the old has enormously improved improved enough to revive all over the place and so weve got something that amounts now to very good breakthrough and therefore we neednt go off into radical lines thats just cutting up peoples heads and that sort of thing sounds rather barbaric to us and discuss the relationship with the class just to that degree and from that particular viewpoint and you would find out theyd be with you all the way you see man is basically good you can do something about the situation people become better people when you handle their problems and aberrations all the various things which you know about scientology they all fit into this frame of reference scientology is not an effort to degrade man the student would very shortly recognize this and he wouldnt even have to have it pushed to him very hard by the very definitions and axioms and things like that which were being given to him he would recognize very clearly what he was looking at and then if you never let one of those pe people get away with misunderstood word then you have not started germ of revolution against man not against scientology but revolution against man himself disgust with man but more intimately to you disupset about scientology theyd just stay with you because you see their best reasons they would stay with you is there is something there to know we can do things you see theres all the good reasons why they should you see so the fact that they dont is really unreasonable and that unreasonability comes from the early word which is not defined and where fellow is incapable of studying scientology as subject or confronting ithe just comes around to mock it or something like thatyou must realize that that person has already been in trouble with another associated subject earlier and youve got to handle him then youve got to handle the fellow whonot get involved all the time with the fellow who doesnt understand what youre saying dont get involved with him to the degree that youre trying to explain what hes asking about all the time do it once explain to him once what yourewhat youre talking about explain to him carefully that doesnt handle it all right right away you know that there was an earlier word which he didnt understand and you ask him for that earlier word what word have i usedwhat word has been used here that you didnt understand and he says uhclay well what about clay well in kindergarten they called it plasticine and clays different this is messed up see because uhclaywhy do you say clay well theres pat explanation for that too plasticine is trademarked word which you would be forbidden to use if you did use it but clay will always be with us and many substitutes for clay will come and go so we just use the basic word all right this clarifies it for him and he says cheers ohuhthats the way it is all right cheers see lets go on with it see but youll always find the fellow who persistently cant understand what youre talking about you see you try to explain it to him and he cant grasp it and so forth well you could keep this up you see for the next halfhour of class time with production what youve got to find is the word he didnt understand just before that and handle that situation you will find that word explain that word and go on and then dont forget your nodder and catch that nodder with the writeback give us an example give us an example of what ive just told you then look over those papers and youll find the nodder sitting there but not clue and that person youll also lose eventually or overwhelm completely and the subject matter of pe is under development at this particular time and i cant give you the entire rundown of pe but i am giving you as much of the pe as i consider very solid ground and very solid form for pe at the present moment im not talking to you about what words to teach im just talking to you if they came there to learn about the field of the mind and the spirit and philosophy you jolly well better teach them about the mind and the field and philosophy and not tell them why they should know about the mind and the field and philosophy cause they already decided that so you just go ratatattat ratatattat and if you treated the pe as an area where they learned the language and they learned the parts of things and they learned the nomenclature of things and they learned what was there these are all the same things dont you see you cant show fellow front wheel and say the word of this is front wheel with also showing him the fact that there was front wheel there see you know hes got to have appreciated the existence of the front wheel as well as the definition of the words front wheel so you get these two things in good balance and all of sudden these people will come up smiling and believe this is very successful line of teaching because there are many peopleread some of the earlier texts on dianetics and scientology understood them with great clarity and recovered in some cases from very serious illnesses just by clarification of existence so if your end product there in the pe was clarification of existence by the demonstration and teaching them nomenclature in new language so they could talk along this line if that was all you succeeded in doing providing you left not one student with word improperly defined then you would have succeeded all the way and your batting average would be not 10 percent or 5 percent in pe in organizations and in private practices but it would be much closer to 98 percent thered be the lady who fell off the bridge and broke her leg and couldnt come back to the pe course she would happen every once in while butso it couldnt be 100 percent but it could be awfully closebe awfully close to 100 percent it would wind up at the end of that week with you now any pe that you have ever run or any course you have ever run or any series of talks you have ever given that found less people attending than attended the first night is assignable not to your diction not to whether you wore blue dress or green one not to whether or not the surroundings were easy to reach and attractive all of these things are beside the point the people that didnt wind up with you the second night missed word they didnt get the word they missed word thats all they missed something they heard thisthey heard this word overt acts and they couldnt get it and they didnt hear it and they did hear it but they didnt hear it and they dont know what this thing is and they just dont wrap their wits around it and they dont come back the next night but now because they havent misunderstoodthey havent understoodthey havent gotten this word you see now they dont understand the subject and not understanding the subject its perfectly all right for them to perform overt acts against scientology and if theres any hostility against scientology in the world its derived from that point see so we therefore are actually building our own opposition to this degree ive just given your orders for america on the subject of dont leave anybody over there who has any words misdefined on the subject of scientology and thats your campaign and youll find out thats going to make big difference but those are the concentrations and the points of pe and thats what kind of course theyre attending theyre attending itrather traditional course that has great many new developments in an old and conservative line you know theyre taking course at rolls royce now they could go and get one of these twobit cutrate courses you know down there at alabama university but well its much better that they came to you more traditional longer harder but more traditional you have to be able to confront better to take course like this you see you cant dodge around the back of the thing and say well we dont know what the word scientology means uhwe dont know what that is and uhhowever were going to teach you about the left foot and were going to teach you pedagogy mixed up slightly with pediatrics and then if we have any time left at the end of the week and so forth why well get into pedantics well of course the poor student who has enrolled and has got to have degree and career at the end of the line and so forth has choice he cant walk out of university but thats what makes it different from your pe course you see they can walk out of your pe course if they dont like it they cant walk out of university so actually what they do is force people to go ahead and study these subjects through to the bitter end till theyre in such state of committing overts that nobody is safe with them i would just as soon open up lions cage and throw patient into it as i would to let them go near an institution anywhere in the world today you think it over at least it would be over with rather quickly in the lions cage but if you look at this as point of view or representation where the public is concerned and their first entrance course the pe i think you would find it extremely successful now youve looked on yourself as ruddy revolutionary yes youre revolutionary against the revolution you have been revolting against the revolution but we hadnt clearly recognized that we were revolting against revolution and it was revolution had occurred and it occurred in 1879 and that there was traditional course of study which was going on and in which discoveries could be made i entered back into that field my own training is very severely in the more traditional lines of philosophy its interesting that there isnt even degree did you know this there isnt even degree for psychology at least theyve been that cautious havent they theres only degree in philosophy and we are definitely in the field of philosophy this is more germane then to what the public wants to know they want to know how to live better lives they want to know what existence is all about so forth so teach straightforward course teach them all the definitions of these things teach them what existence is all about wind it up at the end theyll be very happy with you and very keen to get back next week because then they get to start the motor and youd have very very successful pe okay audience yes thank you very much audience thank you
