efficiently allo cated to states and localities additionally the conference report directs dhs to distribute grant funding in the same manner as fy2006 dhs is to ensure that terrorismfocused program funding is not to be directed to allhazard activities and dhs is to continue to evaluate shsgp letpp and uasi applications based on risk and on how effectively these grants will address identified state and local homeland security needs7 congress directs the government account ability office gao to report on the validity relevance reliability timeliness and availability of the risk factors and
