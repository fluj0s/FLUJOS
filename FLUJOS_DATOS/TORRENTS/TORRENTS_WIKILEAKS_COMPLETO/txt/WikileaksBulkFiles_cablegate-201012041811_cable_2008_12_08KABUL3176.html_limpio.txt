to afghanistan by secdef robert m gates classified by acting dcm valerie c fowler for reasons 14 b and d 1 c embassy kabul warmly welcomes your visit to afghanistan the overall state of the security situation here is more nuanced than the negative drumbeat coming from the media steady advances in success by coalition and afghan national security forces ansf do not grab the headlines that spectacular suicide attack does progress in development in support of balanced coin strategy continues below the radar screen those achievements however are hindered and ultimately threatened by poor performance on the governance front the fundamental challenge of governance 2 c karzai is at the center of the governance challenge he has failed to overcome his fundamental leadership deficiencies in decisiveness and in confidence to delegate authority to competent subordinates the result cycle of overworkfatigueindecision on the part of karzai and gridlock and sense of drift among senior officials on nearly all critical policy decisions 3 c karzai struggles with striking the correct balance between institutional and traditional ie tribal governance in fairness there are easy answers he has given notional nod to general mckiernans proposal to support formal agreements between afghan authorities and districtlevel councils the latter would be responsible for certain governance and security functions in their districts this proposal is aimed at ensuring freedom of travel along the ring road the lack of which undermines public confidence in the afghan government and in the international communitys efforts some questions remain on how to ensure district security arrangements do not create independent local militias 4 sbu independent directorate of local governance idlg director popal has earned and maintains karzais backing to improve subnational governance popal has launched the afghan social outreach program asop to form local councils separate from mckiernans plan to strengthen ties between subnational institutional government and the tribes we will be one of the largest donors to this new and ambitious plan providing 6 million for asop in three provinces elections 5 c next years presidential and provincial council elections will be the defining event for 2009 election factors already dominate nearly everything political here karzais popularity has fallen through the floor but the absence of credible opponent means it is still karzais election to lose public ill ease over personal not national insecurity and disgust over unconstrained corruption are karzais greatest vulnerabilities he installed hanif atmar as interior minister to turn up the heat on both problems atmar is talented and may turn around perceptions but after seven years of unmet expectations afghans will be hard to convince 6 c politicians and the kabul punditry are fascinated with the political jockeying between parliament and the independent election commission iec over the election date in the end we expect all will agree to the iecs proposal for an august vote based on security and logistical reasons 7 c more problematic is the insecurity in the south and east which is prompting some including karzai other pashtuns and some rcsouth partners to raise the specter of pashtun disenfranchisement and the possible illegitimacy of the vote it is much too early to judge the prospects of failure we and karzai agree the british are not up to the task of securing helmand but we also think the expected arrival of additional us combat brigades this spring and summer in tandem with the constant flow of newlyminted afghan troops to the field will provide an adequately secure environment for the election taliban reconciliation 8 c karzais seniorlevel taliban reconciliation initiative is more about strengthening his political base and his relationship with the saudis than anything else negotiations have been much less tangible in reality than is depicted in the press the public is split many welcome the promise whether real or not of reduced violence and instability via possible reconciliation with the taliban while others mainly nonpashtuns women and certain civil society groups fear karzai backroom deal that could harm their political interests or set back hardfought human rights advances we have advised karzai to negotiate from position of strength and to restate our shared red lines8 karzai and civilian casualties 9 c karzais recent heated public statements about bringing down nato aircraft and timelines for coalition withdrawal reflect both deep and heartfelt anger as well as certain amount of elections grandstanding civilian casualties anger him most general mckiernan has directed substantial changes to coalition tactics techniques and procedures ttps but those cannot eliminate the possibility of civilian casualties especially when the taliban has clearly adopted human shield tactics isaf and the embassy work increasingly more effectively with afghan counterparts on improved postincident response to affected communities and the media and investigations 10 c karzai hears of these efforts but is not mollified you can address his upset by acknowledging the problem and recognizing such mistakes hurt us all in the months since the shindand incident and specifically as response to civilian casualties the afghans have drafted technical framework agreement on security measures as means to exert greater control over coalition operations the ambassador told spanta that washington cannot take this up until after the new administration is in place point you should underscore with karzai steps to improve security 11 c the coalition and afghan security forces have increased our area of control and taken the fight to the taliban with increasing effectiveness the taliban response has been forced shift in tactics from insurgency to terrorism to challenge the will of afghans and the international community taliban acts of violence are highly visible and the immediate effect is that ordinary afghans do feel less safe with random violence particularly kidnappings on the rise and travel around the country more insecure atmar is countering by looking to accelerate reform of the police we are supporting him the focused district development fdd program to retrain and equip the police is going well and will broaden to include the border police nonetheless professionalizing the afghan national police anp and reforming the ministry of interior are ongoing challenges we also are working with the idlg nds and the ministry of defense to engage community support for security along the highways 12 c our greatest success on the security side is the advances in numbers and capabilities in the afghan army the army is the most trusted governmental entity and is currently leading more than 60 percent of joint military operations the international community recently agreed to support the expansion of the army force structure to 134000 which includes 12000troop trainee transient patient float army expansion will help meet future security requirements and take some of the pressure off of the police to conduct counterinsurgency operations the principal challenge for both the army and police training program is shortage of trainers either from the us or allied nations karzai recognizes and is grateful for the central role of us security assistance in developing the afghan security forces he will welcome reaffirmation of our support for eventual afghan selfsufficiency and independence in the security and law enforcement fields however the army will continue to depend for some years on coalition enablers such as close air support and intelligence assets survey of security in afghanistan by region 13 sbu rceast remains focused on balanced coin approach synchronizing operations to protect the populace and push the insurgents out while pursuing mutually reinforcing efforts in development and governance assistance the embassy usaid and cjtf101 are coordinating more closely than ever usg efforts in rceast the commanders emergency response program cerp funding is critical to delivering quick effective assistance projects which in coordination with usaid and local officials supports both locally identified needs and longer term development goals in rcsouth the number and lethality of ied attacks is up dramatically significantly in some areas the number of ieds reported by the public to ansf or isaf forces is also up reflecting public support for the government the approximately 2300 marines of the recently departed 24th meu carried out successful operations in the garmsir district in helmand the insertion of other us forces into the south could have positive impact on karzais confidence and quiet concerns about whether the presidential election can be safely held 14 sbu rcwest and rcnorth remain relatively quiet although rcwest has become less stable in the past few months rash of kidnappings in herat combined with series of insurgent attacks including at least one that upset public access to basic needs had resulted in widespread lack of confidence in local governance the giroa apparently recognized the danger of leaving this key region that borders iran and will eventually be linked to khaf iran by rail service open to growing insurgent movements and the appeal of parallel source of governance moi minister atmar has just sacked number of senior security officials in herat in response to this popular unrest afghanpak relations 15 s theres been sea change in bilateral ties since musharrafs exit karzai and zardari have warm relations which has spread to other parts of the bilateral civilianside relationship we also see promising signs of cooperation on the security side increased coordination and communication between the respective security forces along certain parts of the border and november meeting in islamabad between nds director saleh and isi director general pasha the two governments also convened largely symbolic but positive minijirga8 meeting in october continuing though reduced infiltration from the fata and the recent mumbai attacks have done little however to diminish afghanistans ongoing distrust of the pakistan army and conviction that isi is supporting rather than countering terrorism 16 u we very much look forward to your visit dell
