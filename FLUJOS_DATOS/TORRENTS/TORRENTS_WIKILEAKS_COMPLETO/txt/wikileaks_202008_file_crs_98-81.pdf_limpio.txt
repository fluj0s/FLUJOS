companies called the euv llc led by intel and including motorola and advanced micro devices signed cooperative research and development ag reement crada with three department of energy laboratories to develop co mmercial applications for semiconductor manufacturing technology called extreme ultraviolet euv lithography the promise of euv technology is to allo w semiconductor chip ma nufacturers to make chips with more computing speed and memory capacity created by law crada offers the means to transfer federally funded technologies and manufacturin g techniques to industry where they can be further developed and commercialized for the marketplace the work performed must be consistent with the governme nt laboratorys mission in pursuing joint efforts the federal research institution may accept funds personnel services and property from the collaborating party and may provide pe rsonnel services and property to the participating organization the governme nt can cover overhead costs incurred but is explicitly prohibited from providing di rect funding to the industrial partner according to the legislation preference for selecting cradas is to be given to small businesses companies which will manufacture in the united states or foreign firms from countries that permit american compan ies to enter into similar arrangements the successful implementation of the legislative mandate to transfer technology has led to expanded use of this mechanis m and to questions regarding individual crada arrangements much of the opposition to the crada between doe and the euv llc rests on concerns over the par ticipation of foreig n equipment suppliers in applying the results of the collaborative work critics state that the potential for providing foreign firms access to technolog developments originating in federal laboratories will be detrimental to american comp anies and hurt national economic security interests propone nts maintain that the law has been followed and the requirements for us manufacture and ex isting export control regulations are sufficient to address concerns over foreign co mpanies in addition they argue since the consortium is funding the work in the fe deral laboratories it has the right to seek out and use the best manuf acturing technology sources globalization of the international marketplace and the rapid diffusion of new technologies and manufacturing tec hniques throughout has provided many opportunities and generated many conflicts ccessful companies are those that provide innovation and quality in timely manner the gislation does not prohibit participation of foreignowne d firms due in part to the fact that these businesses often provide jobs for american workers and significantly contribute to the us economy still it is in the national inte rest to maintain and improve domestic technological advancement manufacturing and product development the final consideration may be how to encourage americanowned and usbased firms to be the most innovative technology suppliers and manufacturers in global economyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9881contents introduction 1 governmentindustry rd partnerships 2 technology transfer defined 2

research and development agreements and semiconductor technology issues involving the doeintel crada introduction the laboratories of the partment of energy doe have been actively pursuing cooperative research and development rd fforts in conjunction with the private sector there are various mechanisms used to facilitate collaborative ventures between the laborat ories industry and academia those include the use of special facilities and centers set up in pa rticular technological areas personnel exchanges and visits licensing of patents work for others cooperative assistance to state and local programs educational initiatives information dissemination and the spinoff of new firms generally access to the laboratorys unique scientific facilities is determined through peer review of proposals cost reimbursement is required if the companys work is proprietary and patent rights in this case generally are assigned to the firm if the work is to be published charges are incurred additional partnerships have been blished through the use of cooperative research and development agreement crada that document defines the scope of the joint effort and circumscribes the legal relationship between the doe research facility and the private sector parties created by w crada offers the means to transfer federally funde d technologies and manufactur ing techniques to industry where they can be further developed and commercialized for the marketplace department of energy doe laboratories have ente red into approximately 3000 cradas since obtaining legislative ma ndate to use this approach in 1989 in march 1997 consortium of us semiconductor companies signed crada with three doe facilitiessandia national laboratory lawrence berkeley national laboratory and lawrence li vermore national laboratory that consortium called the euv llc euv limited liability corporation is intended to develop commercial app lications for semiconducto r manufacturing technology known as extreme ultraviolet euv lithography1 during the manufacturing process euv lithography can be used to etch circuit pa tterns on semiconductor chips the great promise of euv technology is to allow semiconductor chip manufacturers to make products that have finer circ uit lines etched on each surface in turn that means more computing speed and memory capacity can be handled by an individual semiconductor chip while an number of advances may lead to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9881crs2 2the nature of equipment supplierscompanies that provide the technology necessary to manufacture the semiconductor chipis disc ussed in the section on the semiconductor industry belownext generation of more pow erful and faster chips many believe that commercial euv technologies will dominate production in the future the consortium is led by intel cor poration and includes advanced micro devices amd and motorola euv llc will provide 250 million to the three department of energy laborat ories for continued developm ent of extreme ultraviolet lithography technology for the consortium the doe facilities can play an important role because that is where euv technology was created in the late 1980s as part of the governments strategic defense initiative cutbacks in the program at doe as well as other agency budget reductions have caused apprehension on the part of the us semiconductor industry that the technolog may be lost if not further developed the euv llc is willing to provide industria l funding to ensure that this does not happen while the arrangement ma benefit the us semic onductor manufacturers and the doe laboratories other c oncerns have been raised the consortium is currently negotiating licensing arrangements with several equipment suppliers including the nikon corporation of japan2 nikon already is the dominant player in producing lithography equipment with 50 of the gl obal market some contend that this arrangement may provide foreign co mpetitor with us taxpayersponsored technology because ameri can equipment suppliers make up less than 10 of the world market there has been some worry that nikon may be able to eliminate the us lithography industry by successfully transferring the technology to japan at the heart of the issue are questions regarding the origin definition and purpose of cradas since policymakers ma need an understanding of that type of collaborative activity before they can accurately assess the merits or problems of the doeeuv llc cooperative research and development agreement this report provides information on the fede ral interest in technology transfer and the laws that shape such efforts it then furnishes background on the specific type of technology euv lithography under consideration as well as information on the us and global semiconductor industries the paper is intended to assi st congressional decisionmakers determine whether or not the process instituted by the department of energy meets the legislative mandate for cooperative rd whether or not the doeeuv llc crada meets the requirement s of the agencys policies and practices and whether or not there are rger domestic and inte rnational technology policy issues which fall outside of th crada process but require legislative attention governmentindustry rd partnerships technology transfer defined the federal departments and agencies spend approximately 72 billion per year on research and development in pursuit of governmental mission requirements suchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9881crs3 an effort has resulted in new and improved technologies and manufacturing techniques that may provide additional benefits beyond specific missionrelated use for example while the major portion of total federal rd spending has been in the defense arena governmentfi nanced work has led or c ontributed to new commercial products and processes includi ng but not limited to antibiotic s plastics jet aircraft computers electronics and genetically engineered drugs eg insulin and human growth hormone technology transfer is one way proponents ar gue that federally funded rd can be further deve loped and applied by the priv ate sector to meet other national needs associated with economic growth the increasing competitive pressures on us firms in the intern ational marketplace coupled with the governments requirements for goods nd services can make the collaboration between federal laborat ories and industry through tec hnology transfer beneficial to both sectors although opponents may ar gue that these activities detract from budgeted research the knowledge base cr eated by agencysupported rd may serve as foundation for additional commercially relevant effort s in companies while the government research enterprise is adva nced through interaction with innovative firms the movement of technologies manufact uring techniques and expertise from the federal laboratories to i ndustry is achieved through t echnology transfer this is process by which technology pr oduction process skill or knowledge developed in one organization in one area or for one pur pose is applied in another organization in another area or for anot her purpose technology transfer can have different meanings in different situations in some instances it refers to the transfer of legal rights such as the assignment of patent title to contractor or the licensing of the governmentowned patent to private company it can mean formal cooperative rd effort or in other cases the informal movement of information knowledge and skills through persontopers on interaction ccessful transfer is in the actual use of the product or proce ss without this the benefits from more efficient and effective provision of goods and services are not achieved the federal interest in the transfer of technology is base d on several factors with the rapid pace of technological advan cement in industry the expertise skills products and processes necessa ry for the agencies to m eet their mission requirements often is only available in the private sector thus cooperative activities with industrial scientists and engineers can be critical to the laboratorys successful completion of its research activities the government also requires certain goods and services to operate much of the research it funds is directed at developing the knowledge and expertise necessary to fo rmulate these products and processes however because the government has neither the mandate nor the capability to commercialize the results of the federal rd effort it must purchase technologies from the private sector to meet mission requirements technology transfer is mechanism to move federally generated technology and technical knowhow to the business community where it can be devel oped commercialized nd made available for use and adaptation in the public sector federal involvement in technology transf er also arises from an interest in promoting the economic growth that is vita l to the nations welfare and security it is through further improve ment refinement and marketing that the results of research become diffused throughout the economy nd can generate growthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9881crs4 3for detailed discussion see congressional research service technology transfer use of federally funded research and development by wendy h schacht crs issue brief 85031 updated regularlyeconomic benefits of technology or t echnique accrue when product or process is brought to the marketplace where it can be sold or used to increase qua lity and productivity when technology transfer is successful new and different goods and services become available to meet or induce market demand transfer from the federal laboratories thus can lead to substantial increases in employment and income generated at the company level in additi on it may be way to assist businesses that have been dependent on defense cont racts and procurement to convert to manufacturing for the civilian marketplace the legislative foundation the primary legislation affording i ndustry access to the federal laboratory system is pl96480 the stevensonwy dler technology innovation act of 1980 as amended by pl 99502 the federal tec hnology transfer act of 1986 pl 101 189 the fy 1990 defense authorization act the relevant title is known as the national competitiveness tec hnology transfer act pl 104113 the technology transfer improvements and advancement act and othe rs although technology transfer was ongoing prior to its passage the stevensonwydler technology innovation act provided the federal department s agencies and ffiliated laboratories with legislative mandate to pursue such activities the act specifically states that it is the responsibility of the federal govern ment to ensure full use of the results of the nations federal inves tment in research and deve lopment and mandates that where appropriate technology be transferred to state nd local governments and the private sector the original 1980 legislation established an organizational structure and specific mechanisms to carry out the new agency responsibilities3 section 11 requires that each federal department with at least one laboratory make available not less than 05 of its rd budget for transfer activitie s later increased to 08 although this requirement can and has been waived to facilitate transfer from the laboratories each is required to create an office of research and technology applications orta laboratories with annual budgets exceeding 20 million must have at least one fulltime staff person for this office although the latter provision can also be waived the function of the orta is to identify technologies and ideas that have potential for application in other settings additional incentives to promote technol ogy transfer from governmentowned contractoroperated goco laboratoriesprimarily t hose of the department of energywere included in pl96620 amendm ents

use of federal laboratory resources was less than expected on behalf of both the private and public sectors as consequence additional incentives were c onsidered by the congress resulting in enactment of pl 99502 the federal tec hnology transfer act of 1986 this law established new tool the cooperative research and development agreement crada to be used for joint work be tween federal laborator ies and the business community first limited to governmentowned governmentoperated laboratories the authority to enter into cradas was ex tended to government owned contractor operated laboratories of the department of ener gy by pl 101189 the fy 1990 defense authorization act the t echnology transfer improvements and advancement act of 1996 pl 104113 provi ded additional guide lines to simplify the negotiation of cradas and to reduce priv ate sector uncertainty in working with the government cooperative rd agreements cradas cooperative research and development agreement is specific legal document not procurement contract that defines the collaborative venture it is intended to be developed at the laboratory level with limited agency review in agencies that operate their own laboratories the laborator director is permitted to make decisions to participate in cradas in an effort to decentralize and expedite the technology transfer process at the department of energy where contractors run the major laboratories the agreement while negotiated by the research instituti on must also be approved by headquarters within sp ecified time period the conference report to accompany the legislation permitting gocos to enter into cooperative rd agreements states technology transfer is most successful when agencies handle their own affairs and when government officials technology transfer experts and scientists at the local level have latitude in designing and carrying out cradas any regulations must recognize that purpos of section 12 of stevensonwydler is to allow prompt consideration and disposition of proposed cradas4 the work performed under crada must be consistent with the laboratorys mission technology transfer and coopera tive efforts are expressly forbidden to interfere with the laboratories rd ssionrelated responsib ilities in pursuing these joint efforts the laboratory may accep t funds personnel rvices and property from the collaborating party and may provi personnel services and property to the participating organization the gove rnment can cover overhead costs incurred in support of the crada but is explicitly prohibited from providing direct funding to the industrial partner in most agen cies support for the joint work comes from rd program funding the partment of energy orig inally included line item for financing the

budget instructing that such activities be part of ongoing programs at this time the line item still exists in the budgets for the doe defense laboratories but at significantly decreased level of funding the relevant legislation does not specify the dispensation of patents derived from the collaborative work allowing the agencies to develop their own policies however under crada title to or licenses for inventions made by laboratory employee may be granted in advance to the participating company by the director of the laboratory the director may also negotiate licensing agreements for related governmentowned inventions previously made at that laboratory if it facilitates cooperative ventures in addition he can wa ive in advance any right of ownership the government might have in inventions resulting from the joint effort further clarification of the assignme nt of intellectual property ri ghts is made under pl 104 113 the house science committee report to accompany this law states that in considering intellectual propert the important factor is that industry selects which option makes the most sense under the crada5 in all cases the government retains nonexclusive nontransferable i rrevocable paidup license to practice or have practiced the invention for its own needs laboratory personnel and former employ ees are permitted to participate in commercialization activities if these are consistent with the agencies regulations and rules of conduct federal employees are subj ect to conflict of inte rest restraints in the case of governmentowned contract oroperated laborat ories pl 101189 required the development nd implementation of conflict of interest regulations within 150 days of the enactment of the w the law states that preference for selecting which cradas to enter into be given to small businesses companies which will manufacture in the united states or foreign firms from countries that permit american companies to enter into similar arrangements according to the senate report accompanying the legisla tion srept 99283 the authorities conveyed by the section dealing with cradas are permissive to promote the widest use to this arrangement implementation at the department of energy policy development the department of energy operates nine multiprogram laboratories commonly called the national laboratories as well as 24 single purpose institutions which perform research in specifi c disciplines the research and development budget for these facilities is appr oximately 65 billion year ma jority of the laboratories are operated under contract by organizations outside of the government including universities nonforprofit institutions and forprofit companies in government owned contractoroperated laboratories the agency pr ovides funding and policy direction while management nd technical expertise are fu rnished by the contractorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9881crs7 this arrangement emerged out of the manhattan project during world war ii when time was critical factor in the war effort the government funded the construction of the research facilities but rather than assembling and developing its own expertise and operating processes universities and firms with existing and established systems were utilized in addition scientific technical and engineering personnel can be paid at rates higher than generally available in federal service situation that can be important in attractin g and retaining qualifie d experienced personnel prior to 1989 the department of energy headquarters appeared resistant to promoting governmentindustr cooperation although manage ment of several of the individual laboratories activ ely pursued joint ventures this was documented in testimony on the implementation of the stevensonwydler technology innovation act in hearings on the federal technolog transfer act propos in 1988 general accounting office report titled technology transfer c onstraints perceived by federal laboratory and agency officials in house and nate testimony on legislation to extend technology transfer obligations and practices required of governmentowned government operated laborator ies to those contractoroperated doe facilities and in 1988 report issued by the research and technology utilization panel of the energy research advisory board to summarize complaints were made that central department of energy management was preventing the timely transfer of technol ogy among the points addressed were laboratory directors had not been given di scretion to assign patents and licenses doe headquarters was taking up to tw years to decide upon allowing the laboratories to enter into agreements cerning patents licen ses or cooperative arrangements when time was of the essence class waivers on titles were not being granted to doe laboratories operated by forprofit companies and national security was being invoked even when it was clear th at the technology was to be transferred within civilian context however the situation has changed significantly due in part to legislative requirements as well as to the changing global defense situ ation and new demands on the department this is reflected in po licy decisions and alte red practices in both doe and its laboratories in january 1991 the secretary of energy formally instituted new departmental technology transfer policy sen3091 with the goal of helping enhance us competitivene ss and national security by expanding and accelerating the transfer of federally funded technologies and knowledge into commercial applications by usbased industry to accomplish this the department stated that it will increase pa rticipation by american industry in doe rd at all stages of program deve lopment and execution augment the extent to which doe and laborat ory personnel are involved in technology transfer consistent with other mission requirements and facilitate the transfer process as part of the 1992 national energy strategy develope d to lay the foundation for more efficient less vulne rable and environmentally sustainable energy future the department of energy articulated several objectives and identified initiatives which affected the laboratories major part of this strategy was the expansion of the role science and technol ogy play in achieving us objectiveshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9881crs8 6department of energy national energy strategy powerful ideas for america washington dc gpo february 1991 p 20 7ibid p 21 8ibid p 21 9ibid p 21 10gerold yonas

commitment to ma intaining balanced and diverse federal portfolio of resear ch investments in fundament science and engineering research which meet the goals of the strategy the department stated the necessity of preserving the high quality world class user facilities which are available to industry and academia7 the national energy strategy also prom oted technology transfer to accelerate joint industrygovernment rd efforts toward the commercialization of new technology in the private sector in order to enhance us competitiveness8 to accomplish this the strategy proposed that industry be given additional incentives to increase its research development and commercialization activities and that adequate protection for inte llectual property be devel oped also recommended were improvements in the speed efficiency nd scope of federal efforts to transfer technology to industry this included support for costshared programs that help demonstrate the technical feasibility of generic enabling technologies and that provide technical assistance for the velopment of spinoff applications by industry9 initial attempts to implement the mandate of pl 101189 at the department of energy and its laboratories were hampered by several problems the contractual nature of the laboratories re lationship with the department of energy meant that the operating contracts had to be renegotiated to reflect several new legislative requirements according to gerald yonas then vice president for systems applications sandia nationa l laboratories the depar tment took over year to establish rules and regulations for implementation and to alter contracts to allow for cradas the approval process that wa s first established for cooperative agreements was considered too long and cumbersome the standard contract provisions were seen by industry as favoring doe to great extent10 in addition to the legal aspects of the collaboration th ere were also problems with cultural differences laboratory pers onnel and industry representa tives generally approached the effort with different expectations different operating methods and different needs in response to the changing priorities at doe the agency developed several mechanisms to support technology transfer from the laboratorie s the department has codified its implementa tion of the technology transf er mandate in 48 cfr part 970 effective january 22 1996 while re sponsibility for collaborative ventures resides primarily in the doe research facilities the department created model crada for use by the laboratory

intellectual property resulting from the collaborative research nd development as noted above the laboratory directors are provided broad disc retion in determining assignments of title to inventions and licensing arrangements article xv of the model crada requires that the allocation of rights between the parties be set forth in the agreement option 2 under this article allows th parties to determine which of the participants will own any invention arising from the research th government always retains non exclusive nontransferable irrevocable paidup license to practice or to have practiced for or on behalf of the united states every subject invention under this crada throughout the world the cr ada also must stipulate that the department of energy has certain marchin rights to any subject invention which under exceptional circumstances such as to meet health or safety needs meet mission requirements or failu re to comply with the agreement would require that the collaborating party grant license to others under the stevensonwydler technol ogy innovation act as amended the director of the laboratory in deciding which cooperative agreements to enter into is mandated to give preference emphasis added to business units located in the united states which agree that products embodying inventions made under the cooperative research and development agreement

organization or ot her person subject to the control of foreign company or government as appropriate take into consideration whether or not such foreign government permits united states agencies organizations or other persons to enter into cooperative research and development agreements and licensing agreements11 the department of energy has taken this directive and incorporated it into agency policy regarding collaborative ventures under crada the policy first articulated in february 10 1993 memorandum issued by the department and codified in 48 cfr part 970 states that in negotiating an agreement the laboratory is to give preference to business units located in the us that agree to substantially manufacture resulting technology in the us in instances where this is not possible individual exceptions may be made based on contractual commitments to appropriate alterna tive benefits to the us economy when there are multiple partners and limited resources preference is to be given to those partnerships which meet the us manufacturing requirement these us competitiveness issues are to be resolved before the completion of the joint work statement between the laboratory and the partner prior to forwar ding it to the relevant doe program office article xxii of the model cooperative research and development agreement states that purpose of this crada is to provide substantia l benefit to the us economy the guidelines in the model tablished by doe for use in determining issues of us competitiveness regarding foreign participation affirms that the agency is seeking to transfer technology to compan ies with significant manufacturing and research facilities in the united states in way which will provide short and long term benefits to the us economy and the industrial competitiveness of such companies the preferred benefit to the us economy is the creation and maintenance of manufacturing capabilities and jobs within the us however if an increased number of jobs can not be substantiated as result of the transfer the participants are required to identify other substantial economic benefits that would accrue among the benefits which might be considered are direct or indirect in vestment in usbased plant and equipment creation of new andor higher quality usbased jobs enhancement of the domestic skills base further domestic development of

fairness of opportunity the house conference report on pl 101189 states that while the laboratories are directed to broadly di sseminate information on technology transfer this would not require

moores crystal ball business week 23 june 1997 p 120computers to communications satellites there are many varied types of semiconductor chips ranging from basic mem ory devices which store and retrieve data to more sophisticated multiprocesso r logic and flash semiconductor chips 18 what all of these devices share is that they are critical for todays information and telecommunications technologies and serv ices some conte nd that semiconductor chips are to the information age what oil was to the industrial age how do semiconductor chips work cr eated out of silicon wafer semiconductor chip has an intricate circuit pattern etched onto its surface that can conduct electrical currents the electrical cu rrents are read by the semiconductor chip as series of 0s and 1s when 0 s and 1s are strung together they form words pictures and other forms of data it is the speed of this process and the capacity of semiconductor chips to receive store read and re trieve information which is one of the key factors fueling th entire electronics industry as result powerful personal computers have replaced many larger mainframe computer systems in everyday use this is very simple explanation of sophisticated devices made more complex by the rapid development of the speed and capacity of toda ys semiconductor chips over the last two decades semiconductor ch ips speed and capacity have grown very rapidly and generational leaps in semiconductor technol ogies have been measured in months not years this growth was foretold by gordon moore one of the founders of the intel corporation moore predicted in the 1970s that advances in semiconductor chip design and manufacturing would result in doubling of chip speed and memory capacity continuously bout every two years moores law means geometric rather than an arithme tic procession of adva nces in semiconductor chips19 the doubling of semiconductor chip speed and capacity can occur because semiconductor chip manufacturer s are able to produce semiconductor chips that are capable of performing more functions on smaller surfaces but many experts in the semiconductor industry contend that to do more with smallersized semiconductor chips new manufacturing technologie s will have to be developed and commercialized semiconductor manufactu ring technologies one of the important steps in manufactur ing semiconductor chip is the process that provides clean and resolute circu it patterns on silicon surfaces the circuit patterns are measured in linewidths per semiconductor chip over the last decade semiconductor manufacturers have produced chips below the micron or submicron level micron is 1100000th th width of human hair current manufacturing technologies permit clear and resolute linewidths at 35 micron beyond that level current manufacturing technologies cannot gu arantee consistent highvolume high quality production runs httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9881crs14 20this is very broad distinction which for the purpose and length of this report does not present several finer distinctions these include some us companies like ibm which produces its own semiconductor chips for ibm co mputers but not for external retail sale companies like this are called captive manuf acturers several niche semiconductor chip manufacturers serve specific markets such as only manufacturing devices for the department of defense on the supply side the equipment suppliers and materials suppliers are two distinct industries finally in foreign markets like japan and korea vertical integration can blur distinctions between manufacturers and equipment suppliers the semiconductor chip manufacturing pro cess is iterative often with hundreds of steps being repeated to ensure quality and performance as silicon wafer is made into semiconductor chip key component in this process is where chemicals are placed onto the surface of the silicon wafers in layers pattern representing circuit path is then etched onto the che mical the next process involves stripping away the chemicals when this stripping process occurs the resulting pattern results in an electrically conducive circuit on the face of the wafer each of these steps has specific name the chemicals layered on the silicon are photo resist substances the mask holds the circuit pattern and it is th shadow of light on the wafer surface which provides the actual circuitry on the miconductor chip after the light hits the photo resist the area sensitized by the light is washed awaythe stripping process the technology used to beam light waves onto the silicon wafer is lithography the current state oftheart lithography technology is photo optical this technology has permitted the 35 micron linewidths but likely cannot provide clearer resolution below this level several alternatives to photo optical are xrays deep ultraviolet duv and ex treme ultraviolet euv all of these technologies have been in development for over decade lthough none are currently used in high volume highquality semiconduc tor chip manufacturing but all use shorter waves from the portion of the spectrum invisible to the naked eye it is shorter lightwaves which will likely provide the kind of manufacturing resolution needed below 35 micron the stepper is the entire unit that conducts the exposure process described above this includes the light source the nses that focus the light source and the technologies that control the exposure pr ocess as the lithography unit emits waves upon different parts of the wafer quality of performance of the stepper product life cycles of semiconductor chips and cost of the stepper unit all are factors which determine technology advancement nd commercialization new lithography technologies like euv could make the entire stepper unit more accurate and productive at submicron vels semiconductor industry and markets the semiconductor industry whether domestic or global generally is comprised of two major componentsthe semic onductor chip manufacturers and the semiconductor equipment nd materials suppliers20 in the former category are us companies like the intel corporation moto rola and texas

and for most of the 1960s through mid1970s u s manufacturers held more than two thirds of the global market however increased foreign competition and dropoff in the quality and reliability of us products eroded that lead by 1987 us semiconductor manufacturer s held about 37 of the gl obal market while japanese firms held about 47 of the global market for semiconductor chip sales21 in response us industry and the federal government individually and collectively undertook seve ral initiatives these in cluded the 1988 semiconductor agreement to open japanese markets to u s products an industry roadmap which provided strategic outline for the us semiconductor manufacturers and equipment suppliers and actions by us firms to dramatically innovate and improve the quality of their products importantly many indus try leaders also c ontended that better communication between us semiconducto r chip manufacturers and equipment suppliers was needed to strengthen th link between equipment suppliers and manufacturers in 1987 an industry government funded consortium called sematech for semiconductor manufacturing technology was created to meet that goal by 1997 us semiconductor chip manufacturers had regained global market share of 46 while japanese firms held 3622 for semiconductor equipment supplie rs 19871997 also resulted in turnaround af ter losing the global market

stepper products observations changes in federal funding for rd as well as scientific and technological advances in the private sector have affected the way government laboratories meet mission requirements legislative activ ity over the past 15 to 20 years has encouraged cooperative research and deve lopment between and among government industry and academia the intent is to facilitate collaborative ventures and thereby reduce the risks and costs associated with rd while permitting work to be undertaken that crosses traditional bounda ries of expertise and experience the department of energy has taken the congressi onal mandate to transfer technology from government boratories to the private s ector and created the means to implement this responsibility the indi vidual laboratories have also established programs that reflect their operating styles while meeting their obligations to undertake collaborative rd with industry as articulated in may 1997 sandia national laboratory publication strategi c partnering supports the laboratories traditional missions by leveraging government funding in critical areas sustaining and strengthening the boratorys scientific and technical excellence accelerating technology development and deployment and fostering closer relationships with indus tries that are critical to our primary missions24 however in recent weeks questions have b een raised as to the procedures followed by the department by the labor atories and by the private sector participants in the euv llc there has not been an independent cr ossagency evaluation of cradas which might be helpful in answering questions regarding the doeeuv llc agreement that is in part result of the absence of standardized departmental measures of success the general accounting offi ce gao reviewed 10 cradas among group selected by agencies as having achieved their goals in the december 1994httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9881crs17 25general accounting office technology

technology partnerships washington april 1996 p 39 27ibid p 40study gao found that the benefits of collaboration include new commercial products advances in rd programs nd assistance in meeting agency mission requirements noting that the cradas studi ed were not necessa rily representative of all such efforts the re port concluded that cradas can be valuable asset and governmentindustry collaboration can have positive impact on certain economic health and environmenta l needs of the united states25 in preparing report on partnering th office of technology policy in the department of commerce collected inform ation from government agencies industry and the university community which led to finding that t echnology partnerships enhance the effectiveness of g overnment missionrelated rd26 the report goes on to argue that stateoftheart rd performed by the private sector is necessary for the laboratories to achieve their mandates and can be acquired through collaborative work in addition even in cases where fe deral rd is more pr ogressive generation of governmentunique technol ogies often is too expensiv to be developed solely by the public sector the potential of co mmercial markets can interest industry in participating in such activ ities and thus reduce costs27 the growing industrial interest in cr adas as well as an increase in the number of these cooperative arrangements used by the business community seems to indicate that both the public and private sectors see value in the approach in addition cradas may meet the interests of the current congress for supporting basic research and facilita ting technology development through indirect measures particularly since federal funds are pr ovided to the industrial partner the successful implementation of the legisl ative mandate to tr ansfer technology however has led to expanded use of this mechanism and as such to questions regarding individual crada arrangements much of the opposition to the doeeuv llc cooperative rd agreements rests on concerns over the pa rticipation of foreign equi pment suppliers as noted previously the inclusion of companies such as nikon corporation of japan in licensing arrangements to utilize the results of the crada has given rise to objections that us taxpayer supporte d technology may bene fit foreignowned companies critics of the partnership have stated that the potential of providing foreign companies access to us technolog developments originating in federal laboratories will have serious and destructive effect on american equipment and material suppliers and thus hurt national economic security interests they point to the sematech consortium which linke d us semiconductor manufacturing and supplier firms as an example of constructive federal policy that addressed similar concerns while acknowledging that the parallel to sematech is not identical proponents of this argument main tain that in this case it is clearly in the interest of us policymakers to consider amendi ng the current doeeuv llc crada theyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9881crs18 assert that us semiconduc tor equipment and material s suppliers if not served exclusively should at the very least be primary beneficiarie s of this venture those supporting the doeeuv llc cr ada point out that the government and the private sector participants have followed not only the legal guidelines for creating cooperative rd agreement but also the intent of the law as dictated in congressional documents accompanying the relevant legislation congress instructed the agencies to prom ote technology transfer of bene fit to both the government and industry the work encompassed under the current cooperative rd agreement is precisely the type of critical technology nur tured at federal laboratory that should be developed by the private sector pr oponents argue that the consortium which is funding the laboratory rd has the right to seek out and use the best manufacturing technology sources the requirements for us manufacture of the resulting products and processes and existing expor t control regulations are seen as sufficient to address concerns over the particip ation of foreign firms in congressional discussion over the doeeuv llc cooperative research and development agreement certain issues might need to be resolved starting point may be whether or not this specific crada followed the rules and regulations developed by the department of energy another question is whether both the model crada and the procedures established by 48 cfr part 970 accurately reflect the mandate provided under the law does the current law represent the best method of fostering technology transfer for the bene fit of the us economy given the changes in the rd environment since the legisl ation was enacted is opposition to this cooperative effort driven by political and economic concerns created by competitors in the marketplace or are there other reasons to reassess this arrangement any resolution of differences might invol ve the issue of balance are there other national considerations which shoul d further temper the current technology transfer mandate industrie s and companies typically are interdependent thus can balance be achieved between the technolog transfer interests of us firms that have technological lead and those that do not what does economic security mean in situation such as this how does the government balance the interests of one industry or one company with another eg the semiconductor producers with the needs of the equipment manufacturers nd how can the governments interests be balanced with those of industry do the current system allow both the laboratoriesthus the american public and the private sector to achieve commensurate benefits the globalization of the international marketplace and the rapid diffusion of new technologies and manuf acturing processes thr oughout has provided many opportunities and genera ted many conflicts while there are of ten national security including economic security concerns it is generally acknowledged that keeping technology within domestic boarders is n early impossible although firms can keep certain technological deve lopments within corporate boundaries for some time successful companies are those which provide innovation nd quality in timely manner in recognition of this the legi slation does not prohi bit participation of foreignowned companies due in part to the fact that th firms often provide jobs for american workers and significantly cont ribute to the us economy the measure often used is that of value added to the nati onal wellbeing therefore efforts tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9881crs19 restrict what is considered an ame rican technology from foreign sources or attempts to direct which suppliers manufacturer can use may result in fruitless or even deleterious national policy still it is in the national interest to maintain and improve upon processes of t echnological advancement manufacturing and product development the final consideration may be how to encourage americanowned and usbased firms to be the mo st innovative technology suppliers and manufacturers in global economy
