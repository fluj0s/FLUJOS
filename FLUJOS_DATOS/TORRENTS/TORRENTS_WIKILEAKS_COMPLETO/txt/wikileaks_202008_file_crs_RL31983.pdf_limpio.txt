competing versions of the patient safety and quality improvement act hr 663 s 720 but the differences between the two measures were never resolved on march 9 2005 the senate committee on health educati on labor and pensions nimously pproved s 544 which is identical to s 720 the legislat ion would establish legal protections for data and reports on medical errors in an effort to encourage voluntary reporting of such information the patient safety b ills are in response to the 1999 institute of medicine iom report to err is human which concluded that preventable medical errors cause as many as 98000 deaths year the iom found that medical errors are primarily the result of faulty systems pr ocesses and conditions that lead people to make mistakes it recommended establishing national mandatory reporting system to hold hospitals accountable for serious medical errors as well as developing voluntary confidential systems for reporting errors that result in little or harm analysis of such voluntarily reported data could be used to identify vulnerabilities in health care systems twentytwo states mandate medical error reporting by hospitals however providers are reluctant to report adverse events in part because they fear that the information will be used in malpractice litiga tion states have sought to allay those concerns by passing laws to protect repor ted data from legal discovery and by identifying data and receiving reports nonymously such measures risk limiting the usefulness of the data for research and quality management there are several national voluntary re porting systems for medical errors including the patient safety information system within the department of veterans affairs analysis of these and other voluntary reporting systems notably the aviation safety reporting system has iden tified several design features associated with effective programs for example the reporting process should be userfriendly and the information kept confidential nd protected from legal discovery also reports should be promptly evaluated by experts who are trained to recognize underlying systems causes and reporters should receive timely feedback with recommendations for syst emsbased improvements to encourage voluntary reporting h r 663 would have protected reported information from legal discovery in civil and administrative proceeding and from freedom of information act request th bill required the agency for healthcare research and quality ahrq to certify patient safety organizations to collect and analyze the information reported by provide rs such organizations would develop and disseminate recommendations for system sbased solutions to improve patient safety and health care quality hr 663 so would have required ahrq to establish national database to recei ve and analyze deidentif ied information submitted by patient safety organi zations s 544 would protect information from use in criminal as well as civil and administrative proceedings unless judge determined that it contained evidence of an intentional act to directly harm the patient this report will be updated as legislative events in the 109th congress

quality improving patient safety by promoting medical errors reporting introduction in the 108th congress the house and senate passed competing versions of the patient safety and quality improvement act hr 663 s 720 despite broad bipartisan support for the legislation fu rther action took place before adjournment in december 2004 on march 9 2005 the senate committee on h ealth education labor and pensions help unanimously approved new patient safety bill s 544 which is identical to last years natepassed measure the patient safety legislation is intended to encourage the voluntary reporting of information on medical errors by establishing federal evidentiary privilege and confidentiality protections for such information health care providers are reluctant to report medical errors because they fear that the information w ill damage their reputa tions and be used in medical malpractice lawsuits patient safety emerged as major hea lth policy issue in late 1999 with the release of the institute of medicines iom report to err is human1 the iom report concluded that prev entable medical errors cau as many as 98000 deaths each year and called on all parties to make improving patient safety national health policy priority it recommended establis hing national mandatory reporting system to hold hospitals and other health care f acilities accountable for errors that lead to serious injury or death emphasizing that medical errors are primarily the result of faulty systems process and conditions th at lead people to make mistakes the iom also recommended the development of volunt ary confidential systems for reporting medical errors that result in harm ie close calls or minimal harm analysis of such voluntarily reported information c ould then be used to identify system vulnerabilities and develop preventive strategies the patient safety and quality improvement act attempted to implement that recommendation the iom based its conclusions on epid emiologic studies published in the 1980s and early 1990s while medical researchers were familiar with the published estimates of the prevalence of medical errors in hospitals and other inpatient settings the information was new to the public and it caught the attention of federal and state legislators and health care policymakers indeed 1999 survey showed that patienthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31983crs2 2

story of the year2 as result of the iom report numerous patient safety initiatives were initiated within the federal government and throughout the private sector in health plans and health care trade organizations and accrediting and standardsetting bodies states responded to the iom report by c onsidering legislation to expand existing mandatory reporting systems nd in some cases enact new systems currently 22 states have mandatory reporting systems the goal is to hold hospitals and health care providers accountable to the public for the most serious mistakes in the delivery of health care in an effort to encourag providers to report errors most states have adopted measures to protect reporting system data from use by malpractice attorneys policymakers have had to ba lance provider concerns about the legal consequences of making information available to attorneys and patients with the desire for public accountability legislation to encourage medical errors reporting was first introduced in the 106th congress following the release of the iom report3 m u c h f i t w s reintroduced in the 107th congress and again in the 108th patient safety lies at the heart of the current debate on medical malpractice reform many trial attorneys defend the current tort system claiming that the threat of litigation makes providers practice safer medicine they view tort w as an important driver of health care quality but experts on health care quality reject this argument echoing the ioms recommendations they contend that the only way to realize significant improvements in patient safety is by improving health car systems and that in turn requires the analysis of medical errors report by discouraging physicians from reporting such information the tort system is in conflict with this approach to safety improvement this report provides an overv iew and some analysis of medical errors reporting and the house and senate patie nt safety bills it begins with background information on the nature and causes of medical errors followed by brief comparison of the differences between mandatory and volunt ary reporting systems the report then discusses some of the legal and policy

medical errors can ppen at all stages of the process of care from diagnosis to treatment to preventive care not all errors result in harm those that do are referred to as preventable advers events an adverse event is an injury related to medical intervention and not due to the underlying medical condition of the patient while adverse events are of ten attributable to error and therefore preventable they need not always be the result of medical mismanagement see discussion of adverse dr ug reactions below limited number of published studies ve examined adverse events among hospitalized patients extrapolating from the results of two large retrospective reviews of hospital records the iom estimated that more than 1 million medical errors occur each year in the united states of which between 44000 and 98000 are fatal4 it also concluded that errors may cost the nation as much as 29 billion annually in direct medical costs and lost income and productivity some researchers have challenged the accuracy of the ioms numbers but there is general agreement that the problem is serious5 still others say the iom may have undere stimated the true incidence of medical errors because it only considered errors that occur among hospital patients which repr esent small proportion of the total population at risk many patients receive increasingly comp lex care in ambulatory settings such as outpatient surgical centers phy sicians offices and clinics echoing the views of most health care analysts the iom emphasized that medical errors are primarily systemic problem and generally not attributable to individual negligence or misconduct erro rs are the result of faulty systems processes and conditions that lead people to make mistakes according to the iom health care lags behind other industries eg aviation nuclear power that pay attention to factors that affect performan ce such as work hours work conditions information technology team relationships and the design of tasks to make errors more difficult to commit medication errors while there have been few studies that examined all types of adverse events occurring in hospitals and other provider ttings there is an abundant literature that focuses on adverse drug events ie adverse events specifically associated with ordering and administering dication to patients adve rse drug events are often found to be the most common type of adve rse event documented in hospital settings in its report the iom estimated that dr ugrelated adverse events kill up to 7000 americans

incidence and pr eventability of adverse drug events among older persons in the ambulatory setting journal of the american medical association vol 289 2003 pp 11071116although the distinction is not always clear researchers divide adverse drug events into two types adverse drug reactions resulting from previously known or newly detected side effects of drugs that are correctly prescribed and administered and injuries that are caused by errors in prescribing dispensing and administering medication examples of medication rrors include physicians who prescribe antibiotics to patients with documented allergies to those medications nurses who do not properly dilute intravenous so lutions and patient s who fail to take medications as directed studies reveal that advers drug events occur in 65 to more than 20 of hospitalized patients and that between one quarter and onehalf of these are due to medication errors and are therefore avoidable6 newly published research on medication safety among medicare patients in outpatient settings suggests that the medicare population as whole may experi ence as many as 180000 lifethreatening or fatal adverse dr ug events annually7 it is important to recognize that the majority of medication errors do not lead to an adverse drug event either because they are caught before the drugs are administered or because they result in ill effects in the ioms analysis medication errors typically result from one or more failures in the increasingly complex systems of medication management rather than from negligence on the part of individual health care practitioners medical errors reporting systems the iom recommended establishing nationwide mandatory reporting system for states to collect standardized information initially from hospitals but eventually from other institutional and ambulatory health care settings on adverse events that result in death or serious harm the primary purpose of mandatory reporting systems is to hold providers account able by ensuring that serious mistakes are reported and investigated and that appropriate followup action is taken organizations that continue unsafe practices risk citations penalties sanctions suspension or revocation of licenses and possible public exposure and loss of business the iom proposed that mandatory reporting system data be made available to the public once they have been validated to complement the mandatory reporting of serious and fatal errors the iom also recommended the development of voluntary reporting systems for collecting information on errors that result in little or harm the focus of voluntary reporting is the analysis and identification of systemic problems that could lead to more serious types of errors and the development of prevention strategies to encourage reporting the iom further recommended that information collect ed under voluntaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31983crs5 8 according to the health policy tracking rvice the states

prevent the discovery of error information in civil or administrative proceedings few states have the experts to analyze more than fraction of the reports they receive most reports are not investigated and few hospitals receive any feedback9 states face difficult challenge in designing their reporting systems as they attempt to reconcile two competing objectives they must motivate health care providers and facilities to re port errors promptly and accu rately while at the same time holding them accountable through syst em of public disclosure of information about errors the iom concluded that the public has right to information concerning the safety of the health care system providers however are reluctant to report adverse events they fear that publicly released data will lead to an increase in malpractice lawsuits the more comprehensive and organized the reporting system database the greater the gal threat it may pose to providers in 2003 report on state error reporting systems the national academy for state health policy nashp concluded that the balance between protecting data from legal discovery and disclosing informa tion to the public appears to be tipped in favor of data protection10 data protection attorneys may compel disclosure of information considered confidential by the state through variety of legal processes including 1 freedom of information or open records requests 2 subpoenas 3 legal discovery and 4 admission into evidence in civil or administrative proceed ing to allay providers concerns about litigation states have pursued variety of legal options to protect mandatory reporting system data11 some states have exempted reporting system data from their public disclosure ie freedom of inform ation laws while ot hers have relied on their existing peer review statutes12 peer review laws can provide strong protections for reporting system data if they cover or are interpreted to cover all activitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31983crs7 13 nashp oct 2003 14 wendy k miller and frances h miller medical error reporting professional tensions between confidentiality and liability massachusetts health policy forum issue brief 13 2001 15 nashp oct 2003related to the administration of the reporting system however courts have occasionally found that the rights of an individual to information relating to personal lawsuit trumps peer review protection for these reasons most of the mandatory reporting systems established since the iom report have comprehensive systemsp ecific protections of data and reporters built into the authorizing statute for example information may be protected from discovery subpoena search warrant and evidence in civil or administrative proceedings protections for reporters ma include exclusion from civil and criminal lawsuits monetary liability state antitrust lawsuits compelled testimony and employer retaliation ie w histleblower protection system design features such as deidentifying data and receiving reports anonymously may reduce the need for str ong legal protections by making it more difficult to link specific incidents to individuals or institutions of course such measures also limit the utility of the information to analysts despite their efforts to shield error information from legal discovery and public disclosure states have d limited success in encouraging providers to report adverse events underreporting is serious issue for state reporting systems and it can have important consequences for health care quality13 failure to inform patient of medical error may delay or deprive prompt treatment wh ich in turn may expose the physician to greater liability underreporting also hinders research on the prevalence and root causes of errors hampering quality improvement initiatives while providers fears of legal exposur are real and must be addressed it remains unclear whether they have merit there are studies on whether reported error information is being used in malpractice litigati on moreover there is little research on the influence of specific laws on reporting be havior further complicating the issue is the fact that fear of liability is just one of several factors that lead to the underreporting of medical errors other factors include facilities lack of internal systems to identify events the culture of medical practice that discourages drawing attention to errors fear of ins titutional sanctions anxi ety about maintaining good relationships with peers loss of bus iness damage to re putation and whether the amount of feedback and the potential be nefits from reporting justify the time and effort it takes to report there is not enough evidence to predict the impact that eliminating one or more of these disincentives would have on reporting behavior14 some degree of legal protec tion may be necessary to courage reporting but it may not be sufficient to create an nvironmental conducive to reporting15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31983crs8 16 nashp oct 2003 17 nashp oct 2003data disclosure the iom recommended that mandatory reporting systems publicly disclose all information uncovered during i nvestigations polls indi cate broad public support for such disclosure and some analysts argue that disclosure is necessary to drive improvements in health care however according to nashp public disclosure of adverse event information is sporadic and inconsistent while some states are prohibited from releasing certain data by statute others that are permitted to disclosure certain information refrain from doi ng so because of concerns that the data are incomplete and unreliable and may be misinterpreted by the public in some cases states are also reluctant to disclose information in order to alleviate the concerns of hospitals and practitioners16 nashp found that seven states with mandatory reporting systems release incidentspecific data the remaining states issue or plan to issue aggregate reports incidentspecific data are most commonl provided on request only basis where information is available to the public it is often difficult to access or requires specific information on how and where to request the information in order to access it the data may be provided in raw form wit hout accompanying analysis to assist with interpretation17 overall it appears that state reporting sy stems have had at best modest impact on improving patient safety evidence from hospitals that the reporting and investigation of serious events has led to improvement in patient safety is largely anecdotal as noted above most state programs are plagued by underreporting especially in their early years of operati on the iom report observed that few states aggregate the data or analyze them to identify general trends analysis and followup tend to occur on casebycase basis the report cited limited resources and the absence of standard reportin g requirements as major impediments to making greater use of the reported data it concluded that state progra ms appear to provide public response for investigation of specific events but are ss successful in synthesizing information to analyze where broad system improvements might take place or in communicating alerts and concerns to other institutions in some states reporting systems established by law are not operating due to lack of funds the iom recommended that state regulatory programs continue to operate mandatory reporting systems as they have the authority to investigate specific cases and issue penalties or fines however in order to establish nationwide mandatory reporting system the iom recommended that congress 1 designate the national quality forum as the entity responsible for issuing and maintaining reporting standards to be used by states 2 require health care institutions to report standardized information on defined list of adverse events and 3 provide funds and technical expertise to state governme nts to establish or improve their error reporting systemshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31983crs9 18 for more information on the nqf list go to httpwwwqualityforumorg in march 2003 nashp released

aggregate reports from states to identify persistent safety issues voluntary reporting systems as complement to the mandatory reporting of serious errors the iom recommended establishing vol untary reporting systems to collect information on less serious mistakes that result in little or harm information gathered by voluntary reporting systems may be used to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in health care systems and to make imp rovements to prevent serious errors from occurring aviation safety reporting system the iom report and several more recent analyses have all highlighted the aviation safety reporting system asrs as potential model for establishing national voluntary systems for reporting medi cal errors asrs was created in 1975 to encourage pilots

agency decides whether any corrective action is necessary on casebycase basis by considering the unexpectedness and seriousness of the ev ent the vulnerability of the population affected and the available options for prev ention if corrective action is warranted fda generally pursues one of three strate gies the first and most common strategy is to negotiate with the ma nufacturer to make the

improve the agencys ability to monitor and improve the safe use of medications32 the proposal requires manufacturers to submit to fda within 15 days all reports they receive of actual and potential ie nearmiss medication errors an example of potential medi cation error would be pharmacist who selects the wrong drug because of s imilar sounding name but catches the mistake before dispensing the medication if the pharmacist elects to report the incident to the manufacturer then under the proposed rule the manufacturer must report it to fda the proposal also requires the use of internationally agreed definitions and reporting formats which will allow companies to prepare single report for submission to major regulatory agencies worldwide designing effective reporting systems table 2 summarizes the design features that analysts have identified as essential for an effective reporting program an effective program is one that encourages reporting analyzes the data to identify vulnerabilities in the health care system and promotes the development of preventive strategies to improve patient safety33 the iom report recommended against establishi ng comprehensive national voluntary reporting system modeled after asrs fo r one thing severa l national reporting systems already exist particularly for dication errors moreover comprehensive national reporting system would require an enormous investment in funding and personnel in view of the potential volum of reports with an estimated 1 million errors each year in hospital settings alone pl us an even greater number of close calls the analysis of even fraction of these events would require many expert analysts all of whom would have to be recruited and trainedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31983crs16 table 2 design characteristics of voluntary medical errors reporting systems characteristic explanation userfriendly the reporting process is broadly understood and report forms are readily available and userfriendly nonpunitive reporters are not subject to retaliation or punishment from others as result of reporting errors confidential the identities of the patient reporter and health care institution are not revealed to third party privileged reports are protected from legal discovery and inadmissible in court or other proceedings prior to deidentification independent the system is independent of any authority with power to punish the reporter or health care institution expert analysis reports are evaluated by expe rts who understand the clinical circumstances and are trained to recognize underlying systems causes systemsoriented analysis and recommendations focus on systems processes and products rather than on individual performance responsive reports are analyzed promptly recommendations are rapidly disseminated and reporters receive timely feedback deidentification aggregated deidentified data are publicly available source based on leape reporting of adverse events raymond and crane design considerations the iom said that the existing reporting systems should be encouraged and promoted within health care organizations and that better use s hould be made of the reported information new systems should be focused on specific areas of medical care eg surgery pediatrics and even particular care settings that approach would help manage the potential vol ume of reports and match th expertise to the problems there also needs to be mechanism for sharing information across different reporting systems report in one system may have relevance for another system eg errors in surgery that also involve medications along with its recommendation on reporting systems the io m also recommended the establishment of federal center for patie nt safety to set national go als fund research evaluate methods for identifying and preventing dical errors and disseminate information on best practices patient safety and quality improvement act to encourage providers to report errors without fear of the data being used in medical malpractice lawsuit the iom recommended that information collected under voluntary reporting system be prot ected from legal discovery and

by the help committee overview of hr 663 the house passed the patient safety and quality improve ment act hr 663 hrept 10828 on march 12 2004 by vote of 4186 hr 663 would have provided legal protection to certain cat egories of documents and communications termed patient safety work product wh ich are developed by health care providers for reporting to psos patient safety work product would be privileged and not subject to civil or administrative subpoena discovery in connection with civil or administrative proceeding or disclosure under the freedom of information act moreover it could not be used in an adverse employment action against an employee who in good faith reports the info rmation to provider with the intention of having it reported to patie nt safety organization or reports the data directly to patient safety organizati on patient safety work product would not encompass documents or communications that are part of traditional medical record keeping such information includes patients medical records billing records hospital policies and records of drug deliveries that is informa tion that has been developed maintained or which exists separately from patient safety work product only information specifically created for psos would be protected under the housepassed bill psos would be certified by ahrq to collect and analyze patient safety wo rk product submitted by provi ders and to develop and disseminate recommendations for systemsbase d solutions to improve patient safety and health care quality any public or private organizati on seeking pso certification would have to meet certain criteria fo r example they would have to contain appropriately qualified staff including li censed or certified dical professionals and not be part of health insurance company pso would also have to be managed and operated independently from any provider that reported to it the house bill did not include any language to encourage the establishment of psos in every state or region of the country hr 663 would have required ahrq to tablish national da tabase to receive and analyze deidentified information submitted by psos information in the national database would be available to the public the bill also would have requiredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31983crs18 34 interoperability refers to the ability of two or more systems eg computers

interoperability of health information technology systems34 in addition to the provisions aimed at supporting voluntary reporting of medical errors hr 663 instructed the fda to i ssue standards for uni product identifiers eg bar codes on the packaging of drugs and biological products it also would have authorized grant programs for elect ronic prescribing and other information technology to prevent errors finally hr 663 would have created medical information technology advisory board to make recommendations to hhs and congress on fostering the development and us of information technologies to reduce medical errors analysis of hr 663 v s 544 the senate took up hr 663 on july 22 2004 substituted alte rnative language s 720 as amended and passed the measur by voice vote while s 720 had the same basic structure as the housepasse d legislation there were several key differences lawmakers were unable to r econcile those differences before the 108th congress adjourned on march 8 2005 nator jeffords reintroduced the patient safety and quality improvement act s 544 s 544 which is identical to last years senatepassed measure s 720 was unanimously appr oved by the senate help committee on march 9 2005 table 3 on page 22 compares the patient safety legislation with the iom reports recommendations table 4 which begins on page 23 provides sidebyside comp arison of hr 663 and s 544 definition of protected information as passed by the house hr 663 would have provided legal pr otection to patient safe ty work product which it defined as any document or communication th at is developed by provider for the purpose of reporting to pso and reporte d to pso created by pso or that would reveal the workings of patient safety evaluation system the bill defined patient safety evaluation system as process for collecting managing or analyzing information submitted to or by pso pa tient safety work product would not include document or communication that is deve loped maintained or exists separately from any patient safety evaluation system eg patients medical record or any other patient or hospital record the legal protections in s 544 apply to all patient safety data when the senate bill was first approved by the help committee during the 108th congress some analysts raised concerns that the defi nition of patient safety data was too broad it included for example any data that could result in improve d patient safety or health care quality or health care outcomes that are collected from provider critics of this language argued that it would extend the bills evidentiary privilege and confidentiality protections to wide range of quality and outcomesrelated information as result the bill would have the unintended effect of preemptinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31983crs19 state laws that require hospitals to report infection rates medical outcomes and serious adverse events to address those concerns the definition of patient safety da ta was modified to more closely resemble the language in hr 663 which was tied to the activities of psos s 544 defines patient safety data as any data reports records memoranda analyses or written or oral statements that are collected or developed by provider for reporting within 60 days to pso re quested by pso and reported within 60 days reported to provider by pso or collected by pso from another pso or developed by pso the definition also states that patient safety data shall not include information including patients medical record billing and discharge information or any other patie nt or provider record that is collected or developed separately from and that exists separately from patient safety data this separate data provision has been criticized as ci rcular because it says in effect that information that is not patient safety data is not patie nt safety data s 544 also includes provision that is intended to protect mandatory state reporting laws the provision states that nothing in the bill limits the reporting of information that is not patient safety data to federal state or local governmental agency for public health surveillance i nvestigation or other public health purposes or health oversight purposes hr 663 incl uded comparable language it said that nothing in the bill preempts or otherwise affects state law requiring provider to report information that is not patient safety work product privilege hr 663 would have protected patient safety work product from discovery in connection with civil and administrative proceeding and from admission as evidence or disclosure in any such proceeding patient safety work product would not be protected from use in criminal proceedings by comparison s 544 would prohibit lawyers from obtaining or using patient safe ty data in civil administrative and criminal proceedings unless judge determined that the information contained evidence of wanton and criminal act to directly harm the patient that language was included is an effort to ensure that the legislation does not unduly compromise the rights of injured patients to obtain compensation in its 1999 report the iom focused on protecting voluntarily reported patient safety information from discovery and admission as evidence in civil and administrative proceeding noting that ins tances of criminal prosecution for medical errors are exceptionally rare the inte nt was to encourage the voluntary reporting of information about near misses and other problems that would otherwise go unreported were it not for legal protection analysis of such information would then be used to identify vulnerabilities in health care systems voluntary reporting systems as envisioned by the iom would not interfere with the mandatory reporting of more serious errors as required unde r state law and other accountability systems confidentiality s 544 designates patient safe ty data as confidential and not subject to disclosure except in certain specified circumstances eg disclosure by provider to pso negligent or intentional disclosure of patient safety data in violation of the bills confidentiality provi sions is subject to civil fines of up to 10000 per violationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31983crs20 hr 663 also specified th circumstances under whic h disclosure of patient safety work product iden tifiable and nonidentifiable was permitted and provided for penalties of up to 10000 per violation fo r disclosures other than those permitted unlike s 544 the house bill did not expressly state that work product is confidential though this was implied in the bills language hr 663 said that disclosures in violation of the bills provisions are unlawful and subject to fines provided such disclosures constitute negligent or knowing breach of confidentiality both hr 663 and s 554 state that if th disclosure is in violation of the hipaa privacy rule then the hipaa penalties apply instead for details of the civil and criminal penalties under hi paa see crs report rs20500 medical records privacy questions and answers on the hipaa rule pso certification and listing under the patient safety legislation providers would voluntarily submit informati on on medical errors to public or private entities designated as psos the psos would analyze the data and develop and disseminate evidencebased information to providers to help them implement changes that would improve patient safe ty hr 663 would have required ahrq to establish process for certifying psos the bill listed several criteria for certification for example pso must not be component of health insurer or other entity that offers group health plan or health insuran ce coverage and must be managed controlled and operated independently from any provider that reports patient safety work produc t to the pso that would appear to exclude the department of veterans affairs va among others from pso certification as previously discussed the va has develope d an internal confidential nonpunitive reporting and analysis system and is widely recognized as leader in patient safety hr 663 also would have required psos th at are components of other organizations to protect the confidentiality of patient sa fety work product and ensure that their mission did not create conflict of intere st with the rest of the organization by comparison s 544 relies on pr ocess of pso selfcertification organizations would be required to submit certification to ahrq that they intend to perform the various pso activities specified in the legislation the agency would review the submission and if acceptable pl ace the name of the organization on list of certified psos s 544 does not include any criteria that place limits on the types of public or private entities that seek pso certification and listing nor does it address the issue of conflict of interest civil penalties as noted above both bills provide for civil monetary penalties of up to 10000 for each negligent or intentional disc losure of patient safety information in violation of the pr ovisions in the legislation the bills also prohibit health care provider from taking any adverse employ ment action against an employee who in good faith reports inform ation to the provider with the intention of having it reported to pso or who reports the informa tion directly to pso but whereas hr 663 included civil fines of up to 20000 per violation for providers who took such action s 544 permits an empl oyee to sue their employer to enjoin wrongful adverse employment action and to obtain equitable relief including reinstatement back pay nd restoration of benefitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31983crs21 35 more information is available at httpwwwhhsgovonchitframeworkunlike the house bill s 544 specifies th at providers include staterun facilities because the federal government cannot give state employees right to sue the state s 544 includes provision requiring state hos pitals to agree to be subject to such civil action in order to assert the privileges established by the legislation drug and biological pr oduct identification hr 663 instructed fda to require unique product identifiers on the packaging of drugs and biological products that provision would appear to have been met by the agencys february 26 2004 bar code rule
