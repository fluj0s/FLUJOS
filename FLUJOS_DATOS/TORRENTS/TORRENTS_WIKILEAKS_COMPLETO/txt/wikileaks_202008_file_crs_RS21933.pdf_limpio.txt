organization prot ection act of 2003 hr 3369 on september 14 the house passed hr 1084 and hr 1787 but failed to pass hr 3369 tort law is primarily state law and federal tort reform bills such as these are generally designed to limit lia bility under state tort law hr 1084 the volunteer pilot organization prot ection act hr 1084 would amend the volunteer protection act of 19971 the vpa provides immunity for ordinary negligence to volunteers of nonprofit organi zations or governmental tities acting within the scope of their responsibilities provided that i f appropriate or requi red the volunteer was properly licensed certified or authorized by the appropriate authorities the immunity does not apply to willful or criminal conduct gross neg ligence reckless misconduct or conscious flagrant i ndifference to the rights or safety of the individual harmed by the volunteer it also does not apply to rm caused by volunteer operating motor vehicle vessel aircraft or other vehicle for which the stat requires the operator or the owner of the vehicle craft or vessel to possess an operato rs license or b maintain insurance hr 1084 would create an exception to this aircraft exception it would make the vpa apply if the harm was caused by volunteer of nonprofit volunteer pilot organization that flies for public benefit while the volunteer was flying in furtherance of the purpose of the organization and was operatin g an aircraft for which the volunteer was properly licensed and individually insuredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21933crs2 2 eliminating joint and several lia bility means that if more than one defendant is found liable then each is liable only in proportion to its per centage of responsibility for the harm the vpa eliminates joint and several liability only for noneconomic damages which refer to pain and suffering and other nonpecuniary losses thus th vpa does not change state law to the extent that state law allows joint and several liability fo r economic damages such as medical costs lost wages etc with joint and several liability each defendant who is found responsible is liable for 100 percent of the damages though the pl aintiff may not recover more than once 3 hrept 108679 108th cong 2d sess sept 13 2004the vpa also does not apply to nonprofit organizations or g overnmental entities themselves they may be held vicariously liable for the negligence of their volunteers even if volunteers are immune hr 1084 w ould create an exception to this provision too it would provide that nonprofit volunt eer pilot organization that flies for public benefit and the staff missi on coordinators officers and directors whether volunteers or otherwise of such organization or referring agency of such organization shall not be liable with respect to harm caused to any person by volunteer of such organization while the volunteer is flying in furtheran ce of the purpose of the organization and was operating an aircraft for which the voluntee r was properly license d and has certified to such organization that such volunteer has in force individually insurance for operating such aircraft the vpa also eliminates joint and seve ral liability for nonec onomic damages with respect to volunteers work for nonprofit orga nizations and governmental entities and allows punitive damages only where the plain tiff establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the harm was proximately caused by an action of such volunteer which constitutes willful or criminal misconduct or conscious fl agrant indifference to the rights or safety of the individual harmed2 these provisions would not be amended by hr 1084 and thus would benefit the volunteer pilots and organizations and their staffs etc to which the bill would extend the vpas protection the vpa does not prevent states from gr anting volunteers additional protection from liability and it allows any state to enact statute declaring the vpa inapplicable in the state the reported version of hr 1084 whic h the house passed would direct the attorney general to study the availability of insurance for nonprofit volunteer pilot organizations3 hr 1787 the good samaritan firefighter assi stance act of 2003 hr 1787 would not amend any existing federal law but would pr ovide simply that person who donates fire control or fire rescue equipment to volunteer fire company shall not be liable for civil damages under any state or federal w for personal injuries property damage or loss or death proximately caused by the equipment after the donation this immunity would not apply if donor exercised gross negligence or intentional misconduct and would not apply if the donor is the manufacturer of the equipment httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21933crs3 4 hrept 108680 108th cong

prot ection act of 2003 hr 3369 would also not amend any existing federal law it would provide that nonprofit athletic organization would not be liable for harm cau sed in the adoption of rules for sanctioned or approved athletic competitions or practices if the nonprofit athletic organization 1 was acting within the scope of its duties and 2 was if required properly licensed certified or authorized for the competition or practice in the state in which the harm occurred or where the competition or practi ce was undertaken this immunity would not apply however if the harm was caused by willful or criminal misconduct gross negligence or reckless misconduct on the pa rt of the nonprofit at hletic association hr 3369 woul d not preempt state laws that 1 require nonprofit athletic organization to adhere to ri sk management procedures in cluding mandatory training of its employees agents or volunteers 2 make nonprofit athletic organization liable for the acts or omissions of its employees agents and volunteers to the same extent as an employer is liable for the acts or omissions of its employees or 3 make limitation of liability inapplicable if civil action was brought by an officer of state or local government pursuant to state or local law hr 3369 w ould not prevent states from granting nonprofit athletic organizations additional protection from liability the reported version of hr 3369 contained amendments5 pros and cons supporters of the three house bills have re portedly said that the bills are needed to ensure that people are willing to volunteer for the activities that the bills cover they also claim that nonprofit volunteer pilot organi zations are operating without insurance coverage because of rising premiums6 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21933crs4 7 idothers however have questioned whether there is need for action they also reportedly expressed concern that hr 3369 might shield nonprofit athletic groups from lawsuits on issues such as civ il rights and insurance disputes7
