6407c02 shspec26 ow modernized and revised there are two stages to auditing 1 get into comm 2 do something for the pc it is notorious that few scientologists will inquire deeply into exactly what someone did this is because in order to do something for someone one must have comm line which is supported or made possible by reality and affinity and where person is too demanding the affinity tends to break down so the auditor doesnt want to break the affinity line hence he never gets into the second stage of processing the one after comm line has been established in which the auditor does something for the pc the pc may feel miraculously better just from having comm line established but the two stages are like walking up to the bus and driving off if you dont drive off you never arrive anywhere any upset the pc has is actually so delicately balanced that once you have gotten in communication with the pc it is easy to do something about the upset batty ideas and doingnesses are particularly easy to get rid of since they are based on very slippery logic you could have the guys case fall apart before your eyes just from your asking what are you doing that is sensible and why is it sensible once your comm line and auditing discipline are perfect so you dont disturb the comm line you can forage around amongst his aberrations to great effect comm line is only valuable to the extent that you can use it to move around in the morass which he calls his ideas if you used the process given above aberration would fall to pieces use perfect discipline to keep in the comm line audit well get your comm cycle in let your cycles of action be completed then you can do something for the pc the discipline of auditing is what makes it possible for you to do something for the pc unlike other therapies that is all it is for in fact this gets you up to the door now you have to go through it the magic of auditing and the difficult part is to get in comm with the pc once you have done that doing something for the pc is very easy since his aberrations are so delicately balanced if you are not in comm with the pc he presents himself as accused by you he justifies himself pc who is in comm with the auditor wont be trying to justify himself and uphold his status you can go out of comm with pc by not doing anything for him you lose the rfactor with the person and you go out of comm process is simply combination of mental mechanisms which when inspected will pass away all auditing is subtractive it consists of asising things on the case you can overaudit by trying to get more ta action from process when you have gotten it all you can underaudit by leaving off before getting all the ta action out it takes only observation of the pc when you have done something for the pc you will have gotten the ta action off the process if you have done something for the pc ta action will cease and it wont stop until then dont do something for the pc after you have already done something for him on particular process or in particular area if you go on in the area you will only restimulate something else in the pc if you are clever you will run process that cyclically runs out of ta and end it there at the end of cycle in r6 you develop sensitivity for when an item is dead and you will leave it if you ask for it one more time you are dead you will get tocky needle and an arc breaky pc at lower levels you can get one thing run out acknowledge it very well and go on using the same process in way which makes it whole new minor cycle within your major process cycle auditors who cant do this have to run lots of different processes but they could get much more out of one process if they got slick at directing attention you dont necessarily change the process when the pc has cognited if it is general process that can apply to lots of areas get the cognition out of one area then find another area you dont have to change the process you can just change the subject of the process if you use this approach you have to ask yourself all along have i done something for the pc if you notice that the pcs answers are dodgy recognize that your comm line isnt established some processes such as what could you say to mewhat would you rather not say to do two things at once both getting into comm and doing something for the pc eg by getting off withholds all this is prelude to ow because ow is the greatest comm line wrecker that an auditor has to deal with withhold running is peculiar in that it can put in comm line but it is avoided for fear of breaking down comm line it can get confusing when the same process that puts in the comm line to the pc also does something for the pc this tends to cause confusion in which the difference between putting in comm line and doing something for the pc gets lost ow is senior to the bank that doesnt mean that when the bank is gone you will still have ow it means that ow keys out the bank handled rightly it puts in the comm line but if the auditor permits the pc to sit there with withholds in the session instead of protecting his comm line as is his intention he ends up destroying the comm line by missing the withhold and letting the pc arc break another thing that makes ow dicey is that the word withhold occurs in the bank furthermore withhold is an outofarc process and cannot be run by itself done fortunately does not appear in the bank so you can run donenot done however the common denominator of the bank is done done is high order of lock on all forms of reactivity done to is another part of the bank unless the auditor uses specific name with it that is not in the bank see p 595 above re use of nouns in processes ptp can be created by failure to complete comm cycle method of handling ptps would be to ask the pc at start of session are there any communications you have left incomplete the pc would then rattle off several and not register further on ptps the reason why he hasnt completed the communication is because of the overts he has against what he has the ptp with you never have ptp with something that you dont have an overt on so first ptp is based on or connected to an incomplete comm cycle then to done this follows the pattern of what to do in auditing see p 642 above that is the way the bank stacks up even psychosomatic illness is based on an incomplete communication in extremis you can handle psychosomatic illness as ptp you can handle it nonadventurously with what communication to or about the illness havent you delivered or you can ask what comm havent you completed to the blumjum the more adventurous cycle is the done and notice that you have just got the same cycle as that of auditor to pc establish comm then do something the severity of the illness has nothing to do with the speed of release of it or the difficulty of handling it the what communication hasnt been completed is easy it requires nothing of your auditing discipline but it is the lickandapromise the done takes more skill knowledge and perseverance the session patter could go like this auditor ptp pc yes auditor any comm you havent completed pc blah blah if the ptp is then gone then there is need to continue if the ptp is not gone then get off the pcs overts there are seventeen ways to get off series of overts there are overts in chains recurring withholds recurring overts basicbasic of something etc etc you have to ask the proper questions to get the overts suppose the pc keeps giving you the same often minor overt it is part of chain you need to ask the right question and audit by chain you must also be prepared to find overt at the bottom of the chain but man is basically good despite his reactive bank the bank is only composed to make man commit overts which is against his better nature the bank is the perfect trap because having committed the overts the individual wont go on communicating you do not want to talk to people that you have wronged you withhold to prevent further overts that is the fundamental think of man before he goes so far downscale that he dramatizes obsessively what have you done has two branches 1 what have you done that is socially reprehensible and prevents you from communicating with others 2 just having done something both are valid but watch out for the pc using the process to look for an explanation of what has happened to him this pc will give suppositional answers which you dont want he will invent things he hasnt done to get rid of the consequences that he is experiencing he is trying to find good enough overt to explain what is occurring in his life he will often go far backtrack to find it steer this pc back to where he belongs all you want is what he is absolutely certain that he has done so you have to make sure that he is certain he did the thing if the auditor is asking and the pc is doing b the communication factor is out so the auditor wont do something for the pc you might ask what are you quite positive that you have done ow is likely to be the biggest area of recovery for the pc provided the auditor isnt too tender and will steer the pc you have to observe when the pc thinks that it wasnt an overt if the guy gives you something he did as an overt but obviously doesnt feel that it was an overt then you must ask why wasnt this an overt and get itsa then you might ask was this really an overt after all at this point you might get the glee of insanity then you might get long worry about this with ta action eventually he will realize that it was an overt meanwhile you are raising the cause level of the pc you could go into done in numerous other categories however you may fail in trying to direct somebody in these fields
