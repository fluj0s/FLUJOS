worker remittances money sent back to the workers home countries has grown with the us economys increasing use of foreign and immigrant labor the cost of international money transmission is important to these workers and the recipient countries because of the relatively low incomes of the workers and the intended recipients nd the positive impact on the recipient countries economies remittances from th united states are sent through banks and credit unions money transmitter companies both large and small postal services and individual couriers currently the us foreign remittance market is dominated by nonbank financial institutions nbfis the main reason immigrants use nbfis for remittance services is that th workers are often unbanked that is they do not have an account with depository fi nancial institution the cost associated with these money transmissions is ofte n high foreign workers often lose significant percentage of the value of th eir remittances through fees and unfavorable exchange rates in the united states the actual licensi ng and primary regulation of most non bank money transmitters is matter of state law several types of federal laws for example antimoney laundering laws are applicable to all money transmitters federal law requires money transmitters to register with the treasury departments financial crimes enforcement network fincen fincen requires the nbfis to be licensed if they operate in state that requires licensing in latin america and the caribbean countries the monetary regulatory authorities led by the central banks have not greatly intervened in the remittance market none of the countries discusse d in this report have specific regulations controlling the flow of remittances the central banks usually track the flow of remittances and make estimates on the total volume coming into their countries but in general financial authorities allow money transmitters to operate with minimal regulation letting the remittance market regulate itself congressional oversight hearings on remittance services offered by u s banks credit unions and nonbanks were held in february 2002 by the senate banking committee and in october 2003 by the hous financial services committee the hearings focused on the high costs of remittance transmission and how to introduce unbanked immigrants to mainstream fi nancial services in the 108th congress legislation to facilitate fo reign remittances has been introduced hr 2074 would provide increased disclosure of all f ees and rates involved in these money transmissions title iii of omnibus

america introduction the cost of international money transmission is important to foreign and immigrant1 workers and the recipient countries because of the relatively low incomes of the workers and the intended recipients and the impact these remittances have on the local economies by one estimate latin american immigrants who earn 25000 or less year tend to routinely send hom payments or remittances of about 200 monthly to family friends and communities the cost associated with these money transmissions is often high remitters can significant percentage of the value of their remittances through fees and unfavor able exchange rates in addition the total cost of money transfer is frequently not fully disclosed when the transfer is initiated there is evidence that the recent growth in competition in this market is leading to lower transfer costs this report provides background and analysis of issues surrounding the high cost foreign workers often pay to send money to their families and communities in latin america it begins with an explanation of how the remittance market functions in the united states various methods of remitting money to latin america and the costs associated with money transmissions are discussed using selected latin american and caribbean c ountries as examples the report shows how competition in and government regulation and supervision of re mittance markets affect the price the report concludes with di scussion of policy issues and current legislation that would facilitate fair and equitable pricing of foreign remittances the business of providing foreign work ers with the means to send money back to their home countries is expected to continue to grow with the us economys increasing utilization of foreign labor the us servicedominated economy has increased the demand for low wage workers many of whom come from latin america and the caribbean the volume of remittances has grown with this labor force one study

repor t commissioned by the interamerican development bank to total more than 18 billion these estimates may be low because it is difficult to estimate the volume of funds sent to home countries through informal channels such as personal couriers and letters remittances through these informal channels are largely undocumented and therefore it is extremely difficult to calculate the total

remittance market is do minated by nonbank financial institutions nbfis4 one 2003 estimate is that the fore ign remittance market in the united states could be as large as 28 billion5 the vast majority of remittances are transferred electronically or by internati onal money order the main reason foreign remittance customers use nonbank money tr ansmitters is that they are often unbanked that is they do not have an acc ount with depository financial institution the foreign workers lack of bank accounts is attributable to poor english language skills low levels of education high cost of banking services little or infrequent need for banking services and questionable u s residency status generally nbfis provide their customers with the conve nience of longer hours of operation than offered by banks and credit unions in addition money transmission services may be an ancillary service the foreign remittance customer may be able to cash paycheck send money to family in his hom country and shop for groceries or fill his cars gas tank moreover most fore ign workers have never held bank account in their lives and many are distrustful of banks in mexico for example only 20 of families have bank accounts6 immigrants from other parts of latin america are likely to have an aversion to banks due to history of losing money deposited in banks in their home countries through bank

institutions did not view low wage foreign workers as potential regular banking customers they were likely to return to their country or move to other parts of the united states current interest stems from the growing immigrant populations in parts of the united states and efforts by the federal reserve system to encourage depository institutions to r each out to unbanked consumers9 remittance

and expanded the products used in the money transfer process the great majority of sender and receiver transfer agents use computers linked to central office to process the money transfer bank of

used paperbased money orders remain popular because in many of the recipient countries money order type instrument s are familiar ways of making certain payments in add ition they may be more convenient and cheaper method of transfer money orders can be delivered through the postal system to the recipients at their local post office the cost to tr ansfer up to 700 to mexico by us postal service money order is 75011 however theft is major problem of remitting with money order because it takes such l ong time for money order to reach its recipient by the time the stolen money order is determined to be missing usually two to three weeks it has already been cashed the volume of remittances made through money orders is undocumented seeking to reduce the cost of sending money home many foreign workers still rely on hand delivery and even personal letters money is sometimes delivered by the actual sender encomendero through frequent trips home or by third party viajero another way large number of mig rants avoid paying the high fees of remitting funds safely is to form hometown associations when members of these associations are returning home they deliver other members money directly to the recipients for nominal f ee there are reportedly more than 400 such groups from mexico alone in the united states12 the volume of remittances made by hometown associations letters and ot her informal couriers is unknown the cost and exposure to fraud as result of using cour iers and letters is not known cost the price of sending remittance can vary significantly number of factors affect the transaction fee charged including operating costs the volume sent the transfer mechanism and the level of market competition in both the sending and receiving country the exchan ge rate used in the trans action can significantly affect the funds actually delivered to the recipi ent see discussion on exchange rates that follows the estimated cost to remitting firms of executing

entrants into the business and the resulting competition have lowered the price of sending remittances the general trend of the cost to fore ign workers over last few years has been decline in transaction fees in 1999 for example western union charged 22 for transferring up to 200 to mexico and by 2001 the fee had dropped to 15 in 1999 the average charge for sending remittances to latin american countries totaled 15 of the amount being sent in 2002 the av erage charge has dropped to 75 of the amount transferred foreign remittances are still very profitable business for money

union defends its charges by arguing that the company provides premium service it indicated its service is guaranteed in terms of location speed reliability and safety western union has large number of transfer agents and extensive geographic locations some of the companys outlets offer additional customer services such as notifying recipients that their money has arrived and providing toll free numbers to clients to check on the status of transaction14 bank remittance services usually are credits to deposit account in its branch or correspondent banks branch in the recipien ts country the recipient may or may not be notified of the credit by the banks i nvolved credit union fees are usually the lowest but there are very few credit unions in latin america consequently getting the remittance in the hands of the recipient could become very expensive when time and transportation are consid ered both banks and credit unions are expanding the number of agents and branches of banks to which remittances can be delivered however increasing the convenience of remittances may raise the banks and credit unions priceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31659crs7 the exchange rate factor how much purchasing power the recipient of the money transfer gets depends on the exchange rate used by the money transmitter benchmark exchange rates are set daily by the international currency markets money transmitters often arbitrarily and unilaterally impose exchange rates that vary significantly from the benchmark the difference between the two rates is called the spread the spread can equate to an dditional fee deducted dur ing the transaction if the transmitter does not promulgate or notify the sender of the exchange rate being used in the transaction the sender may be unaware of this hidden fee when initiating the transaction artificially established exch ange rates can significantly increase the profit from transaction the spread can vary considerably table 3 provides an example of the range of exchange rates offered by western ion to nine countries in april 2001 the table compares the western union rate with the market benchmark rate and profits are calculated for 250 transaction ther is evidence that competition in the remittance market both in the united stat and recipient c ountries has reduced these hidden fees competition encourages the disclosure of exchange rates for comparison shopping by consumers table 3 compares two sets of figures for mexico and shows significant drop in spread profits between 1999 and 2001 which can be linked to increased competition in addition dollariza tion where residents of country use foreign currency alongside or instead of the domestic currency has decreased profits from exchange rate spread table 3 exchange rates offered to

from growing number of small businesses that are outgrowths of courier services and hometown associa tions to large corporations in 2001 the major remitter in mexico wa s western union the company had 6300 agents located in mexico16 one estimate attributed at least 41 of the mexican remittance market to western union and moneygram17 the mexican banking industry has added significantly to the competition bancom er banamax and bancomex are major players offering direct money transfer services by establishing offices in the united states these banks also work jointly with other money transmitters like moneygram and ria envia the banks provide customer services similar to those of western union for example they send notices to the recipient that the money is available for pickup at the transfer agen t or bank branch location bancomer also works with the united states postal service to offer the dinero seguro program in addition mexican credit unions are becoming involved in remittance services there is evidence that western union has gradually lost some market share in mexico to the entrance of new competitors on the other hand the lower fees resulting from the highly competitive market may make it more difficult for smaller andor new entrants to survive salvador salvador was the second largest of the foreign remittance markets orozco studied the salvadoran population in the united states is estimated to be at least 1 million and in 2001 they transferred almost 2 billion back home in january 2001 salvadors economy was dollarized the government made the us dollar legal tender in the country while maintaining parity with the colon the local currency this action reduced the cost of remittances in ddition competition has kept fees lower the two largest competitors are western union and gigante express each with about 25 share of th market gigante express is courier service company that sells and sends mone orders salvadoran banks are active players

httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31659crs10 dominican republic the remittance market in the dominican republic is one of the least competitive in latin america despite having large presence in the united states nearly 1 million immigrants and high vol ume of 18 billion in remittances the reason is that an association of more than 15 remittance companies dominates the market the association is called the associacion dominicana empresas remesadoras divisas inc members of the association generally have similar prices this is evident in table 4 where the difference between the maximum and minimum transaction cost is just 5 for the dominican republic while the other countries show much greater range th companies generally charge fixed fee of 8 for sending dollars plus 5 of the amount sent for sending local currency the fixed fee is 5 plus 5 of the amount nt consequently the average cost of remittances in the dominican re public tends to be higher than the other countries studied however the charges usually incl ude home delivery service when offered in other countries this serv ice involves additional fees for the most part banks are relatively uninvolved in the re mittance business the do minican republic does have cooperative system similar to credit unions the association of cooperatives is working on the development of an atm netw ork that would be able to offer less expensive remittance services jamaica jamaicas remittance market is the leas t competitive of the five countries consequently money transfer s tend to be more expensive the jamaican population in the united states is estimated to be 800000 and in 2001 they transferred approximately 900 million back home one company western union dominates the remittance market through an arrang ement with local firm grace kennedy remittance services ltd grace kennedy manages 65 to 70 of the 200000 transfers per month from the united states the major competitor is jamaica national overseas part of building soci ety which controls about 10 of the remittance market table 3 suggests the exchange rate spread also contributes to high price of remittances to jamaica some of the other banks in jamaica are agents for moneygram and their transaction fees are similar to grace kennedy the jamaica cooperative credit union league is currently working with irnet to offer remittance services guatemala guatemala has relatively small immigrant population in the united states less than 500000 but they sent nearly 700 million back home in 2001 the remittance market is competitive the large remittance

established new office to work with immigrant associations to encourage remittance investment in their mexican hometowns salvador as in mexico the central banking authorities exercise little regulatory control over the salvadoran remittance market the central banks main concern is that institutions authorized to carry out international financial operations keep records of incoming flows and their sources the salvadoran government has also established an office to link the government with emigrants the office works with hometown associations on development project s the office

the federal level in this data gathering process usa patriot act the implementation of the usa patriot act raises issues for immigrants seeking financial services and for the financial institutions providing those services an overall goal of this act is to prevent detect and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrori sm although immigrants sending small amounts of money home are not directly ta rgeted under this law it has resulted in increased scrutiny of the remittance market costs resulting from compliance with certain provisions of the act have proved prohibitive for smaller money transmitters for example in april 2002 the treasur department publishe d an interim rule requiring nbfis to establish antimoney undering programs commensurate with the risks posed by their size location and financial activities24 written policies procedures and internal cont rols must be developed th include record keeping reporting and verifying customer identifi cation banks and credit unions are subject to record keeping and reporting requirements that build on existing law these requirements have made it difficult or expensive for individual institutions to do business with foreign banks and remittance companies despite costly examinations by government agencies the number of financial firms entering into the remittance trade has been increasing which is helping to drive down the price of remittances25 the treasury jointly with other federal regulators have issued minimum standardsfor identifying customers opening accounts at depository financial institutions these standards have made it more diffi cult for immigrants to establish account relationships with banks and credit unions because they fear the added scrutiny of the standards may endanger their immigration status
