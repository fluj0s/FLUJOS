energy prices faced by consumers have rise n steeply in the last few years and it is likely that spending on energy substituted at least to some extent for spending on other goods and services it is widely believed th at increases in energy prices particularly gasoline negatively affect tourism the da ta presented provide partial and preliminary support on an aggregate level on the other hand there is anecdotal evidence that the effect may not be large in addition onl part of any slowdown in tourism should be attributed to energy prices this repor t will be updated when warranted by events energy prices and consumer spending consumers have faced sharply rising energy prices in the last few years most recently they increased 28 between the fi rst quarter of 2005 and the second quarter of 2006 table 1 motor gasoline prices which rose 39 during the period had increased 31 from their 2002 average to the average fo r the first half of 2005 prices paid by households for natural gas in the second quarter of 2006 were 13 higher than in the first quarter of 2005 but had been 34 and 28 high er in the fourth quarter of 2005 and first quarter of 2006 similar to gasoline heating il prices rose 33 between the first quarter of 2005 and the second quarter of 2006 and had already increas ed substantially from their 2002 average inasmuch as the price elasticity of demand for purchases of energy in the short run is low1 higher energy prices have led to noticeably increased aggregate spending on energy in absolute terms and also as percentage of total personal consumptionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22496crs2 expenditures thus energy all forms accounted for 72 of total us consumer spending in the second quarter of 2006 compar ed with 63 in the first quarter of 2005 and 53 in 2002 base d upon data generated by the bureau of economic analysis bea us aggregate consumer spending on gasoline rose from 26 in 2002 to 34 in the first quarter of 2005 to 42 in the

forms respectively are used very widely aggregate spending for natural gas and heating oil as percentages of total persona l consumption expenditures in those regions cannot be obtained however as the bea data are on na tional level and percentages calculated on that level would understate the effect of gas and oil price in creases on households in those regions other things being equal the increase in energys percentage of total personal consumption expenditures from 53 in 2002 to 72 in the second quarter of 2006 means shift in spending of 150 billion at an annual rate2 to energy unless the increase in personal income in current dollars between 2002 and the second quarter of 2006 annual rate3 was sufficient to fully accommodate the increased spending on energy it is likely that such spending replaced spending on other goods and services at least to some extent effects on tourism it is widely believed that increases in ener gy prices particularly gasoline prices have negative effect on tourism the data pr esented above and belo w provide preliminary and not unanimous support of this on an aggreg ate level anecdotal evidence also mixed tends to indicate little effect of energy price increases on tourism in any event as noted below not all of any decline in tourism should be attributed to energy prices some data suggest that there has been some slowdown in tourism in the first half of 2006 there were 09 fewer air passenger enplanements4 than in the first half of 2005 the number of air passenger miles was only 13 greater and motor gasoline consumption was only 06 greater table 2 these relative changes are less than the increases of 19 in constant dollar gross domestic product gdp and 25 in constant dollar aggregate personal income the second quarter 2006 profits recorded by the airline industry seem to contradict the above evid ence of slowdown in air travel these however are the results of the industry s cost cutting through capacity reductions efficiency improvements includi ng fuel conservation and fare increases rather than big gains in air travel volume in any case because travel is major com ponent of tourism nd considerable travel is done for reasons other than tourism the tota l volume of travel per may reflect factors other than energy price increas this is especially true of gasoline consumption

demand in branded hotels over 13 years which found that gaso line price increases depress overall lodging demand with the biggest effect on demand for economy hotel rooms moreover the study found that resorts were not harmed7 supportive of the hypothesis that people will travel despite higher gasoline prices but tend to economize was late june 2006 pkf hospitality research report that there is migration toward more economical acco mmodations in the form of limited service hotels and motels8 perhaps contributing to this is the emergence and growth of travel websites that make it easier to compare room rates and book hot and motel rooms perhaps clearer suggestion of slowdown in tourism is the decrease in the number of overnight stays at nationa l parks which began in 2004 table 2 many of the most popular parks are in the western part of the country distant from the highly populated regions of the country and requiring long trips the decrease in overnight park stays at the same time that the number of hotel and motel rooms sold increase appears to be consistent with the observation by many that people still take trips when gasoline prices rise but travel shorter distances anecdotal evidence of the effect of increased energy prices on tourism tends to be mixed appearing in articles with titles such as cant stop guzzling and holiday travelers hit the road but scrimped bit9 travel and tourism employment the number of people employed in industrie s related to travel and tourism shown in table 3 could indicate effects of higher energy prices on tourism but this evidence is mixed as well employment at establishments providing travel arrangement and reservation services while down from 2002 actua lly was higher in the first half of 2006 than in the first half of 2005 despite the greater ease of self booking available on the internet noted earlier with steep rises in jet fuel providing an additional incentive airlines are still striving to economize the decline in th number of people employed by airlines at least since 2003 has continued into 2006 hotel and motel employment having r ecovered somewhat from 911 slipped back in the first half of 2006

with respect to any effect of sharply increased energy prices on tourism key economic and other factors have not improved prospects for lower crude oil prices and lower gasoline prices have not improved stricter security measures may well over time dampen airline travel at least for while and the middle east remains generator of uncertainty despite the recently established cease fire between
