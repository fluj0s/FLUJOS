of title iv of the social security act was enacted in january 1975 pl 93647 and most recently amended by the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 the cse program is administered by the office of child support enforcement ocse in the department of health and human services hhs and is funded by general revenues all 50 states the district of columbia guam puerto rico the virgin islands and nine tribal nations operate cse programs and are entitled to federal matching funds in fy2005 the cse program collected 23 billion in child support on behalf of more than 17 million children the cse program is intended to help strengthen families by securing financial support for children from their noncustodial parent on consistent and continuing basis although the deficit reduction act of 2005 enacted february 8 2006 included significant changes to the cse program it did not include many of the child support provisions that had been considered during the preceding fouryear debate within the context of welfare reauthorization this report discusses 12 such provisions that were passed by either the house or the senate finance committee or both the administration has included several of these provisions in its fy2008 budget of the 12 provisions five aimed at enhancing cse collection tools would have 1 eased the collection of child support from veterans disability compensation benefits 2 facilitated the collection of child support from social security benefits 3 allowed the hhs secretary to act on behalf of states to seize financial assets held by multistate financial institution of noncustodial parents who owed child support 4 facilitated the collection of child support from longshore and harbor workers compensation and 5 required states to adopt later version of the uniform interstate family support act uifsa so as to facilitate the collection of child support payments in interstate cases other provisions included an array of measures aimed at making the cse program more efficient and effective the provisions would have 1 required the hhs secretary to submit report to congress on the problems of undistributed child support collections 2 designated indian tribes and tribal organizations as persons authorized to have access to information in the federal parent locator service fpls 3 changed the language of current law to require the secretary of education to reimburse the hhs secretary for any costs incurred by the hhs secretary in providing requested information on new hires fro m the national directory of new hires which is part of the fpls to help the education secretary locate persons who had defaulted on student loans 4 increased federal funding for the cse access and visitation program 5 prohibited states from collecting child support from noncustodial fathers to repay medicaid costs associated with the birth of child and 6 required each he alth care plan administrator to notify the state cse agency when child has lost health care coverage the final provision discussed in this report would have gradually reduced the federal matching rate for cse expenditures from 66 to 50 table a1 shows the welfare reauthorization

enforcement cse program part d of title iv of the social security act was enacted in january 1975 pl 93647 the cse program is administered by the office of child support enforcement ocse in the department of health and human services hhs and is funded by general revenues all 50 states the district of columbia guam puerto rico the virgin islands and nine tribal nations operate cse programs and are entitled to federal matching funds when the cse program was first enacted in 1975 one of its primary goals was to recover the costs of federal and state governments of providing cash welfare to families with children over the years the cse program has evolved into multifaceted program while costrecovery still remains an important function of the program other aspects of the program include service delivery and promotion of selfsufficiency and parental responsibility in fy2005 the cse program collected 23 billion in child support on behalf of more than 17 million children of which 21 billion went to families and 2 billion was retained by the states and federal government as recovered welfare costs the cse program is intended to help strengthen families by securing financial support for children from their noncustodial parent on consistent and continuing basis and by helping some families to remain selfsufficient and off public assistance by providing the requisite cse services in fy2004 more than 331000 families were able to end their enrollment in the temporary assistance for needy families tanf program due to receipt of child support payments according to the fede ral office of child support enforcement ocse although the cse program generally garners bipartis an support for most of its history changes to the program have been achieved in tandem with more controversial changes to other social programs this was illustrated in the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 was major piece of social legislation most known for ending the cash welfare entitlement for needy families with children creating the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant setting fiveyear time limit on aid and requiring more work from welfare recipients in addition to making changes to number of other social programs the 1996 welfare reform law included over 40 provisions that made significant changes to the cse program the original funding authority for tanf and mandatory child care provided in the 1996 welfare law expired at the end of fy2002 september 30 2002 1 president bush submitted his welfare reauthorization proposals to congress in february 2002 many policymakers and child support advocates maintained at the start of the welfare reauthorization debates that child support should be included in the discussions in light of the ke role that child support plays in promoting self sufficiency though congress debated welfare legislation throughout the four years 2002 through 2005 it did not pass comprehensive welfare reauthorization legislation the major areas of contention were work requirements and child care funding not the proposed cse changes2 1 although the 1996 welfare law pl 104193 included many cse provisions unlike the tanf provisions they were not timelimited the cse program is permanently authorized 2 the house and senate versions of the cse provisions included in pl 109171 the deficit reduction act of 2005 s 1932 were similar if not identical in most cases the notable exception was the cse provision related to states option to pass through to tanf families some of the child support collected on the familys behalf with the federal government sharing in some of the costs although the intent of providing tanf families with more of the child support collected for them was the same in both the house and senate versions of s 1932 the approaches used to continued

ultimately included in broader budget spending reconciliation legisla tion the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109 1713 pl 109171 was signed into law on february 8 2006 the act among other things extended funding for the basic tanf block grant through fy2010 increased the percentage of tanf families that are required to participate in work or work activities increased funding for child care established healthy marriage promotion grants and responsible fatherhood initiatives and revised the cse program 4 although pl 109171 included significant changes to the cse program5 it did not include many of the child support provisions discussed and considered within the fouryear welfare reauthorization debate this report provides brief discussion of 12 child support provisions that were considered during 20022005 within the context of welfare reauthorization but not enacted in pl 109171 or any other federal law 6 to the extent that some of these provisions had broad support they may be considered again in the 110th congress the administration has included several of the provisions in its fy2008 budget

the child support provisions discussed below were all either passed by the house or by the senate finance committee or both and many also were supported by the administration although few of the provisions elicited controversy they were not included in pl 109171 or any other federal law7 because the welfare and child support provisions were included in budget reconciliation legislation there was concern that some provisions would be struck during the senates consideration of the bill due to the byrd rule8 this report describes these child support continued attain that objective varied significantly pl 109171 includes compromise of the two approaches 3 see crs report rl33418 welfare reauthorization in the 109th congress an overview by gene falk melinda gish and carmen solomonfears 4 ibid p 1 5 for information on the child support provisions included in pl 109171 see crs report rs22377 child support provisions in the deficit reduc tion act of 2005 pl 109171 by carmen solomonfears 6 several national cse organizations and some childrens advocacy gr oups have expressed concern and criticism over the provisions in pl 109171 regarding the financing of the cse program these groups are calling for 1 restoration of the authority to federally match cse incentive payments that states reinvest back into the cse program 2 restoration of the 90 federal match for genetic testing associ ated with paternity determination and 3 repeal of the 25 annual cse user fee for certain custodial parents such proposals or provisions are not discussed in this report because they were not part of the 20022005 welfare reauthorization debate nor have such proposals been introduced in the 110th congress 7 in some cases the child support provis ions in the house and senate bills were identical in other cases they were similar this report does not discuss any differences in bill language 8 under the byrd rule the senate is prohibited from cons idering extraneous matter as part of reconciliation bill or conference report on reconciliation bill extraneous matter generally means that the provision does not produce change in outlays or revenues or is outside the jurisdictio n of the committee that submitte d the provision for inclusion in the reconciliation measure however the term remains s ubject to interpretation by the presiding officer who relies on the senate parliamentarian the byrd rule is enforced when senator raises point of order during consideration continued httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33881g5g145g146g149g141g561g21g158g153

individual based on remuneration from pay for purposes of paying child support or alimony prior to 2004 there was one exception to this rule the exception occurred when disabled veteran elected to forego some of his or her retirement pay in order to collect additional disability payments11 in other words if disabled veteran accepted disability compensation instead of retirement pay he or she was subject to having his or her disability benefits offset to meet child support obligations pl 108136 enacted november 24 2003 enables veterans to receive both military retired pay and veterans disability compensation12 pl 108136 eliminated the need to forego retirement pay for disability compensation payments given that veterans disability compensation is not subject to intercept several house and senate bills included provision that would have allowed veterans disability compensation benefits to be intercepted withheld and paid on routine basis to the custodial parent the proposed provision would have made all veterans income subject to income withholding for child support obligations supporters of the provision maintain that the provision would provide more child support collections to families of disabled veterans and make the treatment of veterans disability payments more consistent with other forms of go vernment payment with regard to obtaining child support obligations opponents of the provision contend that congress should stand by its long history of protecting the payments made to disabled veterans from garnishment or other legal claims they argue that the federal government should put protections in place so that veterans disability compensation payments will not be diverted from the children to others eg former spouses who need them less than the disabled veteran 13 g11g150g153g155g152g159g146g151g144g561g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g6g142g139g157g561g5g152g149g149g142g140g157g146g152g151g561g18g155g138g140g157g146g140g142g156g561 federal

only applies to federal debts such as student loans housing loans and small business loans it does not apply to debt owed to state thus the law prohibits the offset of federal benefit payments to collect delinquent stateenforced child support obligations because child support debt is owed to states rather than the federal gove rnment child support arrearage payments which are enforced by states cannot be offset from social security benefitspayments generally social security benefits are not subject to garnishment attachment or other legal process pursuant to section 207a of the social security act however social security benefits are attachable for child support purposes because section 207 of the act is expressly overridden by section 459a of the act which provides that payments from the federal government the entitlement to which is based upon remuneration for employment are subject to income withholding garnishment or other legal proces s brought by state cse agency or custodial parent for purposes of enforcing child support obligations over the last several congresses both the house and the senate have considered provision to expand the federal administrative offset program by allowing states to collect pastdue child support via the department of treasurys withholding of social security benefit payments this provision also was proposed in the administrations fy2003 and subsequent budgets the congressional budget office cbo has estimated that these offsets could yield about 65 million annually by 2010 but it notes that some perhaps half of this child support money would have been collected anyway through the federal income tax refund offset program 15 the proposed federal debt collection improvement provision would add another enforcement method for states to collect pastdue child suppo rt obligations it would increase child support payments to custodial families of children who have noncustodial parent who is the recipient of social security benefits while maintaining specified amount of income for those social security beneficiaries16

assets through the financial institution data match program has been successful addition to the array of cse tools but they also state that the financial match program works best when the custodial parent has an account at bank or banks within the state this is because in some cases multistate financial institutions will not honor seizure by state unless the institution has branch offices in the state also some states have policies of pursuing matching only when large financial asset is identified or only when the arrearage is longstanding or current payments are being made moreover in some cases state law prohibits the placement of liens or levies on accounts outside of the state in 1998 congress made it easier for multistate financial institutions to match records by permitting the federal parent locator service fpl s to help them coordinate their information pursuant to pl 105200 the fpls uses its national file of delinquent noncustodial parents ie noncustodial parents who owe

the authority to seize assets to obtain child support payments given that interstate cases make up about onethird of the cse caseload but represent only about 6 of total child support collections 18

emphasis on the need to determine the controlling order in the case of multiple child support orders modification of current rules regarding the enforcement of modified orders more direction regarding international child support cases clarification regarding duration of child support and procedures regarding use of telephone hearings with respect to controlling orders the 2001 changes clarify current law by stipulating that court of state that has established child support order has continuing exclusive jurisdiction to modify its order if the order is the controlling order and the state is the childs state or the residence of any individual cont estant or if the state is not the residence of the child or an individual contestant the court has the contestants consent in record or in open court that the court may continue to exercise jurisdiction to modify its order the main reason that congress as part of the 1996 welfare reform law required states as condition of receiving cse funding to adopt the uniform interstate family support act uifsa was to reduce the problems associated with the establishment and enforcement of child support in interstate cases one of the major barriers to interstate collection of child support prior to uifsa was the multipleorder world under the uniform reciprocal enforcement of support act uresa uresa expressly provided that ures order did not nullify and was not nullified by any other child support order 21 by the early 1990s it was universally recognized that uniform processing of interstate cases would increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the cse program thus major purpose of uifsa was to establish oneorder world meaning that court or child support agency would have continuing exclusive jurisdiction if it has issued child support order and is the residence of the custodial parent noncustodial parent or child the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 required that to receive cse funding on and after january 1 1998 each state must have in effect the uniform interstate family support act uifsa as approved by the american bar association on february 9 1993 and as in effect on august 22 1996 including any amendments officially adopted as of such date by the national conference of commissioner s on uniform state laws uifsa requires states to treat pastdue child s upport obligations as final judgments that are entitled to full faith and credit in every state this means that person who has child support 21 the uniform reciprocal enforcement of support act uresa was established in 1950 by the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws for states that adopted it it was the primary way to enforce another states child support orders before 1950 us parent who wanted to obtain child support against the other parent who lived in another state had to travel to the noncustodial parents state to take legal action httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33881g5g145g146g149g141g561g21g158g153

state to obtain child support should the noncustodial parent move from the issuing courts jurisdiction the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 clarified the definition of childs home state made several revisions to ensure that the full faith and credit laws can be applied consistently with uifsa and clarified the rules regarding which child support orders states must honor when there is more than one order given that about 33 of all cse cases involve more than one state it is generally considered important that states have the same basic laws for handling interstate cases after all of the states had adopted uifsa as required by the 1996 welfare reform law the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws adopted am endments in 2001 at the request of the cse officials and workers to improve the processing of interstate child support cases supporters of the provision that would require states to incor porate these amendments maintain that it would make the cse program more effective by requiring all states to adopt the more current version of uifsa they contend that the provision would ensure that all interstate cases are handled under similar statutory framework thus moving closer to the oneorder world in which child would not be seriously disadvantaged in obtaining child support just because his or her parents do not live in the same state

interest among parents advocacy groups and congress states contend that they have focused on the problem and have made some progress in reducing the amount of undistributed child support collections but also indicate that there are in some cases good reasons for not distributing some payments for example they cite legal issues such as the pending determination of custody that may need to be resolved before payments are released states could lose anywhere from thousands to millions of dollars year if they prematurely distributed the irs income tax refund intercept collections from joint tax returns parents and advocacy groups maintain that unresolved undistributed child support collections ultimately go into state and federal treasuries according to the national council of child support directors states support the establishment of national goal for reduction in udc undistributed collections the setting of such goal can be accomplished once the data from the reporting categories of udc on the ocse 34a form and the draft schedule is available until such data is available it would be difficult to set realistic national goal for udc as we will not have clear understanding as to the level of udc for individual states or the nation as whole once such data is available it will provide the opportunity to establish benchmark for improvement until all states know where they are through consistent nationally standardized reporting of udc rather than setting concrete standard nccsd supports goal of continuous improvement by each state matter where they are along the path toward reducing udc national goal of continuous improvement by each state will require way to track states performance over time 26

many noncustodial parents argue that it is unfair to look at the child support issue only from the viewpoint of the custodial parent traditionally courts have sided with mothers in awarding custody and in this view have paid insufficient attention to enforcing visitation rights of fathers as result they say mothers have had the rewards and obligations connected with rearing children while fathers have sometimes had share in the rewards but have the continuing obligation to pay support to be fair some say federal laws and procedures should be reformed not only with respect to enforcement of the ch ild support obligation but also with respect to visitation and custody rights historically congress has held that visitation and child support should be legally separate issues and that only child support should be under the scope of the cse program however congress also has indicated that fathers should be involved in their childrens lives the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 authorized grants to states via cse funding to establish and operate access and visitation programs the purpose of the grants is to facilitate noncustodial parents access to and visitation of their children an annual entitlement of 10 million from the federal cse budget account is available to states for these grants eligible activities include but are not limited to mediation counseling education development of parenting plans visitation enforcement and development of guidelines for visitation and alternative custody arrangements the allotment formula is based on the ratio of the number of children in the state living with only one biological parent in relation to the total number of such children in all states the amount of the allotment available to state is this same ratio to 10 million the allotments are to be adjusted to ensure that there is minimum allotment amount of 100000 per state for any year after fy1998 states may use the grants to create their own programs or

delinquency and crime during their teenage years and are more likely to have stable above poverty level incomes as adults 30 supporters of the provision contend that families need more than child

custodial parent has private medical coverage at the time of her childs birth the father can be held financially responsible for payment of the birth costs even in cases where the costs associated with the birth of the child are very high federal law permits states to use the cse program to collect money from noncustodial fathers to reimburse the medicaid agency for birth costs of children receiving medicaid benefits and services several house and senate bills included provision that would have prohibited states from collecting child support from noncustodial fathers to repay medicaid costs associated with the birth of child among the reasons given for the high percent of child support arrearages especially among low income noncustodial fathers are that too many child support
