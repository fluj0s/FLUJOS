breaking the terms of th 1994 agreed framework and several other international agreements and obligations to which it is party other analysts might point to the crisis of 19931994 dur ing which north korea announced it was withdrawing from the nonproliferation treaty asserting that the crisis never ended but instead has evolved into the current situation3 still others contend that origins of the crisis might be found in the nucl earization of india and pakistan in 1998 by which the concept of nuclear weapons stat and nonnuclear weapons states as basis for international agreements was cha llenged and the subse quent world reaction toward those events which many cast as shortlived and relatively mild north korea officially withdrew from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty on january 10
