military technicians proposals to improve their retirement options march 19 2001 lawrence kapp analyst in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30903military technicians proposals to improve their retirement options summary military technicians are federal civilian employees who provide support primarily to wartime deployable units of the selected reserve unlike regular civilian employees however military technicians are generally required to maintain membership in the selected reserve as condition of their employment as members of the federal civil service technicians can earn an entitlement to an annuity under either the civil service retirement system csrs or under the federal employee retirement system fers in the same manner as most other civil servants the civil service retirement options for military technicians are nearly identical to those available to most other civil servants however there are certain categories of civil servants federal law enforcement officers firefighters air traffic controllers and nuclear materials couriers who have been granted more generous retirement options in recognition of the exceptionally rigorous demands of their professions compared to most other federal employees these special category federal employees are allowed to retire voluntarily with lower combination of age and years of service and their pensions are computed using more generous formula special category employees are also subject to mandatory retirement and usually contribute higher percentage of their pay to csrs or fers than do other federal employees representatives of various military technician associations argue that the military technicians should have the same retirement options as those enjoyed by the special category federal employees the work conditions of military technicians they argue are exceptionally demanding and similar in rigor to those of law enforcement officers firefighters air traffic controllers and nuclear materials couriers opponents of this proposal argue that the civilian duties performed by military technicians are not as arduous as those performed by special category employees and are commensurate with those performed by federal employees generally while conceding that most military technicians must meet strict physical fitness requirements in order to retain their reserve membership and are occasionally deployed in the event of war or national emergency opponents argue that technicians are compensated for these military duties through the military retirement system therefore opponents argue military technicians do not deserve the more generous retirement options enjoyed by special category federal civilian employees in the 106th congres s two bills were introduced to improve the civil service retirement options of military technicians so far in the 107th congress one such bill has been introduced this report provides background information on the military technician program and the retirement options for various categories of federal employees including military technicians it also compares the retirement benefits available to military technicians with those available to other federal employees and presents arguments for and against modifyin g the retirement benefits for

national guard and the air national guard 2military technicians have also been referred to as reserve technicians civilian technicians dual status technicians technicians and caretakers and clerks in the past military technicians serving in the army or air national guard have also been referred to as guard technicians the term used in the most recent federal legislation has been military technicians and is the terminology generally used throughout this paper the term technicians however is sometimes used as an abbreviatio n it should be considered synonymous with the term military technicians unless stated otherwise 3the selected reserve subelement of the ready reserve contains those units and individuals most essential to wartime missions members of the selected reserve generally perform at minimum one weekend of training each month and two weeks of training each year for which they receive pay and benefits military technicians proposals to improve their retirement options this report is divided into five parts the first part provides background information on the military technician program this is followed by brief description of the three retirement systems which military technicians are potentially eligible to participate in the next section discusses the civil service retirement options currently available to military technicians and presents the arguments for and against modifying those options the fourth section provides comparison of the retirement benefits available to military technicians with those available to other federal employees finally the last section analyses several bills that have been introduced in the 106th and 107th congresses to provide more generous civil service retirement options to military technicians what is military technician the reserve component1 rc of the united states armed forces employs small core group of full time employees to administer rc units train rc personnel and maintain rc equipment these employees are known as fulltime support fts personnel there are four distinct types of fts personnel civilian employees active duty military personnel active guard and reserve agr personnel and military technicians2 military technicians are federal civilian employees hired under statutes contained in titles 5 and 32 us code who provide support primarily to wartime deployable units of the selected reserve3 unlike regular civilian employees however military technicians are usually required to maintain membership in the selected reserve ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30903crs2 4a unit membership requirement for certain military technicians was enacted november 18 1997 as part of p l 10585 and is codified in title 10 us code section 10216 d similar unit membership requirements have existed for many years within the administrative agreements which govern the military technician programs in the army reserve and the air force reserve in the case of the army reserve the annual department of defense appropriations acts from fy 1984 through fy 1996 also contained language barring funds to certain technician s who did not hold reserve membership in the same unit which they worked for in their civilian capacity 5see footnote 28 for more detailed discussion of why some military technicians are not required to maintain their membership in the selected reserve 6they are also sometimes referred to as status quo technicians 7 csrs applies to those workers who entered federal service before 1984 fers applies to those workers who entered federal service in 1984 or later those hired before 1984 who opted to switch to fers from csrs during designated open seasonand workers who were eligible for csrs when first hired but who had break in federal employment and switched to fers upon reemployment there are number of major differences between csrs and fers including 1 the requirements for retirement with an immediate annuity or pension 2 the requirements for retirement with deferred annuity 3 required payments into the retirement system while working and 4 the formula by which the annuity is calculated some but not all of these differences will be discussed below for more detailed information on these differences see the crs report 98810 federal retirement programs benefit structure and financing concepts september 21 1998 by patrick purcell 8 to qualify for military retired pay reservists normally must have 20 years of qualifying military service the last eight of which must have been in the reserves and be at least 60 years of age since the end of the cold war however these requirements have been temporarily lowered to facilitate reserve force reductionsa condition of their employment they may also be required to fulfill their reserve obligation ie drilling one weekend month and attending two weeks of annual training in the same unit they work for in their civilian capacity4 military technicians who hold membership in the selected reserve are referred to as dual status technicians because of their status as both civilian employees and reservists however not all military technicians belong to the selected reserve either because they were never required to do so when hired or because they lost their reserve membership at some point in their technician career5 these technicians are referred to as nondualstatus technicians6 retirement systems for military technician as members of the federal civil service technicians can earn an entitlement to an annuity under either the civil service retirement system csrs or under the federal employee retirement system fers in the same manner as most other civil servants7 additionally as members of the selected reserve technicians can earn entitlement to military retired pay in the same manner as other reservists8 thus technicians are potentially eligible to receive retirement pay from two different federal retirement systems civilian and military simultaneously however it is important to point out here that the issue of early retirement for military technicians relates onlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30903crs3 9there are two exceptions however they are both advantageous to military technicians see the sections of this report entitled involuntary retirement requirements discontinued service and involuntary retirement requirements disability 10the ages at which special category federal employees are required to retire are as follows 57 for law enforcement officers 56 for air traffic controllers 55 for firefighters dual status military technicians do not have mandatory retirement age nondualstatus technicians do not have mandatory retirement age per but are required to retire once they become eligible for an unreduced annuity provided they are at least 60 years of age to their retirement options under csrs and fers not to their retirement options under the military retirement system therefore this report will focus primarily on describing current retirement options for military technicians under csrs and fers and analyzing how various legislative proposals would modify those options civil service retirement options for military technicians the civil service retirement options for military technicians are nearly identical to those available to most other civil servants9 however there are certain categories of civil servants federal law enforcement officers firefighters air traffic controllers and nuclear materials couriers who have been granted more generous retirement options in recognition of the exceptionally rigorous demands of their professions compared to most other federal employees these special category federal employees are allowed to retire voluntarily with lower combination of age and years of service and their pensions are computed using more generous formula special category employees are also subject to mandatory retirement10 and usually contribute higher percentage of their pay to csrs or fers than do other federal employees comparative summary of the various retirement options for military technicians federal employees in general and special category federal employees is contained later in this report representatives of various military technician associations argue that military technicians deserve to be placed in category similar to that enjoyed by special category federal employees as members of the selected reserve dualstatus military technicians are required to meet the same physical fitness requirements that other members of the military active and reserve are required to meet they may also be called to active duty and deployed in the event of war or national emergency and in the case of national guard technicians may be mobilized to respond to domestic disasters and civil disturbances these work conditions technicians argue are exceptionally demanding and similar in rigor to those of law enforcement officers firefighters air traffic controllers and nuclear materials couriers thus in their opinion military technicians should be allowed to retire with the same combinations of age and years of service as these special category federal employees additionally some argue their pensions should be calculated using the higher accrual rate that special category federal employees enjoy more detailed examination of various proposals to improve the retirement options for military technicians is contained later in this reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30903crs4 11see footnote 8 for more information on military retirement for reservistsopponents of this proposal argue that military technician duty is not as arduous as that performed by federal law enforcement officers fire fighters nuclear materials couriers and air traffic controllers the civilian duties of most military technicians they contend are about as arduous as those performed by federal civilian employees generally typical civilian duties of military technicians consist of administration maintenance training and managemen t and range from sedentary to moderately active while conceding that due to their reserve membership dualstatus technicians must meet strict physical fitness requirements and are occasionally deployed in the event of war or national emergency opponents argue that they are compensated for this through the military retirement system11 additionally as the more arduous aspects of their jobs result from their reserve membership they contend that the situation of military technicians is little different from that of other federal civilian employees who are members of the reserves finally opponents point out that there are substantial costs associated with early retirement proposals including the cost of replacing and training technicians who retire early comparison of retirement options for different types of federal employees federal employees are covered by one of two retirement plans the civil service retirement system csrs or the federal employees retirement system fers the former covers most federal employees who were initially hired before january 1 1984 the latter covers all federal employees who were initially hired on or after that date along with some federal employees who switched from csrs to fers key element of both of these systems is the provision of an annuity also called pension to federal employe who leave federal service after meeting certain retirement criteria there are several different types of annuities an immediate annuity is one which the employee is eligible to receive immediately upon separation from federal service in order to receive an immediate annuity federal employee must meet certain combinations of age and years of federal service usually federal employees need to meet the age and years of service combinations classified as voluntary retirement requirements these requirements can vary depending on the type of work the federal employee does see the section on voluntary retirement requirements below especially tables 1 and 2 under certain circumstances however federal employee may be eligible for an immediate annuity with lower combination of age and years of federal service than is required for voluntary retirement these are called involuntary retirement requirements see the sections on discontinued service retirement and disability retirement below including tables 3 and 4 finally if federal employee does not meet the criteria for an immediate annuity he or she may still be eligible for deferred annuity see the section on deferred annuities below especially tables 5 and 6 description of the various retirement options and how they compare followshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30903crs5 12also under both csrs and fers agencies may offer voluntary retirement at age 50 with 20 years of service and at any age with 25 years of service if the agency is undergoing reorganization or downsizing 135 usc 8336c and 145 usc 8336 155 usc 8412 d and eimmediate annuity voluntary retirement requirements under csrs federal employees can voluntarily choose to retire and receive an immediate annuity after becoming 55 years of age with 30 years of federal service after becoming 60 years of age with 20 years of service or after becoming 62 years of age with five years of service under fers federal employees can voluntarily retire and receive an immediate annuity after reaching the minimum retirement age between 55 and 57 depending on the employees year of birth with 30 years of service after reaching 60 years of age with 20 years of service or after reaching 62 years of age with five years of service additionally fers eligible employees may voluntarily retire and receive an immediate annuity if they have at least 10 years of service and have reached the minimum retirement age 5557 however this annuity is reduced by five percent for each year below the age of 62 the employee is at the time of separation12 certain categories of federal employees may voluntarily retire and receive an immediate annuity with lower combination of age and years of service than normally required in recognition of the exceptionally rigorous demands of their professions under csrs federal employee who chooses to retire after reaching 50 years of age and completing 20 years of service as law enforcement officer firefighter nuclear materials courier or air traffic controller is eligible to receive an immediate annuity13 air traffic controllers are also eligible to receive an immediate annuity with 25 years of service regardless of age14 under fers federal employee who chooses to retire after reaching 50 years of age and completing 20 years of service as law enforcement officer member of the capitol police firefighter nuclear materials courier or air traffic controller is eligible to receive an immediate annuity additionally federal employees with 25 years of service in these professions regardless of age may voluntarily retire and receive an immediate annuity15 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30903crs6 16as of january 1 2001 effective until december 31 2002 5 usc 8334 c 175 usc 8339 5 usc 8339 d1 and 5 usc 8339etable 1 voluntary retirement under

handbook ch 44 section 44a p 3 24involuntary loss of reserve membership can include the following loss of military status due to nonselection by retention board failure to get promoted within the prescribed period of time failure to meet certain medical requirements and failure to meet physical fitness standards due to medical condition failure to meet physical fitness standards that is not the result of medical condition is considered voluntary action and does not entitle the technician to retirement under this section 25in some circumstances senior executives of the federal government may be exempted from the two percent reduction 26note however that special category employees can often retire under the voluntary retirement provision rather than under the discontinued service retirement provision due to the lower age and years of service requirements they have for voluntary retirement in this way they can avoid the two percent reduction however this is not always the case for example under csrs an air traffic controller who was 45 years of age with 25 years of service and who was involuntarily separated from his job would eligible for discontinued service retirement however he could choose to retire under the voluntary retirement provisions instead similarly situated federal law enforcement officer though would have to accept retirement under the discontinued service provisions as he or she would not yet be eligible for voluntary retirementinvoluntary retirement requirements discontinued service in certain circumstances federal employees become eligible for an immediate annuity with lower combination of age and years of service than required for voluntary retirement one set of circumstances is referred to as discontinued service this refers to an employee who is involuntarily separate d from federal service except by removal for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency22 typical causes of involunt ary separation include reductions in force rif abolishment of positions and unacceptable performance not related to misconduct23 with respect to military technicians this would include separations from their civil service position due to the involuntary loss of their military membership or the loss of the rank required to hold their military position24 involuntary separation could also occur if the technician were promoted to military rank in excess of that specified for the technician position under csrs federal employee who meets the conditions of discontinued service is entitled to an immediate annuity if he or she has 20 years of service and is at least 50 years of age or if he or she has 25 years of service regardless of age however if the employee is under the age of 55 at the time of separation the annuity rate is reduced by two percent for each year the employee is below the age of 55 this provision applies to nearly all federal employees25 including military technicians and special category federal employees26 under fers federal employee may qualify for discontinued service retirement with the same combinations of age and years of service as under csrs but there is reduction in annuity if he or she is under the age of 55 at the time ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30903crs9 275 usc 8414c does not actually use the word involuntary to describe the type of separation it says an employee who was hired as military reserve technicianand who is separated from technician serviceby reason of being separated from the selected reserve of the employees reserve component or ceasing to hold the military grade specifie d by the secretary concerned for the position held by the employee is entitled to an annuity however in describing the intent of this legislative provision the conference report which accompanied it stated finally the conference agreement provides that military reserve technicians separated from the civil service because of losing military status through fault of their own emphasis added may retire at age 50 with 25 years of service house conference report 99606 may 16 1986 133 thus the office of personnel management has interpreted 5 usc 8414c to apply only to military technici ans whose loss of military membership is involuntary see footnote 24 for discussion of what constitutes involuntary loss of military membership this provision was amended in 1999 by pl 10665 the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2000 this act lowered the age and years of service requirement for retirement under 5 usc 8414c for military technicians hired after february 10 1996 see footnote 28 for more detailed discussion of that dates significance 28the rationale for the date february 10 1996 deserves mention as mentioned earlier military technicians are generally required to maintain membership in the selected reserve as condition of their federal civilian employment this is referred to as the dual status requirement up until february 10 1996 the strictness of the dual status requirement varied widely among the various reserve components which employ technicians in the air force reserve for example technicians who lost their reserve membership almost always lost their civil service jobs as well in the army reserve on the other hand technicians who lost their reserve membership were often allowed to continue working in their technician positions february 10 1996 was the date of enactment for the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1996 pl 104106 110 stat 306 this act contained provision establishing strict dualstatus requirement for all newly hired technicians under it technicians who were hired after february 10 1996 had to be promptly separated from their technician positions upon losing reserve membership technicians who were hired on or before this date were not affected by this law in the same way for more information on this topic see the crs report rl30487 military technicians the issue of mandatory retirement march 28 2000 by lawrence kapp thus the date of february 10 1996 serves as demarcation line between those technicians hired under the strict congressionally mandated dual status requirement and those hired under the more diverse standards employed by the individual services separation this provision 5 usc 8414b applies to all federal employees including military technicians and special category federal employees however under fers there is an additional provision written specifically for military technicians 5 usc 8414 c this provision appears to be redundant with the general discontinued service provision mentioned in the previous paragraph but in one important way the military technician provision is more generous under this special provision military technicians who are involunta rily separated27 from their positions by reason of being separated from the selected reserveor ceasing to hold the military rank specified may qualify for an immediate annuity with the following combinations of age and years of service 50 years of age and 25 years of service as military technician if hired on or before february 10 1996 50 years of age and 20 years of service as dual status technician or at any age with 25 years of service as dual status technician if hired after february 10 199628 note that for those hired on or before february 101996 the age and years of service combinations are higherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30903crs10 29an annuity supplement is as its name indicates an additional payment to the retiree the function of the fers annuity supplement is to approximate the social security benefit earned during federal employment until the retiree actually becomes eligible for social security at age 62 it ceases at that time the formula for calculating the supplement is complex and varies from individual to individual but it can be significant financial benefit 30the minimum retirement age varies from 55 to 57 depending on the employees year of birth 31see footnote 26 for discussion of how special category employees who are eligible for discontinued service retirement often choose to retire under the voluntary retirement provisions thereby avoiding the two percent reductionthan under the general discontinued service provision the combinations are not higher for those hired after february 10 1996 but at least 25 years of their service must be as dual status technician if under age 50 or at least 20 years as dual status technician if over that age the benefit of retiring under this provision rather than the general discontinued service provision is that it entitles the military technician to an annuity supplement29 regardless of his or her age under the general discontinued service provision available to all federal employees an annuity supplement is payable but only if the retiree has reached the minimum retirement age30 table 3 discontinued service retirement under csrs all federal employees including military technicians and special category employees31 age years of service any age 25 reduced benefits if under age 55 or 50 20 reduced benefits if under age 55httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30903crs11 32see 5 usc

security disability rulestable 4 discontinued service retirement under fers all federal employees including military technicians and special category employeesadditional provisions for military technicians only age years of service any age 25 reduction in benefits if under age 55 eligible for annuity supplement if minimum retirement age has been reached or 50 20 reduction in benefits if under age 55 eligible for annuity supplement if minimum retirement age has been reachedif hired after feb 10 1996 any age 25 reduction in benefits if under age 55 eligible for annuity supplement regardless of age years of service must be as dual status technician or 50 20 reduction in benefits if under age 55 eligible for annuity supplement regardless of age years of service must be as dual status technician if hired on or before feb 10 1996 50 25 reduction in benefits if under age 55 eligible for annuity supplement regardless of age service can be as dualstatus or nondualstatus involuntary retirement requirements disability under both csrs and fers federal employees who are unable to render useful and efficient service in their positions due to disease or injury are eligible for disability retirement if 1 they meet the minimum civilian service requirement and 2 they cannot be reassigned to position of the same grade or level where they would be able to perform useful and efficient service32 with respect to the minimum service requirement an employee needs five years of federal civilian service to be eligible for disability retirement under csrs under fers an employee needs 18 months of service33 all federal employees including military technicians and specialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30903crs12 345 usc 8337h and 5 usc 8456 35remember that most military technicians are required to hold membership in the selected reserve as condition of their employment these technicians are referred to as dualstatus technicians see the section entitled what is military technician for more information on this thus in the absence of these special disability provisions dualstatus technicians who suffered disability that rendered them unfit for military duty but not for civilian duty would be promptly separated from technician service without any disability retirement benefits 36for example in 1999 total of 993 military technicians in the national guard retired of these 235 236 retired under the special disability provision for military technicians while only 78 8 retired under the regular disability provisions applicable to all federal employees source us office of personnel management retirement policy divisioncategory employees are treated the same with respect to these time in service requirements military technicians however do have special provision in both csrs and fers which provides them with more generous standard for determining disability specifically they are eligible for disability retirement if they are separated from employment as military technician by reason of disability that disqualifies the individual from membership in the selected reserve even if they would not be considered disabled under the disability standard mentioned in the previous paragraph34 thus disability which renders technician unfit for his or her military duties but not for his or her civilian duties would be able to retire under these provisions35 the utility of these provisions for technicians appears to be considerable as sizable percentage of military technician retirements occur under them36 deferred annuity those federal employees who are separated from federal service with more than 5 years of service but without the required combinations of age and years of service to be eligible for an immediate annuity are eligible for deferred annuity as the name implies the employee does not receive an annuity immediately upon separation from federal service but at later date under csrs someone who is separated from federal service with at least five years of service begins receiving an annuity upon reaching the age of 62 under fers deferred annuities may begin on an unreduced basis at the minimum retirement age 5557 with 30 years of service at age 60 with 20 years of service and at age 62 with 5 years of service additionally under fers deferred annuities may begin on substantially reduced basis at the minimum retirement age 5557 if the employee had at least 10 years of service as indicated below all federal employees have the same age and years of service requirements for deferred annuityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30903crs13 table 5 deferred annuity under csrs all federal employees including military technicians and special category employees years of service 5 or more age at

in the 106th congress which if enacted would have modified the retirement options available to military technicians both of these bills are analyzed below the senate version of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2001 s 2549hr 4205 bill in the 106th congress contained provision nearly identical to s 1883 it is mentioned briefly below but the reader should refer to the section on s 1883 for analysis of this provision one bill s 155 has been introduced in the 107th congress it is virtually identical to s 1883 it is mentioned briefly below but refer to the section on s 1883 for analysis of its provisions analysis of hr 1079 106th congress this bill sponsored by representative abercrombie would have modified both csrs and fers to allow military technicians to retire voluntaril after 25 years of technician service or after becoming 50 years of age and completing 20 years of service such change would have been beneficial to technicians in two ways first it would have allowed technicians to retire voluntarily with lower combination ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30903crs14 37these federal employees would undoubtedly feel that they were being treated unfairly if they did not enjoy retirement options equal to or superior to those enjoyed by military technicians hence passage of this type of bill would likely inspire csrseligible law enforcement officers firefighters and nuclear materials couriers to demand improvement of their retirement options 38congressional record senate november 9 1999 s14297age and years of service than is currently required of them under this legislation ferseligible military technicians would have been allowed to retire with the same combinations of age and years of service as are currently enjoyed by special category employees additionally csrseligible military technicians would have enjoyed more generous retirement eligibility criteria than most special category employees specifically federal law enforcement officers firefighters and nuclear materials couriers who participate in csrs can voluntarily retire at age 50 with 20 years of service but they are not allowed to voluntarily retire at any age with 25 years of service37 second it would have enhanced the financial benefits for retiring military technicians although not to the level enjoyed by special category employees specifically under this legislation csrseligible military technicians would have been able to avoid the two percent annuity reduction which sometimes comes with retiring under the discontinued service retirement dsr provisions of csrs and fers eligible military technicians would be entitled to the payment of the annuity supplement described in footnote 29 regardless of age in the 106th congress hr 1079 bill was referred to house committee on government reform subcommittee on civil service the bill was not reported out of the subcommittee analysis of s 1883 106th congress this bill sponsored by senator bingaman would have modified both csrs and fers to allow military technicians to retire earlier than they are currently allowed to do when senator bingaman introduced the bill he specifically stated that it was companion bill to the one introduced by representative abercrombie hr 1079 and that this bill would permit dual status technicians to retire at any age with 25 years of service or at 50 with 20 years of service those benefits are similar to benefits provided to federal police and fire employees38 thus it appears that the intent of hr 1079 and s 1883 are the same to allow military technicians to retire voluntarily with 25 years of service or at age 50 with 20 years of service just like hr 1079 however despite their similar intent hr 1079 and s 1883 were written differently unlike hr 1079 which would have added new provisions to both csrs and fers s 1883 would have amended an existing provision of fers 5 usc 8414c and then added new provision to csrs which applies the newly modified fers provision to csrs as well as mentioned earlier 5 usc 8414c allows certain military technici ans to qualify for an immediate annuity with the following combinations of age and years of service 50 years of age and 25 years of service as military technician if hired on or before february 10 1996 50 years of age and 20 years of service as dual status technician or at any age with 25 years of service as dual status technician if hired after february 10 1996 s 1883 would modify thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30903crs15 by permitting all those hired on or before february 10 1996 to qualify for an immediate annuity at age 50 with 20 years of service or at any age with 25 years of service the legislation would not require that the years of service for technicians hired on or before february 10 1996 be service as dualstatus technician as is required for those hired after february 10 1996 additionally it is important to point out that 5 usc 8414c has historically been interpreted to apply only to those military technicians who have been involuntarily separated from their civil service positions by reason of being separated from the selected reserveor ceasing to hold the military rank specified as such there is some uncertainty as to whether amending this provision of the law would allow military technicians to retire under its provisions voluntarily s 1883 was referred to the committee on governmental affairs subcommittee on international security proliferation and federal services it was not reported out of the subcommittee however senator bingaman did offer s 1883 in amendment form to s 2549 the department of defense authorization act for fiscal year 2001 see below comment on section 651 of s 2549hr 4205 106th congress on the floor of the senate senator bingaman offered an amendment to s 2549 the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2001 the amendment 3244 was essentially s 1883 in amendment form and it was approved on voice vote see the section on s 1883 above for analysis s 2549 was later amended into the house version of the defense authorization bill and the bill was thereafter known as hr 4205 similar provision was not included in the house version of hr 4205 and during the housesenate conference the provision was dropped comment on s 155 107th congress s 155 introduced by senator bingaman is virtually identical to s 1883 the bill he introduced in the 106th congress see the section on s 1883 above for analysis the bill has been referred to the committee on government affairshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30903
