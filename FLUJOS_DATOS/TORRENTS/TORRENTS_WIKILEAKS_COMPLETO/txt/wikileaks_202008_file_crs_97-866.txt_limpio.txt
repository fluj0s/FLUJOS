debate over tiered readiness michael longoria and michael c ryan foreign affairs and national defense division summary the senate version of the fy1998 national defense authorization act required the department of defense dod prepare second report on tiered readiness1 the house version hr 1119 opposed tiered readiness and specifically prohibited its implementation2 in the final conference report the differences between the two chambers remained sharp over the issue of reducing current force readiness of some units for cost savings in this case to pay for force modernization given probable stringent budget realities in the future this incident of difference of approach reflects continuing tension among competing national defense budget priorities that remains difficult to resolve this report will not be updated but the information likely will be relevant in future readiness debates definitions and explanations tiered readiness tiered readiness is proposed method for reducing the near term cost of operating us military forces certain forces could be categorized in terms of how early they arrive in theater in preparation for combat operations 3 earlier arriving forces would maintain higher readiness levels than laterarriving forces 4 cost 1 under the fy1997 law dod was required to conduct the first study on tiered readiness see pl 104201 section 1047 september 23 1996 hereafter referred to as tr report 1 the requirement for second report can be found in the fy1998 national defense authorization bill s 936 section 1034 hereafter referred to as tr report 2 2 hr 1119 section 314prohibition of implementation of tiered readiness system 3 originally described in senate armed services committee report 104267 may 13 1996 senator mccain developed the following categorization plan tier i forcesunits capable of mobilizing and deploying within the first ten days of conflict tier iiunits that could mobilize within 60 days tier iiiunits that could mobilize within 180 days the common term tiered readiness has been used to connote the concept of varying degrees of readiness for units 4 the times of arrival for particular forces are described in war plans each theater commanderin continued congressional research service the library of congress crs2 savings could accrue because not all forces would be maintained at their highest states of readiness operations and maintenance om accounts could then be reduced and savings could be directed towards force modernization budget categories there are seven major dod budget categories military personnel procurement research and development military construction family housing revolving funds and om most readinessrelated spending occurs in the om accounts readiness generally refers to activities such as training exercises maintenance and supplies needed to keep us forces prepared to carry out their combat missions the tiered readiness concept envisions less money being directed to those units that are categorized as laterarriving modernization generally refers to research and development as well as procurement although some aspects of modernization are paid out of other accounts as an example upgrading units personal computer inventory would most likely come from the units om account but the bulk of modernization concerns warfightingsupporting platforms eg planes ships tanks munitions satellites missiles and other majorend programs the tension between current readiness and modernization for several years dod has reduced its procurement of new weapons as an explicit policy of the clinton administration william cohen secretary of defense expressed the administrations policy priorities in his first statement to congress on the fy1998 defense budget february 12 1997 people firstthe second priority is readiness andthe third priority is modernization 5 in postcold war era people and readiness accounts have drawn increasing budget shares creating debate between current readiness and modernization6 the quadrennial defense review and report on tiered readiness in may 1997 dod released the report of the quadrennial defense review qdr7 dod had been charged by the congress with conducting comprehensive examination of force structure modernization infrastructure budgets and all other elements as they relate to the u s defense strategy and policy through the year

crs3 readiness tr report 1 preceded the qdr and was released in february 1997 9 tiered readiness was also discussed within section of the qdr in which dod summarized the conclusions drawn in tr report 1 dissatisfied with the scope of the first report the senate now proposes second report tr report 2 further background several high ranking military officers have warned congress about serious readiness challenges since 1992 some in congress have likened the current situation to that of the postvietnam era of the late seventies when nearterm readiness for somewhat different reasons dropped dangerously low 10 since 1992 greater shares of declining defense budgets have been used to meet these readiness challenges over the past five years dod has reduced procurement spending by about twothirds which has made room in the budget for robust funding for training maintenance quality of life and other components of nearterm readiness 11 this has prompted additional concerns however that force modernization is being undermined and that future force readiness could be in jeopardy senator john mccain has concluded that savings within the readiness accounts should be explored and has proposed the tiering system of current readiness force structure to pay for additional modernization12 dod has asserted however that estimated annual savings of only about 100 million would create force that could not meet major theater war deployment timelines and that such tiering would significantly increase risk at the gain of only modest savings while limiting the flexibility required to execute current war plans13 the flexibility to respond to wide range of deterrence conflict prevention and peacetime activities as well as major theater war are all missions tasks and strategic concepts currently embodied in the national security documents of the clinton administration secretary of defense and the joint chiefs of staff14 the requirement for second report 9 see dod report on

authorization act approach tiered readiness differently the house prohibits implementation and requires the secretary of defense to justify to congress why dod would move to such system 15 the senate on the other hand requires dod to followup on the onetime report required in the fy1997 law noting that the first report left number of issues unresolved16 although there was further specific critique of tr report 1 the senate is now recommending more expansive exploration in tr report 217 according to the senates language second report must focus on qdr force structure the implied logic is that the first report predated and therefore neglected to consider the breadth of changes within the qdr s 936 would also require second report to look 1 at lower operational levels eg brigade battalion and squadron 2 at rotational scheme that matches and subsequently tiers army and marine corps divisions as well as air force navy and marine corps air wings and 3 at all operations and maintenance activity that would be affected by tiering tiered readiness issues tiering methods already in place dod maintains that the services are already doing some form of tiering and the house agrees 18 the navy and marine corps rotate their forces on cyclical scheme that naturally differentiates units that are afloat and thus operational from those forces that are in homeport either in refit or preparing to go operational the army keeps units most likely to deploy first at their highest readiness while other units have lower priority on personnel and equipment concept that tiers by resourcing 19 the air force keeps most combat units at their highest readiness but shares significant number of missions with the air national guard and air force reserve called tiering by tasking 20 these differences in the operational patterns of each of the services complicate the question of tiering readiness naval forces rotate on cyclical system tantamount to rotating their readiness so that operational forces are most ready and inport forces are least ready the cyclical deployment schedule of the navy and marine corps rotate operational forces and at any time some units are more ready than others the army puts an emphasis on firsttogo units and gives them fullup 15 hr 1119 section 314 16 s rpt 10529 section 1034 17 discussion with sasc staff members augustseptember 1997 18 see qdr report 3536 additional information provided through discussions with analysts in osd and joint staff and specific language in h rpt 105132 19 see qdr report 3536 additionally and according to an inside the army february 3 1997 news report the us army already has certain kind of tiering in its firsttofight units which are ready on moments notice and are fielded with better equipment the system divides the army into force packages with force package i being the most ready and packages ii and ii progressively less ready 20 this is concept that the usaf refers to as total force policy where active and reserveguard units participate in operational activities as team effort units are tasked according to their capability form of tiering occurs through these very specific taskings crs5 resources while not doing the same for those units that are not firsttogo 21 this arguably tiers their forces the air force maintains mix of guard reserve and active duty forces that divide missions on the basis of capabilities landbased air forces generally do not operate on deploymentbasedcyclical schedule but are always maintained at high readiness levels because of their earlyarriving requirements these current practices raise the question of the effectiveness of single approach to readiness across the services h rpt 105132 asserts the committee strongly believes that the military services have over time developed readiness systems that are particulary tailored to their individual requirements these existing systems already represent form of tiering in that resources are allocated on priority basis to military units that are expected to enter into combat first22 analysis of potential costsavings om analysis in its first report dod estimated only about 100 million in savings 23 the sasc points out that om accounts for over 33 of the dod budget with 94 billion projected for fy1998 according to the gao since 1987 the om accounts have been the largest appropriation group in dods budget and are expected to remain the largest through fiscal year 2001 24 in the second report the senate wants to know just what parts of om could be saved by tiered readiness when dod studied this question before the qdr it concluded that large portions of om were not affected by tiering of forces and thus the potential for savings would be limited anticipated costsavings arguments are critical in this overall debate25 peacetime engagement readiness questions focus almost exclusively on warfighting abilities but there is clearly an argument that the current strategy has demands in excess of any war scenario26 describing units only by their wartime requirement neglects their potential use in various peacetime operations that may or may not involve conflict 27 wartimeonly utility measures appear insufficient to capture the 21 see qdr report 3536 22 see hr 119 section 314 23 see qdr report 3536 this figure was an estimated accounting within the qdr based on the findings

asserts that there are large savings to be gained in reducing infrastructure costs associated with further base closings see qdr report 5457 dod also contends that anticipated savings from additional base closings could pay for modernization 26 national security strategy for new century may 1997 and national security strategy of engagement and enlargement may 1995 the white house the national

breadth and depth of current military operations in peacetime engagement deterrence and conflict prevention the senate is specifically asking that the second report examine tiered readiness with force structure advocated by the qdr and it adds to include forces required to deter or defeat strategic attack upon the united states it does not discuss however peacetime engagement activities or certain contingency operations that can cause the greatest readiness variability28 modernization reflects longer term investment while readiness expenses are comparable to an individuals living expenses contingency operations can increase such living expenses to point that impacts the readiness debate 29 this is the challenge of high operational tempo in peacetime because these activities incur costs while they may or may not add to units combat readiness impact of congressional action overall the debate may have refined but did not resolve arguments over defense budget priorities and the choices between current readiness and future force readiness the final conference report language both supported and opposed tiered readiness as both sections of the senate s 936 section 1034 and the house hr1119 section 314 versions remained after conference see public law 10585 sections 328 and 329 the choice to adopt tiered readiness as specific policy was effectively postponed but the arguments for and against reducing current readiness to fund modernization will remain 27 continued in recent years and have placed increased emphasis on the forwarddeployments based approach since the end of the cold war 28 see military contingency operations search for new funding mechanism crs report 95 636f by nina serafino washington 1995 may 22 1995 see also gaonsiad9736 december 12 1996 and gaonsiad
