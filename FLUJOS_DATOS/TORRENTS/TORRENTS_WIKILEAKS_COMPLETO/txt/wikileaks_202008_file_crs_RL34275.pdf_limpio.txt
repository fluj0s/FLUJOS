department finance fy2008 operations in advance of supplemental appropriations summary on december 18 2007 the senate and on december 19 the house approved consolidated fy2008 appropriations bill hr 2764 that includes 70 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations fo r the department of defense for military operations in iraq afghanistan and elsewhere the president signed the bill into law on december 26 congresss agreement to provide 70 billion for overseas military operations resolved dispute over war fundi ng that had led th defense department to announce plans to shut down all but ssential army and ma rine corps operations early in 2008 in the absence of supplemen tal appropriations officials warned that money for army operations would run out by the end of february and for the marine corps in march even after transfer of 41 billion to the army on november 15 2007 secretary of defense gates said that the defense department would cease operations at all army bases by midfeb ruary next year which would result in furloughs of 100000 civilian and nother 100000 contractor personnel the consolidated appropriations bill averted the need for such steps it provided 352 billion for army and 40 billion for ma rine corp operati on and maintenance accounts these amounts are in addition to 274 billion for the army and 48 billion for the marine corps in the re gular fy2008 defense appropriations act pl 110116 the supplemen tal funding added to regu lar appropriations provided enough money to sustain army operations until the end of june or early july 2008 and marine corp operations until the end of august at planned rates of obligation while congresss agreement to provide funds resolves the debate for the present it did not settle the underlying cont roversy recurring issue for congress has been how much flexibility the defense department has to delay if not to avoid entirely shutting down operations when congress does not provide fullyear defense appropriations in the absence of s upplemental appropria tions the defense department relied on funds in the regular fy2008 fense appropriations act to finance both daytoday peacetime activitie s and warrelated operations abroad crs calculated that these funds would be exha usted by february for the army and by early april for the marine corps whic h is about what the defense department projected dods proposed transfer of 41 billion to the army would have extend its operations for another two to three weeks without supplemental appropriations the defense depar tment could have extended operations for about nother month by transferring limited add itional amounts to the army and marine corps nd by slowing down spending through measures such as those the army began to implement in april 2007 such measures would reduce remaining financial flexibility and might disrupt daytoday operations the defense department might have been able to sustain operations longer by invoking the feed and forage act or by using novel unprecedented measures such as assigning the navy and air force to pa costs of army support operations abroad such measures might weaken congressi onal war powers

the army circul ated estimates that funding from the regular defense appropriati ons act plus planned transfers would run out on february 235 crs estimates crs calculations of the length of time the army and marine corps could continue to operate only w ith funds in the regular fy 2008 defense appropriations bill and without slowing down operations we re in line with defense department estimates the determining factor in this calculation is how long money in army and marine corps operation nd maintenance om accounts would last at projected obligation rates the om accounts finan ce broad range of activities including recruitment training transportation clothing subsiste nce fuel facility operation and repair and equipment main tenance funding for army and marine corps om supports both peacetime activitie s and warrelate d operations for the first few months of the fiscal year the army appeared to be planning obligations of about 65 billion per mont h and the marine corps of about 800 million per month the fy2008 defense appropriations act pl 110116 provided 274 billion in om for the army and 48 billion for the marine corps at planned monthly obligation rates therefore the army could operate with baseline appropriations for about four months of the fiscal year which began on october 1 2007 or until the beginning of february and the marine corp s could operate for about six months or until the end of marc h or the beginning of april which is generally consistent with defense department estimates the requested transfer of 41 billion to the army would extend the time the army can operate for another two to three weeks or until the end of february table 1 shows the calculationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34275crs4 table 1 army and marine corps om funding with baseline

by using provisions of standing law that may allow other services to pay for army and marine corps operations service objections to budget maneuvers in the armys official view all of these kinds of budget maneuvers are detrimental in presentation at the brookings institution on december 4 army chief of staff george casey complained that any measures that would make the flow of money unstable or uncertain were di sruptive to the army and discouraging to military personnel in general as chief of staff of the ar my not having predictable timely funding makes it harder for to do my job to

military services have consistently been critical of measures to manipulate budgets to stretch out funding including administration steps to use money from later in the year to finance operations at the start of the ear practice known as cash flowing disputes over the use of cash flowing for the iraq war began as early as january 2004 at that time the administration d ecided not to request fy2005 supplemental appropriations until after the start of calendar year 2005 and instead to rely on cash flowing to sustain operations until well into the spring when senior service leaders expressed concern about that decision in congressional hearings dod comptroller dov zakheim called press conf erence to defend the practice7 subsequently congress initiated the practice of providing partofthe year bridge funding when it added 25 billion in unrequested funds fo r war related expenses to the fy2005 defense appropriations act later congress provided an unrequested bridge fund of 50 billion in

extended operations longer by using these amounts the transfer of excess cash balances in working capital funds is permitted by section 8008 of the fy2008 defense appropriations act8 working capital funds are businesslike activities of the defense department that are funded primarily through revenues from sales to the military services some working capital fund activities maintain inve ntories of products that they sell to military units others provide industrial services such as depot maintenance of equipment the military services use appropriated funds mostly in the opera tion and maintenance accounts to make the purchases section 8008 allows the funds to maintain sufficient cash balances to meet projected requirements for disburseme nts excess cash balances may then be available for transfer to ot her accounts including service operation and maintenance accounts amounts of excess cash balances vary fro m fund to fund and from year to year as of the beginning of december 2007 the defense departme nt had tapped fy2008 excess cash balances twice the fy 2008 defense ppropriations act used 628 million to offset army navy air force and defensewide operation and

another 21 billion appeared to be available by tapping all of the remaining funds to finance army and marine corps om accounts the defense department could have ex tend operations for week or two this would have further reduced dods remaining financ ial flexibility to respond to future developments though perhaps only temporarily in its n ovember 20 transfer request dod asked congress to restore the 37 billion in transfers to the air force and navy and congress has in the past agr eed to forgive amounts transferred because of delays in making s upplemental appropriations10 while waiting for

measures could reduce obligations by as much as 36 billion over three months out of fy2007 obligations of about 6 billion per month12 the army and marine corps might also have been able to defer some other fundi ng by for example delaying orders for depot maintenance of equipment for wh ich the army planned average obligations of about 400 million per month in fy2008 ie about 16 b illion over the first four months of the year or 20 billion over five months pros and cons if implemented over four months slowing operations and delaying depot maintenance or ders might have reduce obligations by as much as 5 billion 36 billion from measures like those identified last april plus 16 billion from deferring depot maintena nce though less if they were pursued selectively this would have been enough for an add itional three weeks or so of operations some of these measures might have been less disruptive to the daytoday operations of the force than others particularly if undertaken on only temporary basis the army reportedly had depot maintenance backlog of about 7 Â½ months so there might have been some room to defer new orders without disrupting depot work flows13 it is uncertain how

steps taken in april 2007 he explained were design ed to extend operations on the assumption that congress would provide additional appr opriations quite soon this time however defense officials insisted that the challenge was not how to cope with delay in funding but rather how to implement shut off of funds14 invoke the feed and forage act the feed and forage act 41 usc 1115 is longstanding law with antecedents from well before the civil war16 that gives the defense department authority to finance some costs of military operations in advance of congressional appropriations in the past 40 years the act has been used periodically to pay for unplanned military contingencies and to sustain military ope rations when supplemental appropriations have been delayed the feed and forage act permits the partment of defense to obligate funds in advance of appropriations for clothi ng subsistence forage fuel quarters transportation or medical and hospital s upplies obligations may not however exceed the necessities of the current year these categories are broad enough to encompass most activities financed in operation and mainte nance accounts the transportation category fo r example has been interp reted to allow operation of weapons engaged in combat including ai rcraft carrying out bombing missions in southeast asia and funding of repairs of equipment including purchases of spare parts17 the law does not however permit pa of uniformed personnel or purchases of munitions or other weapons when queried about the use of the feed and forage act pentagon

those circumstances is provide is basically provide for their survival its feed and forage provision it dates back before the civil war and it will allow us really just to provide for their feed and thats it so its an extraordinarily desperate situation we are not there yet we ar not talking about invoking that yet18 the feed and forage act has been used in the past in circumstances quite similar

military operations in the event of unexpected developments the potential use of substantial amounts to carry on combat operations particular ly if congress has denied or refused to act on funding for war may be of concern to congress because of its implications for congressional war powers including the pow er of the purse during the vietnam war use of the feed and forage act ig nited vigorous debate over war powers issues in 1973 senators mathias and chur ch sponsored hearings on the law and in 1974 and 1975 senator abourezk proposed rep ealing the act because he argued it eroded congressional authority19 use of the feed and forage act under current circumstances may warrant similar concerns unless congress were to enact language restricting funding for iraq in th is or any other act use of funding under the feed and forage act would not appear to be subject to any limitations the act has other has limitations as well significantly while the act permits the defense department to obligat funds ie sign contracts or hire civilian personnel in dods interpretation it doe s not permit actual expenditu res ie outlays of funds without congressiona l appropriations20 this would require contractors to agree likely at some cost to the government to contracts that might defer actual payments in effect the law allows the defense partment to obligate congress to provide what are known as deficiency appropriati ons which were quite frequently enacted up until the 1950s but have not been used often since then the enactment of deficiency appropriations may however be delayed use title 10 authorities to assign support operations to other services while the use of the feed and forage act has an extensive history there are some other authorities in standing law that might be used to extend army and marine corps operations but for which crs is not aware of any precedents one such provision is 10 usc 165 title 10 us code is the standing law that establishes the department of defense and in cludes most of the statutor language that governs its organization and operations section 165c specifically permits the secretary of defense to assign responsibility to other components of the defe nse department for administration and support of forces assigned to combatant commands including the central command responsible for operations in iraq and afghanistan the term components includes the ac tive duty element of each military service each of the reserve elements and defense agencies the full text of the provision reads httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34275crs11 21 see title 5 section 3341 and title 10 sec 113 d c assignment of responsibility to other components of dod after consultation with the secretaries of the military departments the secretary of defense may assign the responsibility or any part of the responsibility for the administration and support of forces assigned to the combatant commands to other components of the department of defense including defense agencies and combatant commands component assigned such responsibility shall discharge that responsibility subject to th authority direction and control of the secretary of defense and subject to the authority of commanders of the combatant commands under section 164 c of this title pros and cons on its face 10 usc 165 c would appear to allow the defense department consid erable latitude to assi gn management and budget responsibility to the air force and navy for such support activities as food and housing services handled by civilian c ontractors under what are know as logcap contracts for which 62 billion is requested in fy2008 contracts for linguists for which 11 billion is requested subsistence for dod civilians and contractors for which 675 million is requested or other wa r support activities the secretary also has authority to detail civilia n personnel from one service to another as part of his general responsibility for managing the department so army personnel currently managing these contracts coul d be detailed to nother service to ensure continuity21 since air force and navy om budgets were less limited than army and marine corps budgets this would furthe r extend the amount of time the army and marine corps could operate without fy2008 s upplemental funding the fy2008 defense appropriations act provided 322 b

operations by monthanda half while funding for ai r force and navy operations would be reduced by about two months since the use of this provision is unpre cedented it is not apparent whether shift of responsibilities could quickly and fficiently be implemented use of this authority might also be matter of consid erable concern to congress since it would appear to undermine congre ssional limitations on the use of funds if the navy can support army operations with large amounts of money then the integrity of the account structure into which congress ppropriates money is clearly at issue summary of measures to extend operations the defense department warned that money available to sustain army and marine corps operations would run out in february or marc h and crs calculations are consistent with this projection the defense department mig ht have been able to extend military operations further by tr ansferring limited additional amounts to the army and marine corps and by slowing down operations but each alternative has some disadvantages excess cash balances remaining in working capital funds might be as high as 21 billion tapping these funds would however reducehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34275crs12 dods remaining flexibility to respond to unexpected developments the army projected that measures it planned to slow down operations in april 2007 might at the upper limit avoid 36 billion or so of obligations over three months some of these measures however may disrupt daytoday army operations deferring new orders for depot maintenance might reduce planned obligations by 400 million or so per month or about 16 billion over four months or 20 billion over five months crs cannot however assess how this would affect depot work planning taken together all of these measures might temporarily reduce or offset army and marine corps funding re quirements by as much as 21 billion use remaining excess cash balances in working capita l funds 36 billion slow operations 16 billion defer new depot maintenance orders 73 billion or bit more than one months worth of funding at the thenc urrent obligation rate s which would allow the army to extend operations til about the end of march 2008 see table 2 potentially more significant source of funds might have been to invoke the feed and forage act in the past it has been used to finance as much as 74 billion of warrelated operations in todays prices that amount would finance army and marine corps operations for about another month opera tions might be sustained longer if larger amounts were used there may be some problems negotiating contracts however and use of the feed and forage act raises significant war powers issues for congress to recommend us of the feed and forage act appears particularly ironic it is in sense to write the script for the executive branch to evade legislative restrictions on the use of funds to carry on the war in iraq the potential for dod to use unprecedented measures such as the flexibility given to the secretary of defense to r eassign responsibility for support activities to other services is particularly hard to assess it might be difficult to administer or it might involve only paper changes that c ould be implemented quickly it would appear however to undermine congressi onal controls on the use of

rates the estimates in table a1 are based on assumed monthly obligation rates shown in column 4 of each table of 65 billion per month for the army and 790 million month for the marine corps the assumed army obligation rate is based on army estimates that it would exhaust funding available in the regular fy2008 defense appropriations act plus funding transferred from other accounts by february 23 this monthly obligation rate appears reasonable though it is somewhat below th average monthly rate that would result from the amount provided in the regular fy 2008 defense appropriations act plus the amended supplemental appropr iations request for army om the assumed marine corps obligation rate is the level the marine corps appeared to be assuming early in the fiscal year which is quite close to the average monthly rate reflected in marine corps budget requests the estimates in table a2 reflect dod briefings to congressional staff in march 2008 the projected obligation rate s reflect the average monthly rate of funding that would result from amounts re quested in the regular fy2008 defense appropriations act and in the amended supplemental ppropriations request for each budget account if obligations rates were slower as they were earlier in the year money would last longer
