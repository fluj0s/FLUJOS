6210c09 shspec201 instructors bugbear an auditor clears as fast as he is bright and as he delivers good quality auditing and he clears as slowly as he flubs if all is not going well look to what is wrong with the auditor not the pc there is nothing wrong with pcs some pcs require more cleverness on the part of the auditor than others a0pparently the individuality of life was all attained by goals that doesnt mean people are individuals because of goals it means that they are odd individuals because of goals goal is symptom of individuation so each person acts differently in processing but there is goal too difficult to be found if you can discover goal never to be discovered why you have damned good technology auditing quality is not associated with sternness or immovability or with being able to repeat the auditing command or the idea that the auditor must always be right an instructor watching half dozen auditors may think that he needs half dozen new rules to overcome these students peculiar difficulties actually a11 he needs is tremendous ability to detect variation from the standard rule this variation is sometimes so clever and well hidden that one never spots it an auditor can leave the session on the forward track by leaving the pc at time point and progressing to point g as fast as possible the auditor is actually leaving the session by way of the future time track instead of the door the auditor is running the session process and the pc is still stuck in the first rud that the auditor couldnt confront and therefore didnt handle in an effort to avoid facing the confusion in session the auditor unwittingly refuses to set up session he ignores and evades some part of the session that he has had trouble with now the pc is trying to get into session while the auditor tries to run from the session the pcs who give you the most trouble are the ones who do the least they dont explode at you they dont walk out they are just never in session and auditing never bites they make forward progress the good pc is produced by an auditor who never gets the pc into session enough to arc break them everything is all sort of shallow dusted off but not investigated etc there was communication and understanding present the auditor was trying to avoid arc breaks so there was arc at the outset and the whole session was an arc break standard auditing is the cycle of asking the auditing question of that pc who is sitting in that chair getting response or answer from that pc which is then understood by the auditor and is acknowledged by the auditor in such way that the pc knows he did properly answer when this is interfered with weirdnesses creep in it is terribly simple cycle and terribly simple people such as myself dont seem to have too much trouble with it more brilliant people figure their way through and arrive at some kind of mutated answer to it that produces noauditing situation and how they manage to do this is the subject of an instructor this is the instructors nightmare the instructor must observe the departure from the simple comm cycle and get the auditor to see what he is doing the instructor has to point out to students their errors in such way that they realize that they are not doing what they should be doing where do all these oddball considerations come from apart from goals which is source that we already know about man can rise above his aberrations anyway he doesnt have to dramatize his aberrations to the full it is not good enough to say that his goal and his item oppose his being good auditor even though he will perhaps never be fully expert until these are out of the way there is another element however the auditor has fixed idea left over from some group or philosophy or activity about what is supposed to happen or what he is supposed to do to make something happen when he audits for instance he may have been part of society which supposed that there was reason why you couldnt decide to be anything you wanted to be and immediately become it according to this view all men were evil because they couldnt do this thats rather familiar one on the track this is weird way of making nothing out of thetans an auditor with this kind of background operates on the basis that the pc is weak because he doesnt just make up his mind to go clear and do it another oddball consideration is why should you ask anybody question they already know and they know you know wait minute those are the people who think that everybody knows all about them to whom every minute is missed withhold this is the consideration well that is obvious to so it should be obvious to him then there is the consideration that the auditor has to control the session and that that means never let the pc originate or never confess that you didnt understand the answer or never check anything the pc tells you is out like rud so this auditor is doing basic notis of auditing the whole time he is auditing and it will be found that he has never examined his fixed idea with this auditor the instructor must 1 find the fixed idea 2 get the auditor to look at it person can get the impression of knowing from an impact so if you have committed fantastic number of overts against thing you conceive that you know something about it but its an inverted knowingness its the total cycle of individuation and the pc returns on the reverse curve of inversion back to the center of impact see pp 242242a for more detailed description of this cycle at this point he knows that he knows but ask him say psychiatrist what he knows and he cant tell you anything that he knows if you kept it up things would get very interesting because you would deindividuate him out of an obsessed interiorization into whatever hes doing you would be reversing the cycle until he again knows he doesnt know when you try to teach such an individual something to know that room has already been rented it has occupants you cant because he already knowsat the level of impact and obsessive interiorization so you have to reverse that cycle and convince him that there is something he doesnt know this is the guy who greets everything you tell him with yes i know so you say to him everybody hates you and you will get yes i know 0h now wait minute well i knew if i knocked long enough somebody would open that door hello if you press such an auditor long and well enough as an instructor he will eventually cognite either that he knows or that he doesnt know and new piece of certainty will be added to his auditing dont leave these fixed ideas uninspected by the auditor just ask him to inspect his own considerations about why he is doing must do or should do what he is doing wrong take his cockeyed memorized answers acknowledge and then give the question again break down his machinery and he will finally see some screwy alteris that he has added into what he really should be doing ask him what puzzles you in session and you will get an item of alteris and confusion it is usually something he has added which wasnt taught all additives occur in the absence of understanding or the presence of misunderstanding idiocy equals all additives and understanding understanding is the reason for additives misunderstanding is the reason for additives know this misunderstandings get picked up on meters as disagreement nocomprehension of education by disagreement is fascinating approach hence while word clearing on meter you dont ask on spotting read what didnt you understand there you ask for the symptom of the lack of understanding what is the disagreement there in life with respect to knowledge disagreement occurs after the misunderstanding get the auditor to spot his disagreements and you will find his misunderstoods if you get him to give you twelve things in that bulletin you agree with you will inevitably get the twelve things they disagree with person cannot do what he does not understand increase persons understanding arc of what he is doing and he will do it better an auditor is not evil there is something he misunderstands or doesnt understand about the function of the auditor or the cycle of auditing action you cant understand psychiatrists because you dont realize that they havent any goals they arent doing anything that you would think they should be doing goofing auditor can get really wild in his computations you have to spot it and get him to spot it for instance you could get computation like this 1 im trying to straighten out this pcs mind 2 therefore i have to correct the things that they think 3 the only way to correct anything is to change it 4 so to change the pc i have to correct him 5 so i have to tell the pc something different every time he says something if you do not understand what is going on in session you wont be able to handle that session at the bottom of all error is misunderstanding you restore understanding of something by deleting the disagreement with it then you can study it and do things with it etc
