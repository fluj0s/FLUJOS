and rescue usr task forces have been designated by the department of homeland security dhs to provide specialized assistance after buildings or other structures collapse1 the task forces work to stabilize damaged structures locate and extricate victims identify risks of additional collapses and meet other needs at disaster sites each task force is comprised of at least 70 persons whose skills as unit members include engineering emergency medicine canine handling firefighting hazardous material handling communications logistics and other areas although the usr task forces are local government entities they may be considered part of the federal emergency response network as they receive funding 1 for background on usr task forces see httpwwwfemagovemergencyusraboutshtm visited apr 24 2006 congressional research service the library of congress crs2 training and accreditation from the federal government2 congress authorized emergency search and rescue response activities in 1990 as part of an earthquake hazards reduction program and federal involvement in the urban search and rescue field has increased since the establishment of the task forces in the 1990s the successful deployment of task forces after the terrorist attacks of 2001 the bombing of the murrah federal building in oklahoma city in 1995 actions taken after hurricane katrina and other disasters appears to have established general support for the task force concept genesis and growth the federal role in urban search and rescue efforts has developed slowly over the past three decades its roots may be traced to congressional enactment of the earthquake hazards reduction act of 1977 to stimulate research and planning related to preparation for and response to the devastation of earthquakes3 the statute recognized that federal and nonfederal entities both public and private must exercise responsibilities to reduce losses and disruptions from earthquakes the primary mandate given to the president in the 1977 statute was to designate responsible agencies to establish and maintain coordinated earthquake hazards reduction program one primarily oriented toward httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21073 earthquake prediction and mitigation4 objectives that were to be incorporated in the program included organizing emergency services and educating the public and state and local officials on ways to reduce the adverse consequences of an earthquake5 following establishment of the federal emergency management agency fema in 1979 congress amended the 1977 statute to require fema to serve as lead agency for the program6 more recently the 108th congress transferred that authority to the national institute of standards and technology of the department of commerce7 the most significant program change relevant to the history of the usr task forces was the 1980 requirement that the director of fema submit an interagency coordination plan for earthquake hazard mitigation and response emphasis added to congress8 this provision indicates that congress perhaps for the first time authorized federal action and responsibility for disaster response efforts traditionally considered the jurisdiction of state and local governments as consequence of the loma prieta earthquake of 1989 congress and fema revisited the scope of nehrp fema established the national urban search and rescue response system that same year also in the aftermath of that earthquake congress enacted the national earthquake hazards reduction program reauthorization act of 2

authority to include the following charge develop and coordinate the execution of federal interagency plans to respond to an earthquake with specific plans for each highrisk area which ensure the availability of adequate emergency medical resources search and rescue personnel and equipment and emergency broadcast capability10 in 2004 the 108th congress further amended the 1977 earthquake hazards act the amendment required that the undersecretary of homeland security for emergency preparedness and response who also serves as the director of fema develop and coordinate the national response plan and support state and local plans to ensure the availability of adequate emergency medical resources search and rescue personnel and equipment and emergency broadcast capability11 the most recent pertinent development concerns the approval and publication of the national response plan pursuant to congressional directive the department of homeland security has issued the plan to ensure that federal and nonfederal entities httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21073 coordinate their response to significant catastrophes12 task force operations and capabilities after disaster occurs that requires the assistance of usr task forces dhs generally activates up to three task forces located closest to the disaster task forces must be able to deploy all personnel and equipment within six hours of activation and must be able to sustain themselves for the first 72 hours of operations each task force must include wide range of emergency response capabilities requirement that calls upon each task force member to complete significant amount of training and must consist of deployable roster of at least 70 fully trained individuals dhs has established goal for each position on the task force to be staffed to ensure that each position has at least two alternates in reserve task force members must hold the following specialist skills technical search rescue emergency medicine structural engineering logistics communications canine search and hazardous materials handling task force must continue training and evaluation to maintain the accreditation status received from dhs members commonly work in 12hour shifts task forces are supported by incident support teams ists which provide technical assistance to state and local emergency managers coordinate the activities of multiple task forces and provide logistical support 9 104 stat 32313243 10 104 stat 3234 42 usc 7704b2aiv 11 section 103 pl 108360 42 usc 7704b2 12 section 5026 pl 107296 6 usc 3126 required that the

information on usr funding is not readily available although some data have been published federal funding for the activities of the task forces in responding to catastrophes is provided through the disaster relief fund administered by fema13 in general host employers of task force members generally units of local government serve as the primary source of funds for the task forces the federal government provides funding for costs incurred when they are activated by fema according to one member of congress at least in past years states provide little if any financial support14 some historical information is available on funds congress appropriates to ensure that the supplies and capabilities of the task forces are maintained in fy1998 and fy1999 roughly 4 million in federal funding was provided to the teams15 fy2001 fema allocated approximately 64 million to the usr program for training and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21073 equipment which was distributed to the task forces based on need according to program officials state and local governments expected to pay 80 of the longterm costs associated with sponsoring usr task force in fy2001 fema also allocated 3 million for upgrading six task forces to weapons of mass destruction capability wmd this new capability was meant to enable the task forces to search collapsed structures in an environment with chemical biological or radiological contamination16 following the terrorist attacks of september 2001 usr task forces received federal funds to cover costs associated with responding to the world trade center and pentagon sites out of its discretionary funds in the emergency supplemental appropriation pl 10738 the administration allocated funds to the task forces congress also allocated roughly 324 million to the usr program in fy2002 supplemental appropriations pl 107206 for fy2003 congress provided 60 million for the 28 existing task forces the conference report accompanying the appropriation bill pl 1087 stated that the funds could be used for operational costs equipment and training the report also emphasized readiness for operating in an environment contaminated by weapon of mass destruction17

1147 19 pl 108334 118 stat 1311 crs6 additional task forces some members of congress along with state and local officials contend that more task forces should be certified throughout the nation dhs officials however have expressed concern that the establishment of more task forces would dilute the available funding to train equip and manage the task force network members of congress may consider several options with regard to this issue 1 adopt language in the appropriations legislation for dhs that directs the department to establish additional task forces whether in specified states or at the discretion of dhs officials 2 consider legislation that statutorily establishes usr task forces such as hr 88 and s 446 pending before the 109th congress authorization the usr task forces have developed over time through administrative actions taken by fema now dhs in response to the general authority provided by congress in the earthquake statute discussed above since the role of the task forces has evolved members of congress might elect to consider legislation that specifies attributes of the task forces identifies requirements and establishes permanent httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21073 funding accounts two bills before congress s 3721 and hr 5351 would authorize establishment of usr response system funding funding for usr task forces like other aspects of homeland security could be increased to ensure that sufficient equipment and reserves are available to task forces congress might consider legislation such as s 930 considered in the 108th congress but not acted upon that would require the secretary of dhs to provide grants to task forces to ensure that operational administrative and training costs continue to be met others may argue however that federal support and involvement in task forces should be minimized as the federal need for usr task forces occurs relatively infrequently and task forces primarily serve local government purposes redundancy congress may wish to debate how usr task forces fit into the broader scope of federal disaster response efforts report issued by the general accounting office prior to the terrorist attacks of 2001 identified 24 types of teams administered by eight federal agencies capable of responding to terrorist incidents involving weapons of mass destruction20 the extent to which usr task forces duplicate the capabilities and authorities of other federal response teams might be considered oversight the secretary of homeland security has reestablished the national urban search and rescue response system advisory committee21 will the recommendations of the committee be made available to congress if so in what form and how frequently 20 us general accounting office combating terrorism federal response
