report will not be updated on april 29 2004 the department of state released its annual patterns of global terrorism report after discrepancies we re noted in reported data the department of state issu ed revised statistics on j une 22 2004 the newly released data showed minimal change in the number of terrorist attacks worldwide in 2003 over 2002 levels an increase from 205 ttacks to 208 in 2003 the overall number of reported antius attacks declined visibly 60 antius attacks in 2003 as opposed to 77 attacks in the previous year in 2003 the number of persons killed in international terrorist attacks was 625 down from 725 in 2002 in 2003 persons wounded numbered 3646 up from 2013 the previous year in 2003 as in 2002 both the highest number of attacks 80 and highest number of casualties 159 dead and 1268 wounded continued to occur in asia notably the report defines terrorist acts as incidents directed agains t noncombatants thus attack s in iraq on military targets are not

the newly operational terrorist threat integr ation center ttic on august 2 2004 president bush announced plans to cr eate national count erterrorism center nctc an institutional change recommended by the 911 commission in its july 19 2004 report the center is envisioned as serving as central knowledge bank for information about known and suspected terrorists and would be charged with coordinating and monitoring counterterrorism plans and activities of ll government agencies and preparing the daily terrorism threat report for the president and senior officials presumably the function of compiling the data for patterns will be performed by the new national counter terrorism center if and when it is established it has been some fifteen years since congress mandated the first patterns report when the report was originally conceived as reference document the primary threat from terrorism was state sponsored since th the threat has evolved with qaeda affiliated groups and nonstat sponsors increasingly posing major threat given the increased complexity and danger posed by the terrorist threat one option available to congress and the executive branch is to take fresh look at

report trends state sponsors and related issues overview of 2003 terrorist trends on april 29 2 004 the partment of state released its patterns of global terrorism report hereafter referred to as patterns 2003 1 shortly thereafter it was observed that the original numbers of terrorist attacks and casualties were understated and on june 22 2004 an upda ted version was released2 revised data3 show minimal change in the number of terrorist attacks worldwide in 2003 over 2002 levels an increase from 205 attacks to 208 in 2003 the overall number of reported antius attacks declined visibly 60 antius attacks in 2003 as opposed to 77 attacks in the previous year the report indicates that worldwide deaths from international terrorist activity were down roughly 14 in 2003 from 725 to 625 and the number of wounded was up roughly 81 from 2013 to 3646 in 2003 as in 2002 both the highest number of attacks 80 and highest number of casualties 159 dead and 1268 wounded continued to occur in asia where the numbe r of attacks declined roughly by onefifth and the number of casualties increased roughly 11 the report emphasizes that most of the attacks in iraq that occurred during operation iraqi

designated foreign terrorist organi zations and other terrorist groups5 state sponsors of terrorism in addition to data on terrorist tre nds groups and activities worldwide the report provides description as to why countries are on th us list of state sponsors of terrorism that are subject to us sanctions thus included in patterns are detailed data on the seven countries currently on the terrorism list cuba iran iraq libya north korea sudan and syria us administration officials maintain that the practice of designating and repor ting on the activities of the state sponsors of terrorism list and concomitant sanctions policy has contributed significantly to reduction in the overt and apparently overall activity level of states supporting terrorism in the past decade libya and sudan are frequently cited as examples of such success countries designated as st ate sponsors of terrorism are subject to severe us export controls particular ly of dual use technology the antiterrorism and arms export amendments act of 1989 pl 101222 prohibits export of dual use items as well sales of milita ry items and foreign economic assistance to countries on the terrorism list also the foreign assist ance act prohibits providing foreign aid to these designated countries section 6 j of the 1979 export administration act stipulates that congress must be notifie d at least 30 days in advance before any licenses are issued for exporting equipment or services that could be used for terrorist or military purposes other sanctions include denying foreign tax credits on income earned in those countries the degree of support for or involvement in terrorist activities typically varies dramatically from nation to nation in 2003 of the seven on the us terrorism list iran continued to be characterized on one extreme as an active supporter of terrorism nation that uses terrorism as an instrume nt of policy or warfa re beyond its borders closer to the middle of the spectrum is syri although not formally detected in an active role since 1986 patterns reports that the assad re gime reportedly uses groups in syria and lebanon to export terror into isr ael and allows groups to train in territory under its control on the less active end of the spectrum one might place countrieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32417crs3 6 patterns 2003 p 88such as cuba or north korea which at the height of the cold war were more active but in recent years have seemed to settle for more passive role of granting ongoing safe haven to previously admitted terrorists also at the less active end of the spectrum and arguably falling off it are libya and notably sudan which reportedly has stepped up counterterro rism cooperation with us law enforcement and intelligence agencies after the attacks of september 11 2001 country highlights terrorism list nations iran patterns 2003 again designates iran as th most active state sponsor of international terrorism the report which incorporates data from us and allied intelligence services notes that irans islamic revolutionary guard and ministry of intelligence and security were involved in the planning of and support for terrorist acts and continued to exhort variety of groups that use terrorism to pursue their goals6 actions cited include 1 providing sa fe haven to members of qaeda 2 providing money weapons and training to hamas hizballah nd arab palestinian rejectionist groups and 3 helping memb ers of the ansar islam group in iraq transit and find safe haven in iran the report notes that iranian officials have acknowledged detaining qaeda operatives during 2003 but have resisted calls to transfer them to their countries of or igin on december 19 2003 iran announced it will sign an agreement allowing international inspections of nuclear sites iran is not considered to be likely candidate for removal from the department of states terrorism sponsors list in the coming year north korea north korea designated member of the axis of evil by president bush in his 2003 state of the union address is not known to have sponsored any terrorist act s since 1987 according to the report however it continued to give sanctuary to hijackers affiliated with the japanese red army patterns 2003 stresses that north korea announced it planned to sign several antiterrorism conventions but did not take any substantive steps to cooperate in efforts to combat terrorism although patterns notes that north koreas support for international terrorism appears limited at present its efforts to restart its nuclear program and its role in pr oliferation of ba llistic missiles and missile technology suggest that its removal from the terrorism list will not occur anytime soon iraq iraq under saddam hussein had been cited in the 2002 patterns report for longstanding policy of providing safe haven and bases for terrorist groups and as having laid the groundwork for possi ble attacks against civilian and military targets in the united states and other western nations throughout 2002 however in the event of substantive regime change nation may be removed from the terrorism list under us law paragraph 6

against iraq applicable to state sponsors of terrorism which had the practical effect of putting iraq on par with non terrorist states iraq is expected to be removed from the terrorism list as soon as it has its own government in place that pledges not to support terrorist acts in the future requirement expected to be met shortly after june 30 2004 the report notes that the line between insurgency and terrorism has become increasingly blurred in iraq as attacks on civilian targets have become more common by the end of 2003 coalition forces had detained more than 300 suspected foreign fighters in iraq7 libya in 2003 libya reiterated assurances to the security council that it had renounced terrorism had shared intelligence with western intelligence agencies had taken steps to resolve matters related to its past support of terrorism and on december 19 2003 announced it would rid itself of wea pons of mass destruction and allow inspections of its nuclear facilities8 the report states that in 2003 libya held to its pattern in recent ears of curtailing suppor t for international terrorists although tripoli continued in 2003 to maintain contact with some past terrorist clients president bush lift ed sanctions against libya on april 23 2004 after successful intelligence cooperation on wmd issues and efforts by libya to resolve compensation for pam am flight 103 survivors syria syria according to patterns 2003 continued to provide political and material support to palestinia n rejectionist groups and tinued to permit iran to use damascus as transhipment point for resupplying hizballah in lebanon on positive note the report notes that damascus has cooperated with other governments against qaeda the taliban and other rrorist organizations and individuals has discouraged signs of public support for qaeda including in the media and mosques and has made efforts to tighten its borders with iraq to limit the movement of anticoalition foreign fighters on may 11 2004 president bush imposed economic and trade sanctions against syria under the syrian accountability act9 but also waived some of the provisions not ably provisions applying to the export of select

the state sponsors of terrorism list by mark sullivanorganizations it is considered unlikely that cuba will be removed from the terrorism list absent regime change12 sudan sudan is generally considered by observers to be strong candidate for removal from the terrorism list patterns 2003 claims that the nation has deepened its cooperation with the us g overnment producing significant progress in combating terrorist activity but areas of concern remain notably the active presence in sudan of hamas and the pale stine islamic jihad pij in 2004 sudan was removed from the list of countries desi gnated by the secret ary of state as not fully cooperating with the united states in the war on terrorism report issues politicization of report some critics of patterns and its designation of stat sponsors of terrorism charge that the patterns 2003 report generally and specifically its reporting of activities of nations is unduly influenced by comp lex web of overla pping and sometimes competing political and econo mic agendas and concerns as cases in point they refer to activity cited in patterns reports used to justify retaining cuba and north korea on the state sponsors list13 others suggest that patterns heavy focus on state sponsors of terror make such reports less useful in worl d where terrorist activity is increasingly neither state supported nor stat countenanced still others ask whether and to what degree patterns supports sanctions polic that is unrealistically achievable and too unilateral when imposing sanctions on nations in which us and allied economic and st rategic geopolitical interests run high however patterns in its current form is not in tended to set policy thus one potential shortcoming of the criticisms cited above is that they are either policy oriented or revolve around di sagreement with policy issues instead of centering on disagreement with the data and analysis presented in patterns reports moreover such criticisms they maintain arguab ly place too much emphasis on the state sponsors section of p atterns with little or emphasis on the plethora of useful data provided in the report on tr ends in terrorist activity and background on terrorist organizations another issue related to politicization not addressed in patterns 2003 is that of confronting incitement to terrorism when promoted countenanced or facilitated by the action or inaction of nation states over or underemphasizing levels of cooperation particularly strong have been suggestions by some that patterns plays down undesirable levels of counter terrorism cooperation and prog ress in the case of nationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32417crs6 14 note that this is part of much broader policy debate in which crs takes position regarding the place in us anti terror strategy of shortterm measures designed to produce physical security versus longterm strategic measures designed to win hearts and minds arguably some suggest the course of wisdom is mix of policies designed to win both the battle and the war policies which require reporting data and analysis supportive of both tactical and strategic objectives seen as vital to the global campaign against terror patterns 2003 in contrast to pre 911 report versions is silent about pakistans alleged ongoing support for kashmiri militants and their attacks agai nst the population of india some cr itics argue that patterns 2003 also falls far short of criticizing saudi arabia perceived by many analysts as slow unwilling or halfhearted ally in curbing or cracking down on activities which support or spawn terro rism activities outside its borders in contrast patterns 2003 cites saudi arabia as an excellent example of nation increasingly focusing its political will to fight terrorism some suggest however that often at play here is simply desire to put the best face on terrorist related relationships in the hopes of obtaining better cooperation in the future on the flip side of the coin is an issue yet to be resolved of how to inform congress and give countries credit in patterns for cooperation in such matters as intelligence or renditions when for domestic political concerns they do not want this made public one option might be to produce more frequently classified annex to the patterns report which has been done in the pa st downside however is that preparation of classified version is much more time consuming for those tasked with simultaneously preparin g the public document review and restructuring of patterns some also suggest that pattern s reports could be strong er in their coverage of the ideological and economic impact of terro rism on individual nations and the global economy one issue here as raised by some observers is whether patterns places too much emphasis on quantifying and m easuring terrorist success in terms of physical damage to persons and property when terror groups may increasingly be measuring midand long term success by economic and political criteria going beyond the question raised by so of any perceive d shortcomings in data which may or may not be found in patterns 2003 is the question of the quality of strategic analysis of the data provide d to what degree might such analysis be enhanced some observers suggest the issue here is the degree to which patterns is designed to reflect or might be cons trued to reflect body count reporting mentality14 would there be benefits to cong ress and the counterterrorism policy community if the focus of patterns reports was less on presenting statistics and facts and more on gaining meaning from the data and if so how might congress effect such change in policy focus admittedly overall numbers by themselves may not always present complete picture for example each small pipeline bombing in colombia is cited as one incident in patterns as would be major terrorist incident as the multiple train bombings in ma drid in march 2004 another possible shortcoming some note is that patterns sometimes may not include or adequatelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32417crs7 15 see faulty terror report card by alan b krueger and david laitin washington

and state department and ttic staff in may 2004 produced suggestions that the end of year data omission may have been to some degree the result of desire to meet the publication deadline for the printed version of the report note also that data and analysis provided crs by larry johnson former officer in the state departments office of counter terrorism and now di rector of berg associates indicates that the ratio of significant terrorist incidents to total terrorist actions rose fairly steadily from 10 in 1981 to 90 in 2003 see httpwwwbergassociatescom 18 for information on ttic see

representatives of the cias counterterrorist center ctc and the fbis counterterrorism division along with elements of other agencies including dod and dhs ttic began operations on may 1 2004 19 some observers suggest that ttics omissions of data may well give rise to questions about the overall ability and effectiveness of ttic in assuming and performing newly assigned tasks note incidents that are not internationa l in nature but which may have major political or economic impact on the target nation and well beyond it indeed patterns 2003 has been subject to criticism on the issue of data completeness or accuracy as well as on the issue of data relevance15 in may 17 2004 letter to secretary of state colin l powell henry waxman ranking minority member of the house committee on government reform suggests that data in patterns 2003 which indicate that nonsignificant terrorist attacks have declined in the last two years is in sharp contrast to independent analysis of the same data which concludes that significant terro rist attacks acts causing or reasonably expected to cause death serious personal injury or major property damage actually reached 20year high in 200316 also questioned is comp leteness if not factual accuracy of the data relied upon in the patterns 2003 report the list of significant incidents in patterns 2003 as originally disseminated concludes abruptly on november 11 2003 presumably therefore not counting major multiple terrorists attacks that occurred later in the year17 the statistical data which forms the basis for patterns have traditionally been provided to the state department by the cia more recently this function has been transferred to the newly ope rational terrorist threat in tegration center ttic18 ttic is providing an errata sheet to correct incomplete data19 the final report of the 911 commi ssion issued on june 22 2004 recommends the creation of national counterterrorism center subsequently on august 2 2004 president bush announced similar plans to establish such center the new centerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32417crs8 20 httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200408print200408022htmlis envisioned as serving as central knowledge bank for information about known and suspected terrorists and would be ch arged with coordinating and monitoring counterterrorism plans and ac tivities of all government ag encies and preparing the daily terrorism report for the president and senior officials20 presumably the function of compiling the data for patterns will be performed by the new national counterterrorism center if and when it is established conclusion in the wake of discrepa ncies contained in the patterns 2003 as originally released the chairmen of three house committees international relations judiciary government reform forwarded letter to secretary of state colin powell dated july 15 2004 th letter cites discussions between state department and other officials with committee staff and reiterates that there will be comprehensive review of the definitions of terrorist acts as compared to 1 the language in the statute and 2 the current experiences with multinational terrorist organizations that sponsor or otherwise pr omote terrorist acts pe rpetrated by local terrorist organizations moreover it rea ffirms an understanding that the executive branch has assigned an appropriate level of staff to provide full time attention to the contents of the report the results of this executive branch internal review are requested by october 1 2004 it has been some fifteen years since congress mandated the first patterns report at the time the report was originally conceived as reference document the primary threat from terrorism was state sponsored since then the threat has evolved with qaeda affiliated groups and nonstate s ponsors increasingly posing major threat over the years the report has increased in length and expanded in scope it has been disseminated on the internet translated into five additional languages and is widely recognized as primary resource on terro rist activities and groups however in view of the earlier noted data issues the report may be subject to increased criticism and scrutiny in light of the high level of international attention attached to the report and the increased complexity and danger posed by the terrorist threat some observers have suggested that thorough executivecongressional review of patterns its structure and content may be timely and warranted httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32417crs9 patterns of global terrorism data 20022003 2002 2003
