rehabilitation act see crs report rl31298 rehabilitation act summary of 1998 reauthorization legislation by carol oshaughnessy crs3 one function of the state board is to assist the governor in the designation of local workforce investment areas these areas are similar in structure to the service delivery areas established under jtpa under wia request for designation from any unit of general local government with population of 500000 or more is automatically approved under jtpa the threshold for automatic designation was population of 200000 in addition wia requires the governor to approve request for temporary designation as local area from any unit or combination of units of local government with population of 200000 or more that was service delivery area under jtpa and performed successfully and sustained fiscal integrity in the use of jtpa funds within each local area local wib is certified by the governor these local boards are similar in function to the private industry councils pics established under jtpa but have broader responsibility for developing local workforce investment system in addition wia has more specific membership requirements than jtpa had so that wibs might be larger than pics wia also requires each local board to establish youth council as subgroup of the board to develop the youth portion of the local plan to recommend eligible providers of youth activities and to coordinate youth activities in the local area unlike pics under jtpa local board is prohibited from providing training services such as occupational training unless it obtains waiver from the governor local board may provide core services such as job search assistance or intensive services such as comprehensive assessments with the agreement of the local elected official and the governor state administered programs under jtpa there were four state administered programs adult training summer youth employment and training youth training and economic dislocation and worker adjustment assistance ie dislocated worker program each with its own funding stream under the wia the summer youth program is eliminated as separately funded program but local areas are required to provide summer employment opportunities that are directly linked to academic and occupational learning separate funding streams remain for adult and dislocated worker activities7 state and local allocations wia allocates funds to states8 for adult and youth activities using the same jtpa formula9 that allots onethird on the basis of the relative10 number of unemployed individuals residing in areas of substantial unemployment at least 65 onethird on the basis of the relative excess number of unemployed individuals more than 45 of the civilian labor force and onethird on 7 not more than 10 of funds allocated to local areas under each of the three funding streams can be used for administrative costs the administrative funds from each of the funding streams can be pooled into one account for local administration under jtpa not more than 20 could be used for administrative costs also there was provision for pooling administrative funds from various funding streams into one account under wia the secretary of labor shall define the term administrative costs 8 for more detailed description of how funds are allotted to states see httpwwwdoletagov budgetstatfundcfm 9 the main differences from jtpa are in provisions related to allocations to outlying areas and to small state minimums 10 the word relative as used in this report means the number of individuals in state compared to the total number in all states crs4 the basis of the relative number of economically disadvantaged adults of the funds allocated to the state for adult and youth programs the governor can reserve not more than 15 for state activities eg technical assistance to local areas11 the remainder of the funds are allocated to the local areas jtpa mandated that states allocate adult and youth funds to local areas using the same formulas used to allocate funds to the states under wia this remains the case for not less than 70 of funds allocated to local areas the remainder of the adult and youth funds allocated to local areas can be allocated based on formulas developed by the state board and approved by the secretary of labor as part of the state plan that take into account factors relating to excess poverty or excess unemployment above the state average in local areas of funds appropriated for services to dislocated workers the secretary of labor reserves 20 to provide technical assistance demonstration projects and national emergency grants to states or local boards as was the case in jtpa wia also allocates funds to states for dislocated workers using the same jtpa formula that allots onethird on the basis of the relative number of unemployed individuals onethird on the basis of the relative excess number of unemployed individuals and onethird on the basis of the relative number of individuals who have been unemployed for 15 weeks or more at the state level funds for dislocated workers are distributed in the same manner as they were under jtpa the governor can reserve not more than 15 for state level activities and not more than 25 for rapid response activities at least 60 must be allocated to local areas by formula prescribed by the governor based on the following data insured unemployment unemployment concentrations plant closings and mass layoffs declining industries farmerrancher economic hardship and longterm unemployment onestop delivery system under wia each local board with the agreement of the chief elected official develops onestop system to provide core services and access to intensive services and training through at least one physical center which may be supplemented by electronic networks the law mandates that certain partners which are programs such as vocational education welfaretowork and vocational rehabilitation provide applicable services through the onestop system12 partners must enter into written agreements with the local boards regarding services to be provided the funding of the services and operating costs of the system and methods of referring individuals among partners onestop operator which could be single entity or consortium of entities must be designated by the board through competitive process or through an agreement between the board and consortium of at least three partners youth activities subtitle b chapter 4 under wia lowincome youth receive services similar to those authorized under jtpa such as tutoring and study skills 11 funds for state administrative costs come from the amounts reserved for state activities under each of the three state funding streams and cannot be not more than 5 of the total state allotment in addition the administrative funds from each of the funding streams can be pooled into one account for state administration 12 in addition to the mandatory partners wia also specifies optional partners which could included entities that administer temporary assistance for needy families tanf crs5 training alternative high school services and summer youth opportunities services to youth must be provided through grants to providers made on competitive basis as they were under jtpa at least 30 of the funds allocated to local areas have to be spent on youth activities for outofschool youth adult and dislocated worker activities subtitle b chapter 5 under wia one set of services and one delivery system is authorized for both adults and for dislocated workers but funds are appropriated separately for the two groups under jtpa there was one list of authorized services under the adult training program and another list under the dislocated worker program and there could be separate delivery systems wia funds three levels of services core services intensive services and training services anyone age 18 and older is eligible to receive core services such as outreach initial assessment of skills and needs and job search and placement assistance to be eligible to receive intensive services such as comprehensive assessments and development of individual employment plans an individual has to have received at least one core service13 to be eligible to receive training services such as occupational skills training and onthe job training an individual has to have received at least one intensive service have been unable to obtain or retain employment through such services have the skills and qualifications to successfully participate in selected training program select training programs that are directly linked to employment opportunities in the local area and be unable to obtain other grant assistance including pell grants or need assistance above the levels provided by such other grants unlike jtpa income is not criteria for any wia service however if local area determines that adult funds are limited priority for intensive and training services must be given to recipients of public assistance and lowincome individuals individual training accounts adult and dislocated worker training is to be provided primarily though individual training accounts the purpose of individual training accounts is to provide individuals with the opportunity to choose training courses and providers the onestop operator is responsible for arranging payment to the training provider eligible training providers eligible providers are entities who meet minimum requirements established by the governor initially all institutions eligible to participate in the student aid program of title iv of the higher education act and those entities that carry out programs under the national apprenticeship act are automatically eligible to provide training services subsequent eligibility is contingent on meeting performance standards14 local boards retain list of eligible providers along with performance and cost information individuals who have individual training accounts may choose providers from this list in consultation with case manager 13 there is federallyrequired minimum time period for participation in core services before receiving intensive services or for participation in intensive services before receiving training however the federal regulations for wia do not preclude local workforce investment boards from establishing minimum time periods for each level of service 14 for some performance measures such as program completion and wages at completion wia requires providers to collect data on all training participants not just those funded under wia crs6 performance accountability under wia there are 15 core indicators of performance for adults dislocated workers and youth and two indicators of customer satisfaction the state levels of performance are negotiated with the secretary of labor and the local levels in turn are negotiated with the governors technical assistance and sanctions in the form of reduced state allotments may be used by the secretary in the case of poor performance states may receive incentive grants if they exceed performance standards for adult dislocated worker youth adult education and vocational education programs federally administered programs wia continues most federally administered programs including job corps subtitle c native americans migrant and seasonal farmworkers and veterans employment subtitle d sections 166 167 and 168 respectively wia makes relatively minor changes to these programs except for job corps where more extensive changes are made to help assure that youth are placed in centers closest to their homes strengthen linkages between centers and local communities and establish performance measures and expected performance levels state reforms under wia state that enacted statute prior to december 31 1997 that relates to the designation of service delivery areas or sanctioning of local areas for poor performance is in general allowed to continue operating under the state statute further the secretary of labor can waive range of statutory and regulatory requirements upon request from the state15 wia also permits states to request authority from the secretary to waive certain statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to local areas this authority is generally referred to as workflex unified state plan under title v of wia states can submit unified plans that include up to 14 programs specified in the statute such as employment and training programs authorized under the wagnerpeyser act the food stamp act and the rehabilitation act in order to promote coordination and avoid duplication of workforce development activities states submitting unified plans are not required to submit any other plan to receive federal funds for the programs covered in the unified plan authorization under wia the authorization level for most programs is for such sums as necessary for each of the fiscal years 1999 through 2003 as with jtpa appropriations for any fiscal year will be available only on the basis of program year that begins on july 1 in the fiscal year for which the appropriation is made ie fy1999 funds are available from july 1 1999 through june 30 2000 implementation wia became effective when it was signed into law states could implement the act as early as july 1 1999 if they had approved state plans by that time all states were required to implement the act by july 1 2000 15 requirements that cannot be waived are those related to wage and labor standards including nondisplacement protections worker rights participation and protection of workers and participants grievance procedures and judicial review nondiscrimination allocation of funds to local areas eligibility of providers or participants the establishment and functions of local areas and local boards and procedures for review and
