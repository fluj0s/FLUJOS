water resources development act wrda army corps of engineers authorization issues in the 109th congress introduction scientists agree about the ge neral parameters of past nd future rates and patterns of land and wetland loss in co astal louisiana since the 1930s more then 12 million acres mostly coastal wetlands have been c onverted to open water the corps forecasts that land losses will conti nue and that approximately 462000 acres including 328000 wetland acres will be converted to open water by 2050 the corps and others who study these changes believe that future losses will continue to be caused by some combination of human activities such as navigation improvements and development related to oil and gas and natural causes such as relative sea level change these factors have contributed to losses over the past 75 years these sses reduce the quality nd productivity of this wetlands ecosystem and are accompanied by ec onomic and social costs while thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22110crs2 1 the report contains cost estimates date d june 2004 which are used throughout this crs report december 2004 addendum to the report contains updated cost estimate tables dated october 2004 while several component costs changed the total cost estimate of 1996 million is unchanged estimates for individual proj ects are likely to continue to be updated 2 habitat units are defined by the corps in th report as numerical combination of quality and quantity acres calculated for an average year the definition does not give quantitative value to these units it uses these units to compare future scenarios with proposed project and without it the number expresses the magnitude of the benefits or losses that are attributed to the project the corps has used these units in its analysis of some of its other ecosystem restoration programs costs are concentrated in louisiana impacts on navigation energy and commercial fisheries could be felt much more widely for more information on the wetland loss problem see crs report rl32673 coastal louisiana attempting to restore an ecosystem federal and state actions to address extensive land c onversion to open water have been growing over the past 15 years these actions include analyzing the causes and extent of the problem and initiating projects th at are designed to counter it the most recent federal action is the release of the corps louisiana coastal area ecosystem restoration study hereafter referred to as the re port in january 2005 the report recommends five construction projects fo r immediate authoriza tion 10 projects for additional study and several ot her actions that would slow the forecast rate of land loss1 the report provided the basis for the chief of engineers report making recommendations to the assistant secretary of the army for civil works on january 31 2005 the report will be major source of information for congress during consideration of legislation that would respond to past and anticipated land loss the corps report and related documents can be found at httpwwwlcagov for more information on the process by which corps projects are developed see crs report rl32064 army corps of engineers water resources activitie s authorization and appropriations if the projects recommended in the re port are fully implemented the corps estimates that they would reduce the timated loss from 462000 acres by 2050 to about 170000 acres reduction of 625 by both re ducing the number of acres that would be converted to open water nd by reestablishing wetlands at some sites where they had been lost the corps estimates that the five construction projects also would have significant ecosystem benefits it estimate s these benefits to be 22000 habitat units2 if the projects are fully implemented recommendations in the corps report the corps report was prepared to documen t how it determined which construction projects termed nearterm critical restoration features and other activities would be recommended and what be nefits can be anticipated from this suite of proposals the corps has organized these proposals into seven elements in the report drafts of the report were reviewed and comme nted on by others including representatives of federal state and local units of government httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22110crs3 recommended elements if authorized and fully funded the seven elements would be implemented over decade the corps estimates the total cost to complete these elements is 1996 million and that the federal portion of th is total is 1283 million 629 the entire federal portion is fundi ng while the nonfederal share is divided between funding 326 million and real estate 387 million the proposed recommendations include specific construction projects that could be initiated relatively quickly because the preliminary planning and design work is larg ely completed element 1 research and demonstrati on activities elements 2 throug h 5 continuing studies of construction projects that require more extensive planning and design work than those in element 1 and would have to be authorized for construction at later date element 6 and projects that are at more conceptual stage element 7 the seven elements and estimated cost in june 2004 and percentage of the total program cost are as follows element 1 five nearterm critical restoration features that have relatively advanced investiga tions and could be implemented expeditiously in 5 to 10 years after they are authorized by congress and preconstruction docum entation is completed these are shown on the map on the next page as ite ms 1 through 5 864 million or 433 of the total element 2 science and technology progra m to decrease scientific and engineering uncertainties about ecosystem restoration for 10 years 100 million or 50 of the total element 3 demonstration projects r ecommended as result of the science and technology program over 10 years 100 million or 50 of the total element 4 programmatic authorization fo r beneficial uses of dredged materials to benefit co astal wetlands 100 million or 50 of the total element 5 programmatic authorization for investigating modification rehabilitation or management of exis ting water resources structures 10 million or 05 of the total element 6 further analysis and possible future congressional authorization for 10 additional listed features these are shown on the map on the next page as items 6 through 15 762 million or 382 of the total element 7 feasibility studies to evaluate six largescale and longterm concepts to determine their potential for contributing to the restoration effort 60 million or 30 of the total the corps started the planning proce ss leading to these recommendations by identifying 166 restoration features it th winnowed the list down to the five projects in element 1 and the 10 projects in element 6 using complex sorting process described in detail in the report these 15 projects are located on the map below all projects are located in the eastern and central portions of coastal louisiana f unding for these projects would account for almost 82 of the 1996 million in the corps proposed budget in addition the corps identified the six restora tion concepts in element 7 which are much less developed and larger in scale two of the six concepts for example are mississippi river delta manageme nt study and an acadiana bays estuarine restoration feasibility study httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22110crs4 3 the estimated costs in the chiefs report ar somewhat different then those in the report because they are based on updated timates as noted in footnote 1 the chiefs report recommends these elements it distinguishes projects and programs for which it is seeking immediate authorization elements 1 through 4 at total cost of 1123 million further investigations of programs and projects that have already been authorized elements 5 through 7 at total cost of 145 million and future authorization of project cons truction implementing elemen t 6 at cost of 728 million3 in addition to recommending these elements the chiefs report makes two related recommendations first it plans to develop crosscut budget to show annually funding from all federal and nonfederal sources for each project and activity that is considered to be part of this restoration effort cr osscut budgets are already being used for some other ecosystem restoration programs such as the south florida ecosystem restoration program second the corps plans to issue status report to congress every five years to discuss accomplishments and consider refinements to the restoration effort the discussion of this report suggests that it ma include recommendations to add or remove projects from this effort changes to impleme ntation procedures nd other adjustments many might consider this periodic reporting process to be type of adaptive project management the corps has used adaptive mana gement in other restoration efforts plan costs uncertainties and benefits the corps concludes that its recommended plan is the most costeffective of eight alternative plans when comparing average annual costs and averag annual benefits the averag annual cost of this optionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22110crs5 is 66 million the other seven options range from 171 million to 543 million however it provides only slightly less in average annual benefits which the corps calculated as composite of land building habitat suitability and nitrogen removal it calculates numerical value for the benefits of the recommended plan to be 2865 the other seven options range from 3094 to 3202 the corps points out that even with all the research that has been performed there would still be significant uncertainties that accompany the restoration effort the report identifies 19 uncertainties in four groupings knowledge of baseline physical conditions engineering concepts and project impleme ntation methods ecological processes and responses to the proposed actions and so cioeconomic and political conditions and responses the corps identifies actions that can be taken to minimize the uncertainty by collecting additional data or monitoring cer tain aspects of changing conditions in addition as stated above the corps anticipates reviewing the effort ev ery five years and making recommendations for adaptive changes as uncertainties are reduced or resolved the benefits of the five projects in element 1 that the corps proposes for congressional authorization are stated almost entirely in terms of wetland creation and restoration data this shoul d not be surprise since lting wetland deterioration and expanding wetland acreage has been the core concern in coastal louisiana actual wetland benefits however w ill depend on other factors be yond measuring acres gained and lost such as where those wetlands are located what types of wetlands are reestablished and impr ovements in ecological performance in reestablished wetlands the benefits that the corps identifies and discusses in greater detail in the report when it compares future conditions with and without the proposed projects and the wetlands that will be lost or created include hydrology coastal bitats and productivity and socioeconomic factors energy activities navigationshipping and commercial fishing among others it shows that as the amount of land and habitat decreases the productivity measured in amount of vegetation will decrease as well it concludes that land loss will continue but be limited to about 170000 acres if the proposed projects are constructed it does not compare overall sses in coastal louisiana if additional projects are implemented and if this proposal is fully implemented it does identify and briefly discuss losses with additional projects all discussed qualitatively to include disruption of oil gas and pipeline infrastructure deterioration of na vigable waterways diminished coastal fisheries production losses to recreation especially form s that depend on we tlands and habitat diversity and greater exposure and possible destruc tion of cultural resources the proposed projects would meet the corps general mandate that the environmental benefits including improvement of the nvironment and fish and wildlife enhancement are assumed to exceed costs which is standard practice for corps environmental projects in this case creat ed or reestablished wetlands are assumed to provide greater benefits than open waters and areas of open water will increase in both number and size if pr ojects are constructed httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22110crs6 next steps federal authorization with the issuing of the chief of engineers report on january 31 2005 the next steps in the approval pr ocess are review by the secretary of the army and office of management and budget for compliance with administration policy an informal copy of the chiefs report has b een sent to congress if congress authorizes the entire recommended plan the agency would construct the five projects in element 1 initiate the programs in elements 2 through 5 and continue the preliminary investigations of the projects listed in element 6 and the concepts listed in element 7 it is widely anticipated that congress will consider this plan with the next water resources development act wrda legisl ation which may be taken up this year while awaiting congressional action the corps states that it will continue under existing authority with the necessary investigations and preconstruction engineering and design activities to follow the likely legislative process see crs issue brief ib10133 water resources development act wrda army corps of engineers authorization issues in the 109th congress the state role the chief of engineers report identifies the state of louisiana department of natura l resources as the nonfederal costsharing sponsor for the recommended plan according to this report the recommended costsharing for each of the project elements is consistent with current law and corps policies prior to implementation the state must agree to num ber of costsharing and other requirements that are listed in the chiefs report the nonf ederal portion of the funding is 371 of the total or 714 million and majority of this is for real the split between federal and nonfederal shares varies in the corps othe r largescale restoration programs the south florida program is 5050 split while proposal for the upper mississippi would be 91 federal and 9 nonfederal future planning and authorizations the corps will continue to investigate projects identified in elements 6 and 7 for study it then may submit them for congressional authorization although the corp s can continue these investigations under existing authority it requests additional funding authoriza tion in its report to help accelerate this work each of the projects in elements 6 and 7 appears to require substantial additional study before the corps would be ready to submit them to congress to authorize construction although exactly what additional work is required is not stated
