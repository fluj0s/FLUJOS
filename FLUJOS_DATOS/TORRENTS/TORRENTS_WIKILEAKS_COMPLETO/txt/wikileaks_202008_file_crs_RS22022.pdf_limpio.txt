victims who would typically be ineligible for uc may be eligible for disaster unemployment assistance dua1 dua benefits are funded th rough the disaster relief fund administered by the federal emergenc management agency fema the funds are then transferred to the department of labor dol and then distributed by dol to each affected states uc agency2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22022crs2 3 the survivor who becomes the head of household is not required to have wage credits and could be eligible for dua independent of whether the deceased household head would have been eligible for uc benefitsdua benefits are available only to those individuals who have become unemployed as direct result of declared major disa ster first created in1970 through pl 91606 dua benefits are authorized by the robert t stafford disaster relief and emergency relief act the stafford act which authorizes the president to issue major disaster declaration after state and local governme nt resources have been overwhelmed by natural catastrophe or regardle ss of cause any fire flood or explosion in any part of the united states 42 us c 51222 ba sed upon the request of the affected states governor the president may declare that major disaster exists the declaration identifies the areas in the state eligible for assistance the declaration of major disaster provides the full range of disaster assistance availa ble under the stafford act including but not limited to the repair replacement or reconstruction of public and nonprof it facilities cash grants for the personal needs of vi ctims housing and unemployment assistance related to job loss from the disaster dua eligibility the definition of an unemployed worker in the federal regulations for dua benefits differs from the definition used in the uc program for uc benefits for example eligibility for dua benefits does not necessarily require th at the individual have substantial work history and in some cases does not require that the worker be available for work unlike the uc program requireme nts in particular the dua regulation defines eligible unemployed workers to include the selfemployed workers who experience week of unemployment following the datethe major disaster began when such unemployment is direct result of the major disaster workers unable to reach the place of employment as direct result of themajor disaster workers who were to begin employme nt and do not have job or are unable to reach the job as direct result of the major disaster individuals3 who have become the breadwinner or major support for household because the head of the hous ehold has died as direct result of the major disaster and workers who cannot work because of in juries caused as direct result of the disaster just as is the case in the state uc prog rams workers who do not have permission to work legally in the united states are not elig ible for dua benefits individuals must have social security number and an alien regi stration card number in order to apply for dua benefits time limit generally applications must be filed within 30 days after the date the state announces availability of dua benefits when applicants have good cause they may file claims after the 30day deadline this deadline may be extended however initial applications filed after the 26th week following the declaration date will not be consideredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22022crs3 eligibility clarification on november 13 2001 dol issued new interpretive rule clarifying the definition of the phrase unemployment as direct result of the major disaster dol issued this clarifying rule because the september 11 2001 disasters presented number of exigencies not anticipated by the existing regulations the action by dol amended 20 cfr 6255 by adding ne w paragraph c to read as follows 6255 unemployment caused by major disaster c unemployment is direct result of the major disaster for the purposes of paragraphs a1 and b1 of this section workers or self employed individuals unemployment is direct result of the ma jor disaster where the unemployment is an immediate result of the major disaster itsel f and not the result of longer chain of events precipitated or exacerbated by the disaster such an individuals unemployment is direct result of the ma jor disaster if the unemployment resulted from 1 physical damage or destructi on of the place of employment 2 physical inaccessibility of the place of employment due to its closure by the federal government in immediate response to the disaster or 3 lack of work or loss of revenues provid ed that prior to the disaster the employer or the business in the case of selfemployed individual received at least majority of its revenue or income from an entity that was either damaged or destroyed in the disaster or an entity closed by the federa l government in immediate response to the disaster prior to the construction of this new rule the phrase unemployed as direct result of major disaster had neve r been defined in the regulations though dol issued the new clarifying rule in the wake of the ptember 11 2001 disasters the rule applies to any subsequently declared major disasters the rule is intended to make clear distinction between those individuals unemployed as an immediate result of the disaster itself and those whose unemployment may have been caused by long chain of events initiated by the disaster the rule is also intended to exclude those individuals whose unemployment is the result of general economic decline that has been an indirect effect of major disaster dua benefit calculation when reasonable comparative earnings history can be constructed dua bene fits are determined in s imilar manner to regular state uc benefit rules for example selfemployed pers ons would be expected to bring in their tax records to prove level of earnings for the pr evious two years these records would take the place of the employerreported wage data for the workers that are used in uc benefit determination likewise wo rkers who would otherwise be eligible for uc benefits except for the injuries caused as direct resu lt of the disaster that make them unavailable for work would receive dua benefits of an amount equivalent to what they would have received under the uc system if they were not injured and available to work in all cases workers will receive dua benefit that is at l east half of the average uc benefit for that state and cannot receive more than the max imum uc benefit available in that state workers who do not have enough of an employment history to qualify for uc benefits either as new worker or as r ecent hire receive dua benefit equi valent to half of the average uc benefit for that state unemployed workers could also be eligible for reemployment services which may include counseling and referra ls to suitable workhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22022crs4 4 in 1970 pl 91606 required that dua benefits not exceed the maximum amount and duration of the states uc benefit this generally require d duration of not more than 26 weeks section 407 of pl 93288 in 1974 amended this requirement to duration not to exceed one year pl 100707 lowered the maximum duration to 26 weeksopportunities dua assistance is available to ligible individuals as long as the major disaster continues but longer than 26 weeks after the disaster declaration4 in the 107th congress pl 107154 was sign ed into law on march 25 2002 extending the duration of dua benefits from 26 to 39 weeks for victims of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in

half of the average weekly uc benefit for the state where the disaster occurred reduction in dua benefits dua benefits may be reduced by other income received by the dua beneficiary these re ductions are similar to the manner in which this other income reduces uc benefits but do not necessarily mirror them exactly the reductions include benefits or insurance for loss of wages due to illness or disability supplemental unemployment benefits paid pursuant to collective bargaining agreement private income protection insurance workers compensation or survivors benefits if the individual receiving dua becomes the household head as re sult of the death of the head of the household because of the disaster retirement pension or annuity income earnings from employment or selfemployment

attacks differ from those in other disa sters workers continued to apply and receive benefits due to the terrori st attacks in substantial numbers through march 2002 this was attributable to the exte nsion of benefits for an additional 13 weeks provided by pl 107154 the data from hurricane katrina and rita disasters overwhelm the other disasters in the amount of benefits that were paid the
