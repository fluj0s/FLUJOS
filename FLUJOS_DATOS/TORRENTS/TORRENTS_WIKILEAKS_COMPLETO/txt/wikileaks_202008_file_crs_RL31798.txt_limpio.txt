information policy and technology resources science and industry division data mining and homeland security an overview summary data mining has become one of the key features of many homeland security initiatives often used as means for detecting fraud assessing risk and product retailing data mining involves the use of data analysis tools to discover previously unknown valid patterns and relationships in large data sets in the context of homeland security data mining can be potential means to identify terrorist activities such as money transfers and communications and to identify and track individual terrorists themselves such as through travel and immigration records while data mining represents significant advance in the type of analytical tools currently available there are limitations to its capability one limitation is that although data mining can help reveal patterns and relationships it does not tell the user the value or significance of these patterns these types of determinations must be made by the user second limitation is that while data mining can identify connections between behaviors andor variables it does not necessarily identify causal relationship successful data mining still requires skilled technical and analytical specialists who can structure the analysis and interpret the output data mining is becoming increasingly common in both the private and public sectors industries such as banking insurance medicine and retailing commonly use data mining to reduce costs enhance research and increase sales in the public sector data mining applications initially were used as means to detect fraud and waste but have grown to also be used for purposes such as measuring and improving program performance however some of the homeland security data mining applications represent significant expansion in the quantity and scope of data to be analyzed some efforts that have attracted higher level of congressional interest include the terrorism information awareness tia project nowdiscontinued and the computerassisted passenger prescreening system ii capps ii project now canceled and replaced by secure flight other initiatives that have been the subject of congressional interest include the multistate antiterrorism information exchange matrix the able danger program the automated targeting system ats and data collection and analysis projects being conducted by the national security agency nsa as with other aspects of data mining while technological capabilities are important there are other implementation and oversight issues that can influence the success of projects outcome one issue is data quality which refers to the accuracy and completeness of the data being analyzed second issue is the interoperability of the data mining software and databases being used by different agencies third issue is mission creep or the use of data for purposes other than for which the data were originally collected fourth issue is privacy questions that may be considered include the degree to which government agencies should use and mix commercial data with government data whether data sources are being used for purposes other than those for which they were originally designed and possible application of the privacy act to these initiatives it is anticipated that congressional oversight of data mining projects will grow as

valid patterns and relationships in large data sets1 these tools can include statistical models mathematical algorithms and machine learning methods algorithms that improve their performance automatically through experience such as neural networks or decision trees consequently data mining consists of more than collecting and managing data it also includes analysis and prediction data mining can be performed on data represented in quantitative textual or multimedia forms data mining applications can use variety of parameters to examine the data they include association patterns where one event is connected to another event such as purchasing pen and purchasing paper sequence or path analysis patterns where one event leads to another event such as the birth of child and purchasing diapers classification identification of new patterns such as coincidences between duct tape purchases and plastic sheeting purchases clustering finding and visually documenting groups of previously unknown facts such as geographic location and brand preferences and forecasting discovering patterns from which one can make reasonable predictions regarding future activities such as the prediction that people who join an athletic club may take exercise classes2 as an application compared to other data analysis applications such as structured queries used in many commercial databases or statistical analysis software data mining represents difference of kind rather than degree many simpler analytical tools utilize verificationbased approach where the user develops hypothesis and then tests the data to prove or disprove the hypothesis for example user might hypothesize that customer who buys hammer will also buy box of nails the effectiveness of this approach can be limited by the creativity of the user to develop various hypotheses as well as the structure of the software being used in contrast data mining utilizes discovery approach in which algorithms can be used to examine several multidimensional data relationships simultaneously identifying those that are unique or frequently represented for example hardware store may compare their customers tool purchases

occupation income andor distance between residence and the store as result of its complex capabilities two precursors are important for successful data mining exercise clear formulation of the problem to be solved and access to the relevant data3 reflecting this conceptualization of data mining some observers consider data mining to be just one step in larger process known as knowledge discovery in databases kdd other steps in the kdd process in progressive order include data cleaning data integration data selection data transformation data mining pattern evaluation and knowledge presentation4 number of advances in technology and business processes have contributed to growing interest in data mining in both the public and private sectors some of these changes include the growth of computer networks which can be used to connect databases the development of enhanced searchrelated techniques such as neural networks and advanced algorithms the spread of the clientserver computing model allowing users to access centralized data resources from the desktop and an increased ability to combine data from disparate sources into single searchable source5 in addition to these improved data management tools the increased availability of information and the decreasing costs of storing it have also played role over the past several years there has been rapid increase in the volume of information collected and stored with some observers suggesting that the quantity of the worlds data approximately doubles every year6 at the same time the costs of data storage have decreased significantly from dollars per megabyte to pennies per megabyte similarly computing power has continued to double every 1824 months while the relative cost of computing power has continued to decrease7 data mining has become increasingly common in both the public and private sectors organizations use data mining as tool to survey customer information reduce fraud and waste and assist in medical research however the proliferation of data mining has raised some implementation and oversight issues as well these include concerns about the quality of the data being analyzed the interoperability of the databases and software between agencies and potential infringements on privacy also there are some concerns that the limitations of data mining are being overlooked as agencies work to emphasize their homeland security initiatives 3 john makulowich government data mining systems defy definition washington technology 22 february 1999

p 4 crs3 limitations of data mining as terrorist detection tool while data mining products can be very powerful tools they are not self sufficient applications to be successful data mining requires skilled technical and analytical specialists who can structure the analysis and interpret the output that is created consequently the limitations of data mining are primarily data or personnel related rather than technologyrelated8 although data mining can help reveal patterns and relationships it does not tell the user the value or significance of these patterns these types of determinations must be made by the user similarly the validity of the patterns discovered is dependent on how they compare to real world circumstances for example to assess the validity of data mining application designed to identify potential terrorist suspects in large pool of individuals the user may test the model using data that includes information about known terrorists however while possibly reaffirming particular profile it does not necessarily mean that the application will identify suspect whose behavior significantly deviates from the original model another limitation of data mining is that while it can identify connections between behaviors andor variables it does not necessarily identify causal relationship for example an application may identify that pattern of behavior such as the propensity to purchase airline tickets just shortly before the flight is scheduled to depart is related to characteristics such as income level of education and internet use however that does not necessarily indicate that the ticket purchasing behavior is caused by one or more of these variables in fact the individuals behavior could be affected by some additional variables such as occupation the need to make trips on short notice family status sick relative needing care or hobby taking advantage of last minute discounts to visit new destinations9 beyond these specific limitations some researchers suggest that the circumstances surrounding our knowledge of terrorism make data mining an ill suited tool for identifying predicting potential terrorists before an activity occurs successful predictive data mining requires significant number of known instances of particular behavior in order to develop valid predictive models for example data mining used to predict types of consumer behavior ie the likelihood of someone shopping at particular store the potential of credit card usage being fraudulent may be based on as many as millions of previous instances of the same particular behavior moreover such robust data set can still lead to false positives in contrast as cato institute report suggests that the relatively small number of terrorist incidents or attempts each year are too few and individually unique to enable the creation of valid predictive models10 8 ibid p 2 9 ibid p 1 10 jeff jonas and jim harper effective counterterrorism and the limited role of predictive continued crs4 data mining uses data mining is used for variety of purposes in both the private and public sectors industries such as banking insurance medicine and retailing commonly use data mining to reduce costs enhance research and increase sales for example the insurance and banking industries use data mining applications to detect fraud and assist in risk assessment eg credit scoring using customer data collected over several years companies can develop models that predict whether customer is good credit risk or whether an accident claim may be fraudulent and should be investigated more closely the medical community sometimes uses data mining to help predict the effectiveness of procedure or medicine pharmaceutical firms use data mining of chemical compounds and genetic material to help guide research on new treatments for diseases retailers can use information collected through affinity programs eg shoppers club cards frequent flyer points contests to assess the effectiveness of product selection and placement decisions coupon offers and which products are often purchased together companies such as telephone service providers and music clubs can use data mining to create churn analysis to assess which customers are likely to remain as subscribers and which ones are likely to switch to competitor11 in the public sector data mining applications were initially used as means to detect fraud and waste but they have grown also to be used for purposes such as measuring and improving program performance it has been reported that data mining has helped the federal government recover millions of dollars in fraudulent medicare payments12 the justice department has been able to use data mining to assess crime patterns and adjust resource allotments accordingly similarly the department of veterans affairs has used data mining to help predict demographic changes in the constituency it serves so that it can better estimate its budgetary needs another example is the federal aviation administration which uses data mining to review plane crash data to recognize common defects and recommend precautionary measures13 in addition data mining has been increasingly cited as an important tool for homeland security efforts some observers suggest that data mining should be used as means to identify terrorist activities

washington may 2004 crs5 communications and to identify and track individual terrorists themselves such as through travel and immigration records initiatives that have attracted significant attention include the nowdiscontinued terrorism information awareness tia project14 conducted by the defense advanced research projects agency darpa and the nowcanceled computerassisted passenger prescreening system ii capps ii that was being developed by the transportation security administration tsa capps ii is being replaced by new program called secure flight other initiatives that have been the subject of congressional interest include the able danger program and data collection and analysis projects being conducted by the national security agency nsa terrorism information awareness tia program in the immediate aftermath of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks many questions were raised about the countrys intelligence tools and capabilities as well as the governments ability to detect other socalled sleeper cells if indeed they existed one response to these concerns was the creation of the information awareness office iao at the defense advanced research projects agency darpa15 in january 2002 the role of iao was in part to bring together under the leadership of one technical office director several existing darpa programs focused on applying information technology to combat terrorist threats16 the mission statement for iao suggested that the emphasis on these technology programs was to counter asymmetric threats by achieving total information awareness useful for preemption national security warning and national security decision making17 to that end the tia project was to focus on three specific areas of research anticipated to be conducted over five years to develop technologies that would assist in the detection of terrorist groups planning attacks against american interests both inside and outside the country the three areas of research and their purposes were described in dod inspector general report as 14 this project was originally identified as the total information awareness project until darpa publicly renamed it the terrorism information awareness project in may 2003 section 8131 of the fy2004 department of defense appropriations act pl 10887 prohibited further funding of tia as whole while allowing unspecified subcomponents of the tia initiative to be funded as part of dods classified budget subject to the provisions of the national foreign intelligence program which restricts the processing and analysis of information on us citizens for further details regarding this provision see crs report rl31805 authorization and appropriations for fy2004 defense by amy belasco and stephen daggett 15 darpa is the central research and development organization for the department of defense dod that engages in basic and applied research with specific focus on research and technology where risk and payoff are both very high and where success may provide dramatic advances for traditional military roles and missions httpwwwdarpamil 16 department of defense may 20 2003 report to congress regarding the terrorism

added crs6 language translation data search with pattern recognition and privacy protection and advanced collaborative and decision support tools language translation technology would enable the rapid analysis of foreign languages both spoken and written and allow analysts to quickly search the translated materials for clues about emerging threats the data search pattern recognition and privacy protection technologies would permit analysts to search vast quantities of data for patterns that suggest terrorist activity while at the same time controlling access to the data enforcing laws and policies and ensuring detection of misuse of the information obtained the collaborative reasoning and decision support technologies would allow analysts from different agencies to share data18 each part had the potential to improve the data mining capabilities of agencies that adopt the technology19 automated rapid language translation could allow analysts to search and monitor foreign language documents and transmissions more quickly than currently possible improved search and pattern recognition technologies may enable more comprehensive and thorough mining of transactional data such as passport and visa applications car rentals driver license renewals criminal records and airline ticket purchases improved collaboration and decision support tools might facilitate the search and coordination activities being conducted by different agencies and levels of government20 in public statements darpa frequently referred to the tia program as research and development project designed to create experimental prototype tools and that the research agency would only use data that is legally available and obtainable by the us government21 darpa further emphasized that these tools could be adopted and used by other agencies and that darpa itself would not be engaging in any actualuse data mining applications although it could support production of scalable leavebehind system prototype22 in addition some of the technology projects being carried out in association with the tia program did not involve data mining23 however the tia programs overall emphasis on collecting 18

although most of the tiarelated projects did involve some form of data collection the continued crs7 tracking and analyzing data trails left by individuals served to generate significant and vocal opposition soon after john poindexter made presentation on tia at the darpatech 2002 conference in august 200224 critics of the tia program were further incensed by two administrative aspects of the project the first involved the director of iao dr john m poindexter poindexter retired admiral was until that time perhaps most wellknown for his alleged role in the irancontra scandal during the reagan administration his involvement with the program caused many in the civil liberties community to question the true motives behind tia25 the second source of contention involved tias original logo which depicted an allseeing eye atop of pyramid looking down over the globe accompanied by the latin phrase scientia est potentia knowledge is power26 although darpa eventually removed the logo from its website it left lasting impression the continued negative publicity surrounding the tia program contributed to the introduction of number of bills in congress that eventually led to the programs dissolution among these bills was s 188 the datamining moratorium act of 2003 which if passed would have imposed moratorium on the implementation of data mining under the tia program by the department of defense as well as any similar program by the department of homeland security an amendment included in the omnibus appropriations act for fiscal year 2003 pl 1087 required the director of central intelligence the secretary of defense and the attorney general to submit joint report to congress within 90 days providing details about the tia program27 funding for tia as whole was prohibited with the passage of the fy2004 department of defense appropriations act pl 10887 in september 2003 however section 8131 of the law allowed unspecified subcomponents of the tia initiative to be funded as part of dods classified budget subject to the 23 continued primary purposes of some of these projects such as war gaming language translation and biological agent detection were less

provisions of the national foreign intelligence program which restricts the processing and analysis of information on us citizens28 computerassisted passenger prescreening system capps ii similar to tia the capps ii project represented direct response to the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks with the images of airliners flying into buildings fresh in peoples minds air travel was now widely viewed not only as critically vulnerable terrorist target but also as weapon for inflicting larger harm the capps ii initiative was intended to replace the original capps currently being used spurred in part by the growing number of airplane bombings the existing capps originally called caps was developed through grant provided by the federal aviation administration faa to northwest airlines with prototype system tested in 1996 in 1997 other major carriers also began work on screening systems and by 1998 most of the usbased airlines had voluntarily implemented caps with the remaining few working toward implementation29 also during this time the white house commission on aviation safety and security sometimes referred to as the gore commission released its final report in february 199730 included in the commissions report was recommendation that the united states implement automated passenger profiling for its airports31 on april 19 1999 the faa issued notice of proposed rulemaking nprm regarding the security of checked baggage on flights within the united states docket faa19995536 32 as part of this stillpending rule domestic flights would be required to utilize the faaapproved computerassisted passenger screening caps system to select passengers whose checked baggage must be subjected to additional security measures33 the current capps system is rulebased system that uses the information provided by the passenger when purchasing the ticket to determine if the passenger fits into one of two categories selectees requiring additional security screening and those who do not capps also compares the passenger name to those on list of known or suspected terrorists34 capps ii was described by tsa as an enhanced 28 for further details regarding this provision see

continued crs9 system to confirm the identities of passengers and to identify foreign terrorists or persons with terrorist connections before they can board us aircraft35 capps ii would have sent information provided by the passenger in the passengers name record pnr including full name address phone number and date of birth to commercial data providers for comparison to authenticate the identity of the passenger the commercial data provider would have then transmitted numerical score back to tsa indicating particular risk level36 passengers with green score would have undergone normal screening while passengers with yellow score would have undergone additional screening passengers with red score would not have been allowed to board the flight and would have received the attention of law enforcement37 while drawing on information from commercial databases tsa had stated that it would not see the actual information used to calculate the scores and that it would not retain the travelers information tsa had planned to test the system at selected airports during spring 200438 however capps ii encountered number of obstacles to implementation one obstacle involved obtaining the required data to test the system several highprofile debacles resulting in classaction lawsuits have made the usbased airlines very wary of voluntarily providing passenger information in early 2003 delta airlines was to begin testing capps ii using its customers passenger data at three airports across the country however delta became the target of vociferous boycott campaign raising further concerns about capps ii generally39 in september 2003 it was revealed that jetblue shared private passenger information in september 2002 with torch concepts defense contractor which was testing data mining application for the us army the information shared reportedly included itineraries names addresses and phone numbers for 15 million passengers40 in january 2004 it was reported

that american airlines agreed to provide private passenger data on 12 million of its customers to tsa in june 2002 although the information was sent instead to four companies competing to win contract with tsa42 further instances of data being provided for the purpose of testing capps ii were brought to light during senate committee on government affairs confirmation hearing on june 23 2004 in his answers to the committee the acting director of tsa david m stone stated that during 2002 and 2003 four airlines delta continental america west and frontier and two travel reservation companies galileo international and sabre holdings provided passenger records to tsa andor its contractors43 concerns about privacy protections had also dissuaded the european union eu from providing any data to tsa to test capps ii however in may 2004 the eu signed an agreement with the united states that would have allowed pnr data for flights originating from the eu to be used in testing capps ii but only after tsa was authorized to use domestic data as well as part of the agreement the eu data was to be retained for only threeandahalf years unless it is part of law enforcement action only 34 of the 39 elements of the pnr were to be accessed by authorities44 and there were to be yearly joint dhseu reviews of the implementation of the agreement45 another obstacle was the perception of mission creep capps ii was originally intended to just screen for highrisk passengers who may pose threat to safe air travel however in an august 1 2003 federal register notice tsa stated that capps ii could also be used to identify individuals with outstanding state or federal arrest warrants as well as identify both foreign and domestic terrorists not just foreign terrorists the notice also states that capps ii could be linked with the us visitor and immigrant status indicator technology usvisit program to identify individuals who are in the country illegally eg individuals with expired visas

program in december 2006 the dhs privacy office released report comparing tsas published privacy notices with its actual practices regarding secure flight the dhs privacy office found that there were discrepancies related to data testing and retention due in part because the privacy notices were drafted before the testing program had been designed fully however the report also points out that material changes in federal programs design that have an impact on the collection use and maintenance of personally identifiable information of american citizens are required to be announced in privacy act system notices and privacy impact assessments53 in february 2007 interview it was reported that tsa administrator kip hawley stated that while tsa has developed means to improve the

federal governments consolidated terrorist watch list and transmit boarding pass printing instructions back to aircraft operators60 currently air carriers are responsible for comparing passenger information to that on government watch lists the nprm states that tsa would collect secure flight passenger data that includes combination of required and optional information passengers would be required to provide their full names as it appears on verifying identity document held by that individual61 in addition passengers would be asked but not required to provide their date of birth gender redress number or known traveler number however the nprm does propose circumstances in which aircraft operators would be required to provide the optional information to tsa if it already has obtained that information in the ordinary course of business the nprm states if covered aircraft operator were to input data required to be requested from individuals into the system where it stores sfpd such as data from passenger profile stored by the aircraft operator in the ordinary course of business the aircraft operator would be required to include that data as part of the sfpd transmitted to tsa even though the individual did not provide that information at the time of reservation62 in addition aircraft operations would be required to provide tsa if available passengers passport information

for networked information sharing project such as matrix because as metcalfes law suggests the power of the network increases exponentially by the number of computers connected to it85 while as many as 16 states were reported to have either participated or seriously considered participating in matrix several chose to withdraw leaving total of four states connecticut florida ohio and pennsylvania

driven by controversy over allegations that the data mining analysis had resulted in the identification of mohammed atta one of the 911 hijackers as terrorist suspect before the attacks took place while some individuals who had been involved in able danger were reportedly prepared to testify that they had seen either his name andor picture on chart prior to the attacks the identification claim was strongly disputed by others on september 21 2005 the senate committee on the judiciary held hearing on able danger to consider how the data could or should have been shared with other agencies and whether the destruction of the data was in fact required by the relevant regulations while the department of defense directed the individuals involved in able danger not to testify at the hearing testimony was taken from the attorney of one of the individuals as well as others not directly involved with the project on february 15 2006 the house committee on armed services subcommittee on

reauthorized on regular basis and that key members of congress had been briefed about the program in his weekly radio address on december 17 2005 president bush stated in the weeks following the terrorist attacks on our nation i authorized the national security agency consistent with us law and the constitution to intercept the international communications of people with known links to qaeda and related terrorist organizations before we intercept these communications the government must have information that establishes clear link to these terrorist networks104 president bush also stated during his radio address the activities i authorized are reviewed approximately every 45 days each review is based on fresh intelligence assessment of terrorist threats to the continuity of our government and the threat of catastrophic damage to our homeland during each assessment previous activities under the authorization are reviewed the review includes approval by our nations top legal

surveillance program renewing concerns about the possible existence of inappropriately authorized domestic surveillance according to these reports following the september 11 2001 attacks the nsa

analysis to map relationships between people based on their communications108 it remains unclear precisely what information if any was collected and provided to the nsa some reports suggest that

proverbially deaf due to the spreading use of encrypted communications it appears that nsa may now be at greater risk of being drowned in information data mining issues as data mining initiatives continue to evolve there are several issues congress may decide to consider related to implementation and oversight these issues include but are not limited to data quality interoperability mission creep and privacy as with other aspects of data mining while technological capabilities are important other factors also influence the success of projects outcome 113 httpsrrcmitreorgcfp06pdf 114

multifaceted issue that represents one of the biggest challenges for data mining data quality refers to the accuracy and completeness of the data data quality can also be affected by the structure and consistency of the data being analyzed the presence of duplicate records the lack of data standards the timeliness of updates and human error can significantly impact the effectiveness of the more complex data mining techniques which are sensitive to subtle differences that may exist in the data to improve data quality it is sometimes necessary to clean the data which can involve the removal of duplicate records normalizing the values used to represent information in the database eg ensuring that is represented as 0 throughout the database and not sometimes as 0 sometimes as an n etc accounting for missing data points removing unneeded data fields identifying anomalous data points eg an individual whose age is shown as 142 years and standardizing data formats eg changing dates so they all include mmddyyyy interoperability related to data quality is the issue of interoperability of different databases and data mining software interoperability refers to the ability of computer system andor data to work with other systems or data using common standards or processes interoperability is critical part of the larger efforts to improve interagency collaboration and information sharing through egovernment and homeland security initiatives for data mining interoperability of databases and software is important to enable the search and analysis of multiple databases simultaneously and to help ensure the compatibility of data mining activities of different agencies data mining projects that are trying to take advantage of existing legacy databases or that are initiating firsttime collaborative efforts with other agencies or levels of government eg police departments in different states may experience interoperability problems similarly as agencies move forward with the creation of new databases and information sharing efforts they will need to address interoperability issues during their planning stages to better ensure the effectiveness of their data mining projects mission creep mission creep is one of the leading risks of data mining cited by civil libertarians and represents how control over ones information can be tenuous proposition mission creep refers to the use of data for purposes other than that for which the data was originally collected this can occur regardless of whether the data was provided voluntarily by the individual or was collected through other means efforts to fight terrorism can at times take on an acute sense of urgency this urgency can create pressure on both data holders and officials who access the data to leave an available resource unused may appear to some as being negligent data holders may feel obligated to make any information available that could be used to prevent future attack or track known terrorist similarly government officials crs28 responsible for ensuring the safety of others may be pressured to use andor combine existing databases to identify potential threats unlike physical searches or the detention of individuals accessing information for purposes other than originally intended may appear to be victimless or harmless exercise however such information use can lead to unintended outcomes and produce misleading results one of the primary reasons for misleading results is inaccurate data all data collection efforts suffer accuracy concerns to some degree ensuring the accuracy of information can require costly protocols that may not be cost effective if the data is not of inherently high economic value in wellmanaged data mining projects the original data collecting organization is likely to be aware of the datas limitations and account for these limitations accordingly however such awareness may not be communicated or heeded when data is used for other purposes for example the accuracy of information collected through shoppers club card may suffer for variety of reasons including the lack of identity authentication when card is issued cashiers using their own cards for customers who do not have one andor customers who use multiple cards116 for the purposes of marketing to consumers the impact of these inaccuracies is negligible to the individual if government agency were to use that information to target individuals based on food purchases associated with particular religious observances though an outcome based on inaccurate information could be at the least waste of resources by the government agency and an unpleasant experience for the misidentified individual as the march 2004 tapac report observes the potential wide reuse of data suggests that concerns about mission creep can extend beyond privacy to the protection of civil rights in the event that information is used for targeting an individual solely on the basis of religion or expression or using information in way that would violate the constitutional guarantee against selfincrimination117 privacy as additional information sharing and data mining initiatives have been announced increased attention has focused on the implications for privacy concerns about privacy focus both on actual projects proposed as well as concerns about the potential for data mining applications to be expanded beyond their original purposes mission creep for example some experts suggest that antiterrorism data mining applications might also be useful for combating other types of crime as well118 so far there has been little consensus about how data mining should be carried out with several competing points of view being debated some observers contend that tradeoffs may need to be made regarding privacy to ensure security other observers suggest that existing laws and regulations regarding privacy protections are adequate and that these initiatives do not pose any threats to privacy 116 technology and privacy advisory committee department of defense safeguarding privacy in the fight against terrorism march 2004 p 40 117 ibid p 39 118 drew clark privacy experts differ on merits of passengerscreening program government executive magazine november 21 2003 httpwwwgovexeccomdailyfed 1103112103td2htm crs29 still other observers argue that not enough is known about how data mining projects will be carried out and that greater oversight is needed there is also some disagreement over how privacy concerns should be addressed some observers suggest that technical solutions are adequate in contrast some privacy advocates argue in favor of creating clearer policies and exercising stronger oversight as data mining efforts move forward congress may consider variety of questions including the degree to which government agencies should use and mix commercial data with government data whether data sources are being used for purposes other than those for which they were originally designed and the possible application of the privacy act to these initiatives legislation in the 108th congress during the 108th congress number of legislative proposals were introduced that would restrict data mining activities by some parts of the federal government andor increase the reporting requirements of such projects to congress for example on january 16 2003 senator feingold introduced s 188 the datamining moratorium act of 2003 which would have imposed moratorium on the implementation of data mining under the total information awareness program now referred to as the terrorism information awareness project by the department of defense as well as any similar program by the department of homeland security s 188 was referred to the committee on the judiciary on january 23 2003 senator wyden introduced samdt 59 an amendment to hjres 2 the omnibus appropriations act for fiscal year 2003 as passed in its final form as part of the omnibus spending bill pl 1087 on february 13 2003 and signed by the president on february 20 2003 the amendment requires the director of central intelligence the secretary of defense and the attorney general to submit joint report to congress within 90 days providing details about the tia program119 some of the information required includes spending schedules likely effectiveness of the program likely impact on privacy and civil liberties and any laws and regulations that may need to be changed to fully deploy tia if the report was not submitted within 90 days funding for the tia program could have been discontinued120 funding for tia was later discontinued in section 8131 of the fy2004 department of defense appropriations act pl 10887 signed into law on september 30 2003121 on march 13 2003 senator wyden introduced an amendment to s 165 the air cargo security act requiring the secretary of homeland security to submit report to congress within 90 days providing information about the impact of capps ii on privacy and civil liberties the amendment was passed by the committee on 119 the report is available at httpwwwefforgprivacytiatiareportpdf 120 for more

the full senate srept 10838 in may 2003 s 165 was passed by the senate with the wyden amendment included and was sent to the house where it was referred to the committee on transportation and infrastructure funding restrictions on capps ii were included in section 519 of the fy2004 department of homeland security appropriations act pl 10890 signed into law october 1 2003 this provision included restrictions on the deployment or implementation on other than test basis of the computerassisted passenger prescreening system cappsii pending the completion of gao report regarding the efficacy accuracy and security of capps ii as well as the existence of system of an appeals process for individuals identified as potential threat by the system122 in its report delivered to congress in february 2004 gao reported that as of january 1 2004 tsa has not fully addressed seven of the eight capps ii issues identified by the congress as key areas of interest123 the one issue gao determined that tsa had addressed is the establishment of an internal oversight board gao attributed the incomplete progress on these issues partly to the early stage of the systems development124 on march 25 2003 the house committee on government reform subcommittee on technology information policy intergovernmental relations and the census held hearing on the current and future possibilities of data mining the witnesses drawn from federal and state government industry and academia highlighted number of perceived strengths and weaknesses of data mining as well as the stillevolving nature of the technology and practices behind data mining125 while data mining was alternatively described by some witnesses as process and by other witnesses as productivity tool there appeared to be general consensus that the challenges facing the future development and success of government data mining applications were related less to technological concerns than to other issues such as data integrity security and privacy on may 6 and may 20 2003 the 122 section 519 of pl 10890 specifically identifies eight issues that tsa must address before it can spend funds to deploy or implement capps ii on other than test basis these include 1 establishing system of due process for passengers to correct erroneous information 2 assess the accuracy of the databases being used 3 stress test the system and demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the search tools 4 establish and internal oversight board 5 install operational safeguards to prevent abuse 6 install security measures to protect against unauthorized access by hackers or other intruders 7 establish policies for effective oversight of system use and operation and 8 address any privacy concerns related to the system 123 general

explanation of why such procedures are not in place129 also in the senate the committee on the judiciary held hearing on january 10 2007 entitled balancing privacy and security the privacy implications of government data mining programs the witnesses included former member of congress and several individuals from research centers and think tanks collectively they highlighted number of perceived strengths and weaknesses of data mining as well as the continually evolving nature of the technology and practices behind data mining130 the witnesses also addressed the inherent challenge of simultaneously protecting the nation from terrorism while also protecting civil liberties on february 28 2007 senator reid introduced samdt 275 to s 4 the improving americas security by implementing unfinished recommendations of the 911 commission act of 2007 section 504 of this amendment entitled the federal agency data mining report act of 2007 was identical to s 236 as introduced during the senate floor debates held on s 4 in early march 2007 several amendments to the data mining section of s 4 were introduced on march 6 2007 senator kyl introduced samdt 357 to samdt 275 of s 4 the purpose of samdt 357 was described as to amend the datamining reporting requirement to protect existing patents trade secrets and confidential business processes and to adopt narrower definition of data mining in order to exclude routine computer searches131 later on march 6 2007 senator kyl offered modification to samdt 357 that used definitions of data mining and database very similar to those that appear in pl 109177 the usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act of 2005 and that slightly changed the original language of samdt 357 regarding protection of patents and other proprietary business information 129 on april 12 2007 the committee voted to approve revised version of s 236 which was sent to the full senate description of this version of the bill is discussed

record vol 153 march 6 2007 p s2670 crs36 on march 8 2007 senator feingold introduced samdt 429 to samdt 275 samdt 429 is very similar to s 236 as introduced with few differences one difference is that the initial description used to partially define data mining is changed to include program involving patternbased queries searches or other analyses of 1 or more electronic databases another difference is that the data mining reporting requirement excludes data mining initiatives that are solely for the detection of fraud waste or abuse in government agency or program or the security of government computer system132 another difference is the inclusion of language requiring that the data mining reports be produced in coordination with the privacy officer of that department or agency133 samdt 429 also includes language detailing the types of information that should be included in the classified annexes of the data mining reports ie classified information law enforcement sensitive information proprietary business information and trade secrets and states that such classified annexes should not be made available to the public later on march 8 2007 senator feingold introduced samdt 441 to samdt 357 samdt 441 is substantively the same as samdt 429 but with technical modification on march 13 2007 samdt 441 was agreed to by unanimous consent and samdt 357 as modified and as amended by samdt 441 was agreed to by unanimous consent also on march 13 2007 s 4 passed the senate by 6038 vote the data mining provision appears as section 604 in s 4 as originally

committee on the judiciary voted to approve revised version of s 236 the data mining act of 2007 on june 4 2007 the committee reported the bill with one exception this revised version of s 236 is substantively identical to data mining provision passed as section 604 in s 4 and later as section 804 of pl 11053 in july 2007 discussed below as passed by the committee s 236 includes provision regarding penalties for the unauthorized disclosure of classified information contained in the annex of any reports submitted to congress 132 congressional record vol 153 march 8 2007 p s2949 133 ibid
