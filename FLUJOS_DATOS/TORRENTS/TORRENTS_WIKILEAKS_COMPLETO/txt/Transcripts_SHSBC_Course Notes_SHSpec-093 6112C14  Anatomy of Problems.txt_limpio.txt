6112c14 shspec93 anatomy of problems problem is postulate counterpostulate force counterforce idea versus idea solution versus solution you have two people in collision in trouble with each other to be in trouble with each other they have to be in the same time stream and they have to be able to communicate do you realize that you with your problems are on separate time stream from the physical universe and thats why you are not in present time so even in an individual you have two time streams how do you suppose pc got out of pt he must have started off in some instant of time that went on this same timestream but he went off on spur line during the middle of say race he finds his watch missing its an important thing to him and he loses it while he is at the racetrack in timestream called the race he tries to go back to the time he lost the watch and therefore on the subject of the watch he has departure in time from the timestream he starts running on backtimetrack while time goes forward on the agreedupon time track he is trying to find out what happened not to stop time he just wants to see what happened thetan has the facility of running on another time stream so he goes off sideways worrying about it he has problem now and because he hasnt solved it very well he gets stuck in it but then he really gets stuck by solving it he becomes the foe of all pickpockets so he wont lose his watch but hes already on slightly different timestream and he remains on it because he started it you normally refer to this sort of thing as game rather downgraded one he isnt really hung up in moment of this timestream but in moment of departure the rest of the time he sort of makes time himself it becomes an endless affair that can float along forever so you are running along in session and he suddenly has picture of racetrack that picture exists in another timestream which he can slip into how about the fellow who didnt enter this universe at all you never met him he isnt on the timestream can you have problem with him when you have never met him and never will youve never had anything in common with him youve never communicated with him youve never gotten any ows on him so how can you have problem with him you cant so all problems have their own timestream between the two beingnesses ideas forces or whatever they must also have means of communication two armies will maneuver forward until someone fires shot thats communication which everybody can understand now the communication enlarges and they can really have an agreement not disagreement to have war now they can have problems with logistics mechanics propaganda and how to have motivators big enough to justify the overts where you see an argument there must have been prior agreement even light one cf the idea that there can be arc break without prior abc this is why the goriest wars are civil wars the defeated in civil war are treated like criminals not just losers this is because there has been tremendous amount of agreement so the arc break is very severe similarly with serious 2d upsets there couldnt be wild disagreement resulting in problem unless there was some prior agreement the problem is as large as there has been agreement france and germany have common blood going back to the conquest of gaul by the franks there might be road out on the solution of problem in the recognition that 3d is based on onetime total agreement remember about games pandeterminism selfdeterminism otherdeterminism person gets on one side of game to the degree that he has reduced his pandeterminism accepted otherdeterminism and considers himself to be operating on selfdeterminism there are always these factors there must be an outside disinterested arbitrator to resolve the problem thats where the auditor comes in routine 3d is one of the roughest ones to figure out even lrh had to have outside help to the degree of someone else reading the emeter to figure it out it was so involved that it was all selfdetermined or otherdetermined with pandetermined factors at all it looks at first to the pc like there are at least forty or fifty vital factors it takes the auditor to shake it all down to five the auditor does it by listing and assessing down to one item which will either be totally right or utterly wrong oppterm that is it will be either totally selfdetermined terminal or totally otherdetermined oppterm notice that any item you choose will get one of three reactions from the pc 1 he doesnt know if it is right and doesnt care this is rare it could be wrong item or he could be arc broken or groggy 2 it could be selfdetermined or otherdetermined 3 the pc could do flipflop between self and otherdeterminism this phenomenon is lower scale mockery of pan self and otherdeterminism the three factors present in all problems the pc just dramatizes these as he gets into the gpm hell be on one side for few days then go into dont know then go pandetermined for bit i can have both viewpoints im really something else so just run the side you can chip at best and if you are not making progress you have chosen side he cant confront there are levels of confront to consider if we were going to run only one side it would be vital to get the right one you could just run the right side of the right levels and hed go clear but you cant always expect it to happen the harder he is enmeshed in the gpm the less distinct it is to him that either side is real or he is liable to be very fixed in one side and not at all in the other as you run him he has hard time of it if you pick the wrong side for him he will run long time the gpm is problem before it was problem it was an agreement and after it was an agreement it was game there was time continuum and these two elements beingnesses and ideas which make up the 3d 3rd dynamic existed once in their nuclear form as total agreement 1 they were in the same timestream 2 they were in perfect communication 3 they had tremendous agreement and goals on what they were doing they had all these things in common and then they started to depart one from the other and got into game which got very thorough the game deteriorated into problem and stuck ie 1 there was long period of total agreement 2 then there was agreement on the game they got into 3 then it got to be very deadly and got beyond game into being problem but having originated with its own timecontinuum the problem continues up into present time as gpm the easiest way to approach it for most pcs is to find that side they can most easily fight that will give them big case gains and will take big solutions off the top of the problem but recognize that we have long way to go after having taken the solutions off the top of the problem the end of the auditing is not just reaching the end of the prehav levels but could be expected to go on further you now have the selfdeterminism otherdeterminism softened up bit you still have to attain selfdeterminism for the other side for the pc and pandeterminism the pc is really on neither side the pc has been waterbucks he has been tigers before there were waterbucks and tigers as enemies the pc couldnt have told the difference between them they would have had the same goal they werent very solidly waterbucks or tigers yet their nowimsupposedtos werent yet congealed to that extent then they started separating out distinct characteristics which were only waterbucks or only tigers then they solved problems different ways and the game deteriorated into some very standard nowimsupposedtos those were specialized forms of selfdetermined survival that had nothing to do with pandeterminism but great deal to do with otherdeterminism the truth of the matter however is that the pc is neither side tiger or waterbuck and is capable of being either the pc shifts from one side to the other just because you have audited him lot just because you have done listing and nulling of his items thats tremendous amount of auditing his nowimsupposedtos are shook up like dice in box now he will dramatize both sides while before you started auditing he was fixed in one side and dramatized it on stimulusresponse basis so the pc is assessed youve got the routine 3d package and now you want to find the right side for the pc the only thing that makes it the right side is that the pc can run it with benefit tis the side he can run best to run out somatics and break up the gpm its not that the pc is that side because the pc is equally the other side and is neither side in truth and is capable of being both both sides are equally otherdetermined to him but one side is higher than the other on the tone scale so it is easier to view as the ally and harder to buck in auditing but the pc has used both sides down through the ages until he has so many overts on himself as waterbuck that these overbalanced and he became tiger you are trying to establish the pandeterminism of thetan who has gotten so biased that he cant tell good action from bad action because the nowimsupposedtos all fit in this exact pattern and he has some game running that has resulted in an insurmountable problem which has given him his total package of nowimsupposedtos all nowimsupposedtos were part of some old problem and earlier than that some old game and earlier than that some old agreement the pcs pandeterminism has been submerged and he is being obsessively selfdetermined which pins him thoroughly on dynamic and he is longer loose on the dynamics your first attack on routine 3d package is just to find the onlyonlyness of it does the pc think of himself mostly as waterbuck at this moment the easiest side to run is usually the lower toned side if you run the pc as it because of the trick of the commands you get more attack against the weakest side of the gpm so it runs more mass and more flows and it is easier for the pc to handle the other side may either totally slay him or have reality at all he is not capable of attacking tigers because they are too much for him they dont exist for him if you run this one watch out the pc may get so overwhumped that before the pc realizes it he is down the tubes even so if you kept attacking something would happen it would be uncomfortable for the pc he would arc break easily but hell try it but he doesnt get reality out of it thats the basic liability could you just blow one of these things up in the early stages of the run if you ask the pc what he would think of blowing it up or wiping it all out at one fell swoop hed go into an awful confusion he hasnt got it differentiated enough to do much about it he couldnt attack one side of the problem because it was too big for him to find it real what will be his reaction to wiping out the whole thing thats about seven times as unreal the idea of this game ever having an end or beginning is preposterous in view of the fact that there are confusions on down the line that tend to bang the pc up into the problem as you audit the thing you keep on hitting confusions of one kind or another it keeps banging the pc up towards pt so the track to him looks shorter and shorter he thinks maybe he was only waterbuck for one lifetime then it broadens out again and hell feel he was waterbuck for very long time what remains to be sorted out is the easiest way to beat the gpm over month or two you might be able to take pieces of it the pc can find conflicts and date them on the meter and get the whole track plotted on the subject that would soften up the gpm just by getting it aligned and assigned correctly on the track during that time you wouldnt have to figure out which side the pc was on this is feasible method of clearing somebody it would mean teaching people to date on the emeter which is quite skill but it could be done and its quite tool or you could find every confusion that might precede any stuck picture the pc has on the subject of waterbucks vs tigers find what the person was at the time and what they did it would be an interesting gimmick to make list of the number of goals the terminal and oppterm have in common or of the points on which they would be in agreement or you could ask what game would waterbuck play with tiger and vice verse it would all run out the center of the problem once the prehav runs have straightened it out somewhat all you are trying to do it to establish the pandeterminism of the thetan who has gotten so biased that he cant tell good action from bad one because the nowimsupposedtos all fit in this exact pattern and he had some game going which has become an insurmountable problem which has given him his total package of nowimsupposedtos you are trying to establish the pcs pandeterminism so he can breaths before auditing the pc is being solution solution solution the next thing you see with auditing is problem problem problem when this is peeled off he is game game game the ta goes up on the pc because he is breaking the mores of the terminal not necessarily those of society or his present group guy whose terminal is cat burglar will get high ta when he goes to bed at night because he refused to dramatize or went against the terminal
