how to manage course lecture given on 10 april 1964 instructors conference 10 april 1964 im going totaping this because there is little bit of data here that i want to give you which you probably will feel is very unpalatable but which is the ne plus ultra of training i want to give you this very rapidly it is also in the form of policy letter of 10 april i want to discuss these various points andsince its difficult to put all these things out in policy letter ill first just merely read you the policy letter scientology courses this does not necessarily apply only to the saint hill course this applies to all scientology courses and they consist of as follows there are three zones of responsibility in course management these are l providing valuable subject materials well of course that could apply in college as well as it could apply anyplaceis providing valuable subject materials what determines their value that might even be something else but ordinarily is it useful is it going to improve somebody is it going to forward something or something like this or going to make something effective thats the subject material that could be physics and so forth and oddly enough could even go as far down scale as metaphysics now under this particular zone in scientology right now we have oddly enough culminatedand this is hard to believe because it is such wildly embracive figurewe have culminated in anything that was desirable in the fields of religion mysticism spiritualism or mental sciences anything desirable in those particular fields have been discovered and culminated in the field of scientology right now thats why i say its rather hard to believe but you look at it thats true so we do have valuable subject materials now that job is complete and so number one of these course management as far as were concerned on scientology course that is complete were even throwing away material now which would have been enough to have made complete science and revolutionized middle europe you know two hundred years ago were just throwing it away itsweve got stuff thats more effective than that and so we dont pay much attention to it and so forth theres tons of such material that is just going out the window now it goes into codification archives researchlevel actions contributive actions and so forth and the truth of the matter isand this will shock you on the subject of valuable subject materialson this little sheet which you see in front of you right now this little sheet here is contained every process and auditor skill this does not contain the philosophic side of scientology but this contains the auditor technical side of scientology and every process and every action on this one typewritten sheet one side eight by ten is contained on this sheet and this lastyou see most of it is right up here at the top very small little area here at the top well that contains all of the auditor skills and this long one here is just everything class vi auditor ought to be able to do its down to such tiny little things as knowing about auditing see that auditing can upset somebody you see and the valuable subject materials then that we are teaching on all scientology courses and were teaching all of this at saint hill are contained on this one little sheet so there is not vast amount of data when we get under valuable subject materials the whole philosophical side of this is of course left wideopen these are sometimes what you call basics arc and that sort of thing we havent gone into the nature of man on this sheet but this is the technical auditor side of the picture now the next one number two is organizing and codifying those materials so that they are highly effective and comprehensible now thats codification of the material and one early dawn here the other day suzie and i whipped out the form of presentation of proper bulletin or piece of data and were actually throwing this stuff togethershe isfrom bulletins and so forth with considerable speed its under twelve headings is it or is it thirteen female voice twelve twelve headings and these twelve headings oddly enougheach one of these pieces of material is under the twelve headings and the twelve headings comprise the question the examiner should ask all hes got to do is convert it to question like what this process is for you see or something like that all he has to say is what is this process for dont you see so theres simplification even to that little piece of stuff now therefore there are very few processes and these are being codified up on very very exact basis of format so all student has to do is know those and that sheet that has to do with process also contains the technical drills and the auditing requirements so theyre all on the same sheet but of course your technical drills and your auditing requirementsbecause one of them lasts for two or three processesthese are grouped as separate group for your practical and then the auditing requirement of course is whether or not the person can audit this and that of course is the only auditing requirement there is is can he audit it successfully so the codification of these materials to comprehensibility is underway i will not say at this moment they are instantly and immediately available to you but if you recognize what we are heading for and if you have in hand this little sheet you can make do with the instruction materials which you have up to the moment when theyre published in this very harshly pure format and so on for instance youve got the materials for r1c and so forth well r1c is being converted to this other format but you still have the materials that you can use and apply nownow we get to the thirdthe third thats just the comprehensibility of the materials and packaging it and so on that of course gets together your checksheets for the various levels and that sort of thing that all depends on these things and these checksheets are still on this one little typewritten sheet now the third one concerns you very directly and very intimately and thats instructing the student in those materials to point of high comprehension and competency instructing the student now if youve got the materials and youve got the knowhow and then that knowhow is codified we still have the problem of instructing the student in those materials we still have this problem and this is the part which you at first may not agree with and you may find is too gruesome to confront for words but ill just go on and read the remainder of this very rapidly in scientology 1 has been done fully and completely there are gaps or unanswered questions in 2 the very best of scientology has been selected out for instruction and is being written in such way as to minimize any confusion and maximize the communication and practice of the data now in 3which is teaching the student with it we have our largest potential randomity and it is this which this policy letter is concernedwith which this policy letter is concerned the instruction of the student is personalized matter students require answers to their own questions and clarification of their own understandings the student comes up with lot of preconceptions and so forth and these get in his way most ghastly and so that his clarification on the data which is being given to him becomes an important part of the communication of the data but remember that the student is interjecting this barrier and it is up to the instructor to keep that barrier wiped away and the burden of this falls on the instructor in auditing it has taken us long time to learn that there are bad preclears there are only auditor errors and we have now learned similar thing about instructing there are only slow instructors there are slow students now thats terrible thing and i imagine that would seem very unpalatable to you but i myself had to confront up to this as datum the length of time student is on course is direct index of the quality of instruction on that course and of course were held back with the fact that weve only just culminated the material with the codification of its in progress so that of course is part of our difficulty at this present instant but with those out of the way you only have instruction now fast course is well instructed and slow course is poorly instructed and the subject of this of course is how are we going to make this fast course see well were taking care of these other zones what our responsibility is but this one is our zone of responsibility too and itll be this one that we have to continue to live with fast course is well instructed and slow course is poorly instructed bad course gets bad enrollments this has to do with the number of people you have on course good course gets good enrollments if enrollment is down the course is poor course that has been observed continually in academies for years and has variations if you want full course provide well consinstructed course if course enrollments are down dont ponder beyond how to improve the course dont ponder beyond this how to improve the course and youll win if you improve the course this is brick wall datum poor course will become an empty course the speed with which student can go through course depends only on 1 2 and particularly 3 above it does not depend on the student and at this point you poor instructors whove had to live with these lines of course will probably throw up your hat and say well thats it ive had it now hes said too much but dont blame the students look at 1 2 and 3 above there are slow students there is only slow instruction the future of scientology courses depends on getting the student rapidly through the course and graduating him or her at good level of competence scientology course futures do not depend on lowered rates youre already selling pearls for pennies just make sure you are selling pearls i have taken care of 1 2 is very thoroughly in hand and 3 is up to the instructors fast course is wellinstructed course full course is wellinstructed fast course and thats all the mystery there is in it there really isnt anything else to course and its management than just those factors now where does that bring us now this meeting is timely and actually is not in condemnation of instruction because youve had youryour worries have existed in 1 and 2 to very marked degree the valuable material was there and actually its just culminated to complete completion the codification of that material and so forth is just now in hand you have your worries with tremendous quantities of materials which may or may not apply at this particular time you may have excess tapes and all that sort of thing tends to get in your road some of your drills may be completely inadequate to what youre trying to accomplish with them that sort of thing and youve had these things to worry with but you also had running along this other thing because those other things have existed we have to some degree developed the idea of the slow student and that one as we repair 1 and 2 weve got to throw overboard we could have such thing as troublesome student he seems to be throwing more questions and misunderstandings into the situation than seems necessary at the particular moment but under good instruction this is cared for this is cared for we had to develop methods of handling that because hes interjecting worries and concerns into the course material and its up to us to get those things smoothed out and put away now we have to have brief instruction materials and cover them extremely well and this brings about our attitude of instruction our attitude of instruction should be very tough but very helpful we should belearn to be very very harsh on the subject of just pure obstructionism just pass on by itdont fool around with itand recognize whether or not this fellow really is in some kind of weird spin if hes just inventing one and if hes in some kind of weird confusion about something or other learn to grab him by the nape of the neck and say its yip and its yip and its yipyip now do you get that now what dont you understand about that all right very good well thatswell what youre worrying about there is not an important part of this actually its yipyip now you tell what this applies to and so forth and all of sudden lights dawn an example out here fellow couldnt get what an opposite was until he was told that it was an antonym and being former english teacher he of course could grasp an antonym but up to that moment he was saying what i would do would be entirely different and it merely had to be harshly brought home to him that nobody under gods green earth was interested in what he would do as an opposite action that we were only interested in what was an opposite now you get therewe have in one example clarification necessary he couldnt get it through his skull all right so we transpose the material cleverly and we say well its an antonym oh its an antonym see hes interposing this weird one what i would do in that case were just simply tough who the hell cares what you would do we only want to know what an antonym is you get the idea then to be very veryvery very demanding extremely demanding for speed dash and accuracy on essentials and let the nonessentials slip so he doesnt know the number of the bulletin so he doesnt know where the paragraph fits on the lefthand side of the ruddy rod so he couldnt find the tape if it had neon lights on it so what is pc audited during an arc break and he said well uhleuhlet flunk see so he didnt know where the tape was so he didnt know what body of material it came out of well all right so what so what well skip it see but if you say to him well is somebody audited during an arc break and he said well uh well that uh flunk flunk flunk flunk you know say for gods sakes why dont you understand this stuff you know now go on back and study it in other words thats when to take it and what not to that depends to large degree on the auditors judgment of the matter but what is essential material well just be absolutely vicious on the subject and nonessentials plff who cares do you see so you dont have uniform level of examination you have aan examination level which is tough on essentials and just skips nonessentials guy can sit up against wall and rattle off model session poppetapoppetapoppetapoppeta bangbangbangetybang he can sit in session he can go model session all the way through bangbang without flaw or droop you see anyplace along the line fine be absolutely death on his being able to do so dont you see now hes rather worried about the evolution of model session and wouldnt it be something or other and wasnt it true that model session onceand so forth well so he even argues about it on an examination paper well we couldnt care less can he do model session poppetapoppetapoppetapoppeta thats all were looking for see he doesnt even have to be letterperfect on why he has to do model session its not for him to ask were making technician so thisthis levelthis level of understanding of whats essential and what isnt essential is demanded of the instructor see and thats where fast instruction comes in your instruction is fast to the degree that you appreciate that this guy is walking around in squirrel cage and you try to get the data through to him somehow or another the essential datum so that he says oh why oh well yeah what do you know you know or we see hes walking around on squirrel cage wasnt this actually developed at one time or another by gurdjieff see or goodgief or harold bell wrightus or something somebody asked if id studied the work of frank lloyd wright the other day i was quite interested he concluded it with two philosophers and so forth i dont think he was trying to pull anybodys leg i just think he didnt know but hes pulling something like this you see well the instructor has to know aw lie down go off skip it get off that squirrel cage it hasnt anything whatsoever to do with what you are studying now soandso this is what were interested in now can you do that or cant you it depends on the instructors ability to evaluate the important and the unimportant as far as the student training is concerned now that will make fast course that will make fast course now were hitting for the moon here we want to get class iv throughand i mean through and competent as the devilin sixteen weeks we just want to get him through and smooth in sixteen weeks just ride all over him until he is see get class vi through in four weeks these are ideal periods four weeks and get coaudit so that they can bust on through to ot in twenty weeks now those are your optimum times this gives us four weeks on class iv to smooth it out and be sure this gives us two to four weeks more on class vi so that we can get any question out of our mind dont you see and weve hit the maximum period of time in thirtytwo weeks to ot in the coaudit see now weve hit the maximum periods but were inevitably going to hit these maximum periods and all im asking you to do is try to make them the maximum periods and the only way we can do that is try to go like the devil for the minimum period try to shoot that minimum period every time and just go along on total expectancy that the minimum period will be met and dont look for anything else to happen but it will be met now that gives you an expectancy of what youre striking for now if we can do that and if weve got tough course with good spirit of help we can actually accomplish that and if we can accomplish that well have full course out here rolling very nicely and everything going along fine and if we cant accomplish that we wont have thats about all there is to that now id want somebody like the assoc sec ofof perth let us say hes got this policy letter that tells him to bring somebody else all right well he cant be gone very long from there dont you see its practically disaster hes staring in the face to move off of the point anyhow well lets say hes retread or something like this well for sure we could get him through here in just little handful of weeks you see kick him through kick the person hes brought along with him through and kick them back onto an airplane again and be perfectly confident that something effective is going to happen in that coaudit team and that they will be able to carry on with the material accomplish something when they get back there now if we can do this weve got it made weve got it made across the boards because well find out then that people will very often take twocourse shot at it theyll come on here at one period and get their basic and go home and come on and get anothergo on through to the end or something like this or theyll try to take oneshot at the whole situation and so on but they can adjust their minds accordingly as long as we wont put up with any other time budget than what weve got now i think you agree with that its feasible as long as our codified material is out and that all dross is thrown off the course ill read you here rapidly just for your edification and not for anything else particularly because this will all be published under the classification bulletins or policy letters level i r1c for ptps r1cm thats fishing with ta on the meter those are broken into two processes because you lost process which is good process in r1c when you suddenly started converting it over to using meter fishing picking up the things that blew down the meter while the guy was itsaing see that was actually specialized application of r1c so we lost process heres processthe same process without meter and the same process with meter gives us two different processes weve got assists and weve got r2c which is discussion by lists for instance fred here prepared list one time lists of discussion you know just questions and listenstyle auditing and itsa and thats what that whole level consists of see and thats pretty full level at that level ii is repetitive processes model session op pro by dup 8c cchs havingness general ow arc 63 auditing cycle and other materials from the class vi basic auditing checksheet can he answer an auditing question see and can he be asked question you know that sort of materials are simply poured in on top of this now the reason 8c is pulled independently from the cchs is the cchs are just taught as theoretical action and 8c is taught as process see so we come down with thud you see oncan he perform 8c can he do that perfectly well we can just skate over the rest of the cchs here at saint hill dont you see in an academy or in an hqs course something like that why they might hit them little heavier well thats the totality of the second level and the third level is auditing by list this is brandnew name for very old action you clean up lists weve got tons of lists and all the auditor does is clean each question and that can be addressed to the most wide and wonderful things and it so happens that due to the composition of the basic bankwhich is weird enoughthat becomes health approach and will accomplish healing and big future opened up for this particular goofball process big future opened up for it because health is totally the broken dramatization of the gpm when guy cant dramatize his gpm hes had it and what about the destroy series see so somebodys sciatica doesnt depend on what overts hes committing but very possibly upon what overts hes been unable to commit and you start running this by list dont you see and you bend the list over on the other side and you ask couple of trick questions or let some class iv auditor assess it as to which side of the fence this person is on then he takes certain series of lists now you go ahead and clean up each one of these questions and what you got youve got assessing on prewritten list and you also got health very definitely in your hands so that isthat is not much to teach since if he can do this he can also do arc break assessments you see and he can do lot of other things well thats of course sec checking by list and thats written down here at the same time but mostly to get referral to what were talking about as auditing by list prepchecking prepchecking not to destimulate but prepchecking for blood you know something thats almost dropped out of our perimeter problems intensive mid ruds and model session and thats the total of level iii which mainly just puts it to prepchecking which is just cleaning question on meter which is practically all level iii is can he take question that he himself has asked or hes read off list and can he clean it and thats about all youre teaching him at that whole level all the way through which simplifies training there enormously then weve got level iv which is r4sc which is the service fac renumbered thats just service fac arc break assessments r4h and case analysis and all of this is assessment assessment assessment so youre teaching him to assess at level iv whatever kind of an assessment it is youre not trying to teach him now to clean line youre teaching him to find the line to clean so thats the onlythe only step up or improvement there which makes it pretty easy to graduate up to in training and now weve got level vi of course is locatingthis is all level vi now consists ofis locating the truncation checking goals not finding goals running the line plot and track analysis where is the pc see that becomes the totality of level vi you havent got actually finding goals putting together goals plots or any of these other more difficult actions which made level vi almost impossible now we get level vi auditor here and things an auditor should know at level vi i will simply read off here very rapidly as again this will all be published for you case analysis present time problemhe has to know how to handle these various things case analysis present time problem psychosomatic guy got psychosomatic what is it arc break got to handle session class vi arc breaks is different than session arc breaks hes got to be able to do listing hes got to be able to null list and of course that includes auditing by list hes got to know the auditors code hes got to know about completing cycle of action hes got to know about havingness hes got to know about theory of restimulation and destimulation hes got to know by observation of preclearwhats the pc doing at the present moment reading meter executing an auditing cycle knowing not to qanda knowing about auditing symptoms of an arc break good indicators bad indicators not to mess up goodrunning pc not to continue the preclear who isnt running knowing when to stop auditing and ending up the session and how to handle pcs ptps at level vi when they show up track analysis getting the preclear to follow line plot guiding the preclear down goals plot finding out where series is truncated finding out which type of goals series pc is in and looking good crisp and businesslike as an auditor and that gives you the totality and i mean absolute totality of what level vi auditor ought to be able to do well now hes got all the basics of that sort of thing you understand thatsmost of that is simply repeated action on what youve already taught on the lower level so its just the refinement of this that has to be taught him in the level vi course so its not brandnew subject so that is the totality of making the auditor now ive just read you on that list what it all amounts to well you say that looks difficult in some respects but if youve noticed weve thrown out fantastic numbers of processes you can right now think what process what about that process what about some other process forget them these are the senior processes of the bank under repetitive processes you have very few processes theres not even great number of those things going to be in very active use what question would you permit to be asked of you or something like this you see thattheyre that type of session cycle processthat one see and then youve got your pc handling taped here just underneath what processes will get the most effective results on the pc i mean if the pc goes into this then you use that process see and it all weaves together so that none of an auditors training is wasted as you come up the line and it all catalyzes into the end product now therefore that leaves you very few practical drills youve got your meter drills your listing drills youve got your track analysis type drills and you got your basic trs and auditing cycle drills all right that gives you the package you see theorythis becomes pipe because everything is well codified and well straightened out its padded up with lectures which however cover the same subject materials that are covered in the bulletins so therefore lecture examination is not terribly important compared to bulletin examination because the same subject matter is covered auditing is just question can the guy get result with process xz ben see all right well theres onlytheres only dozen of these processes well can he get result with that one well has he gotten result with that one well hes passed on his auditing checksheet if he cleared up somebodys ptp obviously he can handle ptp cleared up somebodys ptp and if the student has to point this out to you then hes now passed this requirement on the checksheet so that becomes relatively simple in that zone is his case making progress is the other half of the auditing supervisor action well that becomes the totality and shape of course now you already had course that was running very well now lets get off into something else course was running very well we complicated the course little bit were dropping back to the simplicity of that there are other administrative changes that are taking place were actually dropping back to the administrative action which we had of month or twothree months ago or something like that about the same administrative action which was the simpler one withwe have had so that requires reformation well ive given you here rundown on really not just the saint hill course ive given you rundown on scientology courses these things ought to be crisp and fast and to that degree theyll be very successful okay why dont you take break
