divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34709economic development assistance for communities affected by employment changes due to military base closures summary under the base realignment and closure brac process military facilities were closed and realigned in 1988 1991 1993 and 1995 fifth brac round was authorized in late 2005 and must be co mpleted by september 15 2011 under the brac process 1 the department of defense dod prepares list of military bases to be realigned or closed 2 an independent brac commission reviews the list makes changes and sends revised list to the president 3 the president approves and transmits the list to congress and 4 the brac recommendations are implemented unless joint resolution is passed in congress disapproving the recommendations for closur and realignments the 2005 brac round includes the closure or realignment of 837 facilities and involves an additional 160 fac ilities that will gain missions or resources for total of 997 changes nationwide most of th changes are on smaller scale each involving fewer than 300 direct job losses or gains including military civilian and contractor jobs unlike previous rounds the 2005 brac round is focused on creating the infrastructure needed to s upport transformed expeditionary armed force concentrated more on shifting forces and installation assets to promote the centralization of units in places from which they can be deployed rapidly thus the 2005 brac round is characterized much more by realignment than closure in 20 communities an estimated increase of 170000 workers is expected important policy issues before congress include 1 the impact of military base closures and expansions on local employment 2 the possible elimination of the of the brac commission and the resulting imp act on federal economic and community development programs such as th community development block grant cdbg program and the economic deve lopment administration eda that currently provide preference

of environmental cleanup by david bearden policy challenge for congress re lated to environmental cleanup is how to promote an appropriate environmental review of military facilities within reasonable time frame since some facilities dating back to 1988 are still under environmental review and remediation 2 prior to the 1988 brac round military installations were closed or their missions were altered by order of the secretary of defense 3 10 usc section 2687 authorizes the base realignment and closure brac process for 1 military installations at which at least 300 civ ilian pers onnel are authorized to be employed or 2 the realignment of any military installation where at least 300 civilian personnel are authorized to be employed and where the closure or realignment is intended to reduce the work force by more than 1000 or by more than 50 of the number of civilian personnel authorized to be employed at the installation economic development assistance for communities affected by

places from which they can be deployed rapidly thus the 2005 brac round is characterized much more by realignment than closure this latest brac round includes the clos ure or realignment of 837 facilities and involves an additional 160 fac ilities that will gain missions or resources due to the proposed closures and realignments for total of 997 affected facilities nationwide most of these closures are on small scale each involving less than 300 direct employment losses or gains each including military civilian and contractor jobs twentytwo major military installations will be closed and 33 others will be realigned according to gao estimates the 2005 brac round will entail relocating over 123000 personnel4 in addition to bracrelated actions that must be completed by september 15 2011 under the global defense posture realignment5 process dod is planning to transfer about 70000 military and civilia n personnel to the united states by 20116 dod also plans to increase the size of the army by 74000 and the marines by 27000 these transfers and increases w ill also have considerable economic development impacts in 20 military facilities alone these combined changes will result in the net growth of 173000 military and civilian personnel not including families and contractors7 spatial analysis methodology the congressional research service crs compiled database with information on direct and indirect military civilian and employment changes for nearly 1000 military facilities nationwide to conduct an analysis of employment changes in communities throughout the count ry as

multiplier effects which measure the rate at which direct effect eg base job losses creates indirect effects such as additional j obs are important elements in estimating the impacts of base closing if for example one assumes that base job has large indirect employment multiplier eg 2530 then for each direct base job lost indirectly related jobs in some defined geographic area are also pr edicted to be lost as result similarly an income multiplier allows one to estimate to tal income generated by military base 10 brac commission 2005 defense base closure and realignment commission report to the president washington dc september 8 2005 11 ibidinformation was obtained from the head of the brac commission former secretary of veterans affairs anthony j principi second data base was developed using geographic information system gis for analytical purposes to estimate and visualize information at multiple geographic levels this database includes information on employment changes for 1 individual facilitie s 2 metropolitan statistical areas 3 counties and 4 states for each of these geographic levels information on employment gains and losses is available for six different variables direct military civilian and contractor losse s or gains 3 variables total direct employment changes indirect employment changes using an employment multiplier9 developed by the brac commission and total direct and indirect employment changes in addition reports from gove rnment agencies such as gao and dod were compiled to review economic development issues the results of the compilation of this information are presented below employment changes in largest facilities in general dod data show that to tal of 21 major military facilities will be closed and 30 other facilities will be realigned as part of the 2005 brac process table 1 includes list of major military installations that will be closed or realigned based on final recommendati ons from the 2005 brac co mmission10 the table ranks the military facilities by the number of direct and indirect employment losses and gains for military civilian and contractor staff two of the largest facilities affected by job losses are fort monmouth new jersey and walter reed army medical center in the district of columbia an estimated 5200 jobs in fort monmouth will be transferred to ot her facilities and total of 9700 jobs will be lost directly or indirectly at this new jersey facility according to estimates developed by the brac co mmission11 most of these employment losses in fort monmouth will be civilian jobs with more than 4600 civilian job losses but large majority of these positions will be transferred to other facilities specifically nine other military facilities would gain jobs transferred from fort monmouth aberdeen proving ground in maryland will gain several thousand positions as result of transfers from fort monmouth and the us military academy at west point new york will gain 421 jobs once the overall job transfers in maryland new jersey and new york are accounted for the net employment change is estimated to be total reduction of 589 positionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34709crs4 table 1

with greater geographic area in the west in states such as calif ornia and relatively smaller sizes in the east the msalevel map helps to illustrate that although some cities such as boulder colorado will see decreased employment as result of base realignments other nearby jurisdictions such as colorado springs will gain jobs and help offset the changes in states such as colorado facilities that

through the defense access road program 6 delays in environmental cleanup that may cau difficulties in the economic redevelopment of military facilities and 7 redevelopment of military bases as refineries to promote economic growth these issues are discussed in mo re detail below38 impacts on communities one of the most important issues for congress is the impact of base closures and expansions on local communities r ecent experience with the base closure and reuse process has shown that the major problems facing communities include the reconciling of competing demands for the assets sometimes unrealistic federal appraisals of base ssets local funding constraints the lack of short term interim leases from the federal government facilities that are not in compliance with local codes land use constraints conserva tion issues and excessive levels of environmental contamination the economic vulnerability of these communities and states to such job losses will depend upon the rate at whic h jobs are eliminated at closed or realigned facilities the succe ss of displaced workers in finding new jobs in the area and the success of each state and community in generating new job opportunities at closed military facilities and elsewhere within the community or state economy the issue of timing in base c onversion realignment and closure is also important for communities all parties are generally interested in moving the base conversion process along as fast as possi ble while the public interest generally may be served by moving as quickly as practicable some of the necessary steps such as the environmental impact asse ssment and any necessary cleanup often require more time delay can also be caused by difficulties in getting local governments to work cooperatively within redevelopment programs an earlier analysis conducted by crs of the previous four brac rounds based on statistics compiled by the department of defense found that military base closures had limited impact on levels of unemployment in localhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34709crs20 39 see crs report 96562 military base closures since 1988 status and employment changes at the

ilian job losses directly and indirectly resulting from brac actions for the prev ious four brac rounds all experienced estimated losses amounting to 04 or less of total jobs in each state for the 2005 brac round states are estimated to ex perience job losses of less than 03 many communities will experience considerable increases in employment40 elimination of the brac commission the duncan

development of the brac commission process prior to 1988 very fe w military bases were closed if the brac commission is eliminated congress may opt to consider an alternative to the commission and possible impacts on economic and community development programs that provide preference for communities affected by changes in employment as result of brac ther may be important tradeoffs and impacts on regional economic devel opment if congress instead of the dod assumes decisionmaking power over military base closures increase in brac c onstruction costs in 2005 dod originally estimated that construction costs related to brac would total 179 billion from 2006 to 2011 however the fy2009 request had increased from the original 2005 estimate by nearly 80 to 320 billion the considerable

affairs and related agencies fy2009 appropriations july 2008 appropriations requests for the 2005 round had been fully funded by congress the senates recommendation fo r fy2009 would reduce

bracrelated construction inside and around military f acilities while cost estimates for brac construction have increased from 17 billion in 2005 to 32 billion in 2009 funding for federal assistance programs to communities has remained flat an important question for congress is how or whether to aid communities that will experience an influx of hundreds of thousa nds of staff by the statutory deadline of september 2 011 alt hough the expected increase in construction may lead to economic growth in selected communities state and local governments may have to fund projects related to ec onomic development what is the role of the federal state and local governments in supporting commun ities affected by employment increases or losses and what is the appropr iate level of funding required to adjust to growth in employment housing traffic demand and military construction housing for military staff displaced by brac the dod housing improvement fund supports military housing privatization and the program pred ates the 1988 brac process the homeowners assistance fund is subcomponent of this program and may provide economic assistance to military pe rsonnel affected by relocation as result of brac activities in particular f unding is available for staff who are unable to sell their homes because of the turmoil in the housing markets an increase in requests for this type of assi stance may be expected in addition the downturn in the national economy tightenin g of credit markets and uncertainty in the financial sector may have an im portant economic development impact over housing prices and stock state and local governments may seek federal dod resources to offset decreases in reve nue as result of the economic downturn defense access road program the defense access road program dar allows dod to pay for public highway improvements required as result of sudden or unusual defensegenerated traffic impacts such as bracrelated ac tivities although dod

ities such as brac actions if defense action will result in doubling of traffic or if new road is needed to accommodate special military vehicles give n the projected decline in state and local government coffers due to decreased economic activity at the national level federal assistance for road construction could become an increasingly important component of economic development environmental cleanup the amount of funds and time require d to complete the environmental review and cleanup of clos ed military bases will depend on the type and extent of contamination present on thos properties and the actio ns that will be necessary to make the land safe for civilian reuse cleanup can take many years as the continuing cleanup of certain bases cl osed between 1988 and 1995 demonstrates as in prior rounds availability of fundi ng and capabilities of cleanup technologies could limit the degree of cleanup on bases closed in the 2005 round making certain land uses infeasible and posing ch allenges to economic redevelopment in deliberations over the 2005 r ound some members of congress and the brac commission expressed concern that dods estimates coul d be undervalued because they do not reflect all possible land uses and the corresponding degree of cleanup that may be necessary to redevelop these bases policy issue for congress is related to the timing of base closures particularly in relation to environmental contamin ation and cleanup of military facilities environmental contamination of military bases poses special problems that affect the types and timing of re use activities and has consumed about onefourth of the money appropriated for base cl osures since 1988 congress continues to address this problem legislatively bu t additional concerns and responses seem likely in the future brac facility redevelopment for refineries subtitle c section 2722 of the d uncan hunter national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2009 hr 5658 requires that the secretary of defense will prepare and submit re port by october 1 2009 evaluating the feasibility of using military installations selected for closure under brac as locations for the construction of petroleu m or natural gas refineries or nuclear power plants the conversion of military facilities into re fineries may have important economic development impacts on local communities where these installations are located concluding observations the base realignment and closure process has affected communities nationwide since 1988 congressional distri cts have been affected economically by defense spending cuts and the em ployment losses and gains from the four previous brac rounds in general the 2005 brac round is more focused onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34709crs23 44 see peter l sternberg and thomas d rowley comparison of military base closures in metro and nonmetro counties government finance review october 1993realignment instead of base closures with an expected shift of nearly 200000 military and civilian staff nationwide there will be increasing demand for economic assistance to plan for bracrelated growth in communities communities that gain jobs will have to plan for population and economic growth that may result in greater demand for housing infrastructure services and increases in traffic with 173000 military nd civilian staff expected to arrive in the top 20 military facilities gaining employment in addition the balance between c ongress dod and the executive branch in deciding what bases to close will continue to be an important issue members of congress are interested in the impact of military base closures on their local districts and the economic impact of em ployment declines and gains brac however is process more focused on na tional security requirements and less on economic development observers note that if federal economic assistance programs do not meet redevelopment needs local communities may face the unanticipated responsibility of funding effo rts to adjust to increases and declines in military facilities at the state and local levels with respect to employment changes at the regional level the closure and realignment of facilities will result in the direct and indirect transfer of military civilian and contractor jobs throug hout the nation some communities will experience an increase in employment whereas others will see decrease in military jobs the impact will vary depending on the individual characteristics of the affected areas major factor that will affect ec onomic impact is the total share of jobs lost or gained as shar of total employment at the metropolitan or micropolitan level rural communities that tend to be smaller and have less diversified economic base may experience greater impact than large urban centers with diverse economy communities that gain jobs will have to plan for population growth that may result in gr eater demand for housing infrastructure services and increases in traffic communities that lose jobs may have to focus on economic and community development pr ograms such as cdbg and eda that can
