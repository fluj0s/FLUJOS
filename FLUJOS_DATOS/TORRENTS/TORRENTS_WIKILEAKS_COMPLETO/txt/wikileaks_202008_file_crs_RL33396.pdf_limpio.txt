malaria headquartered in geneva switzerland is an independent foundation that seek s to attract and rapidly disburse new resources in developing countries aimed at countering the three diseases the fund is financing vehicle not an implementing agency the origins of the fund as an independent entity to fight the three diseases lie partly in french proposal made in 1998 in ideas developed in the 106th congress and in recommendations made by united nations secretarygeneral kofi annan in april 2001 though the global fund was established in january 2002 president bush pledged 200 million to such fund in may 2001 as of july 17 2008 donors have pledged more than 202 billion to the fund of which more than 102 billion has been paid the fund has approved support for more than 500 grants totaling some 10 billion for projects in 136 countries each year the fund awards grants through proposal rounds the fund launched its eighth round on march 3 2008 in 2005 the fund approved round 5 grants in two tranches becaus initially there were insufficient donor pledges to approve all the recommended proposals the fund approved the first group of round 5 proposals in september 2005 and the second in december 2005 after donors pledged to make additional contributions the global fund only approves proposals if it has sufficient resources on hand to support the first two years of proposed project this policy is designed to avoid disruptions to projects due to funding shortages funding lapses can cause interruptions in treatment regiments which could lead to treatmentresistant strains of the diseases or death the united states is the largest single contributor to the global fund from fy2001 through fy2008 congress has made available an estimated 36 billion to the fund including 8403 million in fy2008 the single largest us contribution to date of those funds 5455 million would come from the state department and 2948 million from the department of health and human services hhs the president requested 500 million for fy2009 contribution to the global fund there has been some debate about the level of us contributions to the fund some critics argue that the united states should

board established the rolling continuation channel rcc this funding channel which began in march 2007 permits country coordinating mechanisms ccms7 to request additional funding for grants that are performing well but set to expire the application process for the rcc is not as rigorous as the round process rccapproved grants can receive support for up to an additional six years with th funds being awarded in threeyear intervals the channel is intended only for those grants that have demonstrated significant contribution to national effort that has had or has the potential to have in the near future measurable impact on the burden of the relevant disease 8 7 ccms are comprised of individuals from governments ngos the private sector and affected populations the ccms develop and submit

performancebased funding system that permits it to temporarily suspend support for grants if it finds significant problems with project performance such as accounting inconsistencies in some instances the fund restored support to grants once key concerns were resolved for example in november 2006 the fund suspended support for grants in chad after undertaking audits of the grants the fund reportedly discovered evidence of misuse of funds at several levels and the lack of satisfactory capacity by the principal recipient and subrecipients to manage the global funds resources in august 2007 the fund announced that it had lifted the suspension after series of investigation and negotiations between the global fund and national authorities and after efforts and strong commitment of all relevant stakeholders which guaranteed that the issues have been addressed and better systems with clarified responsibilities will be put in place as part of the global funds mitigationbesides other measuresa fiduciary agent will guarantee for an interim period of 12 months adequate financial monitoring and accounting for our grants 9 the fund might discontinue support for grants in phase ii if it finds that they did not sufficiently meet their targets countries whose grants have been discontinued can apply and have secured funding in subsequent rounds see nigeria belo w in extreme cases the fund will immediately cancel financial support if funds are immediately revoked the fund might invoke its continuity of services policy which ensures that lifeextending treatment is continued for suspended or cancelled grants or for those whose terms have expired until other financial support is identified 10 to date the fund has only terminated grants in burma when the fund decided to terminate support for grants in burma policy analysts debated how best to serve humanitarian needs in politically unstable countries g21g158g156g153g142g151g141g142g141g561g9g155g138g151g157g156g561

stated that it would ask reliable organization to take over implementation of the programs for several months to give ukraine the opportunity to address concerns of slow implementation management and governance issues 11 nearly month later on february 24 2004 the fund announced that the suspension had ended and that temporary principal recipient had been identified the fund hoped that if new

implemented by an ngo named lovelife had failed to sufficiently address weaknesses in its implementation20 press accounts quote global fund representative explaining that it had become difficult to measure how the lovelife prevention campaign was contributing to the re duction of hivaids among young people in south africa additionally the representative reportedly stated that the board had repeatedly requested that lovelife revise its proposals and address concerns regarding performance financial and accounting procedures and the need for an effective governance structure global fund spokesman was quoted as saying that lovelife is extremely costly there are programs that have been very effective which cost fraction of what lovelife costs it would be irresponsible of the global fund to spend almost 40 million without seeing results 21 lovelife officials were reportedly surprised that the global fund ultimately decided to discontinue funding the grant particularly since there were some reported differences of opinion regarding the matter between the funds technical review panel trp secretariat and the board22 additionally lovelife officials reportedly argued that the decision was politically motivated and influenced by us emphasis on abstinence in hiv prevention efforts one press account quoted lovelife official as saying obviously the strength of conservative ideologies is spilling over into the field of hiv and hiv prevention and it has direct impact on programs like lovelife 23 according to lovelife press release the decision to discontinue support for the program will substantially curtail south africas efforts to prevent hiv infections among young people because the global funds grant supported one third of the programs budget however the south

august 18 2005 the fund stated that while it was concerned about the extensive humanitarian needs in burma travel restrictions imposed by the countrys government prevented the fund from effectively implementing grants 27 according to the fund travel clearance procedures that the burmese government instituted in july 2005 prevented the pr implementing partners and global fund staff from accessing grant implementation areas the fund indicated that the travel restrictions coupled with new procedures that the government established to review procurement of medical and other supplies prevented implementation of performancebased and timebound programs in the country breached the governments commitment to provide unencumbered access and frustrated the ability of the pr to carry out its obligations 28 the global funds decision to discontinue those grants in burma sparked larger debate about providing humanitarian assistance in countries that are politically unstable or governed by dictatorial regimes some were disappointed that the fund terminated its assistance citing the significant humanitarian needs in the country burmese official stated that the restrictions on aid workers

particular aspects of the funds financial policies observers contend that the funds oversight mechanisms are not strong enough to protect against wasteful spending particularly in countries that have well documented history of corruption and poor financial management fund supporters counter that the organizations website provides an abundance of information related to its funding process grant project proposals and budgets grant spending trends and results of board meetings which include decisions regarding the suspension of grants fund advocates also argue that the funds decisions to suspend temporarily and in some cases discontinue poor performing grants demonstrate the effectiveness of the funds oversight and funding mechanisms in june 2005 the us government accountability office gao reported that the fund had limited capability to monitor and evaluate grants raising questions about the accuracy of its reported results gao also indicated that the funds documents had not consistently explained why it provided additional funds for grants or why it denied disbursement requests 43 in october 2006 the center for global development cgd global fund working group reported similar findings and made number of recommendations including strengthening the performance based funding system44 in an effort to strengthen oversight of the fund s grants congress included provision in section 525 of pl 109102 fy2006 foreign operations appropriations that required 20 of the us contribution to the global fund be withheld until the secretary of state certified to the appropriations committees that the fund had undertaken number of steps to strengthen oversight and spending practices the act allows the secretary to waive the requirement however if she determines that waiver is important to the national interest at march 2007 hearing on tb held by the subcommittee on africa and global health representative adam smith expressed his reservations about the funds oversight capacity stating that the information and accountability that congress has come to take for granted through bilateral programs are not available through the global fund and that many of the primary recipients of the global fund grants are governments with history of corruption and fraud andor limited capacity to properly manage large sums of money in their health sectors one could argue that the absence in the global fund of robust reporting and monitoring mechanism at both the primary and sub recipient levels is an open invitation for waste in these countries and tragic loss of opportunity to save lives the implementation of system that provides accountability and transparency would seem vital absolutely necessary in my view to continue the expanded donor support of the global fund in

acknowledged that the fund had improved its documentation of funding decisions but also determined that the process needed improvement45 the report indicated that while each grant that gao reviewed included an explanation of associated funding decisions the ex planations did not detail what criteria the fund used to determine whether to disburse funds or renew support as it had found in 2005 gao recommended that the fund strengthen oversight of local fund agents lfas and standardize performance benchmarks to improve the quality of grant monitoring and reporting46 in fy2008 congress placed additional monitoring and oversight provisions to global fund appropriations the fy2008 consolidated appropria tions required that 20 of us contributions to the fund be withheld until the secretary of state certifies to the committees on appropriations that the global fund releases incremental disbursements only if grantees demonstrate progress against clearly defined performance indicators provides support and oversight to countrylevel entities has fulltime independent office of inspector general who is fully operational requires lfas to assess whether principal recipient has the capacity to oversee the activities of subrecipients is making progress toward implementing reporting system that breaks down grantee budget allocations by programmatic activity makes the reports of the inspector general publicly available and tracks and encourages the involvement of civil society including faithbased organizations in country coordinating mechanisms and program implementation the fy2008 consolidated appropriations also requir ed the secretary of state to submit report within 120 days of enactment to the appropriations committees that details the involvement of faithbased organizations in global fund programs some in congress have long advocated for stronger oversight of global fund spending supporters of this idea have welcomed the provisions some global fund supporters contend however that such action is unnecessary in light of the strides that the fund continues to make in improving its reporting and monitoring practices as congress considers whether to continue supporting the global fund members might debate whether the fund is sufficiently adhering to congressional mandates or if additional provisions are necessary 45 gao global fund to fight aids

pl 10825 us leadership against hivaids tuberculosis and malaria act prohibits us government contributions to the fund from exceeding 33 of contributions from all donors congress instituted the contribution limit to encourage greater global support for the fund there is some debate about whether the 33 provision should be interpreted as the amount the united states should provide to the fund or as the maximum amount the united states can contribute supporters of the fund contend that congress instituted the 33 mandate in recognition of the moral responsibility that the united states holds as one of the wealthiest countries in the world opponents of this idea assert that if us contribu tions to the fund were to reflect its share of the global economy then us contributions would and should range from 20 to 25 of all contributions some global fund advocates who disparage the 33 restriction argue that the differing fiscal cycles of the fund and the united states complicate efforts to leverage support opponents to the 33 restriction contend that the requirement is harmful to the fund because the us fiscal year concludes some three months before the funds critics most often point to fy2004 to substantiate their position in that fiscal year nearly 88 million of the us contribution was withheld from the fund to prevent the funds from exceeding 33 advocates of the restriction assert that the 33 cap was intended to suspend portions of us contributions where necessary proponents of the cap note that the fund was not significantly affected as the withheld portion was released at the end of the calendar year when the fund secured sufficient funds to match the us contribution supporters of the provision contend that the fund benefits from the policy because it encourages
