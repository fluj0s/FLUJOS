the commissionergeneral of the united nations relief and works agency for palestine in the near east 1 july 200130 june 2002 at httpwwwunorg unrwapublicationschallenges for unrwa according to unrwa number of fact ors affect its current operations security the volatile situation in gaza and the west bank along with the israeli response have placed extra demands on unr was emergency and refugee assistance the increasing intensity of violence ce february 2002 has disrupted and delayed humanitarian deliveries and affected the security and movement of unrwa staff10 the escalation of hostilities has also directly resulted in damage and destruction to housing and infrastructure funding the unrwa budget wh ich is funded almost entirely by voluntary contributions fluctuates according to timing amounts contributed and exchange rates for foreign currencies with increased use of unrwa services greater demands are being placed on the funding available socioeconomic conditions deteriorating socio economic conditions have had an enormous impact in terms of increasing unemployment and diminishing job security decline in the business sector has only aggravated the problem placing extra demand on unrwas services unrwa reports that there is mounting humanitarian crisis in the occupied palestinian territory seen in deteriorating health conditions rising poverty and displacement of palestinians as the most vulnerable element of the population refugees have been particularly affected issues for congress refugee resettlement there is some concern that effort has been made to settle the refugees permanently some in congress have also questioned whether refugee rolls are inflated while unrwa periodica lly updates the rolls to try to eliminate duplication its mandate covers relief and social services but not resettlement although the refugee camps were meant to be temporary to provide some relief to the palestinians more than fifty years later some are asking whether the unhcr might be better placed to provide ongoing assistance unhcr woul d likely pursue durable longterm solution for the refugees however others have main tained that approach cannot work until there is settlement between the palestinians and israelis while the palestinians argue that general assembly resolu tion 194 calls for return to their homes or compensation the israelis say that because they did not cause the displacement the international community is responsible for finding solu tion at present unrwa is still considered by many unique organization that is bette r left in place until way forward on the peace process can be found use of unrwa funds for many years congress has raised concerns about how to ensure that unrwa funds are used for the programs it supports and not for anything inappropriate such as terrorist activities in the past some in congress have been concerned that refugee camps were being used as military training grounds the campshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21668crs6 11 section 301c states that an contribution to unrwa by the united states are made on the condition that unrwa do everything possible to ensure that none of the funds are used to assist refugees being trained by the plo or who are otherwise involved in terrorist activities 12 gao briefed staff on november 6 2 003 after being asked to post pone the date to due

quirement in the housepassed legislation to report to congress on procedures that have been put in place to ensure that section 301c is enforced to the fullest degree possible educational materials concerns have been ex pressed about the content of textbooks and educationa l materials used by unrwa with claims that they promote anti semitism and exacerbate tensions between israelis and pale stinians the host country not unrwa provides the textbooks because st udents must take exams in host country degree programs in house debate amendmen t 15 offered by rep jarold nadler to the fy2004
