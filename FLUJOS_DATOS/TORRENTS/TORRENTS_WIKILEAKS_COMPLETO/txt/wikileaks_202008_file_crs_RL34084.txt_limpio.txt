groups introduction every year congress institutions of higher education ihes and relevant higher education associations debate what changes if any should be made to the pell grant program to increase its purchasing power and make college more affordable especially for lowincome students the most commonly discussed option increasing the maximum appropriated award per student1 is also the most expensive option it is estimated that 100 increase in the maximum appropriated grant award would increase program costs by approximately 400 million2 in light of this it is unusual for congress to act to increase the maximum appropriated grant award while several proposals are introduced each year3 the passage of the fy2007 appropriations4 marks the first time that an increase in the maximum award has been made since fy2002 when it was increased from 4000 to 4050 in addition to increasing the maximum award alternate ways of using the pell grant to help make college more affordable for lowincome students have also been considered for example the presidents fy2008 budget request and hr 990 both propose that the tuition sensitivity provision be eliminated this provision as implemented by the us department of education ed disparately affects low income students who also attend lowcost ihes by capping the amount of their pell grant award discussed later in this report thus removal of this provision would 1 the maximum appropriated pell grant award is specified in the annual appropriations legislation for the us department of education that legislation appropriates funding for the pell grant program and sets the maximum award that can be made during the award year 2 this estimate is limited to increases that occur during the 20082009 pell award year for additional information see department of education fiscal year 2008 justifications of appropriation estimates to the congress volume ii p o26 3 during the 110th congress s 899 s 7 hres 81 and hr 722 among other bills each propose to increase the maximum pell grant award by various amounts s 3528 s 2573 hr 2960 and hr 168 among others were introduced during the 109th congress to increase the maximum grant award 4 the maximum appropriated award was increased to 4310 from 4050 by the house revised continuing appropriations resolution 2007 hjres 20 pl 1105 the increase becomes effective july 1 2007 crs2 provide these students with an increased pell grant award further congressional interest has been expressed in expanding eligibility for the automaticzero expected family contribution hereinafter autozero efc autozero efc sets the expected family contribution efc the amount that family is expected to contribute to his or her education to 0 for individuals with an adjusted gross income agi at or below specified income level currently set at 20000 if the income threshold were raised additional lowincome students would potentially qualify for the maximum pell grant award discussed later in this report although elimination of the tuition sensitivity provision would increase the grants coverage of college costs and expanding eligibility for autozero efc would enable the grant to reach additional lowincome students both of these changes would increase the programs cost so the question remains is it possible to increase the grants coverage of college tuition and fees and extend the grant to more lowincome students while also controlling for significant cost increases and changes in the recipient composition it should be noted that any change to the programs award rules or to the need analysis formula discussed later in this report would affect the programs cost and the recipient composition there are however provisions that can be altered that would reduce program costs and would not increase the number of participants for example increasing the minimum grant award and eliminating the bump discussed later in this report both work together to reduce program costs and possibly the number of recipients depending on how much the minimum award is increased in addition if selected program changes are made in tandem such as increasing the maximum grant award and eliminating the tuition sensitivity provision it is possible to increase the grants coverage of tuition and fees eliminate provisions that disparately affect needy students and extend the grant to additional lowincome students without significantly increasing program costs or changing the number of recipients this report models selected changes in the pell grant programs award rules and the need analysis formula to examine what impact if any the changes would have on program costs as well as the recipient population specifically the report examines the effect of the following changes increasing the maximum appropriated award increasing the amount of the minimum award and dropping the bump eliminating the tuition sensitivity provision and increasing the income eligibility threshold for the automaticzero expected family contribution provision in addition to analyzing each of these provisions separately final analysis combines some of the provisions to examine the combined effect of changing groups of award rules simultaneously the report begins with brief description of the federal need analysis system to illustrate how the formula interacts with the pell grant award this is followed by review of the pell grant programs structure including brief discussion of the eligibility criteria funding process and program award rules for determining an crs3 individuals grants finally the report concludes with discussion of the results for each of the aforementioned analyses this report is designed to complement detailed discussion of the pell grant program and the federal student aid need analysis formula included in crs report rl31668 federal pell grant program of the higher education act background and reauthorization and crs report rl33266 federal student aid need analysis system background description and legislative action both by charmaine mercer these two reports collectively provide greater context about the pell grant program and the need analysis formula than what is provided in this report overview this section provides an overview of the federal student aid need analysis formula including the different dependency classifications for applicants and its relationship to the pell grant program it also describes the eligibility criteria the authorized and appropriated maximum awards and the award rules for the pell grant program federal need analysis formula the federal student aid need analysis formula title iv part f of the higher education act hea as amended is complex system used to allocate billions of dollars approximately 80 billion in fy2007 of federal student aid through an array of student aid programs authorized by title iv of the hea the need analysis formula entails the collection of financial data which are provided by students via the free application for federal student aid fafsa these data are then used to calculate an individual students expected family contribution efc the efc is the amount the need analysis formula determines that the student and his or her parents when applicable has available to contribute toward postsecondary education expenses in calculating the efc total income combination of taxable and untaxed income and benefits is considered and for some families assets are also considered in addition allowances such as living expenses retirement needs and federal and state tax liability are considered the income contribution is calculated by subtracting series of allowances such as those previously mentioned from total income and then considering percentage of that available income as an income contribution toward postsecondary education costs contribution from assets is similarly calculated the combination of the available income and asset contribution divided by the number of individuals in the family enrolled in college constitutes the efc expected family contribution efc and dependency status the calculation of the efc varies depending upon the applicants dependency status there are three separate dependency classifications for individual applicants dependent student independent student with dependents and independent student without dependents these distinctions are important because parental financial information is not considered if the applicant meets the statutory definition of an crs4 independent student to be classified as an independent student title iv section 480d an applicant must meet at least one of the following conditions be 24 years of age or older be married be enrolled in graduate or professional program have dependent other than spouse be an orphan or ward of the court or have been one until age 18 or be military veteran or active duty service member students who do not meet any of the aforementioned conditions are considered to be dependent for the purposes of title iv federal student aid efc and cost of attendance the financial aid administrator determines the students need for federal aid and other sources of aid based primarily upon the efc and cost of attendance coa5 this is true for all federal student aid programs except for the pell grant program to be discussed the final outcome is the financial aid award or package which consists of the specific sources and amounts of student aid each applicant will receive to help pay for his or her educationrelated expenses6 special efc conditions in calculating the efc special consideration is given to individuals with family incomes at or below specified threshold there are two special efc conditions simplified needs test snt and autozero efc under the snt the efc calculation does not consider assets for applicants if their agi is less than 500007 the automaticzero efc sets the efc to 0 for individuals who have an agi that is not greater than 200008 in addition to having the efc calculated exclusively based on their income recipients who qualify for snt and autozero efc are entitled to provide less income and asset data on the fafsa 5 according to hea title iv section 472 cost of attendance coa is determined by each ihe coa is measure of students educational expenses at specific ihe in general it is the sum of tuition and fees an allowance for books supplies transportation and miscellaneous personal expenses and room and board allowance coa can also include an allowance for dependent care expenses for students with dependents costs associated with study abroad programs for students engaged in such programs expenses associated with disability for students with disabilities and the costs associated with employment under cooperative education program 6 for more detailed description of the federal student aid need analysis system see crs report rl33266 federal student aid need analysis system background description and legislative action by charmaine mercer 7 additionally to be eligible for snt the student and hisher parents must not have to file an income tax return or must file or be eligible to file federal tax form 1040a or 1040ez individuals who complete federal tax form 1040 solely to claim the hope or lifetime learning tax credit are eligible as well further eligibility for snt can be satisfied if any family member including the applicant received federal meanstested benefit 8 the same income tax filing requirements and receipt of federal meanstested benefit that apply to snt applicants also apply to autozero applicants autozero efc is not provided to independent students without dependents crs5 pell grant program pell grants pell are the largest single source of federal grant aid to postsecondary students pell grants are needbased portable aid and are primarily received by lowincome undergraduate students pell grants are considered to be the foundation of student aid because all other federal aid eg federal work study student loans is calculated after the amount of the pell award has been determined the fy2007 appropriation for the pell grant program is 136 billion it is projected to provide grants to 53 million undergraduate students9 eligibility in addition to the general eligibility criteria for all federal student aid programs10 for recipient to receive pell grant award the individual must be enrolled at an eligible ihe for the purpose of earning degree or certificate11 generally the recipient must also be enrolled in an undergraduate program12 recipients who attend less than fulltime are eligible for pell grant however the grant amount is adjusted in accordance with the recipients enrollment status authorized maximums and appropriated maximums although the authorizing statute hea title iv section 401b2 sets the authorized maximum pell award for each year this authorized maximum is overridden by the appropriations process which sets the appropriated maximum award this latter amount is the one applied in awarding funds to recipients the fy2003 authorized maximum grant is 5800 most recent authorized amount but the fy2007 appropriated maximum grant is 4310 the appropriated maximum award is often used as gauge of the programs support for lowincome students because this is the amount that the neediest students those with an efc of 0 are likely to receive 9 for additional information about these criteria see crs report rl31668 federal pell grant program of the higher education act background and reauthorization by charmaine mercer 10 for information about the basic federal student aid eligibility criteria and the specific criteria for the pell program see crs report rl31668 11 for additional information about institutional eligibility see crs report rl33909 institutional eligibility for participation in title iv student aid programs under the higher education act background and reauthorization issues by rebecca r skinner 12 students enrolled on at least halftime basis in postbaccalaureate program required by state for k12 teacher certification or licensure are also eligible such program cannot lead to graduate degree and the enrolling ihe must not offer baccalaureate degrees in education crs6 award rules the primary pell grant award rule is that recipients award amount is the lowest of three amounts the maximum appropriated pell grant award minus the efc the coa minus efc or the tuition sensitivity amount13 for nearly all pell recipients the pell grant award is calculated by subtracting the efc from the maximum appropriated pell grant for the year ie without regard to coa this is because the maximum pell grant minus the recipients efc is almost always lower than the coa minus the efc in addition by statute the tuition sensitivity provision can apply only when the appropriated maximum pell grant exceeds 2700 it should be noted that the tuition sensitivity provision affects very small group of lowincome students the tuition sensitivity award amount is calculated as follows 2700 onehalf of the difference between the appropriated maximum and 2700 the lesser of the remaining onehalf difference or b tuition14 for example at 4310 pell grant maximum and tuition level of 500 the tuition sensitivity amount of 4005 is determined as follows 2700 805 onehalf of the difference between 4310 maximum award and 2700 500 tuition amount the lesser of 805 and tuition of 500 4005 further by law pell grant award cannot be less than 400 hea title iv section 401b5 for those recipients whose pell grant award would be between 200 and 399 the law provides 400 grant otherwise known as the bump student who qualifies for less than 200 grant will not receive pell grant 13 as implemented by ed tuition sensitivity reduces the pell grant received by small number of very lowincome students attending institutions with very low tuition charges for fy2007 the only students whose pell grant may possibly be reduced under tuition sensitivity are those students whose tuition charges and any allowances for dependent care or disabilityrelated expenses are less than 805 whose efcs are 800 or less and whose total coa is 3500 or higher these conditions are delineated in the 20072008 pell grant payment and disbursement tables which are available on the web at httpwwwifap edgovdpclettersattachments2007payschedpdf 14 specific allowances are added to tuition for students with dependent care expenses or expenses related to disability crs7 data and methodology this analysis uses estimates derived by crs from the pell grant estimation model which was developed and is maintained by the us department of educations budget service the department of educations annual budget requests for pell grant appropriations are based on the results from the pell estimation model the models latest version u2008 was utilized for this analysis all estimates presented in this report are for the 20082009 pell award year15 for additional information about the pell grant estimation model see the appendix it is important to note that crs does not make official congressional cost estimates of federal programs or legislative proposals that is the responsibility of the congressional budget office any estimates of costs and the number and characteristics of recipients included in this report are provided to suggest the relative magnitude and nature of the impact of possible changes in the pell grant program most of the results from the analyses are presented by family income it is important to note that family income for the purpose of these analyses is identical to total income which is produced by the need analysis formula and defined in section 480c of title iv of the hea total income consists of the following agi income earned from employment untaxed income and benefits eg welfare and child support payments other sources of income such as federal education income tax credits eg hope and lifetime credits and certain student grant and scholarship aid eg americorps benefits however agi not total income is the data element that is used to determine an individuals eligibility for autozero efc and snt agi generally equals the amount of income earned from work dividends and taxable income and pensions minus specified deductions such as ira contribution or student loan interest among other things16 in most cases agi is either less than or equal to family income for the analysis of the pell grants coverage of college costs only two measures were used 1 the average amount of tuition and fees at public ihes and 2 tuition fees room and board tfrb at public ihes these two measures were inflated to produce projected estimated amount for the 20082009 academic year to generate these estimates 10year average academic years 19941995 through 20042005 percentage increase was produced for both fouryear and twoyear public ihes the estimated 10year average percentage increases for public fouryear ihes are 66 for tuition and fees only and 56 for tfrb for twoyear public ihes the 15 data for the 20082009 award year were utilized because it is the earliest possible award year that any changes congress might make to the pell grant program could be implemented the 20082009 pell grant award year begins july 1 2008 and runs through june 30 2009 16 for the 2006 tax year agi can be located on the specified line for the following tax forms line 37 of form 1040 line 21 of form 1040a and line 4 of form 1040ez for additional information about how agi is calculated see crs report crs report rl30110 federal individual income tax terms an explanation by pamela jackson crs8 estimated 10year average percentages are 46 for tuition and fees only and 44 for tfrb17 it should be noted that this analysis does not address the pell grants coverage of tuition and fees and tfrb at private ihes in general the average tuition and fees and tfrb at private ihes are substantially higher than at public ihes in the last two decades the pell grant has never covered more than 30 of the average tuition and fees at private fouryear ihes moreover at its peak 1975 the most the grant covered was about 62 of the average tuition and fees at fouryear private ihe finally it is important to note that there has been considerable amount of research conducted regarding increases in the amount of federal grant aid18 and institutions response to these increases particularly with respect to increases in tuition and fees the research and findings on this subject are both limited and inconclusive with some researchers concluding that relationship exists between the increase in federal student aid and increases in tuition and fees while others have found correlation may exist but the relationship depends on the type of institution for example judith lis research entitled estimating the effect of federal financial aid on college tuitions study of pell grants 1999 concludes that public and private fouryear ihes increased tuition by more than the increase in the amount of the pell grant whereas twoyear public ihes decreased tuition for every 1 increase in the pell grant award19 conversely in report commissioned by the department of education national center for education statistics entitled study of college costs and prices 198889 to 199798 volume i 2001 by alisa cunningham et they note that other researchers such as mcpherson and schapiro 1998 and coopers and lybrand 1997 maintain that the relationship between increases in federal grant aid and tuition increases particularly at fouryear public and private ihes is either weak or longer holds20 although this report does not address the relationship between federal grant aid or the pell grant specifically and increases in tuition and fees it is important to note that in the last decade the maximum pell grant award has never increased by more than 450 in given award year thereby making it unlikely that the increased amount would serve as an 17 the analysis uses data from the us department of educations digest of education statistics 2005 digest table 312 18 other research has examined the relationship between tax credits and tuition and fee increases and state student aid and tuition and fee increases for additional information see the

available at httpncesedgovpubs20022002157pdf 20 in earlier research by mcpherson and schapiro keeping college affordable government and educational opportunity 1991 they found that only public institutions particularly fouryear ihes would have tuition levels that were sufficiently low enough for the institution to have an incentive to increase tuition to capture additional student aid crs9 incentive for ihes to respond by raising their tuition and fees21 it is beyond the scope of this report to consider how if at all ihes would change tuition and fees in response to changes in the pell grant award however some analyses presented in this report examine the percentage of tuition and fees covered by the pell grant under changed award rules these analyses assume tuition and fees levels for 20082009 would increase in manner that is consistent with recent annual increases and that there would be extra increase in tuition and fees as result of the increased pell grant award analysis of selected changes this section provides discussion and analysis of selected changes in the program award rules and the need analysis formula and how these changes might affect recipients and costs22 the changes examined are those which have received considerable legislative attention during the last few congresses the section is organized according to the following proposed changes increase the amount of the maximum appropriated pell grant award including examining its coverage of tuition and fees increase the minimum pell grant award amount and eliminate the bump eliminate the tuition sensitivity provision and increase the maximum award amount and increase the autozero efc income threshold the section concludes with an analysis that combines some of the provisions according to their ability to increase the pell grants coverage of tuition and fees and tfrb eliminate provisions that disparately affect lowincome students extend the grant to more lowincome students and control for significant recipient changes and cost increases all of the results are presented by family income status23 increasing the maximum appropriated pell grant award as previously mentioned increasing the maximum appropriated pell grant award would provide lowincome students with additional aid and strengthen the grants coverage of tuition and fees and tfrb but would also increase the programs 21

federal student assistance on college tuition levels 1997 by coopers and lybrand llp 22 all of the cost estimates included in this report also include the 5 administrative fee that participating ihes receive for each enrolled pell grant recipient 23 the format of the family income groups generated by the pell model are preestablished and as result constrain the possible income groupings crs10 costs however raising the maximum award is one of the few ways to enhance the grants coverage of tuition and fees and tfrb to demonstrate the impact of increasing the maximum award this section provides an analysis of the estimated impact of raising the maximum award from 4310 to 4600 5100 and 580024 in addition to providing estimates for the changes in costs and recipients by family income changes to the grants coverage of tuition and fees and tfrb are also considered recipients as previously noted the pell grant award is generally determined by subtracting recipients efc from the appropriated maximum award as the amount of the maximum award increases recipients with larger efcs those with more available income and assets become newly eligible for the program for example under current law if recipient has an efc of 4400 he or she would not be eligible for pell grant award 4310440090 however if the maximum award were increased to 4600 this same recipient would qualify for the minimum grant award of 400 46004400200 bumped up to 400 the change in the recipient composition under selected award increases is illustrated in table 1 the table shows that as the maximum award increases the percentage of recipients with higher family incomes would also slightly increase over current law estimates conversely the percentage of recipients with lower family incomes would slightly decrease under each increase in the maximum award specifically under each of the selected increases in the maximum pell grant award the percentage of recipients with family incomes of 40000 or less would likely decrease by small percentage whereas recipients with family incomes over 40000 would experience slight increase however as also shown in table 1 the actual change in the number of recipients in each of the income groups would be relatively small this is particularly true for recipients with family incomes of less than 30000 the change in the composition that is illustrated in table 1 for this group is primarily due to the fact that more individuals with larger incomes are brought into the program thereby changing the overall composition of the recipient population as the maximum award increases more recipients with higher family incomes would likely become newly eligible and assume greater percentage of the recipient population than they would have under current law although under each increase in the maximum award recipients with family incomes above 40000 would not comprise more than 15 of the total pell grant recipient population it should be noted that generally increasing the maximum award does not significantly expand the number of eligible recipients in the lowest income groups however it usually provides these recipients with larger pell grant awards which increases the grants coverage of tuition and fees and tfrb for recipients in these groups 24 these amounts were selected in light of recent legislative proposals to increase the maximum award to the specified amounts specifically the presidents fy2008 budget requests that the maximum award be increased to 4600 and hres 81 proposes 5100 the third amount 5800 was selected because it is the most recent authorized maximum grant award crs11 table 1 estimated impact of selected increases in the maximum pell grant award on pell grant recipients by family income award year 20082009

100 source crs estimates using the pell grant estimation model from the us department of educations budget service program costs it should be noted that increasing the maximum pell grant award by various amounts would produce minimal change in the total recipient composition although increasing the maximum award would increase program costs which could be substantial depending upon the amount of the maximum award for example increasing the maximum award by 290 to 4600 would increase program costs for award year 20082009 by an estimated 117 billion over the current law estimates moreover if the maximum award were increased to the most recent authorized maximum of 5800 the program costs would increase to an estimated 200 billion 60 billion increase over current law as previously mentioned 100 increase in the maximum appropriated pell grant award in general would increase program costs by approximately 400 million similar to what would occur for the recipient composition under selected increases in the maximum award the percentage share of aid for recipients with lower family incomes would slightly decline under each increase in the maximum award for example as illustrated in table 2 the percentage of aid available for recipients with family income of 10000 or less would decline from little more than 33 under current law 334 to just above 31 313 if the maximum crs12 award were increased to 5800 similar patterns are illustrated for recipients with family incomes between 10001 and 30000 however the percentage share of aid for individuals with family incomes above 30000 would slightly increase under each change in the maximum award as illustrated by table 2 recipients with family incomes between 40001 and 50000 would experience the largest percentage change in the amount of aid available under each individual increase and between current law and maximum award of 5800 it is important to note that although the percentage of aid available to recipients with family incomes above 30000 would increase rather than decrease as it would for individuals with family income of less than 30000 individuals with lower family incomes would continue to receive the largest amount of aid awarded under each increase in the maximum award the percentage growth in the amount of aid available for individuals with higher family incomes versus the decline for individuals with lower family incomes is directly related to increasing the maximum award without changing other provisions of the program such as increasing the minimum award as previously noted if the maximum award were increased individuals with higher family incomes would either become newly eligible for the program or they would receive an increased award both of which increase the amount of aid available for higher income groups whereas if the maximum award were increased the number of recipients with lower incomes would not substantially change they would generally receive larger amounts of aid table 2 demonstrates that increasing the maximum grant would provide additional aid for recipients across all income groups however recipients with family incomes above 30000 would experience small increase in the percentage of total aid available under each increase crs13 table 2 estimated amount of pell grant aid to recipients by family income and selected increases in the maximum appropriated pell

department of educations budget service increasing the pell grants coverage of tuition and fees the purchasing power of the pell grant at public ihes has diminished over the last few decades with notable decline at fouryear institutions during the last 15 years combining the rapid increase in college prices with the intermittent and relatively low increases in the amount of the maximum pell grant award the percentage of tuition and fees and tfrb covered by the pell grant has eroded from high of 244 at fouryear public ihes and 507 twoyear public ihes in fy1979 to low of 69 and 178 respectively in fy2006 however as previously mentioned increasing the amount of the maximum pell grant award is the best way to increase pells coverage of tuition and fees and tfrb this section analyzes pells coverage of college costs using only the estimated average tuition and fees and the estimated average tuition fees room and board25 with the current maximum 25 for information regarding how the tuition and fees and tfrb estimates were produced for award year 20082009 refer to the data and methodology section crs14 award of 4310 and the selected maximum award amounts used in the preceding analysis for award year 2008200926 fouryear institutions the analysis shown in table 3 examines the relationship of the maximum appropriated pell grant award to instate tuition and fees and tfrb for students at public ihes as illustrated the current appropriated maximum award would cover approximately 66 of the estimated average tuition and fees at public fouryear institutions and slightly more than 30 of tfrb for award year 20082009 increasing the maximum award to 4600 would increase its coverage to nearly 71 of tuition and fees and 32 of tfrb if the amount of the maximum award were increased by approximately 800 to 5100 the maximum awards coverage of the average tuition and fees would increase to nearly 79 and its coverage of tfrb would increase to about 36 table 3 also illustrates that the grant would need to be increased to the amount of the most recent authorized grant award of 5800 in order for it to cover 40 of tfrb for the grant to cover 50 of tfrb the maximum award would need to be increased to approximately 7100 twoyear institutions the pell grants coverage at twoyear public institutions is considerably more substantial than at fouryear public institutions as shown in table 3 the current appropriated maximum award would cover nearly 200 of the estimated average tuition and fees at twoyear ihes during award year 20082009 furthermore as illustrated that same maximum award would cover nearly 60 of the average tfrb at twoyear ihes if the maximum award were increased to 5100 it would cover more than 230 of the average tuition and fees

estimated amount of coverage presented would be lower if ihes raised their tuition and fees or tfrb to capture increases in grant aid see earlier section titled data and methodology for more information crs15 increasing the minimum pell grant award as mentioned previously current statute specifies that the minimum pell grant award person can receive is 400 even if the individual qualifies for an award between 200 and 399 also known as the bump currently the bump enables individuals who have efcs between 3911 and 4110 to receive the same award as recipient with an efc of 3910 which increases the number of award recipients and adds to the program costs if the 400 minimum pell grant award were set as true minimum award meaning recipient had to qualify for 400 pell grant award to receive this amount the number of recipients would be reduced which in turn would reduce program costs furthermore if the amount of the minimum award were increased to higher amount and the bump were eliminated this would also serve to further reduce program costs and the number of pell grant recipients because those recipients whose current pell grant award falls below the new minimum would lose eligibility this section of the report analyzes the impact of eliminating the bump and increasing the minimum award to 500 750 and 185027 recipients table 4 illustrates that change in the minimum pell grant award would likely alter the distribution of recipients by family income unlike the outcome when the maximum award is increased individuals in the lowest income groups would comprise greater share rather than smaller share of all recipients when the amount of the minimum award is increased for example as demonstrated in table 4 recipients in the lowest income group 10000 or less represent just over 28 of all recipients under current law but they would comprise approximately 30 if the minimum award were increased to 750 and exactly 13rd of all recipients if the minimum were increased to 1850 however reverse pattern would result for recipients with higher family incomes recipients in the highest income group over 70000 would decrease from approximately 03 of all recipients under current law to 01 if the minimum award were increased to 1850 it should be noted that in addition to changing the distribution of pell grant recipients by family income the overall number of recipients would be reduced as well for example if the 400 minimum pell grant award were set as true minimum award approximately 76000 students would lose eligibility for pell grant award if the amount of the minimum grant award were increased to 500 approximately 2 or 122500 of those recipients who are eligible under current law would lose eligibility furthermore if the minimum award were increased to 1850 the amount of the average instate tuition and fees at twoyear public ihe the 27 both 750 and 1850 were selected for this analysis because these amounts are closest to the lowest instate tuition and fees and the average instate tuition and fees for twoyear public ihes reported in the digest of education statistics 2005 table 313 most recent data available specifically 750 represents the amount closest to the lowest instate tuition and fee amount reported 721 california and 1850 is closest to the amount of the average tuition and fees 1847 at all twoyear public ihes for the 20042005 academic year reported in the digest the amount of 500 was chosen because it is 100 increase over the current minimum it should be noted that the instate tuition and fee data are for 20042005 unlike the other tuition and fee data used in this report these data were not inflated to provide projected estimate for 20082009 crs16 number of recipients would be reduced by nearly 17 for an estimated total loss of 895000 recipients generally any increase in the minimum pell grant award will reduce the number of recipients however as mentioned an increase in the minimum award would only affect those current recipients with the smallest grants those recipients whose current pell grant award falls below the new minimum lose eligibility while those with larger grants are unaffected further as shown in table 4 raising the minimum grant by more substantial amounts would lead to greater reductions in the number of recipients again it should be noted that the loss of eligibility would disproportionately affect higherincome recipients rather than recipients in the lowest income group finally it is important to note that the number of recipients in the lower income groups would also not increase but they would comprise larger share of all recipients as result of the attrition of recipients in higher income groups this approach combined with an increase in the maximum award enables more pell grant aid to be targeted to lowincome recipients without significantly increasing the program costs table 4 percentage distribution of pell grant recipients by family income under

number of recipients increasing the minimum award amount and eliminating the bump would also reduce program costs specifically as shown in table 5 simply setting 400 as the minimum grant amount would reduce program costs by approximately 252 million annually to 140 billion however as also illustrated by table 5 the minimum award would need to be increased to either 750 or 1850 to produce substantial reduction in program costs increasing the minimum award to 750 or 1850 would decrease program costs by approximately 104 million and 797 million respectively as demonstrated selected increases in the minimum pell grant award have greater impact in percentage terms on the number of recipients than on the total costs of the program this general pattern is not surprising because increasing the minimum award eliminates all of the students who currently receive the minimum award for example establishing true 400 minimum bump decreases program costs by at most 400 per recipient losing eligibility however raising the minimum grant by more substantial amounts would lead to proportionately greater reductions in program costs because more recipients whose awards fall below the raised minimum would lose eligibility although more recipients would be affected and would lose larger grants crs18 table 5 estimated change in pell grant program costs under selected changes in the

tuition sensitivity this section analyzes the estimated impact of eliminating the tuition sensitivity provision from the program award rules and increasing the maximum award to 4600 5100 and 5800 tuition sensitivity reduces the amount of the pell grant award for lowincome students who also attend lowcost ihes the tuition sensitivity rule was intended to protect base amount of the pell grant maximum award and make portion of increases above that base 2700 sensitive to tuition as implemented by ed tuition sensitivity reduces the pell grant award received by small number of lowincome students attending institutions with very low tuition and fee charges recipients if the tuition sensitivity provision were eliminated there would be change in the number of recipients over the estimated number of recipients eligible for the current appropriated maximum award eliminating this provision simply removes one of the ways awards are calculated it would not affect recipients eligibility for pell grant award that is the number of recipients would not be affected by the elimination of the tuition sensitivity provision even if the amount of the maximum appropriated grant award were increased28 program costs eliminating the tuition sensitivity provision would slightly increase the programs costs because the students who attend lowcost ihes would longer have their award capped as result of their expected family contribution efc and the cost of attendance coa of the institution they attend removing the tuition sensitivity provision would enable these students to receive higher grant amounts that could be used for other qualified education expenses such as room and board or books and supplies if the tuition sensitivity provision were eliminated and the maximum award were increased program costs would increase by small amount over the cost of increasing the maximum award alone regardless of the amount of the maximum award for example under current law if the provision were dropped it would add an additional 103 million to the program costs for total program cost of 1402 billion increasing the maximum grant award by 290 to 4600 and dropping the tuition sensitivity provision would add an additional 119 billion to the current law estimates for total program costs of 152 billion the estimated costs associated with eliminating the tuition sensitivity provision and increasing the maximum award to 5100 are 172 million if the maximum award were increased to 5800 and the tuition sensitivity provision were eliminated program costs would be approximately 201 billion approximately 94 million more than solely increasing the maximum award to 5800 it is important to note that in each of these scenarios the increase in program costs are primarily attributable to also increasing the maximum pell grant award the impact of the tuition sensitivity rule in fy2007 may be felt by an estimated 96000 students whose pell grant awards are estimated to be reduced by an 28 see table 1 for the estimated number of grant recipients at each maximum grant award level crs20 aggregate amount of slightly more than 104 million the estimated average loss per student in pell assistance may be about 10829 increasing the autozero efc income threshold as previously mentioned the automaticzero expected family contribution autozero efc provision automatically sets recipients efc to 0 which generally means that an individual would qualify for the maximum pell grant award30 to qualify for autozero efc recipient must have an adjusted gross income of 20000 or less and satisfy other conditions previously discussed this section analyzes the estimated impact on the recipients and program costs if the income eligibility threshold for autozero efc were increased to 25000 and 3000031 thereby allowing additional lowincome recipients to possibly qualify for larger pell grant award automatically32 recipients the analysis suggests that if the autozero efc income threshold were raised from 20000 to 25000 and the maximum appropriated pell grant award remained at 4310 the overall number of recipients would increase slightly by approximately 3400 recipients for an estimated total of 54 million recipients the analysis indicates that more than 60 2100 out of 3400 of the overall recipient growth would occur for individuals with family incomes between 20001 to 30000 the results would be similar if the income threshold were increased to 30000 however the estimated number of recipients would increase by approximately 7400 over the current law estimates in addition an estimated 3200 of these recipients would have family incomes between 20001 and 30000 432 overall increasing the income eligibility threshold for autozero efc from 20000 to either 25000 or 30000 would have minimal effect on the estimated number of new pell grant recipients however it is important to note that in both cases if the income threshold were increased to 25000 or 30000 all eligible 29 for additional information about the tuition sensitivity provision see crs report rl31668 federal pell grant program of the higher education act background and reauthorization by charmaine mercer 30 student would also have to be enrolled fulltime in an eligible program to receive the maximum pell grant award otherwise the amount of the award is reduced according to the recipients attendance status ie halftime less than halftime etc 31 these amounts were selected because they represent approximately 125 and 150 of the federal poverty guidelines for family of four 20650 for 2007 for additional information about the federal poverty guidelines see httpaspehhsgovpoverty 07povertyshtml 32 it should be noted that there are numerous changes that could be made to the need analysis formula including increasing the income eligibility threshold for autozero efc that could alter recipients efc and possibly hisher pell grant award as well this particular adjustment is examined because it is commonly proposed for additional information about the other elements of the need analysis formula see crs report rl33266 federal student aid need analysis system background description and legislative action by charmaine mercer crs21 recipients with an agi at or below the specified autozero income threshold would receive the maximum appropriated pell grant award33 program costs if the income threshold for autozero efc were increased thereby allowing more students to receive the maximum appropriated award it follows that the program costs would increase as well specifically if the income threshold were changed to 25000 and the maximum award remained at 4310 it would add approximately 142 million to the program costs for an estimated total program cost of 141 billion if the income threshold were changed to 25000 and the maximum award were increased to 4600 the program costs would grow to an estimated 153 billion 94 increase over the current law estimates furthermore if the income threshold were increased to 25000 and the maximum award were increased to 5100 program costs would increase by nearly 24 to 173 billion increasing the income eligibility threshold to 30000 would further increase program costs specifically if the income threshold were increased to 30000 and the maximum award remained 4310 program costs would increase by 349 million for total of 144 billion if the maximum award were increased to 4600 and the autozero income threshold were increased to 30000 program costs would increase by nearly 11 to an estimated 155 billion program costs would increase by an estimated 35 billion or 25 increase over the estimated current law program costs if the autozero efc income threshold were raised to 30000 and the maximum award were increased to 5100 thus increasing the income threshold for autozero efc to 25000 or 30000 would increase the amount of the pell grant award for small group of lower income recipients and the cost of changing the eligibility threshold would be relatively minimal as well if congress were to increase the maximum pell grant award simultaneously significant amount of the cost increase would be due to increasing the amount of the maximum pell grant award estimated impact of selected combined changes this section combines selected provisions from each of the previously discussed analyses to determine if it is possible to increase the pell grants coverage of tuition and fees and tfrb increase the minimum award amount and eliminate the bump remove the tuition sensitivity provision which disparately affects lowincome students and increase the autozero efc income threshold to extend the maximum award to more lowincome students while also not significantly changing the recipient composition or program costs34 two packages have been constructed to 33 as previously discussed the results are presented by family income not agi which is usually less than or equal to family income thus it is possible for recipients with higher family incomes to also have an agi of 25000 or less and as result benefit from auto zero efc 34 the analysis does not include the estimated effects of 5800 maximum pell grant award because the estimated program costs for solely increasing the maximum award continued crs22 produce different estimates for recipients and costs based on changes to selected provisions and increases in the maximum award the packages are provided to illustrate the estimated effects of combining selected provisions and in light of recent legislative proposals such as hr 2669 the college cost reduction act of 2007 and s 1642 higher education amendments of 2007 both of which combine several award rule and need analysis changes it is important to note that the estimated recipient and program cost increases for each option presented are largely driven by the increase in the maximum appropriated pell grant award as demonstrated in the analysis shown earlier increasing the maximum award significantly increases program costs and slightly alters the recipient composition depending on the amount of the increase the other changes eliminating the tuition sensitivity provision and increasing income eligibility for autozero efc are lot more limited in their scope meaning they would affect relatively few recipients and would not substantially increase the program costs increasing the minimum grant award and eliminating the bump would actually reduce the number of recipients and program costs the elements of each of the two packages are described in the following sections package one package one maintains the current appropriated maximum of 4310 and changes other less costly provisions specifically package one presents two options option which is most similar to current law increases the income eligibility threshold for autozero efc from 20000 to 30000 and eliminates the tuition sensitivity provision option b includes these two changes as well but also increases the minimum award amount from 400 to 500 and removes the bump as demonstrated earlier implementing these changes would have minimal impact upon program costs and the recipient composition more specifically increasing the income eligibility for autozero efc and removing the tuition sensitivity provision would add fewer than 10000 new recipients and increase program cost by approximately 360 million less than the amount to increase the maximum award by 100 approximately 400 million for award year 20082009 furthermore increasing the minimum award to 500 and eliminating the bump would reduce the number of recipients by approximately 122000 recipients and reduce program costs by 42 million thereby offsetting some of the cost associated with the other two provisions as illustrated in table 6 the changes included in option and option b would have minimal impact upon the recipient composition or program costs specifically option would add an estimated 7000 new recipients to the program and increase program costs by slightly less than 350 million over the current law estimates further option b would reduce the number of recipients by approximately 110000 and increase program costs by about 309 million over current law estimates the results shown in table 6 also illustrate that under both scenarios the distribution of recipients by family income would not substantially change from current law in fact recipients in the lowest family income groups less 34 continued approximately 61 billion do not permit the other provisions to be changed while also not significantly increasing the number of recipients or the program costs crs23 than 50000 would either retain the same percentage share as they do under current law or experience slight increase the changes in the percentage of aid available under both option and b would slightly differ from current law although the amount of aid available for each income group would remain about the same as previously mentioned these results are largely attributable to the fact that the selected changes increasing income eligibility for autozero efc eliminating tuition sensitivity and increasing the minimum grant award and eliminating the bump are relatively inexpensive to implement and are primarily targeted to individuals with the greatest need crs24 table 6 estimated impact of program and

estimates using the pell grant estimation model from the us department of educations budget service crs25 package two package two includes four options options b c and d options and b of package 2 are identical to option of package 1 except that the maximum award amounts are 4600 and 5100 respectively similarly options c and d are the same as option b of package 1 except that the maximum award amounts are 4600 and 5100 respectively as previously mentioned increasing the amount of the maximum award significantly increases program cost thus the changes presented in package 2 will be largely driven by the change in the maximum award as illustrated in table 7 the selected provisions of options b and d would each add new recipients to the estimated number of recipients under current law options b and d would both increase the number of pell grant recipients to approximately 55 million recipients conversely option c would slightly reduce the number of pell grant recipients from the estimated number under current law overall under each of the options the distribution of recipients by family income would not substantially change from current law recipients with higher family incomes would experience small percentage increase under most of the options program costs would increase over current law estimates under each option as well options b and d are the most expensive of all of the options both would cost an estimated 176 billion which is primarily due to the large increase in the maximum pell grant award which also increases the number of new recipients option c is the least expensive of the four options with price tag of 155 billion it would increase program costs by nearly 15 billion over current law however because of the increased minimum award and elimination of the bump it would also eliminate an estimated 6000 recipients from the program similarly option would also increase program costs by approximately 15 billion but it would add 84000 new

estimates using the pell grant estimation model from the us department of educations budget service crs27 conclusion there are several basic tenets that are relevant to consideration of changes to the pell grant programs award rules andor the need analysis formula maximum grant award increasing the maximum pell grant award is the primary way to increase the amount of aid received by all recipients increases in the maximum award provide additional aid for existing recipients and brings in newly eligible recipients with higher family incomes thus providing increased aid amounts for everyone however increases in the maximum award are also generally very costly every 100 increase in the maximum grant award would increase the program costs by approximately 400 million minimum grant award increasing the minimum award and eliminating the bump allows for greater targeting of pell grants to lower income recipients as mentioned raising the minimum grant amount and eliminating the bump generally reduces the number of recipients who have less need more available income and assets an increase of the minimum award can also serve to reduce program costs or if combined with an increase in the maximum award it can help offset the costs associated with the increase in the maximum however the minimum award would need to be increased to at least 750 and eliminate the bump to realize substantive savings tuition sensitivity eliminating the tuition sensitivity provision is very inexpensive provision to implement and would affect small number of very lowincome recipients as mentioned less than 100000 recipients would be affected by the removal of this provision and they would have their awards increased by approximately 100 autozero efc increasing the income eligibility threshold for autozero efc to either 25000 or 30000 would only affect small group of lowincome recipients as the analyses demonstrated increasing the income threshold to 25000 would add 3400 new recipients and increasing it to 30000 would add approximately 7400 new recipients more importantly increasing the income threshold would enable these recipients to receive the maximum pell grant award of 4310 depending upon their enrollment status in addition to these basic tenets the findings presented in this report suggest it is possible to increase the pell grants coverage to at least 70 of the average tuition and fees at fouryear public institution of higher education eliminate the tuition sensitivity provision and extend the maximum pell grant award to additional low income students by increasing the autozero income threshold while also not significantly shifting the recipient composition or increasing program costs however as demonstrated to achieve these outcomes some changes would need to be made to the program award rules andor the need analysis formula under some scenarios current recipients could lose eligibility while in others new recipients would be ushered into the program and in all cases program costs would increase as the congress prepares to reauthorize the higher education act including the pell crs28 grant program it is likely that questions pertaining to the possible tradeoffs that accompany selected changes will be discussed among some of the tradeoffs to what extent should federal grant aid be primarily if not exclusively provided to help make college affordable for low income students should the pell grant award both the maximum and the minimum awards be of sufficient size to cover the average tuition and fee amount at twoyear or fouryear public ihe what about private ihes should the grant award be expected to cover tuition fees room and board or even the cost of attendance would it be better to provide smaller grants to greater number of students or provide fewer students with larger awards crs29 appendix pell grant estimation model this analysis uses estimates derived by crs from the pell grant estimation model which was developed and maintained by the us department of educations budget service the department of educations annual budget requests for pell grant appropriations are based on the results from the pell estimation model the models latest version u2008 december 2006 was utilized for this analysis all estimates presented in this report are for the 20082009 pell award year the pell model is sasbased model that is capable of simulating changes in the pell grant programs rules and producing estimated changes in recipients program costs and average awards among other things in addition the model provides the distribution of student awards by income level and dependency status the model produces simulated pell grant awards based on enacted or proposed policies to produce these estimates sample of applicants and recipients from recent award year are used sample data for award year 20052006 were used for the u2008 version of the model economic variables such as personal income levels and cpiu inflators which are provided by the office of management and budget are used to specify simulated changes to students financial situations and other facets of the need analysis formula further the sample is aged to project future behavior and current fafsa applicant and pell grant recipient data are used to calibrate the model the model is generally updated twice per year december and june the model contains sample data for approximately 500000 applicants these data are representative of the overall pell grant population and are weighted by income and dependency status for other versions of this document see
