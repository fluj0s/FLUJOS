localism and if the rule served some purposes while disserving others whethe r the balance of the effects argued for maintaining modifying or eliminating the rule58 in its rulemaking the commission raised two fundamental administrative issues that have potentially significant policy implications first what is the relevant standard for reviewing existing owners hip rules and second what are the advantages and disadvantages of using br ight line tests vs casebycase evaluations when reviewing proposed ownership tran sactions that would increase media concentration standard of review there has been some controversy surr ounding the standard to be used in reaching public interest dete rmination about the existing rules the dc circuit in fox television stated section 202h carries w ith it presumption in favor of repealing or modifying the ownership rules59 further in response to petitions for rehearing the dc circuit stated the statute is clear that regulation should be retained only insofar as it is necessary in not merely consonant with the public interest60 but in the same decision the dc circuit stated that the courts decision did not turn at all upon interpreting necessary in the public interest to mean more than in the public interest and dded we think it better to leave unresolvedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31925crs17 61 293 f3d 540 62 in markup of two bills introduced during the 108th congress amendments were added that would have clarified that in its peri odic review of ownership rules the fcc is authorized to reregulate as well as deregulate but neither of those bills was enacted 63 prometheus 373 f3d at 394 emphasis in originalprecisely what 202h means when it in structs the commission first to determine whether rule is necessary in the public interest but then to repeal or modify the rule if it is simply longer in the public interest61 in its june 2 2003 order the commission majority took this language to mean that the commission must overcome high burden to retain any ownership rule responding to question from senator mccain in the june 4 2003 senate commerce committee hearing thenchairman powell stated that the dc circuit interprets the act to be biased toward deregulation and added that for the commission to be in concert with that interpretation it cannot reregulate in response to question from senator dorga n commissioner abernathy stated that the dc circuits interpretation directs the commission to minimize regulation as competition develops not to regulate to maximize the number of voices at that same hearing all five commissioners and several senators agreed that it would be useful for congress to pr ovide both the court and the commission guidance on the standard to use for review ing ownership rules and on whether the act allows the commission to rere gulate broadcast ownership62 subsequently in its prometheus decision the third circuit found while we acknowledge that 202h was enacted in the context of deregulatory amendments the 1996 act to the communications act see fox i 280 f3d at 1033 sinclair 284 f3d at 159 we do not accept th at the repeal or modify in the public interest instruction must therefore operate only as oneway ratchet ie the commission can use the review process only to eliminate thenextant regulations for starters this ignores both modify and the requirement that the commission act in the public interest rather than upending the reasoned analysis requirement that under the apa ordinarily applies to an agencys decision to promulgate new regulations or modify or repeal existing regulations see state farm 463 us at 43 202h extends this requirement to the commission s decision to retain its existing regulations this interpretation avoids crabbed reading of the statute under which we would have to infer without express language that congress intended to curtail the commissions rulemaking authority to contravene traditional administrative law principles63 bright line tests and the diversity index in its june 2 2003 order the fcc revi ewed the advantages and disadvantages of implementing bright line rules that incorporate specific limits on the number

that would allow for casebycase re views that more readily take into account marketspecific or companyspecific ma rket shares and characteristics the commission chose the bright line approach in large part because it identified regulatory certainty as an important policy goal in addition to the three traditional goals of divers ity competition and localism64 the commission stated any benefit to precision of casebycas review is outweighed in our view by the harm caused by lack of regulatory cer tainty to the affected firms and to the capital markets that fund the growth and innovation in the media industry companies seeking to enter or exit the dia market or seeking to grow larger or smaller will all benefit from clear rules in making business plans and investment decisions clear structural rules permit planning of financial transactions ease application proce ssing and minimize regulatory costs65 it concluded that the adoption of bright line rules rather than casebycase analysis provides certainty to outcome s conserves resources redu ces administrative delays lowers transactions costs increases transp arency of process nd ensures consistency in decisions all of which foster capital investment in broadcasting the commission conceded that bright line rules precl ude certain amount of flexibility it is not clear how the commission would weigh the goal of regulatory certainty vis√†vis the traditional goals of diversity competiti on and localism if the former were to be in conf lict with one or more of the tter on one hand the commission stated that it would continue to have disc retion to review partic ular cases and would have an obligation to take hard look bot h at waiver requests where bright line ownership limit would proscribe particular transaction and at petitions to deny license transfer where bright line ownership limit would allow particular transaction at the same time however it suggested it would not look favorably upon some petitions bright lines provide the certainty and predictability needed for companies to make business plans and for capital market s to make investments in the growth and innovation in media markets conversely casebycase review of even belowcap mergers on diversity grounds would lead to uncertainty and undermine our efforts to encourage growth in broadcast services accordingly petitioners should not use the pet ition to deny process to relitigate the issues resolved in this proceeding66 once it determined that bright line test is preferable to casebycase review the commission created bright line tests for its media crossownership and local ownership rules by constructin g diversity index that it used as the basis forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31925crs19 67 ibid at 391481 68 these limits are discussed in the sections on the specific rules below 69 see report and order at 192 ff 70 ibid at 396setting the threshold ownership limits in its new rules67 the diversity index is intended to measure viewpoint concentration and thereby identify at risk markets where limits on media ownership should be retained it is constructed by identifying all the local media voices in market assigning diversity market share to each of those voices by first assigning different weights to each of the media categories based on an arbitron study of the sources consumers use for local news and information television 338 radio 249 newspapers 288 and internet 125 and then ssigning each media outlet within media category the same weight so that for example if there were three radio stations in market each one would be assigned market share of 83 if single entity owns more than one media outlet in market for example if it ow ns both television station and radio station then its diversity mark et share would be the sum of the two individual market shares adding up the sum of the squares of each of the diversity market shares to yield diversity index value larger diversity index value denotes great er viewpoint concentr ation less diversity of viewpoints the commission calculate d the diversity index for sample of large medium and small markets as well as the diversity index for those markets if certain mergers were allowed to occur for example television station purchasing newspaper or television station purchasing radio station to determine which markets were at risk for significant loss of diversity if particular ownership combinations were allowed it concluded that in markets with three or fewer television stations there was significant da nger of loss of viewpoint diversity if television station were allowed to combine with newspaper or radio station and therefore maintained the crossownership ba n in those markets it also concluded that certain combinations would unduly rm viewpoint diversity in markets with four to eight television sta tions and therefore set certain crossownership restrictions in those markets as well68 the commission also used the diversity index as the basis for setting its limits on local television multiple ownership69 the commission stated that its dive rsity index was inspired by the herfindahlhirschmann index hhi70 used by the department of justice and federal trade commission to identify those propos ed mergers that based on historical merger experience might have deleterious effect on competition in the affected markets and therefore merit dditional scrutiny proposed mergers that would result in markets exceeding the hhi threshold levels automatically trigger further review analogously the diversity index is inte nded to identify those markets in whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31925crs20 71 as indicated earlier although the commission maintained processes for firms that would not meet bright line test to seek waiver and for interested parties th at wanted to challenge merger that met bright line test to file petition to deny license transfer it stated that it would not look favorably upon some petitionsadditional concentration in media ownership might have deleterious effect on viewpoint diversity in the affected market the diversity index like the hhi is calculated by squaring the market shares of each market participant but there are three significant differences between these two indices and how they are applied first the hhi is calculated using the actual market shares of the providers in the market under consideration if one or more providers have large market shares the hhi is very large because that market share figure is squared in contrast the diversity index is calculated using the assumption that every provider within media category for example newspapers or tele vision stations has qual diversity market share thus in the new york city market the new york times and the nowy dziennikpolish daily news are accorded the same weight the local cbs television station and the dutchess community colle ge television station in suburban new york are accorded the same weight on purely mathematical basis the assumption of equal diversity impact minimizes the sum of the squared market shares thus minimizing the size of the diversity index and providing the lowest possible estimate of viewpoint concentration second the antitrust agencies apply the hhi directly to the proposed merger on casebycase basis to determine if further scrutiny is merited the actual market shares of each of the market participants are calculated and squared and the resulting hhi is compared to threshold levels to determine if additional scrutiny is required in contrast the fcc does not in tend to apply the diversity index to any specific proposed change in media ownershi p rather it used the diversity index calculated for sample markets by assuming that each media outlet within the same media category for example television stations has the same diversity market share as the basis for setting the maximum number or combination of media outlets that any provider could own in market proposed media merger then would be approved or disa pproved based on the number r combination of media outlets the postmerger company would have in the market regardless of its actual postmerger diversity market share71 third the threshold levels of the hhi that trigger antitrust agency scrutiny were based on many years of partment of justice nd federal trade commission experience reviewing mergers and body of economic litera ture about the relationship between market structure and market conduct the fcc used those hhi trigger points as the starting point for scrutinizing viewpoint concentration but without historical record or body of litera ture demonstrating th at the same trigger points for economic concentration are pplicable to viewpoint concentration in prometheus the third circuit did not question the concept of diversity index or of bright line rules it did httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31925crs21 72 prometheus 373 f3d at 402403 73 ibid at 431 74 ibid at 405 the court found it inconsiste nt that the fcc chose not to include cable television as an alternative local news and information voice because most of that news was actually provided by the local television broadc ast stations carried on the cable systems and yet chose to include the internet as signifi cant alternative local news and information voice despite the fact that most local news and in formation found on the internet is on the websites of the local television stations and newspapers ibid at 406 75 ibid at 408 76 ibid at 411not object in principle to the commission s reliance on the department of justice and federal trade commissions antitrust formula the herfindahlhirschmann index hhi as its starting point for measuring diversity in local markets72 moreover the third circuit found that the commissions decision to retain numerical limits approach to radio station ownership regulation is rational and in the public interest73 in the case of the commissions local crossownership and local television multiple ownership rules it did not explicitly conclude that the numerical limits approach was rational and in the public interest but did frame its remand of the numerical limits adopted in terms of the specific limits chosen not of the concept of numerical limits however the third circuit found that the fccs methodology for converting the hhi to measure for diversity in local markets was irrational and inconsistent specifically the third circuit found the commissions decision to count th internet as source of viewpoint diversity while discounting cable was not rational74 the commissions decision to assign equal market shares to outlets within media type does not jibe with the commissions decision to assign relative weights to the different media type themselves about which it said we have reason to believe that all media are of equal importance order 409 see also id 445 not all voices however speak with the same volume it also negates the commissions proffered rationale for using the hhi formula in the first place to allow it to measure the actual loss of diversity from consolidation by taking into account the actual diversity importance of the merging parties something it could not do with simple voices test id 39675 although the commission is entitled to deference in deciding where to draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable increases in markets diversity index scores we do not affirm the seemingly inconsistent manner in which the line was drawn the crossmedia limits llow some combinations where the increases in diversity index scores were generally higher than for other combinations that were not allowed76httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31925crs22 77 ibid at 435 78 frank ahrens powell calls rejec tion of media rules disappointment washington post june 29 2004 at pp e1 and e5in remanding the rules the court s given the commission the opportunity to justify or modify its approach to setting numerical limits77 thenchairman powell reportedly stated in an interview after the court decision was released it may not be possible to linedraw part of says maybe the best answer is to evaluate on casebycase basis the commission may end up getting more pushed in that direction78 given that the third circuit did not challe nge the concept of using diversity index to set specific numerical limits however it is not apparent that the third circuit has indicated any preference for casebycase pproach rather than bright line rule the task of implementing bright line rules that can withstand court review may be challenging but that may have more to do with the inherent complexity and ambiguity of measuring viewpoint dive rsity consistently across heterogeneous geographic markets than in constraints placed by the courts as indicated above the third circuit identified three problems with the existing rules 1 the inconsistent treatment of cable television and the internet 2 the assignment of equal weight to all media outlets within media category rather than actual market shares and 3 allowing some combinations where the increases in diversity index scores were generally higher than for other combinati ons that were not allowed in remand the commission should be able to modify its dive rsity index to treat cable television and the internet the same or to provide empi rical evidence for why they should be treated differently similarly the commission should be able to construct diversity index using actual market share data though admitte dly that would be more difficult task and might generate challenges to the mark et share figures it may prove to be difficult however to construct bright line media ownership limits in terms of the specific number of media outlets that single entity could own in market that all are based on consistent application of the diversity index the third circuits third concern the commission potentially could get around this problem in several ways though these might be construed as cas ebycase solutions for example the commission could set its bright line rules in terms of specific diversity index levels prohibiting any consolidation that would result in diversity index that exceeded particular level rather than using the diversity index to identify media ownership levels that are bright lines alternatively the commission could use the diversity index to identify media ownership limits that are bright lines in the sense that they trigger further scrutiny but also explicitly identify further criteria that would be used to evaluate proposed consolidations that yi eld diversity index levels within range of potential concern for example it might construct multipart rule that would allow all proposed license transfers that would result in marketwide diversity index below 1000 and an increase in the di versity index of less than 200 triggerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31925crs23 79 the diversity index

subsequently affirmed the 35 cap as part of th 1998 biennial review of media ownership rules91 this decision was challe nged by several broadcast networks and in 2002 the dc circuit in fox stations remanded the rule to the commission on the grounds that the commission had failed to provide justification for the 35 level92 in its june 2 2003 order the commissi on modified its national television ownership rule93 by increasing the maximum aggregate national audience reach of an entity owning multiple television stations from 35 to 45 in addition to increasing the cap the commission retained the uhf discount this discount initially was implemented b ecause uhf signals tend to have smaller geographic reach than and are of inferior quality to vhf signals the commission explicitly retained the uhf discount finding that uhf stations continue to face technical and market disadvantage94 in the report and order the commission determined that national television ownership rule is not relevant to its co mpetition goal in the three relevant economic markets it investigated the national television advertising market the national program acquisition market and th local video delivery

to local needs and interests th an network owned and operated stations for example they are more likely to preempt network programming when nonnetwork programming of special local interest such as local sports event is available or when network programming does not meet community standards if there are fewer independently owned and operated affiliates they will be under much greater pressu re from the networks not to pre empt network programming even if programming of special local interest is availablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31925crs27 100 report and order at 501 101 the dissenting fcc commissioners stated that the commissions new crossownership and television ownership rules do not provide 50 discount for uhf stations and that this inconsistent weighting of uhf in different rules

signals unless they also carried the integrated companys cable networks if thes broadcast networks could own and operate additional local broadcast stations they could extend this practice to those stations in its report and order the commission did not provide quantitative analysis in support of adoption of the 45 cap it explained that the available data demonstrated difference in behavior between the two networks that reach just under 40 of national levision households and the othe r networks that reach fewer than 35 of national tele vision households at the same time the commission found that preserving balance of power betw een the broadcast television networks and their affiliates serves local needs by ensuring that affiliates can play meaningful role in selecting programming suitable for their communities the 45 cap thus represented the balancing of competing interests100 at the june 4 2003 senate commerce committee hearing chairman powell reflected that while the commission believes its order pr ovides justification for the 45 cap given the very high standard set by the court he coul d not have total confidence the commissions rule would survive judicial review and th at if congress believed specific percentage cap is inviolate it should codify that percentage in the act some parties have called for elimination of the uhf discount they claim that the uhf discount in effect raises the current cap to as high as 70 and if retained while the cap was increased to 45 would raise the effective cap to as high as 90101 the provision in the balanced budget

certain conditions are not met when the digital transition is complete both vhf and uhf stations will have the same transmission capabilities and therefore uhf stations will longer be at disadva ntage with respect to audience reach the commissions decision t ook this into account by ruling that when the transition to digital television is complete the uhf di scount would be eliminated for the stations owned by the four larg est broadcast networks102 it chose to retain the uhf discount in other situations because it believes the discount could fo ster creation of additional broadcast

small markets to exploit economies of scalethese numerical limits are applied to geographic markets that are defined according to arbitron rating boundaries whic h are based on market factors rather

totals as long as 1 the brokering entity owns or has an attributable interest in one or more stations in the local market and 2 the joint advertising sales amount to more than 15 of the brokered

transmitter radio stations transmitters and principal community contours though concentrated to some extent in urbanized ar eas are geographically dispersed geographic market defined by overlapping contours can re sult in series of contours overlapping one another to create very extended market sort of daisy chain effect thus the contours of stations in fargo overlapped with stations in several directions outside fargo all in an extended chain resulting in such large numbe r of stations being included in the market that single entity was allowed to own 6 of them all located in close proximity to one another rather than being spread across th large geographic market created by the overlapping contour methodologyit eliminated its policy of flagging those radio station transactions that based on an initial analysis by the staff would result in one entity controlling 50 or more of the radio advertising revenues in the relevant arbitron radio market or two entities controlling 70 or more of such advertising revenues b conducting further competitive review of the flagged transaction and c inviting interested parties to file comments addressing the competitive impact of the proposed merger135 in the fccs rulemaking proceeding the proponents of retaining the old ownership limits as is or eliminating them entirely argued that the rule and the resultant consolidation in the industry had turned around the industry financially from one in which more than half the radi stations were losing money to one that is very profitable and attracting an increas ing share of the total advertising market they also claimed that the number of program formats has increased the proponents of modifying the rule to tighten ownership limits claimed that the rule had led to both horizontal and ver tical consolidation fo r example ownership of concert promotion companies concert venues that has resulted in anticompetitive behavior by the large vertically integrated companies that has reduced competition in the radio advertising music and concert markets reduced program format diversity and reduced local programming the dissenting fcc commissioners claimed that elimination of the 5070 sc reen takes away the opportunity for the commission to undertake casebycase reviews of mergers that though they meet the bright line test do not meet market scr een that is good predictor of potential market power in the advertising market in its rulemaking proceeding the commission found the overlapping signal contour methodology used to define radi markets had yielde d several anomalous situations with very expansive geographic market definitions that included distant stations and therefore allowed concentra tion to occur in more narrowly but also more accurately defined markets fo r example under the market definition methodology single entity was able to own all 6 of the comme rcial radio stations in fargo north dakota because long chain of rural stations with overlapping signal

fcc eliminated the newspaperbroadcast crossow nership ban and the television radio crossownership ban the commission determined that neither the newspaperbroadcast prohibition nor the televisionradio crossownership limitations could be justified for large markets in light of the abundance of s ources that citizens rely on for news155 it also found that the old rules did not promote competition because radio television and newspapers generally compete in different economic markets156 moreover the fcc found that greater participa tion by newspaper publishers in the television and radio business would improve the quality and quantity of news available to the public157 the commission therefore replaced the old rules with the new cross media limits intended to protect viewpoint diversity by ensuring that company or group of companies can control an inordinate share of media outlets in local market the commission developed diversity index to measure the availability of key media outlets in markets of various sizes it concluded that there were three tiers of markets in terms of viewpoint diversity concen tration each warranting different regulatory treatment158 in the tier of smallest markets three or fewer television stations the fcc found that key outlets were sufficiently limited that any cross ownership among the three leading outlets for local news broadcast television radio and ne wspapers would harm diversity viewpoint in the mediumsized tier four to eight television stations markets were found to be less concentrat ed today than in the smallest markets and thus certain media outlet combinations could safely occur without harming viewpoint diversity certain other combinations would threaten vi ewpoint diversity and are thus prohibited in the largest tier of markets nine or more television stations the fcc concluded that the larg number of media outlets in combination with ownership limits for local television and radio were more than sufficient to protect viewpoint diversity the arguments of proponents of re taining the old rules included any crossownership reduces the number of independent voices in the community especially in small markets with only small number of voiceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31925crs42 159 statement of commissioner jonathan s adelstein dissenting fcc news release june 2 2003 available at

commissioner adelstein stated that he c ould have supported m odification of the crossownership rules if the new rule d employed diversity index applied on casebycase basis by measuring the actua l diversity impact of individual media voices in the market under scrutiny159 but the commission majority rejected such casebycase merger review because it would add uncertainty in the market and would impose an administrative burden on the commission these crossownership rules represent situation where economic and diversity goals can be in strong conflict on one hand it is in small markets where resources are limited that individual broadcasters are most likely to lack the wherewithal to produce local news programming on their own so that crossownership might allow for broadcast news voice that would not otherwise exist on the other hand it is exactly in these small markets that there are very few voices to begin with so that crossownership might reduce what little diversity already exists many aspects of the fccs 2003 cross dia ownership rule were appealed and while the third circuit upheld the ceptual basis for the rule it remanded and extended the stay of the rule becaus of it found the commission did not provide reasoned analysis to support the specific cross media limits that it chose specifically in its prometheus decision the third circuit found that the commissions decision not to retain ban on newspaper broadcast crossowne rship is justified160 and the commissions decision to retain some limits on common ownership of differenttype media outlets was

commissions brig ht line rules 1 the inconsistent treatment of cable television and the internet 2 the assignment of equal weight to all media outlets within media category rather than actual market shares and 3 allowing some combinations where the increases in diversity index scores were generally higher than for other comb inations that were not allowed transferability of ownership if the stay is lifted and the fccs ne w radio ownership rules are implemented it may result in number of situations where current ownership arrangements exceed ownership limits the fcc grandfathered owners of those clusters but generally prohibited the sale of such abovecap clusters th fcc made limited exception to permit sales of grandfathered combinations to small businesses as defined in the report and order in taking this action the fcc sought to respect the reasonable expectations of parties that lawfully purchased groups of local radio stations that today through redefined markets now exceed the applicable caps the fcc also attempted to promote compe tition by permitting station owne rs to retain any above cap local radio stations but not transfer them intact unless there is compelling public policy justification to do so th fcc found two such justifications 1 avoiding undue hardships to cluster owne rs that are small businesses and 2 promoting the entry into the broadcasting business by small businesses many of which are minority or femaleowned these transfer restrictions were appealed both by parties that claimed the transfer restrictions were an unconstitutional holding and by parties that claimed the transfers should have been restricted to socially and economically disadvantaged businesses rather than to small businesses the national association of black owned broadcasters and other critics of this commission rule complained that the rule will not foster minority or female ownership becau 1 the large radio groups are unlikely to sell their clusters as long as they receive grandfathered rights and 2 even if these clusters were placed on sale they are likely to command such high price that minority or femaleowned small businesses are unlikely to be able to obtain the financing needed to make the acquisitions the third circuit upheld the transfer rest riction set by the fcc as in the public interest163 and in rehearing explicitly allowed the fcc to

policieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31925crs45 168 rules were adopted on january 20 2000 and appeared in the federal register on february 15 2000 169 pl 10655 632 114 stat 2762 2762a111 2000 170 if an

all radio station signals create some level of interference but in most situations that interference is so limited that it does not affect receptionalso intended to foster competition divers ity and localism for example utilizing the spectrum more efficiently to create additional voices fostering the development and deployment of new tec hnologies that may provide dditional voices maintaining public interest obligations on existing broadcast licensees to foster localism and diversity of voices tax defe rrals and credits to encour age diversified ownership one part of the debate has been how the ownership rules and these other policies can work to reinforce supplement or substitute for one another two bills introduced in the 110th congress would amend the internal revenue code of 1986 with the intention of foster ing diversity of voices by promoting the diversity of ownership of telecommunica tions businesses hr 600 introduced by representative rush would subject to specific limitations defer or exclude from capital gains taxation certain sales of telecommunications businesses to economically and socially disadvantaged businesses and would create tax credit for certain telecommunications businesses that locate in designated empowerment zones hr 3003 introduced by representative rangel would defer from capital gains taxation certain sales of broadcast stations to person with qualified interest in 10 or fewer broadcast stations and would create loan guarantee program fo r qualified businesses to encourage diversity of ownershi p of telecommunications businesses policies aiming to utilize the spectrum more efficiently in order to create additional voices also can foster the policy goals of diversity localism and competition and perhaps reduce the need for ownership limits for example in january 2000 the fcc recognizing that there was broadcast spectrum going unused that could provide locally oriented programming created new low power fm radio service limited to noncommercia l operations and to max imum radiated power of 100 watts168 in response to complaints from existing broadcasters that the new low power fm stations might create harmful radio interference to the reception of existing fm stations in december 2000 congress enacted section 632 of the fy2001 district of columb ia appropriations act169 which required the fcc to impose

nab claims that satellite radio service formally called digital audio radio service or dars although created by the fcc to provide national radio programming threatens the provision of local programming on traditional broadcast radio stations because the national licensees have begun to offer local weather reports and other informational programming that compete headon with the programming of local radio broadcasters the two satellite radio providers xm and sirius claim their local programming is limited in scope and meets the needs of mobile listeners who seek weather reports and other inform ation as they travel from one location to another representative gene green s introduced hr 983 which instructs the fcc to revise its regulations to prohibit satellite radio providers from providing services that are locally differentiated or that result in programming being delivered to consumers in one geographic market that is different from the programming that is delivered to consumers in any other geographic market and to restrict satellite radio repeaters to simultaneously retransmitting the programming transmitted by satellite directly to satellite ra dio subscribers receivers prohib iting the use of those repeaters to distribute any information not also transmitted to all s ubscribers receivers the bill also instructs the fcc to complete rulemaking proceeding within 270 days to determine whether satellite radio licensees should be permitted to provide locally oriented services on nationally distributed channels taking into account 1 the impact

antitrust task force and the telecommunications subcommittee of the house energy and commerce committee held hearings to address the radio market in the united states with focus on the potential impact of an xmsirius merger in these hearings representatives of the nab testified that traditional local broadcast radio is not sufficiently close substitute to satellite radio to be able to constrain prices for satellite radio and therefore should not be considered to be in the same market173 they therefore opposed the merger as anticompetitive in cont rast in its various filings in the fccs media ownership rules the nab has argued that the ownership restrictions should be eased or eliminated because of widesp read intermodal competition for broadcast radio the transition to digital television will allow for more efficient utilization of the spectrum providing additional spectrum for public safety nd wireless broadband and also allowing broadcasters to use di gital technology to offer more programming than they can using analog technology as valuable as the uhf band is for public safety and wireless purposes it is inferior to the vhf band for the analog transmission of broadcast signals af ter the digital transition the current technological inferiority of uhf to vhf w ill longer be an issue ownership of uhf station will not bring w ith it more limited audience r each the rationale for treating uhf stations differently from vhf stations will disappear in its june 2 2004 order the fcc adopted rule to nd the uhf discount for stations owned by the four major television networks but not for other stations when the transition to digital television has been completed when that transition is completed and likely long before its completion the current uhf and vhf licensees will have the ability to multicast as many as six channels of programming over their licensed spectrum this will increase the amount and perhaps diversity of programming available though it may not result in an increase in the diversity of voices or localism congress may want to review the uhf discount and its impact on the goals of competition diversity and localism in light of the digital transition and in light of some of the po licies it develops for that tr ansition for example congress might be concerned that network comprise d entirely of uhf stations offering five

qualified local commercial and noncommercial tele vision stations the fcc has ruled that when broadcaster transmits multiple video streams cable systems are required to carry only the broadcasters primary signal not all the signals175 broadcasters claim that this ruling will undermine their ability to use multicastin g to offer additional local news and weather programming citing in particular the potentially negative impact on project by abc affiliates to use seconda ry signal to offer abc news now mix of international national and local news and on nbc weather plus nbc universals new digital 24hour national and local weather network if cable systems are not required to carry those signals176 but in its september 8 2005 report to congress on retransmission consent and exclusivity rules the fcc found that since the commissions decision to deny broadcasters the ability to assert dual and multicast mustcarry broadcasters have begun using their retransmission consent negotiations to negotiate carriage of their digital signals177 some observers have suggested that more nuanced rule on multicast must carry could help to serve the goals of dive rsity and localism and reduce the need for strict ownership limits for example policy makers might want to consider the pros and cons of granting multiple must carry rights to those broadcasters whose coverage area overlaps multiple states very frequent occurrence since state lines often follow rivers that have large population centers on either side of the river for each of the multicast channels that provides statejurisdictionspecific local coverage that is an argument in favor of multicast must carry might be that with associated local programming requirements it could foster localism178 on the other hand if local programming requirement is imposed on broa dcasters that choose to use digital technology to multicast this might artific ially incent broadcasters to choose to use their spectrum for hdtv or

large media conglomerates deny that their vertical reach has any harmful ffect on consumers or competition on november 27 2007 the fcc adopted report and order th at facilitates the use of leased access channels on cable systems by adopting more specific leased access customer service standards increasing enforcement of those standards requiring faster cable operator response times to information requests lowering leased access rates expediting the leased access complaint process and improving the discovery process related to leased access disputes181 even if the fcc were to meet the requirements of the third circuit by constructing broadcast media ownership limits based on the local market shares of the broadcasters and other media outlets there might be concern that the simple market shares do not reflect actual economic market power or diversity market power for example if locally owned standalone television station has the same ratings in local market as another local station that is ow ned and operated by media giant that also owns multiple cable networks that are shown on the cable and satellite systems serving that local market some observers would argue that the two local stations should not be accorded th same diversity market share this highlights the conflict between those who argue for casebycase analysis of allhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31925crs50

der to have an indepth picture of the impact on the specific market affected and those who argu that as soon as one gets away from bright line tests and into casebycase analysis regulatory uncertainty becomes so great that all merger activity including mergers that are clearly beneficial to consumer s may be discouraged more broadly this raises the issue of whether and how congress might craft legislation focused on media market struct ure beyond the basically horizontal media ownership rules now in effect in congressional hearings number of policies besides ownership limits have been identified that affect the goals of media competition diversity and localism182 the discussions in those hearings suggested that the ownership rules represented just subset of those existing policies that were implemented before the widespread occurrence of media consolidation and ver tical integration and might merit review for example small cable companies and consumer groups claimed that the media conglomerates that own both broadcast television stations and multiple cable networks have taken advantage of their retransmission consent rights to require cable companies to carry their full suite of cable networks in order to have access to their broadcast signals183 this may restrict diversity of voices the small cable operators called on congress to revise the retransmi ssion consent requirement to prohibit large integrated broadcasters from imposing such tying arrangements184 the media giants responded that they do make their broad cast signals available for rebroadcast transmission at standalone price and moreover it was the cable companies that originally preferred to offer cable carriage of the conglomerates cable networks rather than cash to obtain retransmission consent185 in the satellite home viewer extension and reauthorization act congress instructed the fcc to complete an inquiry and report to congress by septem ber 8 2005 regarding the impact of

to consumers186 the fcc submitted report that did not recommend any changes at this time to the statutory provisions rela ting to commission rules under consideration in this report187 this legislative policy discussion has at least implicitly assumed that the underlying supreme court rationale for g overnment regulation of broadcasting spectrum scarcity will remain as indicated earlier several broadcasting companies in seeking to appeal the prometheus decision at the supreme court challenge that rationale they claim that even if spectrum is scarce such scarcity does not restrict the diversity of voices available or the ability of nonlicensees to present their views on an alternative dium on june 13 2005 the supreme court declined to consider the appeal it is possible that broadcaste rs or other parties currently subject to broadcast regulation will use that same argument when challenging other rules if their argument were to prevail congress might have to reconsider the legal basis for many of its statutory policies and rules including those related to media ownership
