summary in an october 28 breakfast meeting with the confederacion asociaciones israelitas venezolanas caiv board of directors xxxxxxxxxxxx said he privately encouraged brazilian senators to allow venezuela to join mercosur at the same time jewish community leaders told polcouns the venezuelan governments gbrvs attacks and doubletalk constant criticism of israel growing alliance with iran and increasing limitations on freedom of speech contribute to heightened sense of vulnerability by the jewish community end summary supporting mercosur 2 c xxxxxxxxxxxx said he had spoken by phone to brazilian senator and had privately urged the brazilian senate on october 27 to allow venezuela to join mercosur believing that membership in the organization would help promote and defend human rights given the ongoing sense of threat caiv members agreed on the need for close relations with the us and other embassies as form of diplomatic protection for the jewish community media attacks since 2004 3 c xxxxxxxxxxxx said 2004 was turning point in venezuela when chavez began referring to support of certain jewish leaders for the 2002 postcoup government as justification for verbal and physical attacks against the jewish community and synagogues xxxxxxxxxxxx said antisemitic programs and articles have been regular features of governmentowned media since 2004 and international antijewish campaigns have been tailored for use domestically xxxxxxxxxxxx emphasized that the antisemitism is governmentsponsored he noted that emilio silva the author of january 20 article on the government website aporreaorg which called for violent demonstrations at the tiferet synagogue just 10 days before the synagogue was attacked is still teaching at the progovernment bolivarian university of venezuela they also noted that there are regular government media attacks on miranda state governor henrique capriles rodonski as jew despite the fact that while of jewish ancestry he is christian considered foreign not venezuelan 4 c caiv continues to be in weekly contact with senior ministry of foreign affairs official temir porras and occasionally meets with minister of foreign affairs nicolas maduro they last met with him three months ago they noted the irony of having the foreign ministry rather than the interior ministry as their designated gbrv interlocutor which emphasizes the gbrvs view of the jewish community as foreign rather than venezuelan while chavezs rhetoric once clearly differentiated criticism of israel from that of the venezuelan jewish community since 2004 they believe he has merged his antizionist views with antisemitic ones note chavez has adamantly denied that he or his government is antisemitic end note they pointed to repeated doubletalk from the gbrv caiv had cordial discussion with former gbrv official jose vicente rangel and then he published virulently antisemitic oped article the gbrv admitted that emilio silvas january 20 article on aporreaorg was antisemitic and mistake but took action against him xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that the charge of having an arms cache which was used as justification for the 2004 searches of the club hebraica has never been officially and fully resolved in spite of repeated requests by caiv court officials claim they are unable to find the necessary documents to close the case caracas 00001401 0022 of 002 venezuelas relations with israel and iran 5 c members of the caiv board said they have felt orphaned since the expulsion of the israeli ambassador and the breaking of diplomatic relations between the two countries xxxxxxxxxxxx said the ministry of foreign affairs had issued ban on visas for israeli citizens while grateful that the canadian embassy was taking on israels consular responsibilities ref c many members lamented that it was taking long time to set up the new operation note both the caiv members and the canadian deputy chief of mission have attributed the delay to the training needed by the individual israel selected to serve as its consular agent the person had previously served as receptionist at the israeli embassy xxxxxxxxxxxx said israels choice of this person was probably intended to keep israels profile low end note 6 c the caiv leadership was also very concerned about the growing relationship between iran and venezuela xxxxxxxxxxxx thinks the gbrv wants to use the treatment of the jewish community in iran as model for venezuela and there was widespread agreement among caiv leaders that president chavezs close alliance with iranian president ahmadinejad did not bode well for the venezuelan jewish community many members expressed deep concern about iranian activities in the country citing the lack of transparency at the international maiquetia airport in caracas on flights to and from iran and the suspiciously inefficient iranian factories for bicycles what are these factories really producing asked one caiv member deteriorating environment 7 c several caiv members noted the effect of the decreasing democratic space on freedom of religion xxxxxxxxxxxx said that while there was freedom of religion there was not freedom of expression when there are restrictions on freedom of speech you do not have freedom of religion he said caiv members are also concerned about the effect of the new education law ref b on the jewish day school to great extent many members of caiv agreed religious freedom cannot be separated from the general state of human rights and the horizon is dark even though the number of jews in venezuela is declining as people leave the country the threat to the community will remain one member said because of the prominence of many jews in business education and venezuelan society comment 8 c the jewish communitys quiet support for venezuelas entry into mercosur suggests that it will be better protected by having venezuela part of an alliance of states pledged to the democracy charter than by having venezuela left only to its partnership with the revolutionary alba countries this conclusion is similar to that expressed by opposition mayor of caracas antonio ledezma ref who told brazilian legislators that chavez was more dangerous isolated than if brought into an organization of democratic countries duddy
