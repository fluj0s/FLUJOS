expanded in size and in recent years have been assigned additional mandates and requirements that extend beyond their original purpose related to hiv testing to serve broader set of purposes related to deployment health and military force health protection the armys center for health promotion and preventive medicine chppm serves as executive agent in managing the dod serum repository dodsr and defense medical surveillance system dmss on behalf of the entire department as the mandate and value of these resources have grown there has not been commensurate systematic assessment of capabilities and untapped opportunities to better fulfill their missions nor to consider how these might be better positioned to meet the needs of the military of the future with these considerations in mind chppm commissioned this study conducted from july 2006 to february 2008 to examine current requirements and capabilities identify gaps and suggest strategies to improve the capabilities of these resources to meet current and potential future needs in the areas of surveillance outbreak investigation research and clinical support particularly as these relate to influenza and other infectious disease threats this report should be of particular interest to health personnel in dod especially military health leaders and planners those responsible for health surveillance across the services medical providers and health researchers it should also be of interest to the veterans health administration within the department of veterans affairs the us congress which has chartered within statute many of the functions of dodsr and dmss and potentially to civilian health researchers this research was sponsored by the army medical surveillance activity under the center for health promotion and

repository specimen storage characteristics for bloodderived specimens 95 rand draft not for open circulation ix summary the department of defense serum repository dodsr and defense medical surveillance system dmss are longstanding and vital assets to us armed forces medical surveillance the repository contains over 43 million serial bloodderived serum specimens from over 10 million military applicants and active duty and reserve service members over the course of their service careers the dmss database contains serial health data that can be linked to these specimens the army medical surveillance activity amsa manages both of these systems amsa recognized that the dodsr and dmss have grown in response to evolving military health needs but their current and full potential use have not been systematically examined mindful of this amsa asked rand to assess the dodsr and dmss to help identify ways that amsa management can make them available to meet the health needs of the current and future military as fully as possible the dodsr and the associated dmss database were originally designed for routine hiv screening purposes but in recent years they have been assigned additional requirements related to deployment health and the prevention and control of diseases relevant to the military more broadly force health protection over these years the specimen of convenience to fulfill new requirements has remained serum the liquid component of blood with specimens collected for all purposes archived in the dodsr with over 43 million serum specimens the dodsr is by far the largest serum repository in the country perhaps the world the associated dmss database allows for analyses at given period of time or over time and the ability to link such data with serum specimens creates valuable resource for military health and even the broader civilian community this report focuses on the current and potential role of the dodsr and associated dmss database to support comprehensive health surveillance referring to surveillance over the career lifetime of service member across all locations epidemiological investigation research and clinical management it describes current requirements and rand draft not for open circulation x capabilities of both systems identifies issues and gaps and assesses specific strategies to increase the capabilities of these vital surveillance resources to serve the needs of the us armed forces today and into the future we reviewed dod policy doctrine and other published documents as well as published scientific literature and we interviewed health experts inside and outside dod to help identify and assess issues and their potential solutions we also examined number of other biological specimen repositories to glean insights potentially relevant to the dodsr we constructed conceptual framework to help identify potential improvements to system elements and to organize the collection analysis and presentation of our data related to these potential improvements figure s1 rand draft not for open circulation xi figure s1 conceptual framework to help identify potential improvements to system

military biological specimen collections behavioral risk factor data access to dmss use level of demand for serum specimens perceived reasons for underutilization of dodsr access to specimens rand draft not for open circulation xiii chapter 7 presents our recommendations which reflect thematic packages of the strategies developed to address these issues 1 clarify and communicate the missions of dodsr dmss and amsa both within and beyond dod there is mismatch between congressional direction for the use of the dodsr and the dmss data system as articulated in several enactments of the national defense authorization act and the articulation of the mission and use of the dodsr and dmss by amsa clear articulation by military policy makers and common understanding by amsa managers and dodsr and dmss users of the full range of uses for these resources including surveillance epidemiologic investigation clinical management and research related to both infectious and noncommunicable diseases should lead to their more efficient use within dod further the mission of dodsr and dmss to collect specimens and data could also extend beyond dod active and reserve populations to include continuation of data and specimen collection on voluntary basis from separated service members followed in military treatment facilities andor the veterans administration health system to harness the full potential of the dodsr and dmss resources the full range of mission areas for these resources and their organizational oversight must be made explicit and communicated widely across dod and into related research and epidemiologic communities 2 empower structure and resource the organizational oversight of dodsr and dmss so that they can fulfill the full range of missions dod officially established the armed forces health surveillance center afhsc within chppm in late february 2008 this organization is intended to encompass and integrate dodwide health surveillance we recommend that the afhsc be organizationally situated empowered and resourced to connect the various experts contracts and systems that are required not only for its primary surveillance mission but also for the full range of uses primarily within the military but also extending to the civilian community for the dodsr and dmss resources it manages rand draft not for open circulation xiv through its executive agency function including surveillance epidemiologic investigation clinical management and research the chain of command and oversight for this organization should be such that it can receive guidance and resources from policy makers responsible for all of these functions eg the asdha surgeons general and army medical research and materiel command in order to ensure proper alignment with current military health system strategy and resources and medical research and service health priorities the afhsc should be configured and staffed to provide the support needed by all users and especially those within the dod supporting execution of its various missions 3 create an integrative data plan for comprehensive health surveillance ideally afhsc should create an overarching and comprehensive data plan prescribing integration of all relevant heath surveillance data such plan should address issues such as connectivity to occupational and environmental health surveillance systems both within the garrison and deployed settings increasing data collection along the service members period of service and beyond and fully realizing policy efforts to facilitate access to surveillance and other data by the va regarding dmss specifically several relevant military health data sets remain unconnected thus limiting the full execution of amsas surveillance mission and limiting the ability of dod more broadly to take advantage of the full value offered by dmss the highest priorities for new data linkages into dmss relate to deployment health especially data derived from deployed settings current issues related to classified data systems also need to be overcome we understand that relevant health surveillance data can possibly be made available to dmss via the unclassified theater medical data store for data that cannot be made available via this system options for linking classified data into dmss include timedelayed incorporation of declassified location data or nearreal time incorporation of classified data which would require new secure communications capabilities that dmss currently does not possess rand draft not for open circulation xv other relevant data linkages to consider are to existing dod biological specimen archives such as isolates and original nasal swab specimens from the dod febrile respiratory illness surveillance system and pathology and necropsy specimens maintained by the armed forces institute of pathology more robust linkages in both directions between dmss and the va health system should also be considered to the extent that the mission of dodsr and dmss are expanded beyond strictly active duty and reserve populations also consideration should be given to whether and how behavioral risk factor data should be collected and fed into dmss because there are many current data sources which might be tapped for deployment health surveillance and there may be more in the future the new afhsc would be better positioned to fully execute its mission if it were included in the military health system information requirements process currently managed at the tricare management agency in addition to dmss data content and management is the need for better protection of its physical infrastructure and the integrity of the data themselves ie to resist physical or cyber threats to the dmss database in addition to assuring adequate housing of the data system we recommend that strong consideration be given to systematic and frequent offsite back up and even parallel mirroring of the dmss database to assure its integrity in response to any threat that may arise as occurred in late january 2008 4 enhance the utility of specimens the dodsr serum specimens continue to serve well their original purpose of hiv serosurveillance however as early as 1997 the dod made decision to use serum as the tissue of convenience for deployment health surveillance the sera permit examination of deploymentrelated exposures to and investigations of infectious agents they are not particularly useful for timesensitive environmental exposures for which biomarkers are only fleetingly present and as military health research becomes broader and more technologically sophisticated the limitations of current serum specimens become more apparent researchers increasingly recognize the importance of genetic material for current rand draft not for open circulation xvi and future research into range of acute and chronic conditions serum specimens as presently stored in the dodsr at 30c do not reliably preserve genetic material the best way to do this is to archive specimens derived from whole blood specimens eg stored in liquid form or as dried blood spots or storage of buffy coat fractions see description in chapter 5 in which the quantity of genetic material is substantially greater storage requirements for dried blood spots are modest and incrementally the easiest storage of both plasma and buffy coat at 80c reflects current best industry practices for preservation of genetic material and other relevant bloodderived analytes however adoption of this alternative would mean costly new repository requirements for future specimens ie walkin freezers would not be possible for storage at 80c nonetheless the nearterm expiration of the current repository lease and potential relocation provides timely opportunity for military leadership to think carefully about the needs of the military health system into future and determine whether new kinds of specimens should be archived to better serve broader range of mission areas for this valuable military resource 5 raise awareness of and expand access to dodsr and dmss the use of dodsr and dmss resources may be limited because of limited awareness across dod for example military clinicians are apparently largely unaware of these resources in support of clinical management broad or targeted educational campaigns could be undertaken to raise awareness and use of dodsr and dmss access also may have been limited because of perceived lack of fully transparent criteria for release of specimens remedy for this could include development and dissemination of updated and transparent criteria and procedures for accessing dodsr specimens and dmss data in terms of expanding use the first priority should probably be for military health users within dod followed by more robust use by the va dod should carefully consider whether and how to expand use to civilian researchers while protecting individual privacy the overall military health mission and availability of remaining specimens as more users rand draft not for open circulation xvii draw down the number aliquots from given specimen finally efforts should be made to take better advantage of the longitudinal nature of the dodsr inventory eg through clarifying the legitimate use of dodsr for research and sensitizing military health researchers to the availability of these serial specimens and linked data 6 plan for the next repository facility finally depending on decisions related to the preceding recommendations dod should begin to define the requirements for the next repository following expiration of the current lease in 2010 factors to take into consideration include the time horizon for the next repository eg 20 years or more the annual rate of specimen acquisition which would increase if specimens are to be collected from members following separation the types of specimen to be archived eg serum or plasma buffy coat whole blood in liquid form or as dried blood spots and desired storage temperature eg 30c or 80c all of these influence the size and configuration of the future repository and hence the requirements for future repository space conclusions the goal of this study was to help identify opportunities to make even better use of dodsr and dmss resources in addressing military health needs now and into the future our analyses uncovered specific opportunities to better fulfill current requirements especially to close gaps in the content and efficiency of medical surveillance the largest gap relates to data from deployed settings which figures prominently within the strategies we describe in the report and our recommendations beyond surveillance we have also identified specific ways to position the dodsr and dmss resources to better serve the military of the future planning now for changes that will permit wider range of uses to improve not only surveillance but also clinical management and research in support of force health protection taken as whole our recommendations suggest that the dodsr and dmss could benefit from improved oversight and management to ensure they function rand draft not for open circulation xviii within the strategic goals of the military health system and have access to the needed data systems as well as other resources they need to fulfill their mission there are key decisions that need to be made at the undersecretary of defense level which will cascade across the recommendations we offer here affecting the direction of the decisions as well as the magnitude of change amsa has been responsible custodian for the dodsr and dmss characterized by multiple interviewees as national treasures whose full potential has yet to be fully harnessed creation of the new afhsc and relocation of the repository offer the opportunity to consider how the dodsr and dmss resources can be used to even greater advantage to support military health now and into the future this study took systematic approach to analysis of current characteristics and opportunities for improvement some of our recommendations are relatively easy while others are more ambitious nonetheless we feel that implementation of all of these recommendations will allow the afhsc to better fulfill its current requirements serve broader range of legitimate mission areas and position the dodsr and dmss resources for valuable service well into the future rand draft not for open circulation xix acknowledgments many people gave generously of their time and expertise in support of this project we thank all of the

circulation xxii an important note about terminology on february 26 2008 the deputy secretary of defense issued memorandum officially establishing the armed forces health surveillance center afhsc based on documents obtained by the rand study team on february 28 the center had been in the planning stages since at least september 2005 in anticipation of its imminent formal establishment the army surgeon generals office established provisional afhsc in october 2007 combining two extant organizations the army medical surveillance agency amsa and the global emerging infections system geis both amsa and geis are described in some detail in this report and amsa is in fact the focus of the report formalization of this new center occurred at the very end of this study because the new center combines two organizations and because our study is in fact focused on amsa we have used the term amsa throughout this report to refer to the portion of the new center that contains those activities traditionally performed by amsa specifically we are referring to the activities and responsibilities that involve management of the dod serum repository and the defense medical surveillance system in this report we use three key terms as defined by dod directives all three describe population health medical surveillance as established by dodd 649002e october 21 2004 is the collection analysis and reporting of data resulting from medical care or medical evaluation health surveillance as defined by the same directive includes medical surveillance plus occupational and environmental health surveillance dod also defines the term comprehensive military health surveillance to mean health surveillance conducted throughout service members military careers across all duty locations and encompassing risk intervention and outcome data dodd 649002e october 21 2004 31 while not officially defined by dod we usually use the term deployment health surveillance to mean health surveillance related to deployment including garrisonbased pre and postdeployment data plus data arising from deployed setting when relevant we are explicit in distinguishing between these two settings rand draft not for open circulation 1 chapter 1 introduction protecting the health of military personnel is strategic component of operational readiness force health protection is built upon foundation of both individual medical care and public health services in the public health area the department of defense dod provides preventive health services monitors the health of its members using epidemiological surveillance and in the event of disease outbreak conducts disease investigation and response public health surveillance ie the collection analysis and interpretation of healthrelated data and the dissemination of that information to monitor the health of population and identify potential risks to health is particularly important in deployed environments where surveillance is used to inform operational readiness track disease and injury and permit examination of linkages between environmental exposures and health outcomes health data are critical to these activities and to ensuring the continuity of medical care over service members careers over the past 20 years the dod has collected blood specimens from both military members and applicants for service and these specimens and related data have been stored in the dod serum repository dodsr and defense medical surveillance system dmss respectively the repository currently contains over 43 million specimens taken from more than 10 million active duty and reserve service members of the army navy air force and marines and applicants to these services the dmss contains data linked to these specimens the dodsr and dmss are both managed by the army medical surveillance activity amsa although routine collection of blood specimens was first mandated in 1985 to track the virus now known as hiv with serum remaining after the tests retained in storage the dodsr has expanded in size and scope in recent years and is now intended to provide information about number of deploymentrelated health issues and more broadly the identification prevention and control of disease associated with military service dodsr and dmss can provide specimens and population based information to the surveillance centers in other services as well rand draft not for open circulation 2 as policymakers and researchers and can also provide individual specimens and data to clinicians for medical management purposes since 1997 an important component of deployment health surveillance has been routine pre and postdeployment health assessment and associated collection of blood specimens that are ultimately archived in the dodsr for potential future testing however while the mission and requirements of the dodsr and dmss have expanded there has not been commensurate systematic effort to assess how these resources are being managed and used and whether there are opportunities for improvement in these areas therefore amsa asked the rand corporation to undertake systematic examination of dodsr and dmss to help identify ways in which amsa can make these resources available to meet the current and future health needs of the military as fully as possible this report focuses on the current and potential role of the dodsr and associated dmss database to support comprehensive health surveillance epidemiological investigation research and clinical management it describes current requirements and capabilities of both systems identifies issues and gaps and assesses specific strategies to increase the capabilities of these vital surveillance resources to serve the needs of the us armed forces today and into the future purpose and scope of rand study the purpose of this study is to examine the current capabilities of the dodsr and associated dmss database in the areas of surveillance epidemiologic investigation research and clinical support and to identify opportunities for improvement to do this we addressed five research questions what are current requirements for collection and use of dodsr specimens and dmss data what capabilities do the dodsr and dmss have to meet these requirements how are the dodsr and dmss currently used rand draft not for open circulation 3 what are the gaps between current capabilities and current and potential future needs what are strategies for improving capabilities to meet future needs we focused our examination of dodsr and dmss on consideration of blood and constituent components of potential use in surveillance epidemiologic investigation research and clinical support infectious disease agents as well as dna and rna as the main target for testing from bloodderived specimens existing military data systems that could potentially be linked to dmss and existing dod policy supporting programs and legacy practices methods to answer the research questions we first analyzed current policies and practices in military surveillance chapters 2 and 3 and examined current capabilities of the dodsr dmss and amsa chapter 4 as well as uses of other biological specimen repositories chapter 5 we then compared the current capabilities of dodsr and dmss to current and potential future requirements identified gaps and suggest priorities for action to close gaps and enhance the utility of these resources in surveillance epidemiologic investigation research and clinical support chapters 6 and 7 the identification and assessment of opportunities for improving the capabilities and use of dodsr and dmss are based on the following review of dod policy doctrine and other official documents review of peerreviewed journal literature and written descriptions of relevant civilian repository programs comparative analysis of the dodsr relative to other selected military and civilian biological specimen repositories rand draft not for open circulation 4 interviews with dod health leadership other military health experts and other relevant dod program staff and civilian health experts and development of rand conceptual framework to guide identification of potential improvements in dodsr and dmss system elements and to organize information collection analysis and presentation see chapter 6 organization of this report this report is organized as follows chapter 2 describes the evolving requirements for dodsr and dmss while chapter 3 describes selected military medical surveillance systems and organizations responsible for medical and broader health surveillance to provide context for the systems that currently do or could be linked to dmss chapter 4 describes the current capabilities of amsa dodsr and dmss chapter 5 examines other biological specimen repositories in order to seek insights that may be pertinent to decisions regarding dodsr chapter 6 then presents conceptual framework that is used to identify issues and describes potential strategies to close gaps between requirements and current capabilities and to increase the capabilities of dodsr and dmss to meet new needs into the future chapter 7 concludes with description of six overarching recommendations derived from our analyses rand draft not for open circulation 5 chapter 2 evolution of dodsr and dmss requirements in order to evaluate how well the dodsr and dmss are able to meet current and future requirements we need first to understand what those requirements are and how they have evolved since the dodsr was first created in 1985 this information together with an understanding of current medical surveillance systems and organizations chapter 3 current capabilities of dodsr and dmss chapter 4 and uses of other biologic serum repositories chapter 5 establish the basis for the assessment of existing gaps and identification of potential improvement strategies chapters 6 and 7 we begin by discussing the current mission of the dodsr and dmss and the way in which the requirements have evolved over time figure 21 presented below depicts the main highlights of this evolution and appendix 1 presents more detailed summary of the requirements as they have evolved we also discuss aspects of dods vision for the repository and ways in which its role was intended to develop evolving mission and uses of the dodsr the current mission of the dodsr is to provide support for the identification prevention and control of disease related to military service dodd 649002e october 21 2004 the mission of the dmss is to serve as triservice medical surveillance system the uses of the repository have shifted however the dodsr was initially conceived as resource for routine hiv screening it subsequently was defined as resource for deployment health surveillance and later for the broader purpose of identifying preventing and controlling disease associated with all military service we describe highlights from this evolution in the following sub sections an overview of the main steps in the evolution is shown in figure 21 rand draft not for open circulation 6 figure 21 evolution of dodsr dmss and organizational requirements origins in hiv screening program the serum collection currently maintained in the dodsr and managed by amsa started in 1985 as part of the armys htlviii screening program asdha december 5 1985 which began in response to the spread of new human virus subsequently known as the human immunodeficiency virus hiv dod instituted mandatory collection of blood specimens for screening of all civilian applicants going through military entrance processing stations6actual collection and storage of remnant serum occurred as part of contracts between dod and commercial testing laboratories in which all nonreactive serologic specimens were ordered to remain in frozen storage for the duration of the contract although these disparate collections of serum which would ultimately seed the dodsr inventory were stored by the dod contractors specified purpose rand draft not for open circulation 7 for their future use had not been officially articulated in 1989 maintenance and management contract was awarded to mckesson to begin consolidating and storing in single facility the serum specimens that were stored by testing contractors who had been conducting hiv screening for the dod since 1985 under the authority of wrair retrovirology this contract gave way to the establishment of the armynavy serum repository the predecessor to the dodsr by 1990 the contractor processing the hiv specimens had collected and stored over six million serum specimens the first officially articulated purpose of the repository was documented in 1991 army request for proposals to create and maintain the walter reed army serum bank repository sera repository operations are required for retrospective studies in support of current and future retroviral research efforts analysis of these sera will be very important the department of retrovirology would require asneeded specimen retrieval up to about 5000 per year rfp damd17900181 p5 7 by 1996 the repository had collected and stored over 17 million serum specimens from army and navy civilian applicants as well as from active component service members institute of medicine 1996 together with the linked medical information stored in the us army hiv data system the military had developed rich resource for conducting robust retrospective studies along with the creation of the serum repository the army created data center in 1986 within the walter reed army institute of research division of preventive medicine to support hivrelated screening care and research activities rubertone and brundage december 2002 in 1995 the system was transferred to the armys center for health promotion and preventive medicine chppm and called the army medical surveillance system dr rubertone personal communication 7 january 2007 emergence of deployment health surveillance requirements later in the 1990s the serum repository was assigned an additional mission related to deployment health and amsa was designated rand draft not for open circulation 8 as executive agent responsible for management of the repository and associated data system on behalf of dod many service members returning from the first gulf war reported illnesses of unknown origin and many questioned the dods commitment to providing health care for military members and veterans the issues were so serious that in the decade after the war dod sought to determine not only the etiology of the illnesses and appropriate treatments but also sought to establish systems that would assure adequate health data captures in future deployments this was important because the medical records of deployed gulf war service members were not adequate either to substantiate or refute the exposures being reported public concern was so great that even as late as 2000 the institute of medicine published report criticizing the dod for not adequately addressing the concerns that had been raised and urging dod to take immediate action to repair the data deficiencies in the medical records of service membersinstitute of medicine protecting those who serve national academy press 2000 page 2 accessed 20 feb at httpwwwnapeduopenbookphpisbn0309071895 in response to the concerns over multiple unexplained symptoms reported by gulf war veterans also called gulf war syndrome in 1997 congress mandated that dod conduct comprehensive health surveillance on service members who deploy overseas public law 10585 november 1997 in particular the law required dod to collect blood specimens before and after military deployments it also stipulated that dod maintain central archive of records and make them accessible across dod nearly simultaneously dod issued new policy related to joint medical surveillance dodd 64902 august 30 1997 and dodi 64903 august 7 1997 see figure 21 these policy issuances designated chppm as executive agent for deployment medical surveillance and for maintenance of dodwide serum repository whose purpose was medical surveillance for clinical diagnosis and epidemiologic studies the repository shall be used exclusively for the identification prevention and control of diseases associated with operational deployments of military personnel dodd 64902 august 30 1997 d7 chppm was rand draft not for open circulation 9 also directed to maintain medical surveillance system to integrate analyze and report data from multiple sources relevant to the health and readiness of military personnel dodi 64903 august 7 1997 e7 the services components and cocoms were mandated to report data to chppm it is important to note that the serum repository which had originally been established in response to thenavailable technology for hiv screening was simply expanded to also serve as deployment health surveillance tool with the serum remaining the specimen of convenience to meet this new requirement it is also important to note that the 1997 policy appears to limit the use of the serum repository to deployment related health these points had many implications which we will examine in some detail later in this report also in 1997 the asdha called for the creation of triservice medical surveillance system this became the dmss at chppm1 also at this same time the armys medical surveillance system changed its name to be the dmss and was moved from being managed directly by chppm to being managed by amsa subordinate agency of chppm rubertone and brundage december 2002 vision for alltheater medical surveillance and data collection in 1998 the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs asdha issued policy memorandum which established that pre and post deployment blood specimen collection mandated by the ndaa of fy98 could be met by routine participation in the hiv screening program as long as the predeployment specimen was collected within 12 months of the start of the deployment asdha october 6 1998 in further response to the health problems experienced by the veterans of the first gulf war congress passed the ndaa for fy99 public law 105261 october 1998 which authorized the secretary of defense to establish center for deployment health in which 1 we were unable to find the source document but were able to find reference to it in an asdha memorandum from september 30 1999 which we describe in more detail below rand draft not for open circulation 10 longitudinal health data would be collected and studied in order to assess the effect of deployment on service members section 743 because of this legislation the asdha issued key policy memorandum in 1999 that established two centers for deployment health the deployment health clinical center within the walter reed army medical center and the deployment health research center within the naval health research center and specified that the dmss would serve as the comprehensive longitudinal relational epidemiology database for the study of deploymentrelated health see figure 21 this memorandum explicitly calls for all theater medical surveillance and treatment data collected by the services unified and specified commands and individual commandsto be forwarded to the dmss finally it stipulates that the tricare management activity will provide unrestricted access to applicable military health system data and support the dmssas appropriateasdha september 30 1999 all cites from 6 the same memorandum provides concept for changing the dmss into dod medical surveillance agency that would function as the dods deployment health surveillance center concept of operations attachment the concept for the future of dmss was that it would provide access to deploymentrelated health data and allow for dodwide surveillance and research chppm was designated as the dod repository for all theater medical surveillance data as described above and amsa was described as the sole link between the dod serum repository and other databases asdha concept of operations document1999 and finally dmss was directed to provide remote access to personnel and health surveillance data to the navy health research center nhrc and other related service surveillance organizations as we describe in later chapters of this report not all the provisions of this memorandum were executed therefore by the end of fy99 dod had established deployment related health surveillance system with the goal of determining the health effects of deployment established three deployment health centers each with distinct deploymenthealth mission clinical research surveillance and established data system in order to rand draft not for open circulation 11 assess deploymentrelated health data most of the major ground work for deployment health surveillance was begun effect of the global war on terror the operations in afghanistan and iraq created new demands related to medical surveillance and deployment health surveillance and these played out in the modifications to the required deployment health assessment forms dd forms 2595 and 2596 in the expansion of the surveillance program to cover certain reserve component populations and in development of quality assurance programs importantly in 2001 asdha issued policy memorandum that applied all deploymentrelated health assessment requirements and specimen collection requirements to the reserve component service members who were activated for 30 days or more this memorandum stipulated that all pre and postdeployment health assessment forms dd form 2795 and dd2796 respectively be sent to amsa and stipulated the content of the forms by providing examples within the memorandum which were mandated across services further policy issuances updated procedures for deployment health surveillance and readiness jcs mcm0006002 2002 enhanced postdeployment assessments usdpr april 22 2003 and new requirements for the electronic transmission and capture of pre and postdeployment health assessment forms asdha may 21 2004 broadening of mission beyond deployment health the mission and requirements for dodsr expanded further beginning in 2004 when the use of the repository was broadened beyond exclusive use for deploymentrelated health to encompass all uses for the prevention and control of diseases associated with military service this began when dod issued major policy document in 2004 describing the overarching guidelines and goals for force health protection within the military health system dodd 620004 october 9 2004 this document lays out requirements for annual health assessments as well as annual assessments of individual medical readiness individual medical readiness standards are applied to each individual service member to ensure their ability to deploy worldwide and are further described in chapter 3 rand draft not for open circulation 12 less than two weeks later dod issued new policy on comprehensive health surveillance dodd 649002e october 21 2004 updating the 1997 issuance on joint medical surveillance see figure 21 the 2004 policy document described broader mission for the repository 412 there shall be department of defense serum repository for medical surveillance for clinical diagnosis and epidemiologic studies the repository shall be used for the identification prevention and control of disease associated with military service the 2004 comprehensive health surveillance issuance establishes dod policy to conduct health surveillance across service members careers in all duty locations and across the full spectrum of activities encountered within the military it requires daily review of battle injuries and disease and nonbattle injuries in order to detect any health threats it directs biological monitoring as required and it directs that triservice reportable medical events be reported electronically although neither the reporting system nor reporting destination is specified that is the policy directs collection of such data but does not explicitly link this to dmss the comprehensive health surveillance issuance also requires the synchronization of data between medical and personnel systems and directs that health surveillance data be transferred to the department of veterans affairs once service member separates from the service in sum by 2004 the mission and requirements related to dodsr had evolved beyond simply hiv screening and deployment health surveillance to also include broader range of purposes medical surveillance clinical diagnoses and epidemiologic studies for diseases associated with military service ie not strictly limited to deployment health surveillance rand draft not for open circulation 13 growing concern about dods ability to track and assess deployment health data by 2005 the global war on terror was four years underway and record numbers of reserve component deployments supplemented high levels of active component deployments congress in 2005 again addressed the issue of deployment health surveillance the ndaa of fy05 indicated growing congressional concern with the dods ability to track and assess deployment health data especially data from theater given the high levels of deployments and complex nature of the contingencies in iraq and afghanistan in particular the ndaa for 2005 required the secretary of defense to ensure interim standards that blood specimens needed for the predeployment examination of service member be drawn later than 120 days prior to the date of the deployment and that the postdeployment specimens be drawn later than 30 days after the conclusion of the deployment section 734 required dod to maintain medical record of all care provided to service members in theater as part of complete health record required the evaluation of medical tracking and health surveillance intheater systems with report due back to congress within year the evaluation was to establish the efficacy of health surveillance as means of detecting i any health problems including mental health conditions of members of the armed forces and ii exposures of assessed members to environmental hazards that potentially lead to future health problemspara b further congress required the evaluation to address how the data system could support future research on health issues to make recommendations for changes to medical tracking and health surveillance systems and to provide summary of scientific literature on blood sampling procedures used for detecting and identifying exposures paras ce congress also asked dod to determine in this same evaluation whether need existed for changes to regulations and standards for drawing blood specimens for effective tracking and health surveillance of the medical conditions of personnel before deployment upon the rand draft not for open circulation 14 end of deployment and for follow up period of appropriate lengthpara f required dod to prescribe policy on the collection and dissemination of intheater individual personnel locations section 734 d required dod to review and revise the classification levels of data for the use of monitoring and assessing the health tracking and surveillance data in order to make the data more usefulsection 735 while deployment health surveillance and medical surveillance epidemiology and clinical support are not mutually exclusive it is clear that congress interest in assuring that the dodsr and dmss met all key needs as deployment health surveillance tool yet neither congress nor dod explicitly specified dmss as the destination for theater medical surveillance data potential need for changes in the process of drawing blood samples in addition the ndaa requires the dod to examine the need for any changes related to the process of drawing blood specimens for effective deployment health surveillance in order to conduct the evaluation required by congress the asdha requested study from the armed forces epidemiology board asdha january 2005 posing three questions is there was sound basis for the continued routine collection of sera pre and postdeployment for clinical care reasons public health surveillance or research purposes in order to examine the effects of deployment on health should any other biological specimens be collected for clinical care reasons public health surveillance or research purposes are there were any valid reasons to change the time frames of specimens of collected biological specimens either pre or postdeployment for clinical care reasons public health surveillance or research purposes rand draft not for open circulation 15 the study reached four conclusions armed forces epidemiology board april 2005 first it concluded that there were medically valid reasons to continue the collection of serum specimens for all purposes next the study concluded that there is utility in collecting baseline and periodic blood specimens consisting of serum and white blood cells going further the study suggested that dod should formalize in rules and procedures and make more clear the accessibility of the repository to ensure wide access and that an oversight panel be created to govern access finally the study concluded that sampling of the entire deploying military force as opposed to smaller sample of the deploying population was also appropriate for the purposes of deployment health surveillance and that the oneyear predeployment and 30 day postdeployment collection windows were appropriate as provided for in the ndaa fy05 the asdha changed the legislated interim standards for pre and postdeployment serum collection per the recommendations of the armed forces epidemiology board allowing predeployment serum specimens to be collected within 365 days of deployment under routine hiv sampling unless some reason would indicate more proximate collection and postdeployment serum collection within 30 days after arrival at demobilization site or home station or inpatient medical treatment facility in the case of evacuees asdha march 14 2006 establishment of policy on individual medical readiness as the conflict in iraq changed from major combat operation to counter insurgency operation veterans began to return to the united states with blast injuries from improvised explosive devices injuries involving extremities were seen more often as were blast injuries and psychological traumas that were manifesting themselves months after the deployment in cognitive and mental health problems in march 2005 the asdha issued policy memorandum that required new postdeployment health reassessment form that was to be completed between three and six months following deployment although the new form was designed to elicit service members concern about physical health its focus was on selfperceived cognitive and psychological health issues the form rand draft not for open circulation 16 was based on the pre and postdeployment health assessment forms and was to be ultimately funneled to amsa for storage in dmss and inclusion in required analyses of deployment health assessments by 2006 the manpowerintensive counterinsurgency efforts in iraq and afghanistan demanded new sources of us troops with naval personnel being used on the ground in iraq for example because of the relatively large demand on both active and reserve service members for ground operations dod issued new policy on individual medical readiness establishing six baseline readiness standards across all services dodi 602519 january 3 2006 the medical readiness standards for deployment for individuals are 1 current periodic health assessment every 12 months 2 the absence of deployment limiting medical conditions 3 dental readiness to specified standards 4 immunization standards germane to the theater of operation 5 current medical readiness laboratory tests and 6 possession of appropriate individual medical equipment these new standards eased the confusion that arose from competing standards across services while also creating sort of baseline for surveillance of medical readiness across dod see figure 21 in 2006 dod updated its 1997 deployment health policy to specify policies and procedures for daily monitoring of disease and nonbattle injury rates during deployments the diseases and injuries incurred during deployment but not from combat address occupational and environmental health risk require documentation of occupational and environmental health exposures and require record of daily location of personnel dodi 649003 august 11 2006 this issuance also requires that deployment health data be collected transmitted and maintained electronically rather than on paper as had been previously practiced although the systems were not specified ie dmss was never mentioned as the destination for such deployment health surveillance data the updated 2006 deployment health policy responded to the outstanding requirement from the ndaa fy05 for more complete and accurate individual location data by directing the deputy undersecretary of defense for program integration to ensure that the current manpower rand draft not for open circulation 17 data center receive oncedaily deployment location records at the secret level and below this allows linkages between exposures and patient encounter data the services are tasked within this instruction to develop data collection system that would record the location data of all deployed individuals the services are further tasked to ensure postdeployment health assessment and reassessment forms are submitted to dmss and to conduct occupational and environmental health surveillance section 5 the cocoms are tasked to coordinate occupational and environmental and medical surveillance and to provide timely reporting of disease and nonbattle injuries battle injuries and other medical events section 5 the updated 2006 deployment health policy reiterates the maintenance of dmss and dodsr by amsa and the timelines for pre and postdeployment serum sampling and process it tasks amsa with providing individuallevel and aggregated data from the pre and postdeployment health assessment forms as well as the reassessment form it also directs amsa to integrate triservice reportable medical events data from across the services and make such data available to the services for further analyses and reporting it further directs the army to maintain and provide analyses from the occupational and environmental health data system yet while dmss is explicitly mentioned in the context of ongoing pre and postdeployment health assessment forms there is mention that directs theater surveillance data be sent or ultimately linked into dmss chapter highlights there are several points to be emphasized from this discussion of requirements to inform the future of dods medical and deployment health surveillance the serum repository and dmss in terms of current missions the current policydirected mission for amsa is to manage the dodsr and dmss and to act as the organization carrying out the secretary of the armys executive agency responsibility for dodwide deployment medical surveillance rand draft not for open circulation 18 the current policydirected mission of the dodsr is to provide support for the identification prevention and control of disease related to military service the current policydirected mission of the dmss is to act as triservice medical surveillance system that is to transform to medical surveillance center share data across services with related surveillance agencies connect to all relevant personnel and medical systems and receive all theater medical data yet policy specifies that theater medical surveillance data be transmitted to dmss the use of the repository has shifted since its inception in 1985 initially resource for routine hiv screening it subsequently became resource for deployment health surveillance and later as resource for the broader purpose of identification prevention and control of disease associated with all military service for both the reserve and active components as early as 1997 dod determined that it would continue to store the sera that had already been collected and also expand the use of serum specimens to fulfill new deployment health surveillance requirements pursuant to legislation in 2005 the asdha requested an evaluation of the soundness of the continued use of sera for surveillance and for clinical care purposes as well as research the armed forces epidemiology board conducted the evaluation and reported that there was utility in continuing this practice but suggested that archiving of an additional blood fraction white blood cells might also be appropriate in order to preserve genetic material for testing now and into the future as we discuss later in this report with the technological advances presenting new opportunities for health surveillance the benefits of storing whole blood or other blood fractions may now outweigh the simple convenience of continuing to rely upon sera to meet rand draft not for open circulation 19 deployment health surveillance requirements now and into the future in 1997 the asdha envisioned dmss as triservice medical surveillance data system that would be connected to health data collections in theater of operation asdha further suggested that dmss would migrate toward dod medical surveillance agency that would function as the dods deployment health surveillance center as we discuss later in our report this suggestion has never been realized data collected from theater systems have not been fed into dmss but instead these data are being analyzed by an agency within asdha further the collection of individual location data has been addressed both by congress and dod yet as we discuss later these data are still elusive in fact the connection of the dmss system to relevant and timely data systems is significant issue that can be addressed by dod since there appears to be regulatory guidance available and the data systems themselves are evolving to make such connections more feasible in this chapter we have discussed the statutory and dod policy directives relating to amsa the dodsr and dmss in the next chapter we will describe selected dod medical surveillance systems and organizations rand draft not for open circulation 20 rand draft not for open circulation 21 chapter 3 department of defense medical surveillance we now discuss dod surveillance systems understanding relevant medical surveillance activities helps place the role of dodsr and dmss into context the summaries of relevant surveillance components and activities also set the stage for potential strategies to improve the capabilities of dodsr and dmss by leveraging integrating or streamlining existing dod activities and resources dod distinguishes between medical surveillance and health surveillance medical surveillance involves the collection management and analysis of health and medical information including biological specimens from members of all services stationed in both garrison and deployed environments in the united states and around the globe health surveillance is broader it includes medical surveillance as well as occupational and environmental health surveillance the military operational tempo since 2001 has led to updates in dod policy related to deployment health including deployment health surveillance guided by department policy the services carry out routine public health surveillance activities such as hiv testing dodd 64851 august 10 1992 notifiable disease reporting asdha november 9 1998 and disease and nonbattle injury reporting dodi 649003 august 11 2006 independently services support more specialized public health programs based on the needs of their member population and operations specific service components have been designated to support dodwide public health program elements our focus in this chapter is on medical surveillance within the broader context of health surveillance in dod the goal is to describe the scope of these activities across dod along with the current systems executing them we discuss selected medical surveillance systems and the organizational components responsible for medical and broader military health surveillance we begin with discussion of relevant definitions and principles established by dod policy then highlight relevant surveillance systems and finally discuss key service agencies that conduct military health surveillance rand draft not for open circulation 22 key definitions department of defense policy has defined different kinds of military health surveillance based on the source content and scope of the data these definitions begin to establish the context for the role of dodsr and dmss the following definitions are cited in dodd 649002e october 21 2004 with key distinctions across definitions highlighted 31 comprehensive military health surveillance health surveillance conducted throughout service members military careers across all duty locations and encompassing risk intervention and outcome data such surveillance is essential to the evaluation planning and implementation of public health practice and prevention and must be closely integrated with the timely dissemination of information to those who can act upon it 32 health surveillance the regular or repeated collection analysis and interpretation of healthrelated data and the dissemination of information to monitor the health of population and to identify potential risks to health thereby enabling timely interventions to prevent treat or control disease and injury it includes occupational and environmental health surveillance and medical surveillance 33 medical surveillance the ongoing systematic

medical surveillance systems and activities not surprisingly data systems are stovepiped within services moreover as noted in chapter 2 the regulatory context for deployment health has developed separately from the garrison or nondeployment context data collection systems have likewise developed within those two general contexts as we describe below we identified relevant systems that collect

serving in major overseas deployments in compliance with dod instruction 649003 deployment health august 2006 all deploymentrelated health assessment forms are submitted electronically to dmss and permanently archived postdeployment health reassessment requirement was added in 2005 instituting collection of health information and medical review of service members 36 months after returning from deployment the program uses dd form 2900 to collect information on health concerns with particular emphasis on mental health the latest version of the form is dated september 2007 the predeployment process generally involves selfdisclosure by service member of any recent health events medicines being taken and any health concerns once the form is completed medical personnel will review the form and if needed interview the service member to determine fitness for deployment or if the service member needs any treatment to prepare for deployment the postdeployment assessment process starts with the completion of the form by service member when concern is noted on the form or the service member screens positively for potential mental or physical health issues that member is immediately seen by medical personnel who will determine whether referral to medical provider for further attention is needed the postdeployment reassessment process is similar to the postdeployment process but is focused on capturing cognitive and mental health problems which typically appear in the three to sixmonth window following deployment again should service member screen positive or indicate health concerns in their reassessment he or she will be seen by medical personnel and referred as appropriate the deployment health assessment forms are intended to describe the service members perceptions of their own health health exposures psychological problems and health related concerns the postdeployment health assessment and reassessment forms in particular however some rand draft not for open

what guidance amsa received from higher organizations either within dod or within the army we asked amsa whether it received any prioritized chain of command for amsa written guidance or any other form of formalized guidance to direct its efforts within the greater dod surveillance context we learned that amsa apparently receives little if any guidance from any organization for its medical

half of the serum specimens in the dodsr are traceable to service member who has at some point been on active duty after 1990 as previously discussed this subset of the population captured by the dodsr is of high value because of the availability of linked longitudinal medical and personnel information the total number of former and current military members represented in the dodsr including

these specimens since the specimen collections are done for public health surveillance and condition of employment in the service second serum specimens are stored in perpetuity in the dodsr with apparent guidelines govern appropriate handling andor disposal of sera from separated or deceased members our interviewees suggested that service members know that bed in as ing rand draft not for open circulation 47 their serum specimens are stored in perpetuity however we could evidence find f explicit communication to that effect guidelines address uses of stored serum specimens but consent rules are not fully articulated for uses of the serum specimens amsas guidelines for collecting maintaining requesting and using specimens stored in the department of defense serum repository 29 may 2003 establish research as an activity conducted with the primary intent to create extend or validate generalizable knowledge or knowledge that extends beyond the individual or populations directly associated with the individual nonresearch is an activity conducted in order to develop specific knowledge of an individual or directly associated population within these two categories the guidelines address four primary uses of the stored serum specimens research patient care public healthforce health protection and criminal investigations the issue of consent is addressed by determining whether the sera are identifiable to an individual or linked or unidentifiable for research purposes linked specimens would require consent documents and unlinked specimens would not require consent for patient care purposes consent must be obtained prior to specimen release imens when gh t for public healthforce health protection linked spec would not require consent if the use is nonresearch and if the use is to examine threat to or intervention for military population the guideline does not describe linked specimens might require consent for the purposes of public healthforce health protection however it does describe the potential use of an unlinked specimen althou it is not explicit about whether this use would or would require consent presumably it would not for criminal investigations and prosecutions the guidelines are quiet concerning the need for consent although specify the use of counsel rand draft not for open circulation 48 it appears that the guidelines could be improved upon by specifying consent issues relating to public healthforce health pr otection further from the discussion above since the specimens are drawn without consent then there seems to be way to use the sera for any purposes other than delinked or certain public healthforce health protection uses guidelines for use of institutional review boards could be expanded we learned from our interviews that amsa relies on the irbs of requesting agencies to determine the appropriateness of the protections stipulated within the proposed protocols although the current trend among repositories is to have an internal irb or an established affiliation with an irb see chapter 5 as in our discussion of informed consent above because recent technological innovations allow for detection of dna in sera it is questionable whether sera can actually be delinked the amsa guidelines specify the following irb requirements for proposed uses of sera for research purposes amsa requires an irb approval for the purposes of patient care the amsa guideline is silent on the matter of irb approval for the purposes of public healthforce health protection the guidelines are silent with regard to irb approval although this category of use in particular may warrant an irb for the purposes of criminal investigations and prosecutions the guidelines are also silent although stipulate the use of counsel theref irb review m going to be affiliated i there appear to be several opportunities for improvement in the treatment n informed conore guidelines articulating the protections offered by an ay be improved

suggests that an updated examination might rand draft not for open circulation 49 provi being drawn for two legallymandated and regulated purposes hiv testing and pre and postdeployment surveillance

because d subsequent storage by the dodsr include application for military service routine hiv screening deployment related health assessments both before and compulsory hiv screening for all active component and reserve component benefit both to the service member as well as to the military health system to summarize the key points of this discussion regarding informed consent specimens are specimens are stored in perpetuity with evidence of communication of that to service members specimens can be used for purposes other than that for which the were drawn namely research clinical care public health criminal investigation but research uses require either linking from individually identifying information or express informed consent the consent rules are apparently not fully articulated in current guidelines repositories either tend to b exclusively on the determination of requesting organization irbs the guideline articulating the need for irbs is sil this category of use is large it may benefit dod to revisit this use of serum specimens and further specify the appropriateness of if when and how to use an irb timing of specimen collection the events associated with

while dodsr and dmss have been used for other important purposes such as special hiv surveillance studies public health investigation and clinical support our interviews and ana suggest the potential for far more robust use in particular fo deployment medical surveillance that includes data from deployed settings and broader health surveillance ie to include medical and occupational and environmental health surveillance in both garrison and deployment settings rand draft not for open circulation 68 to summarize some key findings about the serum repository particular we found thin at od d g to military n to s eg 80 degrees celsius point that becomes more important in our comparison to other repositories mmended mendation ss we found that from 2001 through january 2008 specimens from the dodsr were requested fewer than 200 times the missions of the serum repository as defined by d policy include medical surveillance clinical diagnosis an epidemiological studies of all illness relatin service yet the staff at amsa perceive its main missio be one of surveillance the serum repository has large number of specimens that have become delinked from the individual donor there is apparent policy in place to determine how long to store the specimens or what to do with them the repository has apparent guidelines explaining the decision making process for allowing use of the sera the sera are stored at 30 degrees celsius rather than at colder temperature more consistent with current industry standard most uses of the repository to date have been for research studies as opposed to surveillance uses the ability of the sera to support the repositorys given missions has not been evaluated since the armed forces epidemiology board recommendation of 2005 which reco archiving of wbc for preservation of genetic material and action has not been taken in response to this recom there does not appear to be mandate for any joint body to routinely and systematically evaluate the value of the sera for surveillance possibilities balancing against resource constraints and emerging threats to the force to summarize some key points related to dm there is disparity between the mission of dmss as defined in policy and its actual functioning specifically the mission of rand draft not for open circulation 69 dmss is to provide triservice medical surveillance in order do this dmss needs ad to equate data elements fed in timely manner and c receiving many relevant data elements which would be necessary though not necessarily sufficient to address all deployment health needs

to be published forth rand draft not for open circulation 70 rand draft not for open circulation 71 chapter 5 examination of other biological specimen repositories to better evaluate potential improvements to the dodsr the rand team examined the characteristics of other repositories in the united states and abroad repositories are typically associated with organizations that have specific research interests or surveillance mandates that necessitate storing of biological specimens specific details of each repository are function of their general purpose the sponsoring organization and underlying research design that led to the repository depending upon these factors the collection processing testing and storage of specimens varies across the repositories the volume and storage conditions of specimens can also be dictated by the purpose and function of the repository to understand examine the different repositories the rand team developed framework for the collection processing testing and storage of specimens figure 51 the framework consists of four components collection processing testing and storage each of which includes key variables that affect the usefulness of specimens for different purposes eg research surveillance surrounding each of the components is colored box representing overarching elements associated with that component each of these components is described in more detail below in the remainder of this chapter we first describe the different major blood fractions and the types of standard tests that can be performed with them then we describe the framework used in this analysis and discuss each of the repositories blood fractions and testing as mentioned in chapter 2 congress legislated in 1997 that dod collect blood specimens pre and postdeployment because dod was already collecting blood for hiv testing and storing sera it decided to use the extant repository as currently configured to fulfill the newer legal requirement since then both congress and dod have questioned the continued use of the repository to fulfill pre and postdeployment rand draft not for open circulation 72 health surveillance functions the asdha asked the armed forces epidemiology board to investigate whether or not other specimens should be stored and the board concluded that there may be utility in storing white blood cells for preservation of genetic material platelets make up approximately 05 of cellular blood components and lected and how they are stored is often driven by the purpose of the collection or the purpose of the original study that collected the specimens depending on the intended use of the fied as described in this section white blood cells can be either purified and stored as the buffy coat fraction or captured in whole blood whole blood can be stored either dried or liquid in all of these cases dna and rna can be captured in adequate amounts for todays technology and even perhaps tomorrows to use in genetic testing as further discussed dried blood spots have several advantages one being simple collection processing and storage along with long term stability of dna whole blood provides buffy coat which in turn provides even larger amounts of dna and rna for genetic testing than dried blood spots blood is one of the most common biological specimens collected and used for diagnostic tests and is also commonly used for surveillance and research purposes blood is complex mixture of cells proteins metabolites and many other substances cells make up approximately 45 percent of the total human blood volume plasma the liquid component of blood in which the blood cells are suspended makes up about 55 percent of total blood volume serum is blood plasma without fibrinogen or the other clotting factors the vast majority of blood cells more than 99 percent are erythrocytes red blood cells rbc thrombocytes leukocytes white blood cells wbc make up approximately 03 the only human blood cells that contain nuclei and are suitable for use in preparation of genomic dna are wbc which specimens are col specimens biological repositories store either whole blood or puri blood components ie blood fractions whole blood can be collected and stored either in liquid form or as dried blood spots collection on filter paper repositories also store purified fractions from whole blood which can commonly include serum plasma and wbc during rand draft not for open circulation 73 separation wbc and platelets typically are collected together in fraction called the buffy coat and are often stored in this form in some cases repositories also store rbc blood tests can be grouped into range of categories including clinical biochemistry hematology immunology microbiology and genetic ten for so tests require dna or rna depending on the type of test is rther f wbcs dna or rna buffy coat provides more volume of material than dbs for genetic studies finally in general serum and plasma can both be used for wide range of biochemistry immunology and microbiology tests although serum is of the preferred fraction since the clotting factors in plasma can complicate some tests plasma is required for blood clotting tests and other specific tests like the fasting plasma glucose test for diabetes whole blood is required for some hematology tests such as complete blood counts and can also be used for variety of biochemistry immunology and microbiology tests geneticbased this generally requires collection of wbcs either in purified form or in whole blood both dried blood spots dbs and liquid blood can be used for genetic studies dbs have long been used for newborn screening and large populationbased repositories schafer et 1996 hsu et 1992 dbs have the advantage of simpler collection processing and storage requirements 20c humidity control small space requirements and longterm stability of the dna ref uk biobank specimen handling and storage group protocol and recommendations but supply smaller quantity of dna since the size of dbs specimens typically small yielding limited amounts of dna they may not be suitable for wholegenome amplification steinberg et 2002 the buffy coat from processed whole blood can be stored or fu processed to purify specific subsets wbcs can be turned into immortal cell lines to provide long term high volumes of genetic material this can be done on freshly purified wbcs or on blood properly stored with cryoprotectant in liquid nitrogen rand draft not for open circulation 74 framework for specimen collection processing testing and storage as shown in figure 51 the framework for understanding the characteristics of repositories consists of four components collection processing testing and storage determination of the need for the informed consent of the research the specimen collection component of the framework consists of who the specimens are collected from when and where they are collected the purpose for which they are collected ie why and the collection method used ie how the overarching elements associated with the collection component of the framework are informed consent and institutional review board irb approval the system of federal protections pertaining to the ethical involvement of people as participants in medical research including research with biological specimens involves review of the proposed research by an irb and participant see hhs regulations at 45 cfr part 46 and dod directive 3216027 the irb looks after the participants rights and the ethics of the research study the irb process can vary across institutions and nations with some countries having single national board that address all research studies involving human participants irb approval can be implemented at different points in the life of specimen most often an initial irb approval is required prior to the start of research study but additional irb reviews can occur to provide periodical review of the study to ensure that appropriate steps are being taken to protect the participants rights and welfare once specimens are stored in 45 cfr part 46 is the common rule that addresses the protection of human research participants in the federal government it is set of identical regulations codified by 15 agencies of which dod is one the office of science and technology policy ostp is signatory to the common rule but did not codify it because it does not conduct or sponsor research the common rule also regulates research conducted or7 sponsored by two other agencies that are not signatories but are bound to hhs regulations and therefore the common rule the social security administration and the central intelligence agency the common rule has to be upheld and is enforceable by law dod directive 321602 is the department of defense codification of the common rule and is equivalent to it rand draft not for open circulation 75 repository irb approval is also usually required for the distribution of

of different repositories that collect blood products to compare with dodsr to cover the variables described here part of the original study in addition some repositories have established their own irbs to oversee access an ens and other general repository functions the specimen processing component of the framework includes the processing method eg how blood is fractionated as well as when where the specimens are processed some specimens may need to be transported from the collection site to the laboratoryfacility they will be processed the overarching element associated with specimen processing is the annotation that accompanies each spec once the specimen has been processed testing may be conducted t acquire information about the specimen and the person from whom it ca in some cases the testing is done at the same facility as the processing in other cases testing is done at different site the results of tests done on specimens are the overarching element associated with testing finally once the specimen has been processed and all of the initial testing has been completed the specimen is put into storage at biological specimen repository the storage component of the framework includes the type of specimen being stored and where and how the specimen is stored the data management system at repository is the overarching element associated with storage the conditions and time involved in the transport processes between collection processing rand draft not for open circulation 76 figure 51 framework for the evaluation of serum repositories six repositories for

part in its studies via collaborations with clinicians in many countries virtually all of these specimens are in the form of whole blood andor purified dna from each participant five vials of whole blood are collected one vial is processed into purified dna and aliquoted into an average of ten 2 milliliter tubes that are stored at 4 c there is time restriction on storage length for the purified dna but the general rule of thumb practiced by decode is that if aliquot of purified dna rand draft not for open circulation 90 has been stored for less than year at 4c then it can go directly into the research cohort if an aliquot has been stored longer than year it must go through quality control test before being included in the research cohort the other four other vials are stored as whole

markets certain technologies knowhow it has developed for protecting analyzing and storing l quantities of specimens and data comparison of dod as described above and summarized in tables 51 and 52 there number of important similarities and differences between the dodsr and other biological repositories we highlight the following comparison the dodsr is by far the largest of all the repositories examined here its total size and annual rate of specimen acquisition are at least ten times those for the civilian repositories described in this chapter rand draft not for open circulation 91 the dodsr has wide range of purposes whereas most of the other repositories serve largely research purposes only nhanes also has surveillance mission similar only to nhanes general population and the afip dna registry military population the dodsr contains specimens that are statistically representative of defined population ie beyond research study population of these only d has serial specimens collected from the same individuals ie longitudinal specimen collection and is linked to medical records odsr however an appropriate irb must approve use of dodsr specimens for research purposes er in ther dried or liquid in all of these cases dna and rna can be captured in adequate all six of the comparison repositories but not dodsr store bloodderived specimens from which genetic material dna or rna can be retrieved reliably storage requirements are different for such specimens less rigorous temperatur requirements for dbs and in general colder temperature requirements for all other relevant blood fractions only decode stores whole blood and purified dna at higher temperatures than the 30 degrees celsius temperature at which the dodsr stores its serum specimens only dodsr specimens are collected without at least reading an informed consent and privacy statement even the dod dna specimens are collected following reading of these statements only specimens in the two dod repositories are collected without prior irb approval chapter highlights key points from this chapter include the following as described in this chapter white blood cells can be eith purified and stored as the buffy coat fraction or captured whole blood whole blood can be stored ei rand draft not for open circulation rand draft not for open circulation 92 amounts for todays technology and even perhaps tomorrows to use in genetic testing also as we describe here dried blood spots have several advantages one being simple collection processing and storage along with long term stability of dna whole blood provides buffy coat which in turn provides even larger amounts of dna and rna for genetic testing than dried blood spots comparison of the repositories we selected for this study table 52 shows that the dodsr is unique in that it stores sera at relatively warmer temperature than the others it is the only repository that stores only sera it is very large compared to the others and does not require informed consent while each of these differences does not indicate that the dodsr is not meeting the current best practices of the industry it does indicate that dod has opportunities to address each of these issues within its unique context to deliberately assess whether or not it is functioning as intended the dodsr will soon be forced to consider how it is going to acquire more space and as we discuss in the next chapter this presents an opportunity for dod to determine whether or not changes are warranted 93 table 51 comparison of general repository characteristics nhanes

chapter first describes conceptual framework that we used to organize our analytic process next we identify and assess potential improvement strategies grouped according to the various domains of the framework for each we summarize relevant current characteristics of the dodsrdmss system described in greater detail elsewhere in this report describe issues or problems derived from our analyses and key informant interviews and finally present potential strategies to address those issues potential improvements are described in terms of the questions to be addressed strategies to address them approach to implementation and potential advantages and disadvantages in chapter 7 we package the most promising strategies into practical recommendations for action conceptual framework chapter 4 describes in detail the capabilities of the dodsr and associated dmss system in terms of their functional and structural elements management timing of specimen collection specimens data and usersuses we used these concepts as the basis for organizing systematic process to capture current characteristics of these systems discuss them with persons interviewed both inside and outside the military and identify potential improvements these system elements are described briefly below and depicted in figure 61 the conceptual framework organizes the domains depicts their logical relationship to one another and facilitates identification of opportunities for improvement in the dodsrdmss system rand draft not for open circulation 98 management this domain includes the organization and staffing of

and archived from military service members figure 61 reflects number of administrative milestones that already do or could trigger specimen collection over the term of members service specimens processes related to specimens include collection processing transport initial testing storage retrieval and additional testing data this domain includes linkages of data into dmss and access to the data users and uses this domain includes the range of military and nonmilitary users of dmss data andor dodsr specimens and the range of potential uses of these resources rand draft not for open

system and potential improvement opportunities current system characteristics as described in detail in chapter 4 and issues raised about them during our interviews are summarized in the discussions that follow figures 62 and 63 represent populated versions of the conceptual framework shown in figure 61 depicting current dodsrdmss characteristics and potential improvements respectively rand draft not for open circulation 100 management current status amsa is the designated as the executive agent for military health surveillance dodd 64902 august 31 1997 and as such is the us militarys central epidemiological resource amsa manages the dodsr and dmss systems and the associated dmed database that can be accessed by military users outside of amsa consistent with amsas own guidelines access to repository specimens is ultimately the decision of the amsa director amsas guidelines provide information about submitting requests but do not address the precise decisionmaking process under current institutional requirements specimens are housed in leased space in silver spring md lease expires in 2010 the 25000 ft2 facility accommodates the current inventory of approximately 43 million specimens some of which have been reconfigured into compressed space due to storage space limitations and are thus less readily accessible issues identified amsas mission statement has explicit reference to deployment health surveillance nor to epidemiological investigations clinical support or research in interviews amsa staff and leadership frequently alluded to their surveillance mission suggesting it is the sole or at least primary mission for which they are resourced however the amsa mission statement describes very general surveillance activities without using the term surveillance or referring to deployment surveillance the army medical surveillance activitys amsa main functions are to analyze interpret and disseminate information regarding the status trends and determinants of the health and fitness of us military and militaryassociated populations and to identify and evaluate obstacles to medical readiness amsa is the central epidemiological resource for the us armed forces providing regularly scheduled and customerrequested analyses and reports to policy makers medical planners and researchers it identifies and evaluates obstacles to medical readiness by linking various databases that communicate information relevant to service rand draft not for open circulation 101 members experience that has the potential to affect their health amsa mission personal correspondence 28 january 2008 dod policy has defined broader set of mission areas for dmss and dodsr medical and deployment health surveillance including clinical diagnosis and epidemiological studies dodd 649002e october 21 2004 and deploymentrelated data from both garrison and deployed settings for dodwide surveillance and research asdha september 30 1999 thus policy seems to suggest that amsa as executive agent for dmss and dodsr must support the missions of not only medical and deployment health surveillance but also clinical management epidemiologic investigations and research toward development of measures for the prevention and control of diseases associated with military service dodd 649002e october 21 2004 although amsas mission statement does not refer explicitly to deployment health surveillance or even surveillance more broadly amsas guidelines for collecting maintaining requesting and using specimens stored in the department of defense serum repository reflect the full range of mission areas with the exception of deployment health as category for use of requested serum specimens it is important to note that chppm does not have the lead responsibility for research within the army that lies with the medical research and materiel command mrmc which is responsible for medical research development and acquisition medical information management and information technology medical logistics management and health facility planning mrmc is headquartered at fort detrick md and supports 14 laboratories and separate organizations throughout the united states six of the mrmc medical laboratories and institutes perform core science and technology research specializing in infectious diseases combat casualty care operational medicine and chemical and biological defense the military infectious disease research program focuses on vaccine development against diseases which threaten military personnel prophylactic and treatment drugs for infectious diseases techniques for identification of disease organisms and diagnosis of disease studies of vector controls and collection of epidemiological rand draft not for open circulation 102 data relevant to disease serum specimens stored in the dodsr and managed by amsachppm are relevant to military research which is managed by separate command mrmc analysis of our interviews suggests that there is lack of shared understanding within the army and across dod of both the mission and appropriate uses of the repository some interviewees felt that there is explicit vision for the repository perhaps reflecting the lack of common understanding of its full range of missions there is also lack of common understanding of the meaning of such missionsterms as surveillance and research to our knowledge critical nuances related to the definition and allowable scope of medical surveillance and research have not been clarified by central or even army guidance however amsas guidelines do begin to tease this out distinguishing between research and nonresearch studies thus the specific research mission for dmss and dodsr may be source of conflict for amsa whose name funding stream and work to date suggest it is surveillance entity yet it is the designated executive agent for dodsr and dmss programs that serve mission areas beyond surveillance alone including research thus to the extent that dodsr and dmss are used for research purposes amsa must have at least research support mission and the connections between research policy components eg mrmc and amsa must be reconciled this confusion plays out in the management of the serum repository the dodsr has set of published guidelines which define research as studies with the primary intention to create extend or validate generalizable knowledgethat is knowledge that applies to individuals populations or settings external to and not directly associated with the donors of specimens from which the knowledge is generateddodsr may 29 2003 pg 7 nonresearch is defined as studies that are specific to identified individuals or populations or settings that those populations represent the same guidelines signal that nonresearch study requests will be responded to more quickly than research indicating some sort of prioritizing dodsr may 29 2003 pg 7 amsas definition of nonresearch studies may help legitimize work undertaken by its own staff in response to requests for rand draft not for open circulation 103 dmss data analyses however even so there are true research studies that have also made good use of dmss data andor dodsr specimens see chapter 4 it is unclear if amsa staff feel conflicted about their authority to support such efforts given their surveillance mission and operational funding stream amsas organizational position potentially limits use of the repository amsa is buried deep within the armys medical command some interviewees commented on the organization and leadership of amsa as potentially limiting optimum use of the repository interviewees expressed hope that creation of the new afhsc will offer opportunities to overcome real or perceived organizational factors that may have impeded robust use of dodsr andor dmss in the past there is currently process in place to systematically review and integrate promising new technologies of relevance to the repository we found evidence of such process in our review of documents and interviews across the military small amsa staffing size may challenge amsas ability to fulfill even its primary surveillance mission requests for support to other mission areas also put pressure on amsas limited staff amsa staffing comprises mainly army and civilian personnel also according to amsa the deployments of at least three amsa military staff in recent years have led to more frequent staff turnover than usual leading some amsa staff to comment on issues of staffing strategies eg longer term billets or more civilian staffing that might better serve institutional continuity finally the almost exclusive military staffing by army personnel raised questions among some interviewees about the true tri service nature of amsa and the dodsrdmss system it oversees some contrasted amsa to geis whose staffing was often perceived as more diverse across services some interviewees expressed concern about lack of transparent procedures concerning access to specimens dodi 649003 august 2006 rand draft not for open circulation 104 calls for the secretary of the army to establish procedures to respond to requests for data and specimens while some interviewees noted that they had had problems in accessing repository specimens others expressed concern about what they perceived as difficult access or lack of transparent procedures amsa for its part was open to considering new mechanism that improves its oversight of the approval process for release of specimens in addition they noted concerns that time sensitive requests for specimens cannot be met consistently for example if recent predeployment specimens needed for an ongoing outbreak investigation have not yet arrived at the repository the mixing of uses and longterm storage of specimens without apparent communication to donors could be problematic for human subjects protection the protection of human subjects with regard to the serum repository generally involves two practices the use of an irb and the gaining of informed consent where appropriate from service members we have described in detail the intricacies of both practices as they relate to the collection storage and research or nonresearch use of stored sera see chapter 4 one of the key issues is that specimens are drawn for either hiv testing or pre and postdeployment surveillance and then later could potentially be used for research patient care public healthforce health protection and even criminal investigations related to this the sera are stored in perpetuity and there appears to be explicit communication of this to the individuals donating the specimen the mixing of uses and the enduring storage of the specimens all with apparent communication to the donors could be problematic finally the amsa guidelines that describe the various practices pertaining to each type of use of the sera are not explicit in all cases about whether consent is needed or even whether an irb is needed the current repository facility is not sufficient to support future growth approximately 43 million specimens have accumulated over the years of those approximately 55 million cannot be linked to records in dmss and most of these unlinked specimens have been placed in rand draft not for open circulation 105 compressed configuration in response to growing limitations in repository storage space the current repository facility does not provide sufficient space for further growth at present specimens are discarded amsa staff noted that selective culling of such specimens would be tedious and not necessarily result in major gains in storage space since sera are stored in boxes with multiple specimens each potential culling of older specimens was called into question by other interviewees who described the value of military serum specimens from the 1950s1960s stored elsewhere that had been very useful in studying the emergence of hepatitis c in any case the upcoming relocation of the repository once the current lease expires provides timely opportunity to consider space and other repository requirements into the future the dmss physical infrastructure and lack of backup pose risk of system malfunction or failure the facility used to house the dmss hardware and operations center is characterized by amsa analysts as not meeting industry standards and as containing vulnerabilities posing serious risk to system malfunction or failure such as leaks in the roof of the room housing the dmss server an incident in late january 2008 involving the dmss server emphasized the need for both physical protection of dmss hardware and facilities and robust backup mechanisms for the dmss database itself some amsa interviewees commented on the fragmented nature of hiv testing this testing is conducted by afioh the army retrovirology laboratory and viromed interviewee expressed dissatisfaction with the performance of any of these laboratories potential improvement strategies based on the problems identified there are several key questions related to aspects of program management could the use of dodsrdmss be improved through clarification or redefinition of the mission of amsa and dodsrdmss different organizational structure different size or skill set of amsa rand draft not for open circulation 106 staff andor different procedures for accessing serum specimens or data given the current storage space constraints what requirements for space should be sought for the new repository facility following expiration of the current lease should archived specimens be selectively culled what improvements can or should be made to current dmss operating facilities and hardware given the risks posed by the poor condition of the facilities that house the system should hiv testing be consolidated within dod the strategies described below address these questions strategy 1 clarify or redefine the mission of amsa and appropriate uses of dodsr and define relevant terms clearly this strategy involves clarification by appropriate military authorities of the scope of surveillance and research functions the full range of missions authorized for dmss and dodsr and implications for amsa does the mission of amsa itself need to be more explicit to include medical surveillance and deployment health surveillance including nearreal time medical surveillance from deployment areas and should it also explicitly include support to clinical management epidemiological investigations and research or is amsas current mission of dodsr and dmss oversight sufficient to support other dod entities in these additional mission areas after clarification at the policy level this information should be shared widely and incorporated into practice by amsa and its chain of command and shared with all current and potential users of dmss and dodsr dodwide this strategy may or may not require new policydoctrine in and of itself but the creation of the new afhsc and attendant requirements for updating relevant dod policy offers opportunities to be more explicit in describing and aligning the missions of dodsr dmss and their oversight organization the new afhsc communications will also require leadership to help assure clearer common understanding across dod of the full roles and responsibilities of amsa dmss and dodsr rand draft not for open circulation 107 which in turn should lead to more robust and efficient use of these important military resources there appear to be few if any disadvantages other than to note that supporting functionally expanded set of missions may require additional staffing discussed in strategy 3 below perhaps amsas guidelines distinguishing between research and nonresearch studies using dodsr specimens were aimed at least in part at reconciling their support to research studies as well as potential human subjects protection issues strategy 2 change the organizational structure in late february 2008 the deputy secretary of defense issued memorandum officially establishing the armed forces health surveillance center afhsc consolidating amsa and geis within an elevated single organizational unit whose director reports directly to the chppm commanding general the final structure of the organization is to become triservice this is an effort to further integrate military health surveillance both in terms of bringing together the complementary functions of amsa and geis and other surveillance organizations while the organization now officially exists we hope its name which suggests primary surveillance mission will not confuse potential users or impede the broader use of its assets as described throughout this report also while organizational restructuring may be deemed desirable broad experience with organizational restructuring suggests that it will likely not be sufficient to fully integrate surveillance and optimize use of the dodsrdmss resources also needed are continued strong leadership efforts to attract strong multiservice military staff and efforts to create normative change across the military in which the new afhsc helps the dodsrdmss achieve its full potential through clear mission and successful implementation perceived as timely and helpful by users further as technology advances and the needs of the services change the afhsc could play an ongoing oversight and monitoring role to manage process to determine when relevant new technologies such as those for collecting processing testing and storing biological specimens are ripe enough for practical use in the services rand draft not for open circulation 108 strategy 3 align staffing with mission expansion of the mission or uses of the dodsrdmss resources may require changes in the staffing pattern eg in terms of size and skill mix or expansion of relevant amsa contracts most notably the data analysis contracts beyond adding billets to amsas staff or resources to amsa contracts there may be lowcost ways to augment amsas staffing such as offering rotations to military preventive medicine residents andor epidemiology students from usuhs regardless of change in mission however drawing its highly qualified professional staff from across all services as geis has done for example may contribute to the positive perception and enhanced use of the repository across dod there may also be role for longer military tours for amsa analysts andor civilian staffing of relevant staff or leadership positions eg deputy director to optimize institutional continuity strategy 4 improve transparency in access to specimens the most reasonable approach to implementation of this strategy is probably consensus planning effort culminating in doctrine disseminated across dod as practical matter this could involve revision and reissuance of amsas current guidelines to add criteria for release of repository specimens or issuance of separate document with this information based on suggestions from various interviewees such procedures should also include an administrative fasttrack mechanism for approval and release of specimens needed on time sensitive basis such as investigation of an ongoing outbreak or for urgent clinical support such procedures should be thoroughly vetted captured in appropriate doctrine disseminated widely and followed in practice strategy 5 improve internal amsa oversight of dodsr specimen release amsa in particular expressed interest in an appropriately constituted group to help oversee the approval of release of repository specimens as well as independent of service irbs oversight of rand draft not for open circulation 109 ethicalhuman subjects issues relevant to the repository in fact such mechanism was suggested in the armed forces epidemiology board memorandum of april 2005 but apparently was never acted upon oversight of human subject protections is particularly important if use of repository specimens expands significantly beyond the original intended uses of its specimens eg research or other uses judged to require informed consent amsa may wish to consider establishing its own irb if it feels that an additional layer of human subjects review is warranted in addition to irb review the us national heart lung and blood institute has constituted an allocation committee that reviews requests for specimens see chapter 5 this allocation committee may provide relevant model for amsa for dealing with requests for serum specimens strategy 6 collect specimens with informed consent the current amsa guidelines are not explicit about all cases when consent may or may not be required in the cases when consent is not required guidelines specify that the specimens be delinked from individually identifying information currently and consistent with the waiver provision in existing legislation on privacy protection and informed consent specimens stored in dodsr are collected without informed consent for that reason in part specimens that are sent to researchers for research purposes are delinked from any identifiable information this also limits the utility of the specimens in the repository since there is way for researchers to request more of the same specimen and restricts research to strictly retrospective studies since it is not possible to obtain specimens from the same individual in the future once it has been delinked from identifiable information sera are drawn for either hiv testing or pre and postdeployment surveillance but can be used for other purposes and are stored in perpetuity none of this is apparently explained to service members as concerns about protecting the privacy of human subjects continue to be raised and to broaden the usefulness of the specimens in the repository dodsr should consider obtaining informed consent for the storage and research use of specimens in dodsr rand draft not for open circulation 110 also the dodsr is charged with the storage of specimens from service members and civilians in the military community the current amsa guidelines do not address the use of an irb in all described cases of use and when it does it relies on the irb approval of the requesting agency there is trend among repositories to either have an internal irb or to be closely affiliated with an outside irb therefore amsa may wish to pursue strategy to establish its own irb for the dodsr or become affiliated with triservice irb that would protect not only service members interests but ensure that protocols take in to consideration the protection of the military health system and the dodsr while still allowing for the conduct of appropriate research and non research strategy 7 determine requirements for the new repository once any modifications are made to plans for future collection andor archiving of specimens planners must determine the time horizon and associated requirements for space in the new repository facility for example if the current 25000 ft2 repository accommodates approximately 43 million specimens with some redundancy to mitigate potential equipment failure and with an acquisition rate of approximately 19 million new specimens per year then new repository configured similarly but with double the capacity should suffice for the next 23 years however if specimens are to be collected more frequently or for an extended period of time eg following separation then space requirements and planning horizon must take these new requirements into account this is timely juncture for undertaking such planning however since the current repository lease expires in 2010 and any new space requirements must be established soon strategy 8 protect the physical infrastructure and back up dmss an incident in late january 2008 involving dmss server emphasized the potential vulnerabilities of both the facility housing the dmss operation as well as the system hardware on which the dmss system currently operates an indepth assessment of the current facility and potential risks posed by the physical state of the facility should be rand draft not for open circulation 111 undertaken at the very least planning requirements for the new afhsc facility should provide for adequate housing and protection of the integrity of the database itself offsite back up systems as well as data mirroring are important ways to secure the continuity of dmss operations and maintain the integrity and utility of service member information securing the maintenance and integrity of dmss data is paramount to amsas ability to meet its stated mission objectives and continue to support military health in consistent and reliable manner strategy 9 consider consolidation of hiv testing from systems perspective dod could consider potential efficiencies to be gained by consolidating hiv screening in single eg military or contract laboratory however our analyses did not yield compelling justification for this strategy at present the laboratory with the highest throughput capacity is that of afioh and at present the wrair hiv laboratory currently performs all hiv testing for the european command under the base realignment and closure plans afioh is scheduled to be relocated to wrightpatterson afb in ohio several of those interviewed across the services commented on the potential desirability of colocating the laboratory and the repository including the possibility of establishing new laboratory for purposes of hiv screening and potentially other testing another option would be to colocate the afioh laboratory and new serum repository whether at the new afioh site in ohio or the new repository site in the national capital region where the new ahfsc will also reside if any colocation strategy is to be seriously considered decisions should be made relatively soon since both afioh and the serum repository facility will be relocated within the next few years further any benefits in either colocation of the laboratory and repository or consolidation of hiv screening in single military laboratory eg potential cost savings improved management efficiency increased military laboratory surge capacity should be weighed against the costs and administrative requirements associated with deviations from current plans military leadership will likely wish rand draft not for open circulation 112 to make any relevant planning decisions within the nearterm planning frame for the new afioh and repository facilities timing of specimen collection current status in general blood specimens are collected according to administrative milestones specimens are routinely collected and archived at accession pre and postdeployment and at separation as well as every two years for hiv screening specimens collected from routine medical encounters during deployments or post separation are archived issues identified most military interviewees were satisfied with the current frequency and timing of specimen collection from service members indeed the armed forces epidemiology board now the defense health board endorsed in 2005 continuation of the universal sampling and current timing of pre and postdeployment specimen collection most of the military interviewees did not see good reason to collect routine hiv specimens more frequently or on dates tagged to birth month nor to collect and archive additional specimens from routine medical encounters other than those from which specimens are already required or theater operations interviewees expressed divergent views regarding the desirability of ongoing specimen collection from separated members enrolled in the va health system this group represents an estimated 8 million of the approximately 25 million eligible according to the va such individuals tend to remain within the va health care system for life thus extending the longitudinal coverage of service members for years or decades beyond their active duty policy makers in osd and the va expressed strong support while at least one amsa staff member expressed reservations seemingly based on perceived administrative complexity amsa did suggest however that they would be supportive of continued specimen collection from separated military members treated at mtfs rand draft not for open circulation 113 potential improvement strategies based on the issues discussed the key questions related to the timing of specimen collection concern the frequency of specimen collection and the extension of collection beyond active duty is there any reason to change the frequency of specimen collection is there justifiable benefit in extending specimen collection from separated service members followed in mtfs andor the va health system the strategies described below address these questions strategy 10 change the frequency or timing of specimen collection from purely systems perspective factors that could potentially be changed are the timing or frequency of specimen collection eg tying hiv screening systematically to birth month rather than more random twoyear sampling or collecting specimens annually rather than every two years however as with any potential change the potential merits and justification must be weighed against the administrative or other drawbacks most interviewees did not advise any change they feel that the hiv screening and pre and postdeployment specimens meet current needs the rand team also found compelling justification for changes in the timing or frequency of specimen collection strategy 11 extend routine specimen collection beyond separation two implementation options not mutually exclusive include extending systematic specimen collection on voluntary basis from separated military members followed at mtfs an estimated 2 million members separated from active duty currently enrolled in tricare prime or eligible for tricare for life combined dod task force december 20 2007 and doing the same for the even larger group of separated service members followed by the va health system estimated 8 million currently enrolled cbo december 2007 decision regarding this strategy should be made relatively soon however so that planning for the new repository space can accommodate any new space requirements it is also possible that specimens collected through the va system could be rand draft not for open circulation 114 archived elsewhere eg through the va but in any case both specimens and data collected by the va and mtfs should be linked to dmss to assure the seamless longitudinal nature of data and specimens from service members through their years of active duty and postseparation if such strategy is contemplated dod should also consider the epidemiologic value of such specimens of convenience as compared to more methodologically rigorous establishment of cohorts of separated service members which would be considerably more complicated from practical point of view specimens current status currently specimens that ultimately reach the repository are collected in single tube and usually processed within 2448 hours of collection shelf time before initial processing may vary depending on individual versus mass specimen collection serum is extracted and tested for hiv initial hiv testing is performed by viromed the laboratory contractor for usbased army and navymarine specimens afioh for all air force specimens or the armys retrovirology laboratory for specimens coming from europe the army and navymarines have separate contracting processes but currently both employ viromed serum remaining after hiv screening usually about 23 cc is sent to the repository shipping temperature requirements are in place but they are not rigorously monitored the amsa transport contractor picks up specimens approximately every two months from the viromed in minnesota and from afioh in texas and then transports them in refrigerated truck to the repository in maryland specimens are shipped and stored frozen in walkin freezers maintained at 30c specimens are retrieved manually from the walkin freezers upon first request for specimen from the repository there is single freezethaw cycle for aliquoting the specimen is thawed divided into multiple 05cc aliquots and then used for further analyses or frozen and stored at 30c until it is needed serum specimens are released as 05cc aliquots to approved users for approved testing purposes rand draft not for open circulation 115 issues identified variations exist in specimen processing and transport conditions there are significant variations and lack of standardization in the length of time specimens sit at the mtf before being processed ie spun down to obtain serum and the transport time 24 48 hours of serum from the mtf to the testing laboratory in addition several interviewees from both amsa and across military services commented on problems of timeliness in the repositorys receiving recently obtained specimens eg accession or predeployment specimens needed for investigation of outbreaks the twomonthly schedule for transport of specimens to the repository contributes to delays in the accessibility of such specimens eg to support realtime outbreak investigations the finite size of the archived serum specimens limits the number of uses from single specimen this point was noted by number of interviewees the current 05cc aliquot size means that given 23cc serum specimen can only be used 46 times at dodsr storing the specimens in 23cc vials requires freethaw cycle before the specimen reaches the end user freezing and thawing biological specimens can impact the measurement of many components of the specimen including biomarkers and genetic material some other repository models minimize the freezethaw cycles of their specimens some interviewees noted the utility of archiving other blood fractions most of the specimenrelated discussions with interviewees focused on the utility of serum specimens as currently stored and the desirability or not of archiving other bloodderived specimens most notably fractions that would retain adequate genetic material indeed in 2005 the armed forces epidemiology board recommended the preservation of wbc for this purpose but there has been apparent action on that recommendation there are clearly considerations related to policy logistics and cost associated with any such change several interviewees expressed interest in collecting dried whole blood spots on filter paper such specimens offer promising opportunities to retain genetic rand draft not for open circulation 116 material and are associated with only modest requirements for space and storage conditions the inclusion of new types of specimen in the repository would most certainly mean different storage requirements and perhaps also different retrieval processes both of which should be considered in light of the anticipated relocation of the repository if new types of specimens are contemplated alternate storage conditions must also be considered the current repository stores serum specimens at 30 c which also permits the use of large walkin freezers if new types of specimens or different storage conditions for serum specimens are contemplated associated new requirements must also be considered as amsa secures new repository facility within the next several years for example storage at colder temperature such as 80c would not permit walkin freezers some interviewees supported the possibility of conducting screening beyond hiv some amsa interviewees raised the possibility of running routine panel of tests on serum specimens before they are refrozen and stored potential improvement strategies based on the issues discussed the key questions related to blood specimens concern the cold chain maintenance of specimens timeliness of transport to the repository finite size of archived sera number of required freezethaw cycles the potential for other routine screening tests the desirability of retaining additional blood fractions that would permit wider range of testing and storage temperature of the specimens how could the cold chain be monitored better how can accessibility to recently collected specimens be improved given that it may be impractical to collect and store larger specimens greater volume of serum should smaller aliquots be considered can the number of freezethaw cycles be reduced as another way to preserve testable analytes in the specimens rand draft not for open circulation 117 should new routine screening tests be added should additional blood fractions be retained and if so are potential new requirements justified should specimens from other studies be archived in the central repository or at least be accessible through links into dmss the strategies described below address these questions strategy 12 improve the cold chain custody of specimens specimens are collected throughout the country and world at mtfs clinics hospitals etc and shipped to afioh wrair hiv laboratory or viromed for testing however laboratory personnel do not have adequate cold chain custody for specimens there is way to determine if the specimens were maintained at controlled temperatures before they arrive at the testing facility there are simple devices that can track the temperature of shipment continuously or track the highest temperature that package reached during transit either of these options would allow laboratory personnel to know whether the specimens have been compromised by reaching high temperature levels once tested specimens from afioh and viromed are frozen and shipped to the repository in refrigerated truck specimens from wrair hiv laboratory are delivered to dodsr weekly on dry ice it would also be useful to maintain records of the refrigerated truck temperature as afioh and viromed specimens are being transported strategy 13 increase the frequency of specimen shipment to the repository increasing the frequency of specimen shipment eg from the current twomonthly schedule to monthly could be achieved through modification of the current amsa contract or purchase of vehicle for this purpose while we understand that vehicle was recently purchased for this purpose we are not sure if this is actually the case and that specimen shipments are now more frequent we therefore decided to include this strategy either option ie more frequent transport by the contractor or purchase of truck for specimen transport increases rand draft not for open circulation 118 the cost to the military either onetime or recurring however timelier archiving of specimens can potentially render the repository more relevant for realtime support of serosurveillance investigations and clinical management amsa should consider the most desirable timing and efficient mechanism for transport of specimens to the repository in lieu of more frequent shipments another option would be to develop policy to allow expedited shipment of specimens from the testing laboratories for special circumstances when specimens are needed quickly strategy 14 reduce the number of routine freezethaw cycles the measurement of biomarkers in blood specimens has become an integral component of many epidemiologic studies as noted above freezing and thawing biological specimens can impact the measurement of many components of the specimen including biomarkers and genetic material mitchella et 2005 most repositories and researchers minimize the number of times specimen is frozen and thawed in addition nhanes takes part of their specimens and freezes aliquots in liquid nitrogen to save as pristine specimen dodsr procedures could change to provide for aliquoting the specimens before they are frozen and shipped to the storage facility this would increase costs associated with storage and shipping strategy 15 reduce the sizevolume of serum aliquots released for testing with current testing methods the volume of specimens required for testing has been reduced although it varies by analyte and test protocol currently dodsr sends all requestors 05cc aliquot for many tests smaller volume would be sufficient for instance aliquots of 025cc would double the number of specimens available from an individual specimen for rare cases that 05cc aliquots are actually required 2 vials could be sent however the issue of running out of specimens has not been problem with the repository to date and will only be an issue if dodsr significantly increases the number of specimens that are provided to researchers and other users however increasing the number rand draft not for open circulation 119 of aliquots by decreasing their size may require additional storage space strategy 16 perform standard set of tests on serum specimens if amsa wants to be more proactive in performing surveillance with the specimens in the dodsr set of predetermined tests could be performed on all or subsets of the specimens as they are collected this would allow amsa personnel to perform more immediate surveillance activities other repositories such as nhanes perform standard set of biological tests on the blood specimens they collect and the results of these tests are then made available to researchers who request data and specimens in addition those researchers are often required to submit the results of their tests back to the repository which then become part of the data available to other researchers this strategy would require new laboratory andor financial resources to support new routine panel of tests it is not clear that all potentially worthwhile routine tests could be identified in advance and if these would remain constant over time the advantages of this strategy would be the availability of more routine test results from each specimen or selected specimens from which to perform routine surveillance and reduction in the freezethaw cycles before having such results the disadvantages relate mostly to resources financial human and laboratory nonetheless it may be worthwhile to ask an appropriately constituted military body to consider this question in more detail to identify potentially useful tests and specific advantages and disadvantages and then to weigh these carefully and offer recommendations strategy 17 collect and archive blood fractions that permit wider range of testing other repositories collect and store wider range of specimens including whole blood plasma serum white blood cells often as buffy coat and purified dna specimens while there are wide range of tests that can be performed on serum some tests require the use of whole blood or plasma the type of material stored is determined in most rand draft not for open circulation 120 cases by the types of tests required the dodsr has mission to engage in medical surveillance and support the prevention and control of diseases relevant to the military using avian influenza surveillance and related research as an example studies could be conducted on military service members who have been deployed to countries that have experienced avian influenza outbreaks to determine if any service members have been exposed serum stored in dodsr could be tested to determine exposure by determining whether any service members had developed an antibody response to avian influenza this information could then be matched with their medical records to see if they had an influenzalike illness during their deployment testing for human influenza subtypes is already being undertaken in similar manner if the dod considers this testing fully sufficient for medical surveillance and disease prevention and control purposes then serum specimens as currently collected and stored most likely are adequate however should the dod feel that more indepth study of factors potentially predisposing or protecting service members from infectious diseases such as influenza or that other biological and chemical threats are worthy of surveillance then it might consider the addition of specimens which contain dna and rna serum and plasma are not good sources of genetic material for either dna or rna testing for example if the dodsr stored genetic material it could be used to help determine if some people have genotype that makes them more or less susceptible to infection or is predictor of more severe illness caused by avian influenza knowledge of service members susceptibility to avian influenza would be useful in multiple ways genetic screening tool could be developed to screen service members before deployment to areas susceptible to avian influenza susceptible service members could either receive prophylactic treatment to prevent infection or reassigned to not include deployment to high risk areas the knowledge of genotypes could lead to the development of different vaccines for different people in all of these cases access to genetic material would be necessary purifying and then storing dna from all specimens would be cost prohibitive however collecting and storing buffy coat or whole blood are both options and allow for the later purificationisolation of dna rand draft not for open circulation 121 and rna buffy coat and plasma can both be obtained from the same tube of blood in this case separate tube of blood would be required to be collected from the person if serum were still required however hiv testing is possible on plasma and the resulting plasma could be stored for follow on testing instead of serum if whole blood is stored it can be collected and stored in two ways either in liquid form from venipuncture or as blood spot collected on filter paper for both buffy coat and whole blood in liquid form the specimens would need to be stored at 80c or colder to be useful for range of testing including purifying genetic material according to review by the uk biobank sample handle and storage subgroup dried blood spots dbs offer the most stable storage format for dna in blood studies have also shown that rna can be isolated and assayed from dbs zhang and mccabe may 1992 uttayamakul et september 2005 baumann et june 2005 dbs are commonly stored on filter paper at 20c with desiccant to minimize humidity although they can be stored at 4c as well mei et may 2001 strategy 18 change the storage temperature of the dodsr while the current storage temperature of 30c is adequate for many analytes it does not adequately maintain the integrity of all of the analytes available for testing in serum rai aj et alhupo plasma proteome project specimen collection and handling towards the standardization of parameters for plasma proteome specimens proteomics 2005 aug513326277 proper specimen storage is critical to maintaining specimen integrity and to be able to perform broader range of tests to be more confident in the results of those tests the serum specimens should be stored at 80c or colder as noted in strategy 17 if other fractions are collected and stored especially for analysis of dna andor rna at minimum 80c is required to maintain their integrity dbs are the exception and can be stored at 2030c with desiccant without loss of information rand draft not for open circulation 122 data current status dmss is amsas data hub and the sole data link to the dodsr dmss is also the sole custodian of deployment health forms dmss is strictly unclassified database that draws different types of data from several sources as described in detail in chapter 4 and summarized below dmss draws data from several sources and retains such data permanently according to amsa interviewees some of the original data sources do not retain data permanently dmss data are deidentified and made available as the defense medical epidemiology database dmed to users outside of amsa dmss includes data related to demographic and administrative details hiv testing pre and postdeployment health assessments immunizations and inpatient and outpatient encounters from garrison settings issues identified some interviewees cited data quality and connection issues several interviewees commented on the inaccuracy and hence lack of reliability of military data with one characterizing the problem as leviathan such problems cascade into all military data systems including dmss solutions to such problems must be recognized by amsa and others but remediation is beyond the purview of amsa alone interviewees from amsa and asdha commented on data missing from dmss amsa is slowly completing the data entry from paper records for early specimens in the archive amsa is also currently incorporating more data into dmss from routine inpatient and outpatient medical encounters including diagnoses and pharmacy actions incorporation of laboratory data is vexed by the lack of standardization of laboratory testing and reporting across the department deploymentrelated health data are lacking the lack of deploymentrelated data from theater settings represents gap of particular concern in dmss at present data of interest include health data eg from the disease and nonbattle injury dnbi database timely triservice medical event reporting clinical encounters as recorded in the ahltat platform and detailed location data rand draft not for open circulation 123 dmss links to classified data pose problems while both the accuracy and availability of personnel location data are problematic highresolution personspecific location data during active theater operations through the defense theater accountability system dtas is generally classified for at least several months in fact all data from the field arrive via the classified system but according to sources in asdha only the specific location data fields are actually classified this may be one obstacle to the availability of unclassified location data and timely broader deploymentrelated data feeds into dmss data classification may also be an obstacle for connecting mortality surveillance data into dmss we understand that the theater medical data store is an unclassified data system which may currently or soon contain deployment surveillance data that could be linked into dmss there are opportunities for additional linkages to other military biological specimen collections our interviews uncovered and explored potential linkages into dmss of specimens collected for other purposes and archived elsewhere within the military that could through dmss be linked to both data and serum repository specimens for specific service members ifas needed examples include nhrcs collection of isolates and original throat swab specimens from its febrile respiratory illness surveillance program the armed forces institute of pathology afip mortality surveillance divisions necropsy specimens and afips pathology specimens at least one of these sources expressed interest in pursuing the potential linkage of such specimens through dmss and even their availability to complement serum specimens archived by amsa there are probably other relevant specimen archives elsewhere within the military services not uncovered through the rand teams document review and interviews in contrast to the generally perceived desirability of dmss data links for specimens archived elsewhere there were somewhat divergent views among interviewees regarding storage in the repository of specimens collected for other purposes eg related to specific studies for example some expressed interest in collecting and storing specimens from the militarys current millennium cohort study overseen rand draft not for open circulation 124 by nhrc involves 1500 active duty members to be followed over 20 years15 from which specimens are not being collected however another military scientist noted that as the source of repository specimens widens the nature of the specimens and hence the standardization of collection and processing procedures may be compromised potentially reducing the comparability of specimens that may be selected for subsequent testing data on behavioral risk factors are not available one interviewee suggested linking behavioral risk factors that may be of interest to acute andor chronic diseases such data are not available through systems currently feeding into dmss such as periodic health assessments or pre and postdeployment assessments although we learned that dod does collect such data the survey of healthrelated behaviors among military personnel has collected behavioral risk data from active duty members in several cycles since 1980 the survey was extended in 2005 to include reserve component personnel however these data are collected anonymously and as such could not be linked to memberspecific records in dmss it would be important to ascertain whether survey data could be collected in such way that data could be linked to individual service member records or whether selected questions could be added to non anonymous data collection tools such as pre and postdeployment health assessment forms access to dmss is limited several interviewees commented that they do not use dmss some expressed discontent that the identified data they send to dmss is not accessible to them via dmed which is identified and the only database made accessible outside amsa their workaround is to directly obtain the broad range of needed data from such sources as the defense management data center dmdc and other channels 15 source accessed 24 january 2008 at httpwwwmillenniumcohortorgendorsementsphp rand draft not for open circulation 125 potential improvement strategies based on the issues discussed the key actionable questions related to dmss data concern lack of connections to certain relevant data sources especially deployment related data from theater settings and data links to other dod biological specimen archives the desirability and ability to capture relevant behavioral risk information potential obstacles associated with classified information and access by military health users outside amsa to sufficiently detailed data through dmss what other data sources should be fed into dmss should behavioral risk factor data be captured by dmss and if so how how important are classified data elements and how can desirable classified data be handled within dmss can and should access to dmss be enhanced the strategies described below address these questions strategy 19 link additional relevant data sources into dmss in reliable and timely manner first step in this strategy would be establishment of criteria to guide decisions regarding new connections to dmss such criteria should begin with meeting requirements specified throughout relevant military policy especially deployment health data from theater settings other criteria could include potential benefits eg the relevance of specific new data elements to meet the potentially redefined mission and range of uses of dodsr and dmss in support of force health protection weighed against potential challenges eg data classification delays in data availability interoperability of data systems an alternative to this systematic process is simply to identify desired new data several examples are mentioned above and then proceed to determine how to feed such data into dmss it will then be important to review current inventory of all military databases and their data content and wiring diagrams to determine the best sources of needed data rand draft not for open circulation 126 strategy 20 connect other military specimen collections into dmss this strategy first involves canvassing or inventory of potentially relevant specimen collections currently stored across dod and then assessing the desirability and feasibility of linking them to dmss so that analyses based on these specimens could use the dmss database or even making those other specimens available for further testing in conjunction with testing of serum from the same service members criteria for such assessments could include size and retrievability of specimens and the nature and degree of incremental benefit that the new specimens themselves or at least linkages to dmss might provide strategy 21 capture behavioral risk factor information in dmss the first question is the extent to which such information would add relevant value weighed against the obstacles in obtaining such information the second question would then be how to do so two potential options include changing the longstanding and comprehensive military survey mentioned above from anonymous to nonanonymous status or collection of selected data elements via current nonanonymous tools such as the pre and postdeployment health and periodic health assessment forms the first option may not be practical since the surveys procedures and guarantees of anonymity are well established addition of selected questions to current forms is feasible but would take considerable administrative effort including required approval from washington headquarters servicesdirectorate for information operations and reports for changing the content of any of these forms considerations should include the types of behavioral risk data most relevant to surveillance epidemiological investigation clinical support and military health research the volume of current and projected demand for such data and the likelihood that information would be truthfully reported eg may be an issue for reporting alcohol or drug use but perhaps less an issue for tobacco use diet or physical activity an appropriately constituted military body should consider the questions related to behavioral risk factor data in greater rand draft not for open circulation 127 detail and weigh potential benefits against administrative and other drawbacks before recommending for or against new data collection that might subsequently be linked into dmss strategy 22 overcome obstacles to inclusion of classified data elements if all relevant data can be obtained from the theater medical data store that would be the easiest solution to overcome current limitations ascribed to housing of such data exclusively within classified systems however if data are indeed needed from classified systems there are at least three possible approaches to implementation of this strategy first the entire dmss database could reside and operate within the classified environment and be accessible by others via the siprnet this would require new policydoctrine and new secure communication facilities at least for the central amsa database the advantages would be access to broader range of data most specifically timely detailed and personspecific location data during deployments however all current dmss data and the overwhelming majority of any future dmss data are currently unclassified permanent residence and operation of dmss within the classified environment may limit the number of otherwise relevant military users second approach to implementation is modular one in which the main dmss database is maintained within the current unclassified environment but is mirrored into the classified system and linked to classified data elements on either an asneeded or systematic basis to permit analyses involving protected data fields this is particularly relevant to deployment health to track health in timely way during ongoing deployments dmss is already required to house such information but currently does not to fully meet this requirement amsa will require secure communications facility similar arrangements would be needed if the full dmss database were available outside of amsa it is important for the broader range of dmss data including classified data to be available to relevant users when needed and for amsa to retain oversight of the dmss database it is also important to maintain routine rand draft not for open circulation 128 operations and access within the unclassified environment thus unclassified and classified versions of dmss both maintained by amsa will likely optimize the number and range of military users third option would be to maintain strictly unclassified dmss system which incorporates personnel location information once it becomes declassified while logistically simpler approach toward the goal of capturing this information the disadvantages are the delays until sensitive theater information is declassified and made available to unclassified data systems such as dmss such delays would jeopardize timesensitive clinical management and epidemiological investigation needs strategy 23 expand access to dmss expanding access to dmss beyond amsa staff can be accomplished in different ways amsa already hosts affiliated analysts who perform targeted analyses of special interest eg mental health wrair and deployment health deployment health support directorate under force health protection and readiness within osd if dmss is made available to remote users privacy protections must be extended beyond the current central dmss site to any other sites where dmss resides or is accessed this is not critical factor for the more readily available online dmed database which includes aggregated and deidentified data first option would be to expand the number of service liaisons and affiliated analysts working out of amsa and directly accessing dmss this would enhance amsas triservice visibility and operations while also broadening the amsabased staff using the central dmss database to perform broad range of relevant analyses needed both by individual services as well as dodwide second option would be to mirror the dmss database into each services surveillance hub or other designated site with appropriate privacy protections and procedures as specified and followed by amsa itself this would permit direct access by single site from each services own location third and related option would be to broaden dmss access even further similar to the rand draft not for open circulation 129 range of access now available online for dmed by web enabling the data and query systems and controlling its use via password protections last approach and the main one in current practice is for all analyses requiring identifiable data to be performed by amsa staff upon request because several interviewees expressed concerns about their access to dmss itself this last option is probably the least desirable because it poses greatest pressure on the small amsa staff resulting in less timely andor less robust range of analyses from dmss and does not fully satisfy external users who prefer to undertake their own analyses use current status amsa and small number of liaison and periodic affliliated analyst staff working out of amsas offices are the sole users of the central dmss database which has data with individual identifiers mostly for linking to specimens and for clinical and other support amsa converts dmss into deidentified database dmed for other users dmed provides aggregated data mostly from outpatient inpatient and immunization databases the full range of users of dmss and dmed has included amsa internal research eg seroepidemiology military researchers uniformed services university for the health sciences wrair us army medical research institute for infectious diseases walter reed army medical center clinicians dmss data only for individual patient management the military vaccine agency armed forces epidemiology board now defense health board and health surveillance hubs afioh nhrc geis serum specimens are available for use by military researchers civilian researchers must partner with military counterparts to access the specimen repository in addition patients can request their specimens for medical purposes but the request must come through their physician if it is civilian physician the request needs to go through military physician to gain access to the specimen and informed consent must be obtained from the patient dmss data and dodsr specimens have been used for surveillance outbreak investigation clinical management and military research rand draft not for open circulation 130 typically single specimens are requested eg for clinical support or to compare with specimens from ongoing investigations longitudinal specimens are much less frequently requested moreover requests for amsa analyses from dmss data far exceed the number of requests for serum specimens over 175 serum studies were approved by amsa through early february 2008 mostly for research and mostly including civilian researchers and occasionally from policy making components such as the defense health board and surgeon generals offices issues identified numerous interviewees both within amsa and across services commented that the repository is national treasure that is seriously underutilized and whose value has not yet been fully realized interestingly several interviewees had personally used the serum repository for research studies or investigations including studies on chronic diseases all of them reported good experiences and high value of the repository interviewees commented directly and indirectly about the limited volume of demand for serum specimens stored in dodsr and the potential for greater use data from amsa indicate that they received approximately 180 different requests for specimens between 2001 and january 2008 or an average of about 25 requests per year underutilization of dodsr could derive from several potential causes interviewees suggested several possible reasons for under utilization of the repository first some commented that military health personnel especially clinicians are largely unaware of the repository countering this others expressed concern about managing or accommodating greatly increased demand second utilization of the repository may be due in part to perceived mismatch between range of missions for dodsr as defined in policy and perceived areas of value as expressed by interviewees and the surveillance mission of amsa which oversees dodsr for example some interviewees commented that the serum repository has role in surveillance or situational awareness based on perception of surveillance within realtime time frame in rand draft not for open circulation 131 contrast amsa staff consider comparison of pre and postdeployment specimens surveillance function some interviewees also commented that the repository is not valuable for real time deployment health and that systematic testing of preand postdeployment specimens is not carried out however another interviewee countered that infectious diseases for which the serum specimens are most relevant are not proving to be major health problem in current theater operations even chronic disease research studies most often have examined infectious disease markers antibodies from serum specimens looking at potential infectious disease precursors to selected chronic diseases nearly all interviewees consider the repository valuable for both outbreak investigations and research indeed one military group commented that the repository is not very valuable because dods main focus is operational support whereas the repository is well suited to support research to improve force health protection which may not be viewed as operational support thus limiting either by perception or in reality the use of the dodsr for research indeed several interviewees commented on the great value and largely untapped potential of the longitudinal specimens available through the repository finally there were differing views regarding the utility of the repository for clinical support interviewees expressed mixed views on whether repository specimens should be made more accessible for civilian research more than one interviewee raised the possibility of making repository specimens more readily available to civilian researchers including more active use by the veterans health administration va however others expressed potential concerns with broadening access other than potentially to the va eg because of the limited number of aliquots per specimen risk of deviating from military mission or interests and complications introduced if any funding for additional repository support in exchanges for increased repository access might come from nonmilitary sources as result of opening access beyond the military rand draft not for open circulation 132 potential improvement strategies based on the issues discussed the key questions related to use of the repository and dmss data concern underutilization of specimens for variety of potential reasons including lack of awareness lack of consensus regarding appropriate uses of serum specimens which may be associated in part with the mismatch between amsas stated surveillance mission and limited staff size versus potential research uses and lack of value or use in support of deployment health another key question concerns the under utilization of multiplelongitudinal serial specimens from the repository should efforts be made to raise awareness of the repository especially among military health personnel similarly among civilian researchers how can the repository be more useful to deployment health how can longitudinal nature of the serum specimens be used to greatest advantage the strategies described below address these questions strategy 24 raise awareness of dodsr and dmss information campaigns to raise awareness of dodsr and dmss can broaden the user base and increase the use of these resources communications efforts can selectively target groups relevant to specific uses eg clinicians for clinical support uses alternatively they can take broader approach to educate the entire military health community and others regarding the availability and full range of uses of these specimen and data resources once the mission and full range of appropriate uses of the repository and dmss database are clarified or redefined information about the availability of and procedures for accessing these resources can be widely disseminated amsa can take the lead for such efforts including renewed encouragement to their service surveillance hub counterparts to enhance their use of the repository and dmss resources other appropriate entities can also help raise awareness eg the joint preventive medicine policy group for surveillance investigation and research uses tricare management activity service surgeon generals offices and the va for clinical rand draft not for open circulation 133 support uses the uniformed services university of the health sciences and potentially others for research uses andor relevant officials within the office of the secretary of defense such as the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs or the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness the deployment health centers nhrc research and walter reed army medical center clinical can also contribute to raising awareness across broader range of relevant military users the advantages of this strategy include more robust use of what has been widely acknowledged as valuable but underutilized military resource however increased demand for specimens may lead to more rapid drawdown of available serum aliquots and further burden amsas current small staff such disadvantages could be mitigated by other improvement strategies such as release of smaller aliquots and more robust staffing of amsa including military staff from other services ifas required to meet an expanded mission or level of demand strategy 25 coordinate actions to increase the utility of the repository and dmss for deployment health because military policy eg dodd 649003 dodd 649002e usdpr memorandum of april 2003 mcm000602 jcs memorandum of february 2002 emphasizes the importance of deployment health and requires timely submission of data to dmss and specimens to the repository enhancing the use and perceived value of these resources in support of deployment health should be particular priority especially acquisition of relevant data from deployed settings based on our analyses and comments from interviewees implementation of this strategy could involve number of potential specific actions fully implement current requirements for timely feeds of relevant deployment health data into dmss eg dnbi triservice medical event reports data from medical encounters as recorded on dd form 2766 and via the ahlta t platform and personspecific location information declassified with 60 day delay or more timely classified location data requiring classified version of dmss as described in strategies 19 and 22 above rand draft not for open circulation 134 reinforce communications to the other deployment health centers and to other relevant users including the va regarding the availability and utility of the dodsr and dmss in support of deployment health especially if relevant new data are fed into dmss and on more timely basis increase the systematic analysis and reporting on trends specifically linked to deployments especially based on the new data linkages from theater environments as noted above more resourceintensive strategy would be proactive and systematic testing of pre and post deployment serum specimens all or relevant specimen for infectious disease surveillance purposes this could be done by amsa other service surveillance hubs other deployment health centers the va or other relevant military health personnel strategy 26 broaden civilian access to the specimen repository including va and other researchers there are both incremental and broad approaches to implementing this strategy for example first priority might be to raise awareness and use of dmss andor the repository among the va medicalhealth community either selectively eg for clinical support to individuals or more broadly eg for the full range of uses of the data or serum specimens individual medical management public health investigation or research for health or clinical management policy for service members on active duty or separated this incremental approach maintains the strong military focus of the specimen and data resources while extending access beyond the dod itself while amsa provides deployment health form data to the va for separating service members more of the va health community including its leadership should be made aware of their access to dmss and dodsr resources broader approach to this strategy would be to make the data andor specimen resources more available to civilian researchers either rand draft not for open circulation 135 passively make aware but do not actively advertise or actively advertise availability further civilian researchers could still be required to partner with military coprincipal investigator or not and the proposed research could be required to demonstrate relevance to the military or not combinations of these various options could result in narrow to broad expansion of nondod users of dmss data andor specimens however human subjects protection becomes an increasing issue and challenge ifas use expands beyond surveillance and investigation purposes and beyond military users purely civilian research not directly tied to military priorities may prove to be an obstacle for ethical reasons unless human subjects protection issues can be resolved strategy 6 proposes ways to address human subject protections military leadership may wish to consider this issue more comprehensively by asking an appropriately constituted group to review the different options and their associated implications and offer more specific policy recommendations strategy 27 increase use of serial specimens from the repository since serial specimens beyond strictly paired specimens are of greatest value for longitudinal research and because both the dodsr and dmss are longitudinal in nature these resources provide unique opportunities for surveillance and research drawing upon longitudinal population sampling design assuming the continued legitimacy of research use for the specimens the awareness raising efforts described in strategy 24 would be appropriate military health leadership and appropriately constituted groups could help raise awareness across the military and va healthmedical research community with particular focus on the unique large and serial nature of the serum repository the uniformed services university of the health sciences could also play key role in both promoting and using specimens for appropriate longitudinal studies rand draft not for open circulation 136 chapter highlights the dodsr and dmss have already demonstrated their value to military health surveillance and to military health more broadly nonetheless this systematic review has led to the identification of potential ways to further improve the use and hence value of these resources several of the improvement strategies described above are interdependent so they should not be considered purely independently based on the review in this chapter alone package of improvement strategies could include the following explicit clarification of the mission and authorized uses of the dodsr and dmss to include surveillance clinical support investigation and research in support of force health protection deployment health and the health of separated service members communications to promote common understanding of the meaning of such terms as surveillance and research as they relate to the dodsr and dmss in particular and to promote use of these resources more timely availability of specimens from dodsr establishment of clear criteria and procedures for accessing dodsr specimens linkages of new data sources to dmss particularly health and other data from ongoing deployments expanded access to dmss ongoing collection of specimens on voluntary basis from separated service members followed at mtfs or through the va health system archiving of new bloodderived specimens that reliably retain genetic material for future testing including biomarkers and tests yet to be identified and developed final determination of location space and other requirements for the new repository rand draft not for open circulation 137 the discussion and recommendations in the following chapter aim to consolidate and suggest priorities for consideration by military authorities figure 62 summary of current dodsrdmss system elements and characteristics rand draft not for open circulation 138 figure 63 summary of potential improvements in dodsrdmss system elements and characteristics rand draft not for open circulation 139 rand draft not for open circulation 140 chapter 7 synthesis and recommendations it is clear from document review and interviews with broad range of staff throughout dod that amsa has been good steward of the dodsr and dmss resources and has used them well in support of military medical surveillance in particular however the goal of this study was to help identify opportunities to make even better use of these resources in addressing military health needs now and into the future our analyses have uncovered specific opportunities to better fulfill current requirements especially to close gaps in the content and efficiency of medical surveillance the largest gap relates to data from deployed settings which figures prominently within the strategies described in the previous chapter and the recommendations presented here our report also describes the larger context for dod surveillance which is important to consider as potential improvements in the dodsr and dmss components are contemplated ie medical surveillance together with occupational and environmental health surveillance constituting health surveillance and these all within the even larger context of comprehensive health surveillance which encompasses the entire career of service across all locations beyond surveillance we have also identified specific ways to position the dodsr and dmss resources to better serve the military of the future planning now for changes that will permit wider range of uses to improve not only surveillance but also clinical management and research in support of force health protection taken as whole the recommendations we offer below suggest that the dodsr and dmss could benefit from improved oversight and management to ensure they function within the strategic goals of the military health system and have access to the needed data systems as well as other resources needed on an ongoing basis this chapter draws from the preceding chapter and synthesizes our findings into six main recommendations there are key decisions that need to be made at the undersecretary of defense level which will cascade across the recommendations we offer here affecting the direction of the decisions as well as the magnitude of change rand draft not for open circulation 141 1 clarify and communicate the missions of dodsr dmss and amsa both within and beyond dod there is mismatch between congressional direction for the use of the dodsr and the dmss data system as articulated in several enactments of the national defense authorization act and the articulation of the mission and use of the dodsr and dmss by amsa clear articulation by military policy makers and common understanding by amsa managers and dodsr and dmss users of the full range of uses for these resources including surveillance epidemiologic investigation clinical management and research related to both infectious and noncommunicable diseases should lead to their more efficient use within dod further the mission of dodsr and dmss to collect specimens and data could also extend beyond dod active or reserve populations to include continuation of data and specimen collection on voluntary basis from service members followed in military treatment facilities andor the veterans administration health system to harness the full potential of the dodsr and dmss resources the full range of mission areas for these resources and their organizational oversight must be made explicit and communicated widely across dod and into related research and epidemiologic communities 2 empower structure and resource the organizational oversight of dodsr and dmss so that they can fulfill the full range of missions in chapter 2 we describe how dods own policy envisioned tri service surveillance center and we believe the vision and guidance to be relevant and timely today specifically 1999 asdha memorandum described the migration of dmss toward dod medical surveillance agency collecting all theater medical surveillance and treatment data collected by the services unified and specified commands and individual commands within the services further dmss was directed to provide access to personnel and health surveillance data to other agencies involved in medical surveillance and health research asdha september 30 1999 as we describe in the preamble to our report dod officially established the armed forces health surveillance center in late february rand draft not for open circulation 142 2008 we learned from our interviews that the intent for this organization is to encompass dodwide medical surveillance activities within one organization by combining amsa geis and the deployment health support directorate of osdha review of the afhsc concept of operations indicated that the new organization will also encompass the broader range of health surveillance components and activities ie including occupational and environmental health in garrison and deployment settings although details of these were largely beyond the focus of this study we assume that the name of the new organization ie specifically referring to health surveillance will not create limitations or confusion in the full range of missions served by the organizational components it oversees most notably dodsr the organization is envisioned to be triservice surveillance agency although we understand that there are serious concerns among the services about how to staff such an agency and what the appropriate oversight of the agency should be we recommend that the afhsc be situated organizationally empowered and resourced to connect the various experts contracts and systems that are required not only for its primary surveillance mission but also for the full range of uses for the dodsr and dmss resources it manages through its executive agency function including surveillance epidemiologic investigation clinical management and research the chain of command and oversight for this organization should be such that it can receive guidance and resources from policy makers responsible for all of these functions eg the asdha surgeons general and army medical research and materiel command in order to ensure proper alignment with current military health system strategy and resources the afhsc should be configured and staffed to provide the support needed by all users and especially those within dod in support of its various missions in chapter 6 we describe approaches to leveraging new staff resources if needed 3 create an integrative data plan for comprehensive health surveillance ideally afhsc should develop construct wherein all the various data required for medical surveillance and broader health surveillance rand draft not for open circulation 143 would be linked and would reflect the underlying tenets of comprehensive health surveillance currently as we describe in chapter 3 there are many data systems within the services and cocoms that are being used for various medical and other health surveillance functions there are issues related to data classification and connections which impede dmss from being fully functional deployment medical surveillance tool although the capabilities that are not resident in dmss are being conducted at other sites and with other systems however there seems to be overarching and comprehensive data plan prescribing integration of all relevant heath surveillance data such plan should address issues such as connectivity to occupational and environmental health surveillance systems both within the garrison and deployed settings increasing data collection along the service members period of service and beyond and fully realizing policy efforts to facilitate access to surveillance and other data by the va regarding dmss specifically over the past several years amsa has effectively increased the number of data feeds into dmss and has expanded the breadth of its surveillance reporting accordingly however several relevant data sets remain unconnected to dmss thus limiting the ability of amsa to fully execute its surveillance mission and for dod more broadly to take advantage of the full range of value offered by dmss the highest priorities for new data linkages into dmss relate to deployment health serving primarily but not exclusively deployment health surveillance mission these data sources include theaterbased reportable medical events clinical encounters via ahltat and disease and nonbattle injury dnbi data all available via the theater medical information program tmip ideally all relevant health surveillance data can be made available to dmss via the unclassified theater medical data store memberspecific deployment location information is also important and available through the deployment theater accountability system though the data in this system are classified the main options for linking such data into dmss include timedelayed incorporation of declassified location data or nearreal time incorporation of classified data the latter imposes potentially new requirements on amsa ie for rand draft not for open circulation 144 secure communications facility to house either the original or mirrored version of the dmss database other relevant linkages to consider are to existing dod biological specimen archives such as isolates and original nasal swab specimens maintained by nhrc from its febrile respiratory illness surveillance system and pathology and necropsy specimens maintained by afip consideration should also be given to collecting and archiving specimens from the recently initiated millennium cohort study overseen by nhrc more robust linkages in both directions between dmss and the va health system should also be considered to the extent that the mission of dodsr and dmss are expanded beyond strictly active duty and reserve populations also consideration should be given to whether and how behavioral risk factor data should be collected and fed into dmss as discussed in chapters 4 and 6 finally as technology develops new ways of testing for the presence and use of chemical or biologic weapons dmss might be tailored to contribute to surveillance or research for these potential threats because there are many current data sources which might be tapped for deployment health surveillance and there may be more in the future the new afhsc would be better positions to fully execute its mission if it were included in the military health system information requirements process currently managed at the tricare management agency better protection of dmsss physical infrastructure and the integrity of the dataie to resist physical or cyber threats to the dmss database is also needed we recommend that strong consideration be given not only to assuring adequate housing of the data system but also to systematic and frequent offsite back up and even parallel mirroring of the dmss database to assure its integrity in response to any threat that may arise as occurred in late january 2008 4 enhance the utility of specimens the dodsr serum specimens continue to serve well their original purpose of hiv serosurveillance however as we discussed in chapter 2 as early as 1997 the dod made decision to use serum as the tissue of convenience for deployment health surveillance the sera permit rand draft not for open circulation 145 examination of deploymentrelated exposures to and investigations of infectious agents they are not particularly useful for timesensitive environmental exposures for which biomarkers are only fleetingly present and as military health research becomes broader and more technologically sophisticated the limitations of current serum specimens become more apparent researchers increasingly recognize the importance of genetic material for current and future research into range of acute and chronic conditions serum specimens as presently stored in the dodsr at 30c do not reliably preserve genetic material therefore it is timely at this juncture as the current repository lease expires and amsa looks toward serving the longerterm needs of the military health system to consider ways to enhance the utility of the dodsr specimens there may be some incremental value in storing future serum specimens at 80c note that storage of current specimens at colder temperatures would not change the availability of analytes for future testing even greater value would be derived from whole blood specimens eg stored in liquid form or as dried blood spots or storage of buffy coat fractions in which the quantity of genetic material is substantially greater see description in chapter 5 storage requirements for dried blood spots are modest and incrementally the easiest alternatively archiving of plasma and buffy coat could be accomplished through collection of blood specimens in tube that allows fractionation into plasma and buffy coat plasma can be used in place of serum for routine hiv testing and for essentially all other tests currently performed on dodsr serum specimens storage of both plasma and buffy coat at 80c reflects current best industry practices for preservation of genetic material and other relevant bloodderived analytes however adoption of this alternative would mean costly new repository requirements for future specimens ie walkin freezers would not be possible for storage at 80c nonetheless the nearterm expiration of the current repository lease and potential relocation provides timely opportunity for military leadership to think carefully about the needs of the military health system into future and determine rand draft not for open circulation 146 whether new kinds of specimens should be archived to better serve broader range of mission areas for this valuable military resource 5 raise awareness of and expand access to dodsr and dmss number of interviewees commented that use of the dodsr and dmss resources may be limited because of limited awareness across dod for example one military medical officer noted that military clinicians are largely unaware of these resources in support of clinical management likewise senior health official within the va system was largely unaware of the rich specimen and data resources managed by amsa several interviewees suggested broad or targeted educational campaigns to raise awareness and use of dodsr and dmss some interviewees suggested that access has been limited because of what they perceive as lack of fully transparent criteria for release of specimens remedy for this could include development and dissemination of updated and transparent criteria and procedures for accessing dodsr specimens and dmss data the cost associated with obtaining specimens from the repository 20 per specimen has also been cited as barrier for civilians wanting to tap into the dodsr for the purposes of research in terms of expanding use the first priority should probably be for military health users within dod followed by more robust use by the va dod should carefully consider whether and how to expand use to civilian researchers while protecting individual privacy the overall military health mission and availability of remaining specimens as more users draw down the number aliquots from given specimen finally efforts should be made to take better advantage of the longitudinal nature of the dodsr inventory eg through clarifying the legitimate use of dodsr for research and sensitizing military health researchers to the availability of these serial specimens and linked data 6 plan for the next repository facility finally depending on decisions related to the strategies described in chapter 6 and the recommendations above dod should begin rand draft not for open circulation 147 already to define the requirements for the next repository following expiration of the current lease in 2010 factors to take into consideration include the time horizon for the next repository eg 20 years or more the annual rate of specimen acquisition which would increase if specimens are to be collected from members following separation the types of specimen to be archived eg serum or plasma buffy coat whole blood in liquid form or as dried blood spots and desired storage temperature eg 30c or 80c all of these influence the size and configuration of the future repository and hence the requirements for future repository space conclusions the goal of this study was to help identify opportunities to make even better use of dodsr and dmss resources in addressing military health needs now and into the future our analyses uncovered specific opportunities to better fulfill current requirements especially to close gaps in the content and efficiency of medical surveillance the largest gap relates to data from deployed settings which figures prominently within the strategies we describe in the report and our recommendations beyond surveillance we have also identified specific ways to position the dodsr and dmss resources to better serve the military of the future planning now for changes that will permit wider range of uses to improve not only surveillance but also clinical management and research in support of force health protection taken as whole our recommendations suggest that the dodsr and dmss could benefit from improved oversight and management to ensure they function within the strategic goals of the military health system and have access to the needed data systems as well as other resources they need to fulfill their mission there are key decisions that need to be made at the undersecretary of defense level which will cascade across the recommendations we offer here affecting the direction of the decisions as well as the magnitude of change amsa has been responsible custodian for the dodsr and dmss characterized by multiple interviewees as national treasures whose rand draft not for open circulation 148 full potential has yet to be fully harnessed creation of the new afhsc and relocation of the repository offer the opportunity to consider how the dodsr and dmss resources can be used to even greater advantage to support military health now and into the future this study took systematic approach to analysis of current characteristics and opportunities for improvement some of our recommendations are relatively easy while others are more ambitious nonetheless we feel that implementation of all of these recommendations will allow the afhsc to better fulfill its current requirements serve broader range of legitimate mission areas and position the dodsr and dmss resources for valuable service well into
