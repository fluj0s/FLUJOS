divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30826softwood lumber imports from canada history and analysis of the dispute summary softwood lumber imports from canada have been of concern to us lumber producers for many years because of questions about canadian government timber pricing policies in 1996 the united states and canada reached 5year agreement on restrictions fee on lumber imports from four canadian provinces in excess of the specified quota that expires on march 31 2001 resolutions and bills have been introduced in recent congresses that had they been enacted would have restricted lumber imports from canada or eliminated the basis for restricting those imports the 107th congress may also consider legislation on this issue us lumber producers argue that they have been injured by subsidies to their canadian competitors stumpage fees for the right to harvest trees charged by the provinces are asserted to be subsidiz ed priced at less than their market value in canada provincial government timberlands dominate the supply system with long term leases to private firms to assure stable timber supplies and with timber priced administratively to assure financially feasible production private timberlands dominate the us supply system with competitive bidding to allocate and price most public timber the use of administered prices by the provincial governments opens the possibility that the canadian system results in transfers to the private sector at less than the fair market value major differences in tree species sizes and grades in measurement systems in requirements on harvesters in environmental protection and in other factors however make comparisons difficult controversial and generally inconclusive canadian log export restrictions are also asserted to be subsidies because the restrictions assure more supply less competition for timber for canadian producers evidence from the us pacific northwes t where private logs can be exported but public timber cannot indicates substantial price differential with higher prices for exported logs however canada has recently challenged as gatt violations the us trade law provisions that include export restrictions as subsidies injuries to us lumber producers have also been difficult to establish decisively canadas share of the us lumber market has risen substantially from less than 7 in the early 1950s to more than 35 in the mid1990s under the 1996 agreement the quantity of imports has continued to rise but the market share has been relatively stable in the past two years the dispute has also included whether certain softwood products are modified construction lumber subject to the 1996 restrictions the us view or are specialty products outside the agreement the canadian view the impact of import restrictions on domestic lumber prices is not easily estimated but supplydemand theory suggests that restrictions would put upward pressure on us lumber prices other factors are also impor tant the persistence of the dispute may reflect tensions between increasingly freetrade us policies and protection from imports available under us trade law also probable differences in

above specified level of canadian softwood lumber shipped to the united states despite hopes that this agreement would quiet longrunning dispute over increasing imports of softwood lumber from canada disagreements over the products covered and the price impacts of the agreement have persisted the agreement is scheduled to terminate on march 31 2001 some interests would like to see the agreement renewed or modified others would like to see it ended with alternative approaches to resolving the dispute and still others would like to see restrictions on imports of canadian lumber legislation has been introduced in past congresses both to restrict canadian lumber imports and to end import restrictions the 107th congress may also consider legislation on this issue tension between the united states and canada over softwood lumber trade may be inevitable both countries have extensive forest resources but vastly different population levels and development pressures vast stretches of canada are still largely undeveloped while relatively fewer areas in the united states outside alaska have remained relatively pristine these different situations have led to different forest polic ies in canada the forests are largely owned by the provincial governments which have allocated and priced the timber to encourage the development of the extensive timber reserves in the united states the majority of timberlands are privately owned private markets dominate the allocation and pricing of timber although us federal and other governmentowned forests are regionally important the us forest service used timber as tool to foster western expansion in its early years but rising population pressures and changing demands for the goods and services provided by forests have altered its approach to management of us federal forests and general us environmental policy as it affects public and private forest management us lumber producers view the canadian policies as more favorable for timber production and thus as an unfair competitive advantage in supplying the us lumber market especially when the market is weak however since the us and canadian governments influence timber production in different ways because of different histories purposes and situations comparing the relative competitiveness of us and canadian lumber producers is difficult at best these uncertainties are exacerbated by the differi ng views of us lumber producers and us lumber consumers on lumber prices producers and consumers would probably agree that policies which raise lumber prices by increasing production costs eg by additional state forest practice regulations were undesirable because consumers could be harmed without benefitting producers however policies that might raise lumber prices without increasing lumber production costs such as by restricting lumber imports would generally be supported by producers and opposed by consumers these different domestic views combined with the

and length today the volume of lumber produced from given log can be much greater than the log rule estimate because of technological improvements since the rules were developed for lumber the mbf volume is greater than the actual lumber volume because drying and finishing reduces the lumber from its original roughcut dimensions for example 2x4 was originally 2 inches thick and 4 inches wide

and then examines several aspects of the dispute what constitutes softwood lumber allegations of canadian subsidies and of injury to us producers and other relevant factors history of the dispute the debate over restrictions on imports of canadian lumber began early in the 20th century in 1930 during the great depression duty of 1 per thousand board feet mbf1 was assessed on canadian lumber2 this rose to 4 per mbf by 1935 when trade negotiations reduced the duty back to 1 per mbf in 1937 lumber producers in oregon and washington unsuccessfully petitioned the us federal government for protection from unfair canadian competition imports of canadian lumber increased slowly in subsequent decades finally in 1962 western us lumber producers became distressed enough by the rise in canadian share of the us lumber market which had risen to 12 up from 7 in the early 1950s that they sought protection from canadian lumber imports the us lumbermens economic survival committee prompted congressional hearings and white house task force and petitioned the us tariff commission now the us international trade com mission for restrictions on canadian lumber imports in 1963 the tariff commission chose not to impose restrictions and efforts to restrict lumber imports abated the 19821983 investigation in 1981 following brief but steep recession the northwest independent forest manufacturers regional us wood products trade association alleged that subsidies to canadian lumber producers had increased unemployment in the us pacific northwest in response to these concerns house

that this has injured us producers canadian lumber imports have risen from 7 of the us market in the early 1950s to more than 30 over the past two decades the cfli has argued that imports have risen due to government programs in canada in particular they assert that the fees set by the provinces for governmentowned timber are less than prices in competitive fair market and that log export restrictions in british columbia artificially depress canadian timber prices these practices are alleged to have injured us lumber producers these two issues subsidies and injury are the basis for determining whether countervailing duty is warranted under us law and will be examined in turn first however it is useful to examine what imports are considered to be softwood lumber then after discussing subsidies and injury other factors such as differing environmental policies will be examined what is softwood lumber while seemingly straigh tforward softwood lumber subject to the softwood lumber agreement has been an issue over the past few years before discussing the issue some basic information on softwoods and on lumber is presented softwood is classifica tion of tree species and contrasts with the other major classification hardwood both however are misnomers some hardwoods such as aspen and poplar are softer less dense than many softwoods such as yellow pines43 softwood species are all in the order coniferales the conifers conifers generally have needlelike leaves and cones for reproduction these plants are often called evergreens because most retain their needles in winter trees of the larch genus larix spp are deciduous with bare limbs in the winter the hardwood timber species are in the phylum anthophyta the angiosperms or flowering plants these plants are often called deciduous because most species in temperate climates lose their leaves in the winter however some temperateclimate species eg holly and most tropical and subtropical species are evergreen retaining their leaves throughout the year despite the imprecision softwood is the term of art for conifer species and will be used to indicate lumber produced from conifer species this use is also consistent with the definition of softwoo d lumber in the harmonized tariff schedules and in the 1996 lumber agreement see below lumber is the collective term for products sawn from logs this

wind ows and doors with frames parquet panels shakes and shingles and laminate d beams roof trusses and other fabricated wood products the issue of lumber product classification arose in 1997 after the us customs service had issued new york ruling letter b81564 feb 18 1997 classifying drilled studs 8 and 10foot long 2x4s and 2x6s with 1inch holes drilled about 16 inches from each end as builders joinery and thus outside the agreements quota in october the customs service requested comments on drilled stud classification including whether they serve particular purpose and whether the holes limit their use in construction49 in april 1998 the customs service proposed revoking the new york ruling letter effectively reclassifying drilled studs as softwood lumber under tariff item 4407 subject to the current agreement50 the june 1998 final ruling revoking the 1997 ruling letter was challenged in court but the customs service decision was upheld in december 1998 by the us court of international trade51 in 1999 the customs service proposed and then finalized notices to reclassify notched studs and rougherheaded lumber as softwood lumber under tariff item 4407 instead of as builders joinery under tariff item 4418 the issue essentially is whether these various products are indeed specialty products with particular construction applications or standard construction lumbe r with minor modifications to avoid the quota if the latter is correct and the products are now correctly classified as softwood lumber products further question is whether they were included in the base level of lumber imports used to establish the quota levels or whether their reclassification has expanded the products covered and thus effectively reduced the quota levels for the standard products from the originally agreedupon levels subsidies to canadian lumber producers alleged subsidies to canadian lumber producers have been at the core of the efforts to restrict imports by the cfli over the past two decades initial efforts focused on the argument that the canadian system of allocatin g timber and setting stumpage fees results in fees below the fair market value of the timber more recently critics have also argued that restrictions on log exports at least from bc artificially depress domestic canadian timber prices by limiting the markets for

the federallyowned boreal forests are in the yukon nunavut and northwest territories in the 10 provinces the canadian federal government owns 2 of the timberlands and the provinces own 90 with 8 in private ownership this contrasts with us timberlands where 42 are owned by the federal 33 state 8 and local 1 governments and 58 are privately owned53 each province has its own forestry legislation regulations and standards in general the provinces require management plans for forested areas typically prepared by certified professional foresters and subject to participation or review by broad spect rum of users and interests54 the provinces also allocate timber harvest for relatively large producers the provinces typically use long term generally 5 to 25 years with renewal options area tenure agreements with exclusive rights to the specified annual harvest levels and with various management obligations eg road construction and reforestation55 for smaller producers the provinces often use shorterterm as brief as 6 months volume tenure agreements with exclusive rights to the specified annual harvest levels and with some management obligations but typically less than for longterm area tenure agreement many provinces also have other agreements for selling various types of timber to specific often quite small or familyoperated firms the various tenure agreements also referred to as leases also must be consistent with the management plans for the areas which are often prepared by foresters working for the lessees especially for the longterm area tenures the only significant opportunity for the public to influence canadian forest management appears to be through comments on the perio dic forest management plans there seems to be opportunity to oversee or challenge the appropriateness of forestry activities except when those activit ies violate the law regulations or management plans this differs markedly from the system for us federal timber where

usda forest service august 1982 pp 121 60it is not clear how transaction evidence appraisals can be determined in system with market transactions for comparisonadministrative stumpage fees the provinces charge fees for timberland leases and timber harvests there is generally flat annual fee for maintaining the leases and stumpage fee per unit of volume for the timber harvested in most of the provinces stumpage fees are determined administratively and range from fixed provincewide fee to fees established separately for each tenure agreement56 these fees are adjusted periodically to reflect changes in the market prices of lumber and other wood products administrative stumpage fees are unlikely to match marketdetermined prices because the fees are determined by agency personnel not by markets if the fees are designed to approximate market prices lags in periodic fee adjustments suggest that the fees would be below the market value in tight markets when lumber prices are rising but above the market value in weak markets when lumber prices are falling however some observers assert that the provinces have intentionally set the fees substantially below market prices to assure the competitiveness of their producers57 whether provincial administrative stumpage fees approximate market values or are substantially below market values can only be determined by examining provincial fees and us prices for comparable timber but such comparisons are difficult as discussed below bc appraised stumpage fees in bc stumpage fees historically were set using the residual value appraisal process where average harvesting and manufacturing costs and profitandloss margin were deducted from the estimated end wood product prices to determine the stumpage fee58 this process for timber was first developed by the us forest service early in the 20th century with the first timber appraisal manual produce d in 191459 the us forest service still uses residual value appraisals in some places for some timber however the bc ministry of forests and the us forest service have largely shifted to the transaction evidence appraisal system where stumpage fees are established by comparing the transaction timber sale or agreement with other similar transactions timber sales or agreements60httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30826crs15 61us dept of agriculture forest service and us small

1981 15 p brink lindsay mark groombridge and prakash loungani nailing the homeowner continuedthe difference between the bc provincial system and the us federal system is that in bc the appraised price is the stumpage fee while in the united states the appraised price is the minimum stumpage fee for timber sales which are offered for competitive bidding competitivelybid us stumpage fees are often substantially above the appraised price data on the ratio of bid fees to appraised price for us forest service timber sales are not published regularly but one study found that in the 1970s successful bids were on average three times greater than the appraised prices even when noncompetitive sales were included and averaged 10 times greater in one region alaska61 however competition for us forest service timber is not always vigorous with 12 of those 1970s sales having bidders and 22 having only one bidder ie sales in which the stumpage fee equaled the appraised price62 nonetheless this old evidence from us forest service timber sales suggests that competitive bidding for timber results in market price higher than the value estimated using the appraisal system comparing cana dian and us stumpage fees market values are established in competitive markets between willing buyers and willing sellers in the united states this is the situation for wood product manufacturers and private timberland owners and arguably federal timber sales in areas with competitive bidding63 thus much of the timber from lands in the united states is probably sold at fair market values this is not likely the case in canada where leases rather than competitive bids are used to allocate timber eviden ce to demonstrate this possible disparity between us and canadian stumpage fees is widespread but inconclusive over the past 20 years several reports have shown significantly higher stumpage fees in the united states64 also as noted above in the history of the dispute the us itc and ita have found significant differences in stumpage fees in various examinations dating back to 1982 however other analyses have shown little or difference between us and canadian

first us timber and canadian timber are measured differently in the united states trees and lumber are measured in board feet as descr ibed above in canada trees and lumber are measured in cubic meters the conversion how many board feet of lumber can be produced from cubic meter of logs depends on the diameter of the log ranging from about 130 board feet per cubic meter for 6inch diameter 16foot log to more than 275 board feet per cubic meter for 44inch 16foot log66 thus the conversion rate chosen ie different assumptions about log diamet ers can have significant effect on the resulting price second except for the occasional forest plantation forests are not uniform monocultures forests may contain several species of trees each of which varies in diameter height and quality comparisons typically use single dominant species eg douglasfir but the stumpage fee for the dominant species can be affected by the fee for other species in us federal timber sales for example competitive bidding is generally limited to the dominant species with the other species being sold at the appraised price this leads to an overall balance but limits the validity of the fees for comparing the prices of timber in different areas us and canadian forests differ in their species mix percentage of trees or timber volume in each species as well as in the size and quality of the trees of each species adjusting for these differences is difficult under the best of circumstances other factors also affect stumpage fees for example the management responsibilities imposed on the timber purchasers differ in canada licensees are generally responsible for reforestation and for some forest protection67 in us federal forests timber purchasers generally make deposits to pay for agency reforestation efforts and some of those deposits are typically reported as part of the stumpage fees68 road construction and road maintenance responsibilities and compensation also differ another factor relates to changes in the exchange rate study in 1986 indicated that the relative strength of the us dollar visavis the canadian dollar in the mid to late1970s was an important factor

province71 even for logs identified as surplus the province imposes fee equal to the export premium the difference between the export price and the domestic price72 the canadian federal government imposes similar restrictions on log exports from noncrown lands in canada73 the overall purpose of the provincial and federal export restriction policies has been to maintain and enhance provincial development provide jobs ensure that the timber industry remains solvent and for other purposes74 exports of logs from public lands in the united states are also restricted the forest resources conse rvation and shortage relief act of 199075 as amended prohibits exports of unprocessed timber from all federal and state lands west of the 100th meridian which runs through the great plains except for

register 3596935970 may 19 2000export restrictions are widely recognized as creating an export premium ie higher price for export logs than for comparable logs sold domestically77 few studies identify the magnitude of the export premium although most discussions fall within range of 255078 one recent study graphically presented 19891999 domestic and export log prices in the us pacific northwest79 in the mid1990s the premium was 400600 per mbf about 67100 above domestic prices the asian financial crisis in 1997 reduced the premium to less than 100 briefly but export prices then stabilized while domestic prices fell raising the premium to more than 300 per mbf about 75 above domestic prices80 these data suggest that us export restrictions on logs from federal and state lands apparently provide substantial price premium for export logs from private lands and therefore may depress domestic prices to less than free marketdetermined price despite the lack of data this situation seems likely to be true for canada also since bc and the us pacific northwest compet in the same pacific rim markets japan korea and china restrictions that reduce domestic prices to less than fair market price would in most circumstances be considered to be subsidies by most economists and article xi of the gatt generally prohibits restrictions on exports81 nonetheless the itas determination that the export restrictions are subsidies has been challenged in may 2000 canada requested consultations with the united states under the wto dispute settlement understanding82 canada has argued that the

recessions in 1951 1957 and especially 19741975 however in the 1980 and 1982 recessions canada increased its share of the us lumber market instead the market share for other regions notably the us pacific northwest and intermountain west declined suggesting that these regions had become the marginal highcost producers this suggests that canadian production costs had fallen relative to western us production costs which some allege is because of canadian subsidies and that at least western us lumber producers were injured by canadian imports after reaching 33 of the us market in 1985 the canadian share fell during the us economic expansion through 1989 implicitly confirming that canada was not the highcost producer however during the next economic recession 1990 1991 and subsequent recovery the canadian market share first fell then rose again reaching new peak at more than 35 of the us market in 1995 this might indicate return to canada being the marginal highcost supplier but other factors including significant changes in us federal timber supplies attempts to restrict canadian lumber imports and changes in far east asian economic performance might have affected the historic relationship between production costs and us market share if canada has again become the highcost marginal supplier to the us market then imports are unlikely to injure us producers if however the recent changes in canadian market share are not result of higher production costs then canadian imports might be causing injury to domestic producers us lumber prices lumber prices might also be an indicator of injury persistently low prices might harm us lumber producers particularly if canadian production costs are lowered by subsidies however us lumber users eg home builders and lumber dealers argue that restrictions on canadian lumber imports have led to high and increasingly volatile lumber prices harm themselves and the us economy generally these two issues price level and price volatility will be examined after brief explanation of the problems associated with examining lumber prices lumber prices are more difficult to track over time than data on consumption and market share because each species and grade has different price and the mix of species and grades produced and consumed as well as the relative prices have changed it is particularly difficult to demonstrate price changes that result from particular action or event one analysis noted in fluctuating commodity market attributing price changes to particular causes is extremely difficult the first reason is data imperfections the second reason is that market behavior is governed by expectations which cannot be measured because expectations are so important simple interpretations of supplydemand behavior are often wrong the third reason is that multiple factors are always interacting on current market conditions and expectations fourth reason is the high level of volatility that is inherent

construction but neither are they so persistently low as to by themselves indicate significant injury to us producers the itc however has consistently found material injury to the us industry each time it has examined the issue price volatility lumber users have also argued that the current softwood lumber agreement has harmed them by increasing the volatility of lumber prices relative volatility can be assessed by examining the average and standard deviationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30826crs25 table 1 the annual average and standard deviation for the random lengths framing lumber

source crs calculations using data from random lengths inc of lumber prices table 1 shows the annual average and standard deviation for the weekly random lengths framing lumber composite price and the

unusually high during 2000 although it had been higher in 1993 and 1982 volatility was also unusually low during 1998 having been lower only in 1978 and 1988 trade restrictions might affect the volatility of us lumber prices but these data suggest that other factors appear to have more effect on price volatility than trade restrictions the current softwood lumber agreement in effect from 19962000 appears not to have increased the volatility of us framing lumber prices other factors affecting the trade dispute host of similarities and differences affecting us and canadian lumber production have already been discussed us and canadian land ownership patterns and pricing and allocation systems different timber measurements and conversion difficul ties conditions of foreign

of philosophy toronto on canada univ of toronto may 1997which us and canadian producers compete etc two other factors are worth brief discussions the structure of us trade law and differing environmental policies us trade law structure this feature has been identified by one observer as contribu ting to the persistence of the dispute over imports of softwood lumber from canada95 dr benjamin cashore has noted that us trade law in conjunction with the various gatt agreements has generally become more liberal oriented toward free trade over the past several decades at the same time he argues laws enacted by congress since the 1970s have made it progressively easier for us industries to receive protection from foreign competition he sees this tension between increasingly free trade policies and easier industry protection as assuring persistent trade disputes and expanding the role of executive and legislative politics in trade relationships and disputes as demonstrated by the lumber import dispute environmental policies differing environmental policies have also been raised as cause of differing cost structures some allege that weaker canadian environmental protection further subsidizes the canadian lumber industry many environmental groups in the united states and canada argue that subsidized canadian stumpage prices lead to overcutting and that 90 of the harvest is in extensive clearcuts96 of irreplaceable oldgrowth timber97 they also assert that canadas laws do not provide nearly as much protection as us environmental laws especially the endangered species act us lumber producers have asserted that complying with us environmental laws significantly increases their cost of production some observers view the less restrictive environmental protection in canada as result of the lower population density in canada the worlds second largest county by area and thus placing fewer demands on resources and portending fewer environmental threats one study found that us federal policies for federal lands in washington and oregon were more protective than the bc provincial policies98 this implies greater costs imposed on us lumber producers by environmental laws than are imposed on their canadian competitors however there has not been definitive study comparing us federal state and local policies for federal state local and private lands in the united states with canadian federal provincial and local policies for federal provincial local and private lands in canada because of differences in resource demands and threats less restrictive canadian environmental protection might not necessarily lead to greater environmental damage from logging whether canadian forests are in better condition than or are more degraded than us forests is not clear from existing datahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30826crs27 summary and conclusions concerns about softwood lumber import s from canada have been raised for decades the current dispute has persisted for 20 years in 1981 congress asked the department of commerce to undertake countervailing duty cvd investigation which resulted in finding of minimis insignificant subsidies in 1986 another investigation resulted in preliminary finding of subsidies of 15 ad valorem as percent of sale value the expected cvd was supplanted by memorandum of understanding mou with canada agreeing to 15 export tax on softwood lumber canada withdrew from the mou in 1991 arguing that the provinces had responded to the earlier conce rns new cvd investigation led to 651 ad valorem duty in 1992 but this duty was successfully challenged and terminated under provisions of the uscanada free trade agreement in 1996 following changes in us trade law the united states and canada reached the current 5year softwood lumber agreement that imposes fee on softwood lumber imports from four canadian provinces in excess of the specified quota what actions might follow from the march 31 2001 expiration of this agreement are not certain bills and resolutions to impose and to oppose restrictions on lumber imports from canada have been introduced in recent congresses and the 107th congress may consider similar legislative proposals us lumber producers assert they have been injured by canadian subsidies that have given canadian lumber producers an unfair advantage in selling lumber in the us market these two conditions subsidies and injury are prerequisites for countervailing duty under us trade law the dispute has also encompassed the question of what softwood lumber products are subject to the current agreement the us customs service has reclassified certain products which canadian producers claim are specialty products outside the agreement but which us producers claim are slight modifications to construction lumber to get around the quota one alleged subsidy is canadian provincial stumpage fees fees for the right to harvest trees that may be less than their value in competitive market in the 10 canadian provinces 90 of the timberland is owned by the provinces the majority of provincial timber is allocated to lumb er producers under longterm area tenure agreements which specify harvest levels management requirements and stumpage fees the stumpage fees are generally set administratively and adjusted periodically to reflect changes in lumber markets this contrasts with the situation in the united states where 58 of timberlands are privately owned and timber from federal and state lands is typically offered for sale at competitive auctions administered fees are not likely to match market values but could be higher or lower depending on the purpose and methods by which they are established critics have claimed that the fees are set low to assure profitable production regardless of market conditions several studies have shown significantly lower canadian stumpage fees but other studies have found comparable crossborder fees these contradictory results may be explained by the adjustments made to account for differences in timber measurement systems one cubic meter of canadian logs yields 125275 board feet of us lumber depending on the logs diameters in tree species sizes and grades in requirements imposed on the timber purchaser eg reforestation and road construction and in other factors analyses of the differences are difficult and generally problematichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30826crs28 canadian log export restrictions are also alleged to artificially depress domestic log prices in canada evidence from the us pacific northwest where logs from private lands can be exported but logs from public lands cannot shows persistent price differential with substantially higher prices for exported logs most economists would generally identify restrictions that reduce domestic prices as subsidies and article xi of the gener agreement on tariffs and trade gatt prohibits most export restrictions however us treatment of canadian log export restrictions as subsidy has been challenged canada has requested consultations with the united states under the wto dispute settlement understanding arguing that this treatment and this provisi on of us trade law generally violates several provisions of the wto agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures injury to the us lumber industry remains major and complex issue the canadian share of the us softwood lumber market grew substantially over the past 50 years from less than 7 in 1952 to more than 35 in 1996 during this period us lumber production for domestic consumption grew slowly from nearly 30 billion board feet bbf in the early 1950s to 35 bbf in 1999 while imports of canadian lumber rose substantially from less than 3 bbf in the early 1950s to more than 18 bbf in 1999 under the 1996 agreement imports have continued to grow although market share has been relatively stable lumber imports from canada may have limited opportunities to expand domestic lumber production but whether this long term pattern is sufficient to constitute injury or whether the limited growth in domestic production is due to other factors is not clear from the existing data us lumber prices are according to economic theory probably higher with the restrictions on canadian imports than they would be without the restrictions price differentials for single aspect however are exceedingly difficult to determine one estimate of the price increase from the 1996 agreement by group that opposes trade restrictions nearly equaled the fee rates although the fee applies only to imports in excess of the quota this estimated price increase which us lumber producers argue is grossly overstated would have raised the price of 1999 median new home by less than 1 and would have raised monthly mortgage payments on such house by by less than rise in mortgage interest rates of 18th of 1 opponents of restrictions also argue that the 1996 agreement has increased the volatility of lumber prices however the annual volatility measured by the ratio of standard deviation to average of the random lengths framing lumber composite price over the past 5 years ie under the 1996 agreement is generally consistent with the annual volatility shown during the preceding 20 years 19751995 other factors might also be important in the dispute over lumber imports from canada one analyst has suggested that the persistence of the dispute is due at least in part to the conflict between the increasingly liberal nobarriers us trade policy and the increasingly easy process for obtaining industry protection under us trade law in addition environmental laws and policies probably differ and the impact of those laws and policies for lumber production costs complicate any crossborder analyses
