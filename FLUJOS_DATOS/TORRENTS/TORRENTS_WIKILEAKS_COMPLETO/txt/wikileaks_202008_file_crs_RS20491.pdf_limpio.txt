shimabukuro legislative attorney american law division summary retail reciprocity requirements have been included in the electricity restructuring legislation of at least four states these requirements mandate generally that outofstate utilities which operate in state closed to retail competition cannot market power to retail consumers in the open state because state reciprocity requirements enacted without congressional authorization are probably unconstitutional under the commerce clause of the us constitution congress would have to include reciprocity provision in federal electricity restructuring legislation if it wants to support the view that such provision will increase competition this report reviews the treatment of state reciprocity requirements by the us supreme court and discusses congress power under the commerce clause seven of the eight comprehensive electricity restructuring bills introduced during the 106th congress include reciprocity provisions the power bill hr 667 introduced by representative burr the electric utility restruct uring empowerment and competitiveness act of 1999 s 516 introduced by senator thomas the electric

424 us at 380 7 458 us 941 1982these reciprocity provisions mandate generally that outofstate utilities which operate in state closed to retail competition cannot market power to retail consumers in the open state states have enacted reciprocity requirements as way of encouraging closed states to open to retail competition although state reciprocity requirements are not per unlawful the us supreme court has been reluctant to uphold such requirements under the commerce clause of the us constitution2 the commerce clause provides that congress shall have power to regulate commerce among the several states3 the commerce clause has been interpreted to provide not only an affirmative grant of authority to congress but an implied limitation on the power of the states to interfere with or impose burdens on interstate commerce the doctrine of the dormant commerce clause whereby state regulation of interstate commerce may be invalidated because of its burden on interstate commerce has been well established4 the us supreme court has addressed the constitution ality of state reciprocity requirements in several cases in great atlantic and pacific tea company v cottrell louisiana milk producer challenged mississippi regulation that permitted the sale of milk and milk products from another state only if the other state accepted such products from mississippi on reciprocal basis5 contending that the reciprocity requirement was freetrade provision mississippi advanced two arguments first it argued that the reciprocity requirement served to help eliminate varying inspection standards between the states second it maintained that the requirement allowed the state to get around economic barriers erected by louisiana the court rejected both arguments requiring states to either sign reciprocal agreement acceptable to mississippi or be foreclosed from exporting their products to mississippi would invite the kind of preferential trade areas the commerce clause was meant to prevent6 the court contended that the reciprocity requirement unduly burdened the free flow of interstate commerce and could not be justified as permissible exercise of any state power in sporhase v nebraska the court held that reciprocity requirement would be upheld only where state can demonstrate close fit between the requirem ent and the states local purpose7 in sporhase the owners of contiguous tracts of land in nebraska and colorado challenged nebraska statute that restricted the ability to use ground waterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20491crs3 8 458 us at 958 9 id 10 id 11 486 us

for use in an adjoining state to obtain permit from the nebraska department of water resources permit would be issued only if the state in which the water was to be used granted reciprocal rights to withdraw and transport ground water from that state for use in nebraska under colorado law the transport of ground water to any other state was forbidden although nebraska contende d that the reciprocity restriction was necessary to conserve and preserve ground water it failed to offer any evidence of water shortage or some other justification for the requirem ent8 without this evidence the court was unwilling to uphold the requirement the court maintained that because such requirement facially discriminates against interstate commerce it would be subject to the strictest scrutiny9 while the court acknowledged that conservation and preservation are legitimate purposes it concluded that such restriction on the withdrawal and transport of nebraska ground water absent any evidence of shortage or some other justification was not narrowly tailored to achieving those purposes10 in new energy company of indiana v limbach an indiana manufacturer of ethanol challenged an ohio statute that awarded tax credit against the ohio motor vehicle fuel sales tax for each gallon of ethanol sold by fuel dealers if the ethanol was produced in ohio or in state that granted similar tax advantages to ethanol produced in ohio11 the manufacturer became ineligible for the ohio tax credit after indiana repealed its tax exemption for ohioproduced ethanol in attempting to counter the manufacturers commerce clause argument ohio contended that the availability of the tax credit to some outofstate manufacturers demonstrated that the statute was likely to promote interstate commerce by encouraging other states to enact similar tax advantages that would spur the interstate sale of ethanol citing the freetrade argument advanced by mississippi in cottrell the court similarly rejected ohios assertion the court maintained that without proper justification ohio could not use the threat of imposing higher tax to force other states into reciprocal arrangement12 although ohio attempted to argue that its statute was justified by health and commerce concerns the court rejected these concerns as implausible speculation13 while state is permitted to exercise its police power over local affairs this power has generally been limited to legislation that protects the health and welfare of citizens14 if the primary purpose of state electricity reciprocity requirement is to prompt competition in noncompetitive states it is likely that the analyses provided in cottrell and limbach are applicable such purpose would probably be perceived as impermissiblehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20491crs4 15 see prudential ins co v benjamin 328 us 408 1946 16 id cf united states v lopez 514 us 549 1995 in lopez the court held that the commerce power was

its electric utility industry simply to sell power to retail consumers in competitive states although state may not interfere with interstate commerce on its own congress may confer upon the states the ability to restrict commerce congress power over interstate commerce has been recognized as plenary and supreme15 the only limitation placed upon congress power is in respect to what constitutes commerce16 if congress enacts legislation that permits the states to regulate interstate commerce any action taken by state within the scope of that congressional authorization is rendered invulnerable to challenge under the commerce clause17 in western and southern life insurance company v state board of equalization of california the court upheld state retaliatory tax that responde d to the insurance tax laws of foreign insurers home state under californias insurance laws retaliatory tax is imposed on outofstate insurers doing business in california when the insurers state of incorporation imposes higher taxes on california insurers doing business in that state than would be imposed on that states insurers doing business in california the california state board contended that the purpose of the tax is to put pressure on other states to maintain low taxes on california insurers with the enactment of the mccarranferguso n act congress removed all commerce clause limitations on the ability of the states to regulate and tax the business of insurance18 the limitations associated with the dormant commerce clause were longer present because congress exercised its authority through legislation because congress explicitly intended the mccarranferguson act to permit state regulatory and taxing powers over the insurance business even state taxation that discriminated against outofstate insurers could be permissible in northeast bancorp inc v board of governors of the federal reserve system the court upheld two state statutes on similar grounds19 the douglas amendment to the bank holding company act prohibits the federal reserve board from approving an application of bank holding company or bank located in one state to acquire bank located in another state unless the acquisition is authorized by the laws of the state in which the bank is located20 pursuant to the douglas amendment massachusetts and connecticut enacted statutes which permit

included reciprocity provision when it was introduced that provision was removed during its markupprincipal place of business in another new england state to acquire massachusetts or connecticut bank or holding company so long as the other state allows reciprocal privileges to massachusetts and connecticut banking organizations the massachusetts and connecticut statutes were challenged on the grounds that they were not authorized by the douglas amendment and discriminated improperly against nonnew england bank holding companies after reviewing the legislative history of the douglas amendment the court concluded that the massachusetts and connecticut statutes were consistent with the purpose of the douglass amendment that is to promote differing approaches to interstate banking and to retain local communitybased control over banking21 the interest in pursuing regional banking within new england was consistent with that purpose if congress enacts electricity restructuring legislation that permits states to impose reciprocity requiremen ts such requirements are likely to be permissible under the commerce clause like the retaliatory tax in western and southern life insurance company and the regional acquisition statutes in northeast bancorp state reciprocity requirem ent should be permissible under the commerce clause because it would be enacted pursuant to congressional authorization those who support federal reciprocity provision contend that such provision would force closed states to consider retail competition they argue that the inclusion of reciprocity provision in federal restructuring legislation will likely enable consumers to choose from wider variety of domestic and outofstate suppliers as consumers and utilities in closed states observe the benefits and potential offered by open access it is believed that they will encourage their state legislatures to adopt competition opponents of reciprocity including utilities operating in closed states and consumers in states with low electric power rates maintain that the federal government should not interfere with states decision to reject competition seven of the eight comprehensive restructuring bills introduced during the 106th congress include reciprocity provisions22 although the provisions vary slightly in language they generally provide state with the authority to prohibit the supply of electricity generated in noncompetitive state
