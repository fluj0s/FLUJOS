and reducing losses summary wildfires are getting more severe with more acres and houses burned and more people at risk this results from excess bi omass in the forests due to past logging and grazing and century of fire suppre ssion combined with an expanding wildland urban interface more people and houses in and near the forests along with climate change exacerbating drought and ins ect and disease problems some assert that current efforts to reduce biomass fu treatments such as thinning and to protect houses are inadequate and that pub lic objections to ac tivities on federal lands raise costs and delay action others count er that proposals for federal lands allow timber harvesting with substantial environmental damage and little fire protection congress is addressing these issues throug h various legislative proposals and through funding for protection programs wildfires are inevitable biomass dr conditions and lightning create fires some are surface fires burning needles grasses nd other fine fuels and leaving most trees alive others are crown fires burning biomass at all levels from the ground through the tree tops and typically dr iven by high winds many wildfires contain areas of both surface and crown fires surface fires are relatively easy to control but crown fires are difficult if not impossible to stop often crown fires burn until they run out of fuel or the weather changes homes can be ignited by direct contact w ith the fire by radiative heating and by firebrands burning materials lifted by the wind or the fires own convection column protection of homes must addre ss all three research has identified the keys to protecting structures having nonflammable roof clearing burnable materials that abut the house eg pl ants flammable mulc h woodpiles wooden decks and landscaping to create defensible space around the structure wildland and resource damages from fire vary widely depending on the nature of the ecosystem as well as on sitespecific conditions surfacefire ecosystems which burned on 5 to 35year cycles can be damaged by crown fires due to unnatural fuel accumulations and fuel ladders fuel treatments probably prevent some crown fires in such ecosystems standreplacementfire ecosystems are where crown fires are natural and the species are adapted to periodic crown fires fuel treatments are unlikely to alter the historic fire regime of such ecosystems in mixedintensity fire ecosystems where mix of surface and crown fires is historically normal it is unclear whether fuel treatments would alter wildfire patterns prescribed burning intentional fires and mechanical treatments cutting and removing some trees can reduce resour ce damages caused by wildfires in some ecosystems however prescribed fires are risky mechanical treatments can cause other ecological damages and both are ex pensive proponents of more treatment advocate expedited processes for environm ental and public review of projects to hasten action and cut costs but others caution that inadequate review can allow unintended damages with few fire protection benefitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34517contents background fires happen 2 p r

commonly assessed by acres burned but larger fires may not be worse if they burn less intensely because their damages may be lower however fire intensity and damages are not measured for each wildfire and thus cannot be used to gauge the severity of fire seasons it is unclear whether acreage burned might be re asonable approximation of severity 2 the past four fire seasons have surpassed the 2000 season while the 1988 data have been revised downwardwildfire damages to homes and resources understanding causes and reducing losses wildfires have been getting more severe in recent fire seasons the last four seasons are the most severe since 19601 national attenti on was focused on the growing wildfire problem by an escaped prescribed fire that burned 239 houses in alamos nm in may 2000 the fire in alamos highlighted the wildland urban interface problem also at that time 2000 was the second most severe fire season since 1960 eclipsed only by the 1988 yellowstone fires2 president clinton responded with new national fire plan to increase fundi ng for wildfire protection it has been widely proclaimed that the increasing severity of wildfires is result of excessive biomass accumulations in at least some ecosystems logging livestock grazing and century of fire suppressi on efforts have allowed biomass fuels to accumulate to unnatural levels climate change and its impacts on drought fire and insects and diseases could exacerbate these problems many interests have proposed fuel reduction treatments as means to lower the fuel levels and thus reduce the wildfire threat to homes and to wildlands the severe 2002 fire season led president bush to propose healthy forests initiative to expedite efforts to reduce biomass fuels on federal lands and in 2003 congress enacted the h ealthy forests restoration act to expedite federal fuel reduction and other fo rest protection programs some interests are concerned that current efforts to reduce fuel levels on federal lands are inadequate and that environmentalist objections to some of those efforts are unnecessarily raising costs and delaying action others counter that some efforts are so broad that they per mit substantial timber sales without significantly reducing wildfire risks for communities congress continues to address these issues as it considers funding and legislative proposals this report focuses on options for prot

see stephen f arno and steven allisonbunnell flames in our forest disaster or renewal washington dc isla nd press 2002 pp 4546background fires happen in temperate ecosystems wildfires are inevitable the combination of biomass plus dry conditions in the short term g the annual dry season or in the long term eg drought or climate change equals fuel to burn add an ignition source such as lightning and wildfire happens fi re is selfsustaining chemical reaction that perpetuates itself as long as all three elements of the fire triangle fuel heat and oxygen remain available fire control focuses on removing one of those elements there are two principal kinds of wildfi re although an individual wildfire may contain areas of both kinds3 one is surface fire which burns the needles or leaves grass and other small biomass within f oot or so of the ground and quickly moves on such fires are relatively easy to control by removing fuel with fireline essentially dirt path wi enough to eliminate the continuous fuels needed to sustain the fire or by cooling or smot hering the flames with water or dirt the other principal kind of wildfire is crown fire also called conflagration crown fires burn biomass at all levels from the surface through the tops of the crowns of the trees although they do not consume all the biomass logs and large limbs may need to burn for hours before being completely reduced to ashes rather crown fire quickly burns the needles or leaves and small twigs and limbs on the surface and throughout the crown of the trees because the needles and leaves in the crown are green they require more energy to burn than dry fuels on the surface furthermore because of th green fuels and the often discontinuous biomass of the canopy wind is usually needed to sustain crown fire once burning vigorously crown fire can create its own wind the st rong upward convection of the heated air can draw in cooler air from surrounding ar eas thus creating wind that feeds the fire the strong upward convecti on can also lift burning biomass firebrands and send it soaring ahead of the fire creating spot fires and accelerating the spread of the wildfire not surprisingly crown fires are difficult if not impossible to control unless quite wide firelines may be ineffective especially if winds are causing spot fires water or fire retardant slurry dropped from helicopters or airplanes can sometimes knock crown fire down back to surface fi re if the area burning and the winds are not too great oftentimes however crown fires burn until they run out of fuel or the weather changes the wind dies or it rains or snows crown fires also typically include areas of surface fire and unburned areas within their perimeters nearly all fires are patchy with mix of areas of varying fire severities depe nding on sitespecific fuel mois ture and wind conditions this patchiness makes unde rstanding and controlling wild fires difficult at besthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34517crs3 4 for

one or more fires annua lly have burned down several to few hundred hom and outbuildings sheds garages etc these structures generally have ignited in one of three ways through direct contact with fire through radiation heating from exposur to flames and through firebrands5 the likelihood of structure burning from one of these ignition methods is called home ignitability 6 home ignitability research has identified three essential elements to protecting structures the roof adjacent burnable materials and the landscaping treating these three elements address all three ways by which structures are ignited direct contact radi ation and firebrands the roof is critical to protecting structures from wildfires7 firebrands that land on flammable roof can ignite the roof treated red cedar shakes and shingles are particularly problematic major cause of home loss in wildland areas is flammable woodshake roofs8 fire retardant treatments ffer sufficient for wood shakes but the effectiveness of such treatments degrades over time9 alternatives include tile slate metals eg copper or aluminum and other nonflammable materials walls doors and windows and vents can also cont ribute to the protection or destruction of structure depending on materi als location and other variables10 adjacent burnable materials are items whic h can burn that abut the house this can include plants live or dead and fl ammable mulch eg wood chips or bark under an overhang or eave or next to the st ructure gutters clogged with leaves or needles decks and porches sheds and gara ges and especially woodpiles these factors were particularly important for the 239 homes burned by the cerro grande fire in alamos nm in may 2000 the high ignitability of alamos was principally due to the abundance and ubiquity of pine

assessing the ignition potential of structure attachment s such as decks porches and fences are considered part of the structure12 finally landscaping the characteristics of the vegetation surrounding the house is critical to preventing both dir ect burning and ignition by radiation recommended defensible space around structures is at least 30 feet or 10 meters with greater distances for steeper slopes because of upslope convection heating and for larger vegetation least for grass mo re for shrubs most for mature forest13 others recommend greater di stances such as 100 feet14 one researcher calculated the ignition time for an untreated wood wall was more than 10 minutes at distance of 40 meters about 130 feet15 with burning durations fo r crown fires on the order of 1 minute at specific cation the safe distance for an untreated wood wall was calculated to be 27 meters less than 90 feet which is consistent with field tests documenting wall ignition times for experimental crown fires in canada16 the same source notes older fire case studies documenting structur survival 95 survival for 1018 meter about 3260 feet clearance in the 1961 belairbrentwood ca fire and 86 survival for 10 meter clearan ce in the 1990 painted cave ca fire17 thus clearing to 40 meters would likely be considered ideal to 30 meters desirable and to at least 10 meters ssential to achieving about 90 probability of survival note also that clearing defensible space does not require an expanse of concrete or gravel relatively nonflammable vege tation such as lawn or succulent herbaceous plants and flowers can provide comparable protection18 the importance of landscapes in protectin g structures can also be deduced from evidence from the 2002 hayman fire the larg est wildfire in colorado history

662 homes 83 of the homes within the fire perimeter survived the hayman fire relatively unscathed20 since 35 of the hayman fire was high severity burn and nother 16 was mode rateseverity burn21 it seems likely that at least some of these homes the numbe r and portion are not documented survived despite crown fire around them thus it seems reasonable to conclude that the nature of the structure rather the nature of the fire primarily determines whether structure survives wildfire responsibility for pr otecting structures owners are responsible for their structures insurance companies and the relevant state agencies that regulate insurance can contribute to structural prot ection by requiring certain materials and actions to obtain policy for compensation following wildfire losses or by adjusting premiums based on homeowner actions local governmental agencies also play role since the building and zoning codes that could implement some of the safe structure requirements are generally developed and enforced locally22 alternatively states can play role as of january 1 2008 the california building standards commission23 is enforcing wildlandurban interface building standards in very high hazard zones the structure owners are also primarily responsible for the defensible space surrounding their structures 10me terwide clearing around 3000 squarefoot structure encompasses less than third of an acre almost certainly private land owned in conjunction with the structure even 40meter clearing encompasses less than 2 acres and thus is commonly part of the structure owners property in the wildlandurban interface when structural fire starts the local fire department is responsible for controlling the blaze state agencies may provide support for local fire departments especially in the wildlandurban interface where structural fire could cause wildland fire occasionally because of the location of firefighting resources the federal agencies may be the first responders on structural fire in the interface but federal firefighters are genera lly not trained for safety in structural firefighting the federal government has re sponsibility for structural fire control in the

is clear federal responsibility in protecting structures from wildfires however the federal government often pr ovides disaster assistance in the wake of catastrophic wildfire generally at the request of governor federal di saster assistance is expensive and could be avoided if action to protect homes were taken in advance several federal agencies cu rrently support firewise pr ogram aimed at educating homeowners about how to make thei r structures safe from wildfire25 assistance to homeowners such as technical assistance lowcost loans and costsharing on projects might be costsaving federal i nvestment federal assistance to prepare local firefighters is anot her means for addressing hom protection from wildfires26 research on wildlandurban interface fire protection can also reduce losses27 another possibility might be federal wildfire insurance comparable to the national flood insurance program28 those living in an identified wildfireprone zone would be required to purchase federal wildfire insurance probably with an annual premium to receive compensation for wildfire damages the premiums could vary by eco region depending on the likelihood and risk of wildfires and by aspects of the structure and landscaping which mig ht require periodic inspections protecting wildlands and natural resources wildlands and natural resources can also be damaged by wildfires wildfire damages vary widely depending on the na ture of the ecosystems burned as well as sitespecific conditions activities to modify wildland biomass fuels can reduce damages although the cost and effectivene ss also vary finally for fuel reduction activities on federal lands delays and modifications related to endangered species concerns and public involvement in decisi onmaking can affect the

27 ppwildland ecosystems and wildfire ecosystem fire regimes can be classified in several ways one common approach is to distinguish among surface fire ecosystems standreplacement fire ecosystems and mixed fire ecosystems29 damages to lands and re sources depend on the nature of those ecosystems surfacefire ecosystems surfacefire ecosystems are ecosystems where fires burned relatively frequently typically 5 to 35year intervals with the fires consuming leaves or needles grasses tw igs and small branches and sometimes small trees but generally leaving moderate and large trees unharmed by the fire the classic surfacefire ecosystem is the western ponderosa pine where seedlings occasionally survive the surface fire to become the scattered stately pines in fields of grass or low brush the other archetypical surface fire ecosystem is the southern yellow pines shortleaf slash loblolly nd especially longleaf pine surfacefire ecosystems account for about 34 of all us wildlands30 over the past century surfacefire ecosystems in the west have been affected by grazing logging and fire protection heavy grazing reduced grass cover which commonly carried the surface fires logging in many areas emphasized the large pines often leaving the true firs and d ouglasfir which are more susceptible to drought insect damage and crown fires to replace the pines at least in the northern rockies and pacific northwest fire protection has similarly led to more firs and douglasfirs and small pondero sa pines than would typi cally have survived with fire return intervals of 535 years ie fi res typically burning once in that period many surfacefire ecosystems have missed two or more bur ning cycles thus many forests now have an unnaturally large accu mulation of small bur nable materials and of trees susceptible to crown fires many are concerned that the unna tural fuel accumulations and the fuel ladders continuous fuels from the ground to the tr ee crowns from many small and medium sized pines firs and douglasfirs are causing crown fires in ecosystems where such fires were rare this could cause significant ecological damage to plants and animals illadapted to crown fires it is unclear whether new surfacefire ecosystem will develop in the wake of an intense crown fire research on fuel reduction treatments d iscussed below ve documented the effectiveness of such tr eatments on ponderosa pine surfacefire ecosystem31 and activities that reduce fuel accumulations have been shown to reduce wildfire severityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34517crs8 32 philip n omi and erik j martinson

1829in surfacefire ecosystems32 presumably less severe wildfires cause less damage to timber to watersheds and to wildlife and wildlife habitats standreplacementfirecrownfire ecosystems standreplacement fire ecosystems are ecosystems where crown fires are normal natural periodic events to which the ecosystem has adapted the interval for the standreplacement fires varies widely from few years prairie grasses to more than 1000 years coastal douglasfir depending on the ecosystem some ecosystems require periodic crown fires to regenerate the ecosystem fo r example lodgepole pine in much of the west and jack pine in the lake states have serotinous cones which only open and release their seeds after exposure to temperatures exceeding 250 fahrenheit similarly chaparral in southern california and the desert southwest most perennial grasses and aspen everywhere regenera from rootstocks burning the surface vegetation allows new plants to sprout from the underground stems rhizomes and root crowns standreplacem entfire ecosystems account for about 42 of all us wildlands33 it seems unlikely that standreplacementfire ecosystems could suffer significant ecological damage from severe wildfires in contrast to surfacefire ecosystems where crown fires could alter the ecosystem in standreplacementfire ecosystems the exclusion of crown fires if it were possibl would likely alter the ecosystems this ecological change is implied by evidence from grass ecosystems prairies and meadows where fire suppression is feas ible and which are being encroached upon by trees that would normally have been eliminated by the frequent fires activities that reduce fuel levels in st andreplacementfire ecosystems have documented effect on wildfire severity anecdotal reports have asserted that crown fires were halted became surface fires when they arrived at treated areas but research has not documented where and wh such occurrences have happened to date research has shown that fuel tr eatments consistently reduce the extent or severity of wildfires in standreplacement fire ecosystems the ineffectiveness of fuel reduction was par ticularly noted for southern ca lifornia chaparral large fires were not dependent on old age classes of fuels and it is thus unlikely that age class manipulation of fuels can prevent large fires34 mixedfireintensity ecosystems many wildlands have ecosystems that burn in crown fires of rela tively limited scale substantially mixed with surface fires these ecosystems are called mixedfireintensity ecosystems classic example is whitebark pine species generally limited to high elevation sites near timberline whitebark pine is slowgrowing species that invades harsh s ites and moderates the microclimatic conditions to allow true firs and

be mixedfireintensity types under certain conditions typically near the transition to another area with different dominant tree species ponderosa pine for example may be mixedfire intensity type on relatively moist sites especially where it mixes naturally with douglasfir such as on northfacing slopes in the northern rockies lodgepole pine may be mixedfireintensity type on relatively dry sites where the trees naturally grow farther apart such as on the eastern slopes of the sierra nevada mountains less is known about wildfire in mixedfi reintensity ecosystems even though they occupy about 24 of us wildlands36 it is unclear whether fuel loads have accumulated to unnatural leve ls whether crown fires could cause significant ecological damage or whether fuel reduction activities would alter wildfire extent or severity in these ecosystems wildfire effects the effects of wildfires on natural resources are difficult to assess and are commonly oversta ted for two reasons first burned areas look bad blackened trees and ground cover even fo llowing surface fires however many plants recover from being burned conifers generally survive even with as much as 60 of their crowns scorched37 other plants especially grasses aspen and some brush species resprout vigorously af ter being burned furthermore animals regardless of their size and mobility are only rarely killed by wildfire38 the other reason that wildfire effects are commonly overstated is that reported burned area includes all the acres within the fire perimeter however even severe crown fires are patchy leaving some areas lightly burned or unburned for example in the yellowstone fires that were on the nightly news for weeks in the summer of 1988 30 of the reported burned area wa s actually unburned and another 1520 had only surface fire39 in the 2002 hayman fire the worst wildfire in colorado history 35 of the area had high seve rity burn and 16 had moderate severity burn 34 had low sever ity burn and 15 was unburned40 thus severely burned acreage is substantially less than the burned area that is reportedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34517crs10 41 nelson burning issue pp 3738 42 the federal

be salvaged for lumber and other wood products however harvesting and processing costs are typically higher in burned areas and many object to postfire salvage harvesting because of its possi ble additional impacts on soils and other resource values wildfires especially cr own fires can also have significant local economic effects directly on tourism and indirectly through effects on timber supply water quality and aesth etics on the other hand federal wildfire suppression efforts include substantial expenditures many of which are made locally and fire fighting jobs are considered fina ncially desirable in many areas41 protecting wildlands and resources the federal government is generally responsible for pr otecting federal lands and their natural resources from wildfire42 wildfire protection of other wildlands and natural resources state local governme nt and private lands is the responsibility of the states although the individual landow ners are responsible for excessive fuel accumulations and other hazardous conditions on their own lands as noted above the fs has technical and financial assistance program for state fire agencies the principal goal for land and resour ce protection is to reduce the damages caused by wildfires this can best be achieved by reducing bur nable biomass live and dead to reduce wildfire intensity and duration and especially by eliminating the fuel ladders relatively continuous biomass fro m the surface to tree crowns that facilitate wildfire tr ansition from surface fire to crown fire43 fuel treatments can also reduce the crown bulk density the biomass especially fine fuels in the tree crowns making it more difficult for crow n fire to sustain itself thus making wildfire more controllable44 reducing burnable biomass however does not eliminate wildfires because fuel reduction doe s not directly alter the dryness of the biomass or the probability of an ignitionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34517crs11 45 for more information see david m smith bruce c larson matthew j kelty and p mark s ashton the practice of silviculture applied forest ecology 9th ed new york ny john wiley sons 1997the two principal mechanisms for reducing fuels are prescribed burning and mechanical treatments although the two tool s can also be combined each tool has benefits costs and risks or limitations to its use prescribed burning prescribed burning is intentionally setting fires in specified areas when fuel and weather conditions are within prescribed limits eg fuel moisture content relative humidity wind speed some observers include in their definition of prescribed burning natu rally occurring fires that are allowed to burn because they are within acceptable ar eas and conditions as identified in fire management plans the agencies term such fires wildland fire use and do not identify them as prescribed fires but do include the acres burned in wildlandfireuse fires as acres treated for fuel reduction prescribed burning is used for reducing biomass fuels because it is the only means available for eliminating fine fuels grasses needles leaves forbs and twigs and shrubs less than quarterinch in diamet er pencilsized burning converts the vegetation to smoke carbon dioxide wate r vapor fine partic ulates and other pollutants and ashes mineralized forms of the organic matter readily available for absorption by new plant growth reducing fine fuels is critical in wildfire protection and control because fine fuels are necessary to carry wildfires without fine fuels wildfires cannot spread prescribed burning has various limitations as well smoke can be problem contributing to human health problems especially in areas where inversions are common or with relatively stagnant airsheds also prescribed burning is risky it is not controlled burning there is such thing as controlled burning because there is switch to turn the fire off prescribed fire is also an indiscriminate tool for reducing tree density crown nsity

it can be used to eliminate fuel ladders and reduce crown density depending on the approach and tion of trees removed thinning approaches include low thinning or thinning fro m below to remove the smallest and poorest specimens which liminates fuel ladders and can reduce crown density crown thinning or thinni ng from above to open the canopy to stimulate growth on the remaining trees which substantially reduces crown density selection thinning to remove the least desirable trees for the future stand which reduces crow n density and can eliminate fuel ladders and mechanical thinning to

primary benefit of mechanical fuel treatment is the high degree of control ove r the results one report stated46 mechanical thinning has the ability to more precisely create targeted stand structure than does prescribed fire used alone mechanical thinning especially emphasizing the smaller trees and shrubs can be effective in reducing the vertical fuel continuity that foster s initiation of crown fires in addition thinning of small material and pruning branches are more precise methods than prescribed fire for targeting ladder fuels and specific fuel components the authors also observed some of the limitations of mechanical fuel treatment47 however by itself mechanical thinning does little to beneficially affect surface fuels with the exception of possibly co mpacting crushing or masticating it during the thinning process depending on how it is accomplished mechanical thinning may add to surface fuels and incr ease surface fire intensity unless the fine fuels that result from the thinning are removed from the stand or otherwise treated thinning and prescribed fires can m odify understory microclimate that was previously buffered by overstory vege tation thinned stands open tree canopies allow solar radiation to pene trate to the forest floor which then increases surface temperatures decreases fire fuel moisture and decreases relative humidity compared to unthinned stands conditions that can increase surface fire intensity an increa in surface fire intensity may increase the likelihood that overstory tree crowns ignite other sources have similarly reported the limitations of thinning48 depending on the forest type and its st ructure thinning has both positive and negative impacts on crown fire potential crown bulk density surface fuel and crown base height fuel ladders are prim ary stand characteristics that determine crown fire potential thinning from below free thinning and reserve tree shelterwoods have the greatest opportunity for reducing the risk of crown fire behavior selection thinni ng and crown thinning that maintain multiple crown layers will not reduce the risk of crown fires except in the driest ponderosa pine forests moreover unless the surface fuels created by using these treatments are themselves treated inte nse surface wildfire may result likely negating positive effects of reducing crown fire potential single thinning approach can be applied to reduce the ri sk of wildfires in the multiple forest types of the west thus thinning and pruning have the poten tial to reduce the risk of crown fire but may increase

operations commercial thi nning stewardship contracting and salvage logging have been suggested as means to moderate the high cost of mechanical fuel treatment however commercial timber sales on federal lands commonly cost more to prepare and administer than they return to the treasury50 the results of commercial operations fo r fuel reduction are also questionable51 the proposal that commercial logging can reduce the incidence of canopy fires was untested in the scientific literature commercial logging focuses on large diameter trees and does not address crow n base height the branches seedlings and saplings which contribute so signific antly to the ladder effect in wildfire behavior emphasis in original others have also noted the likely net cost of thinning to reduce the risk of crown fires52 although large trees can be removed for valuable products the market value for the smaller logs may be less than the rvest and hauling charges resulting in net cost for thinning operations however the failure to remove these small logs results in the retention of ladder fuels that support crown fire s with destructive impacts to the forest landscape co stbenefit analysis broadened to include market and nonmarket considerations indicates that the negative impacts of crown fires are underestimated and that th benefits of government investments in fuel reductions are substantial combined operations the ability to control the resulting stand structure with mechanical treatments and the ability to remove fine fuels with prescribed burning make combining the two treatments seem logical choice however empirical evidence to document the effectiveness of such combined operations is limited53 more limited number of studies addressed the effectiveness of

prevent some proposed actions however others caution that expedited review or limits on consultation and on public overs ight of proposed fuel treatments may allow treatments to include commercial timber harvests or other actions that provide little wildfire protection nd exacerbate fuel accumulations in the short run while causing other environmental damages this raises the question of the effect of delays on wildfire threats clearly structures in the wildlandurban interface are threatened by wildfire but as shown above fuel treatment provide s little if any fire protec tion for structures and thus delaying fuel treatments s little consequence for stru cture protection resources in surfacefire ecosystems with unnatural fu accumulations are at risk from severe wildfires the odds of having treated the right acres to prevent crown fire with significant resource damages are however quite low over the past four years during which more area burned annually than in any other year since 1960 wildfires have burned an average of 90 million acres annually total wild lands in the united states are 147 billion acres 6533 million acres of federal land59 and 8121 million acres of private forest and rangeland60 thus the likelihood of any particular acre burning in any given year on averag is less than 066 ie burning once every 150 years obviously the risk for certain areas in particular years can be much higher 54 of idahos wildla nds burned in 2007 for example but this is offset by much lower risk s for those areas in other years and for other areas in the same year 02 of idahos wildla nds burned in 2002 while 004 of colorado wildlands burned in 2007 in contrast to 18 in 2002 when the hayman fire burned61 wildfire risk is probably somewhat higher in western states than the national average because the ecosystems in the lake states midatlantic region and new england experience less fire however even if the risk were 50 greater than the national average which seems unlikely because the larger area in the west already contributes to higher national average the risk would still be less than 1 per year in addition to the low probability of particular acre burning is the modest likelihood of an area being treated the forest service and blm have treated 27httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34517crs18 62 see crs report rl33990 wildfire funding table 7 page crs12 by ross w

are spread more broadly to class 1 surface fire ecosystem lands or to lands in other fire regimes the probability of treating particular acre to prevent crown fire diminishes further nonetheless lengthy delays can exacer bate the risks annual probabilities of wildfire burning an area and of an area being treated are both cumulative over 10year period the likelihood of an area burning is more than 6 while the likelihood of moderate or highrisk surf acefire ecosystem being treated rises to 15 if half of all treatments are concentrat ed on these lands thus relatively brief delays may have relatively little impact of the likelihood of an area being burned in an unnatural crown fire but longer delays decade or more could have significant impact consultations63 the established process for federal agencies to consult with the fish and wildlife service fws or with the national marine fisheries service nmfs for some species on any actions that might jeopardize listed endangered or threatened species or adversely modify its critical habitat this is not problem for firefighting as immediate informal consultations can occur during an emergency with formal consu ltation to follow after the emergency has passed however some fuel treatments might jeopardize species or adversely modify its habitat which would require consultation consultation means the fws or nmfs would review the proposed action and if jeopardy or adverse habitat impacts are likely propose reasona ble and prudent alternative to achieve the same purpose without jeopardy or dverse habitat modification the vast majority of agency activities have finding of jeopardy and most with jeopardy have reasonable and prudent alternative actions with jeopardy and alternative findings are exceedingly rare fuel treatments that reduce the likeli hood of crown fires in ecosystems where such fires were historically rare are ge nerally unlikely to je opardize or adversely modify the critical habitat of endangered species many species in north america are adapted to survive and even thrive with natural wildfires one study reported that more than 90 of rare threatened and endangered plants in the 48 coterminous states either benefit from fire or are found in fireadapted ecosystems64 also as noted above animal mortality in wildfires is rare thus treatments that only restore forests to conditions that allow an historically natural ecological role for wildfire are more likely to benefit endangered and threatened species than to harm themhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34517crs19 65 for more

supplementa l public involvement considerations in expediting decisions public acceptance of options to accelerate fuel treatments depends on variety of factors in general earlier discourse among interests about the risks and needed treatments lead to greater comfort with the resulting decisions on study found that survey respondents were willing to accept limitations on the rights to appeal and litigate agency decisions but wanted to be more informed and involved in those decisions84 greater specificity in approved treatments also is likely to result in greater acceptance for example treatment prescription that specifies thi nning from below to approximately 20foot spacing of remaining trees and emphasizing retention of ponderosa pine is likely to be more acceptable than mechanical treatment to reduce stand density finally authors have identified the need for collective action to minimize conflict over decisions and three broad social factors to achieve collective action developing collaborative capacity framing problems in mutuallyunderstood rms and creating mutual trust among groups85 these are factors that take time and cannot be legislated directly although congress can fo ster or negate their development by the ways in which it authorizes agency action to promote wildfire protectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34517crs25 conclusions as more acres and more homes have bur ned in the past few years and more people at risk from wildfires congress has faced increasing pressures to protect structures and resources c ongress decides what programs to authorize and fund and many options exist to protect homes congress could creat new programs and expand existing ones for installing nonflammable roofing removing burnable materials adjacent to structures and creating defensible sp ace of at least 30 feet around the building programs could inform homeowners or assist or require landowner action the programs could be federal or implemented through st ate or local governments protecting resources poses different challenges for congress because ecological damages vary widely depending on the eco system and on sitespecific conditions fuel reduction can probably moderate crown fire damages in surfacefire ecosystems and possibly in mixedintensityfire ecosystems existing programs for federal lands authorize prescribed burni ng intentional fires under prescribed conditions and mechanical treatments cutting and removing some trees the principal means of reducing fuel levels however prescribed fires are risky and mechanical treatments can cause other ecological damages and both are expensive proponents of more fuel treatment advocate acceler ated processes for envir onmental analysis and public review to reduce costs and expedite action others caution that inadequate analysis and review can allow projects with unint ended damages and fe w fire protection benefits congress can alter the existing environmental and public review processes recognizing the tradeoffs between expe ditious action and insufficient review however the fact is that crown fires ccur they cannot be halted and the damages they cause cannot be totally preventedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34517crs26 appendix excerpts from forest service handbook on nepa categorical exclusions related to structural or resource protection from wildfires the following
