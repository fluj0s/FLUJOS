number of hhas participating in medicare also increased sharply growing from 5686 agencies in 1989 to 10492 in 1997 this drama tic growth resulted in similarly dramatic increases in medicare spending for home health home health spending rose from 19 billion in 1987 to about 175 billion in 1997 an average annual increase of almost 27 table 1 this growth led to the imposition of new cost limits on hhas in the balanced budget act of 1997 bba that attempted to control growth in number of visits paid by the program until prospective payment system could be implemented the interim payment system the growth also led to scrutiny by the department of health and human services hhs office of the insp ector general and th general accounting office gao regarding fraudulent practices by some home

be the same as under the previous costreimbursement system but the cost of the old system would be calculated as though the co st limits under the interim payment system were reduced by 15 delayed until oct 1 2002 two years after the start of pps the reduction in actual payments amounted to approximately 7 b ecause hhas are paid th lesser of their actual costs or their costs subject to the limits reduced 15 and when coupled with the update in payments that also occurred oct 1 2002 hha payments were actually reduced by approximately 49 see crs report rl31420 medicares home health benefit the fifteen percent payment cut by carolyn l merckafter the bba medicare payments to hhas decreased sharply falling 37 in the first full year the interim payment system was in place and an additional 24 in the second year the number of beneficiaries serv ed decreased about 10 year for the three years after bba passed this decrease wa s due to the stepped up program integrity activities directed at hhas and change in qualifying service by bba5 the average number of visits per beneficiary served also decreased dramatically falling almost 30 in the first full year after bba due to the application of new payment limits after implementation of the home health prospective payment system hhpps in october 1 2000 payments increased by 83 in 2001 and by 95 in 2002 payments fell slightly in 2003 due to the imp act of the socalled 15 reduction6 the number of visits and to lesser degree the number of beneficiaries served continued to decline immediately after the implementation of pps in 2001 the average number of visits per person dropped to 28 and the num ber of beneficiaries served per thousand dropped to 71 however in 2002 the number of beneficiaries served increased and in both 2002 and 2003 the number of visits increased home health prospective payment system begun october 1 2000 hhpps groups patient s according to the type and intensity of services the patients require and sets payment rate for each payment group the basic unit of payment is for 60day episode of care and is adjusted for the wages of the area in which the beneficiary resides payment for the 60day episode covers skilled nursing and therapy visits aide visits and medical s upplies needed by the beneficiary physician services durable medical equipment and osteoporosis drugs are not included in the hhpps the 60day episode base payment called the national standardized 60day episode rate is based on actua l audited average fy1997 per visit home health costs that have been trended forward for inflation th ere is distinction be tween urban and rural base payment amounts the payment amount is then adjusted for th care needs of the beneficiaries by using hhrgs each of these represent specific amounts of nursing and therapy care care information is obtained through the initial assessment of the patients care needs using the outcome and assessment information set oasis like other ppss that pay health care providers for care to medicare beneficiaries on the basis of predetermined fixed amounts medicare payments to hhas are intended to pay the hha for its medicare beneficiaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21814crs5 7 the benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 bipa provided temporary twoyear 10 increase in payments for services furnished in rural areas that expired mar 31 2003costs on average that is although the pa yment is predetermined rate an agencys actual costs may be above or below that amount for an indi vidual patient agencies have an incentive to manage costs so that on average costs do not exceed the pps average amounts hhas that provide services at wer costs than the medicare payment are able to keep the difference hhas are paid 60 of the wageand case mixadjusted payment after submitting request for anticipated payment rap the rap may be submitted at the beginning of beneficiarys care once the hha has receive d verbal orders from the beneficiarys physician and the assessment is completed the remaining payment is made when the beneficiarys care is completed or the 60day episode ends depending upon the circumstances additional adjustments may be made to the payment outliers outlier payments are made for extraordinarily costly episodes whose estimated costs exceed thre shold amount for each hhrg five percent of total home health payments are set aside for outlier payments significant change in beneficiarys condition an hhas payments can be modified within patients 60day episode when significant change in beneficiarys condition occurs payment will be an amount that is proportional betw een the hhrg prior to the change and the hhrg after the significant change in condition partial episode payment if beneficiary transfers from one hha to another during 60day episode the first hha to provide care will have its payment reduced to portion equa l to the amount of time during the 60day episode in which care wa s provided the second hha will conduct an assessment and new 60day episode of care will begin low utilization payment adjustment the pps payment for an agency is adjusted if beneficiarys care is delivered in four or fewer visits the payment is standardized servi cespecific pervisit amount multiplied by the number of visits actua lly provided during the episode current issues mma mma contained

of hom health agencies paid under the medicare home health prospective payment system using cost reports filed by agencies and examine whether systematic differences in payment margins are related to differences in patient care needs as measured by hom health resource groups among agencies payment adequacy after three years experience of hhpps analysis is ongoing to assess the adequacy of medicare payments both the gao and medpac have analyzed available data on hha costs nd medicare payments recently gao studied payments to freestanding hhas for the fi rst two years of hhpps and concluded that medicare payments more than covered aggregate costs of caring for their medicare home health patients8 gao found that aggregate dicare margins for freestanding facilities were 162 in 2001 nd 178 in 2002 furthermor medpac has estimated that aggregate pps margins for all hhas we re 161 in 2001 and projected margins of 168 for 2004 quality of care efforts have been underway si nce the late 1980s to

hhas can be obtained on wwwmedicaregov or through the 1800medi care phone line in addition to providing the data to consumers cms has offered hhas assistance in improving the quality of care they
